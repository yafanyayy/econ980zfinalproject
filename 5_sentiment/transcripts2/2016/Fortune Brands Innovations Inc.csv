Our team delivered strong results at the high end of our guidance for the fourth quarter and full year 2015. We achieved strong sales growth as the home products market accelerated in the back half of the year as we had expected. 
Our teams also delivered strong profit growth, driven by efficiency gains in our recently expanded capacity and our continued focus on profitable growth in all channels. 
Our strong 2015 results again illustrate that our substantial and leading share positions in each of our categories generate outside sales and earnings growth when our underlying markets are positive. Our leading positions and the momentum we have built position us well for continued strong performance heading into 2016 and beyond. 
Let me first take you through some of the fourth quarter highlights and my thoughts on our full year performance in 2015, then I will discuss our view of the U.S. home products market and our 2016 outlook for top line growth. 
So let me start with my perspective on our business performance. For the fourth quarter, sales increased 18% in total and 22% for the U.S. businesses. Importantly, total company operating margin increased to 200 basis points to 12%, with solid performance across all operating segments. 
Starting with our Cabinet segment. We continue to follow a disciplined strategy for cabinets focused on profitable growth, and that strategy is working well. We are focused on the most attractive segments in the market, where we have our strongest structural competitive advantages and the greatest profit potential. Our consistent base of product innovation and our high levels of reliable service to our channel partners is driving growth. 
For the fourth quarter, our overall cabinet sales were up 33% over the prior-year quarter, with broad growth across all channels. Sales in the U.S. increased 38%, including Norcraft acquisition. U.S. sales for dealer and in-stock cabinets and vanities, which account for more than 70% of our annual sales, increased 42%, up 12%, excluding Norcraft acquisition. 
Specifically, sales in our largest channel, dealers, grew 57% and benefited from the Norcraft acquisition. Our share gains in the ski channel are coming from deeper relationships with existing customers as well as ramping up recently added dealerships. 
Our home center in-stock cabinets and vanities sales increased strong double digits due largely to strong sell-through of new programs and product upgrades that launched earlier in the year. 
The remaining 25% of our cabinets business focuses on home center semi-custom, builder direct in select markets and our Canadian sales. 
We are disciplined in our approach to these segments of the cabinet market as we focus on where we can partner with our customers to capture profitable growth. With our focused approach, combined sales for these segments increased strong double digits in the quarter, excluding the impact of currency. 
Overall for cabinets, our teams continue to execute well across multiple facets of a complex category. Our plans are increasingly more efficient, and we're pleased that we added capacity when we did to handle the growth that is now being realized. 
On the front end of the business, we are performing particularly well as we built share in the most attractive segments of the market. The impact of our consistent execution can be seen in our share gains, our stronger mix and our improving margins. 
For our plumbing segment, sales were up 7% in the quarter and increased 10%, excluding the negative impact of currency. Growth was led by U.S. wholesale and retail as well as China. 
Again, in the fourth quarter, our mix was solid, and margins were strong. Both wholesale and retail sales increased high single digits, driven by new product performance and strong POS. We're encouraged to see consumers trade up and continue to select our innovative new faucet and shower products for their new homes and repair and remodel projects, including new pull-down faucets, which reflects self-retraction in our Kinzel and Glenshire lines, and our magnetic easy-docking, easy-releasing showerheads. 
And we will continue our pace of innovation in the coming quarters as we introduce new products, which include additional pull-down and pull-up faucets with our new power clean technology that provides 50% more spray nozzle power and additional styles with our most SentrySafe hands-free technology. 
Sales in Canada were down high single digits to the prior year but were up high single digits in local currency as we gained share. 
China sales increased low double digits versus the prior year, driven primarily by our retail stores in e-commerce. We remain optimistic about both our long-term business model in China and the growth potential and are encouraged by the R&R activity that we are seeing despite general economic concerns. 
Doors reported sales were up 5% for the quarter but increased 7% when you exclude the final quarterly the impact of exiting some lower-margin business in 2015. 
Door product sales growth driven by gains in new construction and retail. Mix continued to improve with, with consumers more frequently choosing our decorative last designs and premium upgrades like our recently launched Classic-Craft doors in the American style and Rustic Collections that capitalize on the growing trend toward taller doors and wider openings. The protuberant continues to perform strongly across all channels, and we're benefiting from our expanded distribution. 
In the Security segment, sales increased 3% from the prior year quarter and were up 6%, excluding the negative impact of currency. High single-digit increases in Master Lock U.S. retail and new program wins for SentrySafe drove the growth. We are excited about the opportunities we see between our Master Lock and Sentry businesses over the next few years. And the integration of Sentry into Master Lock is on track. 
So to recap the quarter, we executed well in our U.S. home products market that is improving as we expected. Results were strong and on plan. Our teams are executing well on delivering profitable growth. 
Before I turn to our outlook for 2016, let me spend some time on our overall full year 2015 performance. 
The U.S. home products market saw steady growth in repair and remodel activity of around 5% throughout 2015, with growth for new construction accelerating to low double digits in the back half of the year. This was right in line with our initial planning assumption. 
As a result of this market performance and our execution, we delivered sales growth across the businesses that was on plan for 2015, with sales increasing 14% despite the negative impact of currency. 
The sales growth was significant, with sales for our U.S. home products businesses increasing 20%. 
We also delivered operating margin and improved 110 basis points to 11.8% and EPS growth of 19%. Profit improvement was broad across the businesses. We completed our key capacity additions in cabinets and generated significantly better manufacturing efficiency in the back half of the year. We also added capacity in our door segment and began some modest capacity additions in our plumbing assembly operations. 
During the year, we also took a number of steps to position ourselves for the growth opportunities that we expect over the coming years. First, in May, we purchased Norcraft Coventry, which is helping us build on our structural competitive advantages with their proven capabilities and positions us even more strongly for growth in share gains in a critical dealer channel. Norcraft has great relationships in the dealer channel and strong operating management throughout their business. The integration is very straightforward and remains right on track. 
Second, in June, we took advantage of the opportunity to secure long-term financing by issuing $900 million in corporate bonds. This provides us significant financial flexibility to drive incremental growth. 
Last, in July, we began integrating the SentrySafe operations into our existing Master Lock platform. As I mentioned, we're excited about the opportunities we see between these 2 businesses, and the teams are working hard to integrate the operations by the middle of 2016. 
Moving forward, we continue to focus on creating meaningful incremental shareholder value by using our strong cash flow and balance sheet to make strategic acquisitions, repurchase our shares and increase our dividend. Our acquisition pipeline is robust, and I'm encouraged by the number of things we're looking at and the potential we have to create incremental shareholder value over time. 
Over the next 3 years, we believe we have the potential to deploy more than $2 billion to drive this incremental value. 
So in 2015, we delivered solid sales and profit growth, driven by reasonable market growth and our strong execution. Importantly, as we enter 2016, our current assessment of the near- and medium-term market, based on the demand indicators that we monitored, point to overall market growth rates similar to 2015, and we see no challenges to our stronger execution. Therefore, we are well positioned to deliver a similar growth in 2016. 
Now let me turn to our full year outlook for 2016, starting with our view of the U.S. home products market. Our 2016 annual outlook is built on an assumption that U.S. home products market, which impacts over 70% of our sales, grows at a 6% to 7% rate, which is similar to full year 2015 market growth. 
[indiscernible] assumption, the pace of repair and remodel demand is soon to grow at a continued 5% range. Consumers continue to demonstrate an appetite for stronger styling, product differentiation and project complexity, [indiscernible] to these trends and the improving mix across our categories. 
Construction is assumed to grow at around 10% in 2016, a rate similar to full year 2015 growth. Single-family growth is now expected to grow faster than multi-family as single-family entry-level activity is beginning to accelerate. 
Therefore, our total market, which includes assumptions for U.S. market as well as our other international and security markets, is expected to grow at a combined 5% to 6% in 2016. 
[indiscernible] total market assumption, continued share gains post the Norcraft acquisition, we expect solid top line growth for 2016, with our full year sales increasing 10% to 12% over 2015 and our home products businesses again outperforming the market for our products. 
With this market sales growth, our teams are focused on delivering full year EPS in the range of $2.42 to $2.52. 
So overall, our 2016 outlook is based on reasonable market growth assumptions based on the basket of market indicators that we monitor. 
We continue to see steady mix improvement. Our capacity is increasingly more efficient, and we feel good about the winning momentum that our teams are carrying into the year. 
To sum up, we delivered strong sales and profit growth in 2015, and we are well positioned to deliver similar growth in 2016. We remain confident in our ability to continue to outperform the home products market, and our businesses are even stronger. Our strong brands, management teams and capital structure provide flexibility to both focus on profitable organic growth and drive incremental shareholder value with our balance sheet and strong free cash flow. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Lee who will review our financial performance and provide detail on our guidance."

As Brian mentioned, to best reflect ongoing business performance, the majority of my comments will focus on income before charges and gains from continuing operations. Let me start with our fourth quarter results, whic",1066,"Thanks, Chris, and good afternoon. As Brian mentioned, to best reflect ongoing business performance, the majority of my comments will focus on income before charges and gains from continuing operations. 
Let me start with our fourth quarter results, which were on plan. Sales were $1.22 billion, up 18% from a year ago. As Chris mentioned, sales increased 22% for our U.S. businesses. 
Consolidated operating income for the quarter was $147 million, up 42% or $43 million compared to the same quarter last year. Consolidated operating margin improved to 12% [ph]. 
EPS were $0.56 for the quarter versus $0.44 the same quarter last year, increasing 27% and were at the high end of our guidance range. 
Now let me provide more color on segment results. Our Cabinet sales were $608 million, up $152 million or 33% versus the prior-year quarter. Norcraft added $107 million of the sales growth. Dealer sales were $309 million and increased 57% from the prior year. In-stock cabinets and vanities sales of $121 million increased 15%, driven by strong sell-through of new products. The remaining sales for home center, semi-custom, builder direct and Canada increased 21%, excluding the negative impact of currency of approximately $8 million. 
Operating income for the Cabinet segment increased 72% or $26 million over the prior year quarter, with Norcraft adding half of the increase. Operating margin for the quarter increased 220 basis points to 10%. For the full year, Cabinet sales increased 22% over the prior year, and operating income grew 42% to $196 million, with the operating margin increasing 130 basis points to 9%. Excluding the Norcraft acquisition and the negative impact of currency, sales increased 8%, and operating income grew 19%. 
Turning to plumbing. Sales for the fourth quarter were $359 million, up $23 million or 7%, led by U.S. retail, U.S. wholesale and China. Excluding the $9 million negative impact of currency, total plumbing sales increased 10%, Canadian sales increased 8% and China sales increased 14%. 
Operating income increased $12 million to $71 million, up 21%. Operating margin for the segment was 19.8%, up 220 basis points from the prior year quarter. The negative impact of currency was $6 million. For the full year, plumbing sales increased 6%, operating income was up 12% over the prior year and operating margin increased 120 basis points to 20.7%. 
Door sales were $115 million, up $5 million, up [ph] 5% from the prior year quarter. Sales were up 7%, excluding the impact of exiting some low-margin business. Operating income increased $6 million to $13 million, up 77%. Operating margin was 11.6% for the quarter. For the full year, door sales increased 6%, operating income grew 51% and operating margin increased 290 basis points to 10%. 
Security sales were $144 million in the fourth quarter, up 3% to the prior year. The U.S. business was up 7%. The impact of foreign currency reduced sales by $3 million in the quarter. Segment operating income increased to $19 million, up 21%, and the segment operating margin was 13%. For the full year, security sales increased 15%, operating income increased 17% from the prior year and operating margin was 12.5%. We expect significant operating margin improvement in 2017 after we complete the integration of the SentrySafe manufacturing into our Master Lock platform in 2016. 
To sum up, consolidated fourth quarter performance, sales increased 18%, and EPS were on plan at $0.56. Our total company operating margin was 12%, with an incremental margin of 44%, excluding acquisitions. For the full year 2015, sales increased 14%, and EPS grew 19% to $2.07, which was at the high end of our outlook. Total company operating margin was 11.8%, a 110 basis point improvement. We are on track to reach our long-term goal of approaching 15% operating margin when the housing market returns to steady state levels. 
Before turning to the balance sheet, let me comment on the cumulative impact of currency. The strengthening U.S. dollar reduced our total fourth quarter sales by approximately $20 million, with Canada being the primary source. EPS impact was approximately $0.02. For the full year, currency movements reduced sales by $69 million and EPS by $0.07. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Our December 31 balance sheet remains solid with cash of $239 million, debt of $1.2 billion, and our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage is 1.4x. We had nothing drawn on our $975 million revolving credit facility. 
Since the beginning of 2016, we have repurchased approximately 2.1 million shares totaling $100 million. 
Turning last to the details of our outlook for 2016. Based on our projected 6% to 7% U.S. home product market growth and our total global market growth of 5% to 6% as well as our continued share gains and additional sales from the Norcraft acquisition, we expect full year 2016 sales to increase 10% to 12% compared to 2015. Our resulting outlook for 2016 EPS are in the range of $2.42 to $2.52. The midpoint of our EPS outlook reflects an increase of 19%, similar growth to 2015, with the first quarter EPS growth rate similar to what we expect for the full year 2016. 
The annual EPS outlook includes the following assumptions: interest expense of around $45 million; a tax rate of 33%; average fully diluted shares of approximately 163 million; a positive impact from commodity cost that will partially offset a negative impact from currency in the first half of 2016; and a double-digit increase in health care costs. 
We expect 2016 free cash flow to be $350 million to $375 million, with conversion rate of over 90%. 
In summary, the fourth quarter and full year EPS were on plan, with market growth as expected. The solid performance of our business for the year, the recent investments made to increase capacity and the expected continued market recovery give us confidence in continued solid growth in the coming years. Importantly, the 110 basis point operating margin increase in 2015 and expected 100 basis point increase at the midpoint of our 2016 outlook place us right on track for achieving our 3-year operating margin targets. 
Also, as demonstrated by the Norcraft acquisition, share repurchases and the dividend rate increase, we remain focused on using our balance sheet and cash flow to drive incremental shareholder value. Additionally, our new debt structure provides significant flexibility to continue to drive incremental shareholder value. 
I will now pass the call back to Brian."

We really look at a lot of different factors to drive our outlook, and [indiscernible] actually break it down a bit. On the supply side, we are looking at a lot of fundamentals, land sales, land development, permits, starts, homes under construction, supply of inventory, labor availability. And then you kind of look at supply versus demand, the fundamentals around household information, affordability, home prices, interest rates, levels of consumer debt. And then we look at builder reported new home sale order rates and new and existing home sales and purchase finance applications and then kind of look at the macro level stuff around consumer confidence, employment rates. So we take all of that plus more and actually try to drive toward what we think are the fundamentals around the outlook for new construction, existing housing turnover, R&R. Then we compare it to the stuff that we're actually seeing from our customers and discussions that we're having. So keep in mind, we've got -- we're a leader in our category, so we've got a pretty broad network of customers we're getting input from. But we're losing the builders, home centers, probably home sellers, 5,200 kitchen and bath dealers. We're looking at order patterns. We're looking at prior quarter patterns. We're looking at current quarter patterns. We'll roll that all together. And then we compare it to what consistent with the market whether they're saying. So I'd say we've got a lot more proprietary. Last year, we came out, and I'd say, almost hit it dead on with where we wound up. So our estimate of how these starts overall between single-family and multifamily was 1,119,000 [ph], and I guess, the year wound up at 1,107,000. Consensus was at 1.2 million. So we're off by 11,000, and the market was off by 100,000. So I'm not low here. I'm just thing we've got much better looking at the drivers at very granular kind of data-driven level and then comparing it to what we're hearing and seeing a market. Cigna part of your question was around what we're seeing right now and actually years off pretty good after a pretty good start. So order patterns and then January, which is done now, are on plan. Maybe in a little bit stronger, but we're seeing actually really encouraging signs. And that matches up well so we're out of builder and kitchen 2 weeks ago, and a lot of positive commentary. And we look at the current behavior and the builders with order patterns and what we're from home centers. So I just -- I would say we've built all this over the fourth quarter, and we're foreseeing over the first 6 weeks of the year, support our outlook and where we think the year is trending and where the year will come in."

And maybe if you could just give us a flavor for how much operating leverage is in the business based on the assumptions that Chris outlined for volume growth."

So as we think about operating margin growth, it starts with our long-term strategy.

So as we think about operating margin growth, it starts with our long-term strategy. And we said at the spin that our focus was, when we get to steady-state, which is 1.4 million to 1.5 million housing starts a year, which is not peak but which we consider steady state, we'll be back to 14% to 15% operating margins, which was similar to what we had predownturn. And we think we've continued to do that each year, the growth of 110 basis points of operating margin in '15, and then at the midpoint of our guidance were another 100 basis points improvement to maybe 12.8. We are right on track, if you assume, over the next 3 years, we hit steady-state. But what's really driving that? I think it starts with the focus on disciplined sales growth that drives profit, not just driving sales growth for the sake of sales but really targeting across all of our segments that we're going to just really drive discipline profit growth. I think, secondly, what you've seen in '15 is with those lack of the reduction investments that we've had in '14 and and even early part of '15, we're getting very good leverage across our business. For the full year, our incremental margin on incremental sales was about 36%. We normally plan around 25% to 30% on an annual basis, but we're getting -- starting to see that leverage comes when you're reducing investments. And that's driving a lot of this margin expansion. I think the other thing you're seeing is the operating efficiencies are improving since we're not increasing the capacity at this point. And we watch that closely. Our product mix continues to improve across our channels and across our segments. So I think that combination, you're seeing not only for the fourth quarter but for the full year, and it's reflected in our guidance that, that discipline is going to continue to drive this operating margin growth."

So again, they're making nice progress. We put capacity in, in '14, a little bit in early '15. So now you're starting to see the leverage against that, and that should continue to get them on track for that '14 plus at kind of steady state. Moen last year, in '14, was 19.5%. This year, in 2015, they were 20.7%. We kind of think there -- our strategy there is that's a fine margin. It will go up. But the real strategy there is to drive sales above market growth sales at anywhere close to that mark -- that margin. So we're very happy with the 20-plus percent operating margin. We can retain that. But our real goal is to drive incremental value by really driving sales around that same margin rate, would be a better way to create value than just increasing that margin unit per year."

I'd say our plans for '16 midpoint guidance is first half of '16, $7 million to $8 million benefit, very similar to the second half and then kind of slowing down in the second half of '16.

We're encouraged by the credit availability, especially at the entry level. I think that there are constraints that the inventory in existing housing that's been on the market when there is demand. I think if you look at other pricing survey, the pressure that you see on existing housing prices rising is because their inventories not quite where demand is. Some I'm encouraged by the month. I'm encouraged by credibility. Also look at, from just a macro standpoint, level of spending per household on home improvements weren't even back to a 50-year average yet. We've been running below that since 2008. So we look at that and how far up are we on that curve. It's a large number universe so you're talking about the averages like 7 25 to 7 50, but you actually looking at those, really remodeling it, it's a 1,500, north of that type number. And then if you look at what the home centers activity has been, and that's kind of running in mid-single-digits, and I think their outlooks are more for mid-single-digits for the year. So there's a number of those factors that give us pretty comfortable around a 5% rate, which is really the historic average. I think there's essential upset over the next couple of years just based on the fact that we've underinvested in every with the remodel side of the market houses are getting older. We've underbuilt relative to the housing stopover 8 years. And so you're just kind of continuing to lean on the existing housing starts. So the turnover is one factor that used to be highly correlated. So back, I'm talking pre-2006, it was highly correlated to our spending that completely disconnected them out turn. It's gotten tighter but it is an kind of backing that same high level of correlation. So it's important, but it's not the only driver in R&R that we look at."

For a long time, we saw that in the mix coming through dealers as being a richer mix and when they're spending their actually spending not concerning my credit. Over the last 18, 24 months, we've seen much more activity at kind of the entry level, semi-custom level, both in home centers as well as in the dealer channel. We think there probably is some credit support to that, and that you can say it's safety locks, it's refinancing of its annual savings. As the price was are frankly lower. So they can afford more affordable projects at that kind of entry-level, semi-custom. So you're not being to really finance that much of a purchase. So I think that it's a combination of those 2, depending on the level of activity we're seeing. Anecdotally, constant dealer channel, pretty consistent growth throughout the year.

We are, as Chris mentioned in his comments, we started the integration in this end of June of '15, of SentrySafe manufacturing into Master Lock, that will take a year or so. Some sometime this summer, we should finish that. So at that point, at a minimum by the fourth quarter of '16, we should be at a much higher run rate. I'd say you could see SentrySafe going preintegration of the manufacturing from 7% operating margin to 13%, 14% operating margin for at least the last quarter of '16. And then by the time we hit '17, if they're at a 13%, 14%, Master Lock is a 14% to 15%, so you're taking that whole business up nicely from 12.5% this year to 14% to 15% by '17. But '16 is a transition year. We won the lot of benefit until probably the fourth quarter, maybe a little bit into the third. So great profit growth potential there with that integration. In terms of Doors, so Doors, nice growth in '15. Operating margin full year, 10%. Doors are much like Cabinets. We expect them to get back to that 14%, 15% operating margin at steady-state. They're making great progress there. I think if you looked at the guidance, midpoint of our guidance, you could see them approaching or exceeding 11% in '16.

You've been very good about kind of creating a decent cadence over the last 2 or 3 years in terms of these bolt-on opportunities. And when those don't present themselves, be willing to buy back some stock. I was wondering if that's the -- that type of balance, let's say, would also be applicable to 2016 where, I presume, you're still, as of the last conference call, very active on the M&A side. But if that doesn't necessarily happen, given the strong free cash flow and good balance sheet position, that you'd still be willing to repurchase some shares throughout the year. So thoughts around that, and then again, the first minor modeling on the corporate expense for the year."

If anything, we're busy now than we were a year ago. And in fact, I'd say that still is a real focus for us. On the other side, we bought back $100 million worth of our shares, $2.1 million in the month of January. I'd say at the value that we're seeing in the market right now versus our plans, we'll remain -- looking at share repurchase this year, we've still got about $148 million left under our authorization. So yes, we're going to look at both of those, and we've got plenty of capacity to both buy back shares and complete acquisitions. We ended the year at only 1.4x debt. So we've got capacity to do things. We've got debt capacity. We've got strong free cash flow. So we'll be very efficient with our cash. We have been coming up on 5 years here, and we're going to continue to do that. And then maybe some really nice opportunities looking at us over the next few months. So that's about all I can say on that. But I'd say we'll be balanced in our approach across those 2."

Our team delivered strong results at the high end of our guidance for the fourth quarter and full year 2015. We achieved strong sales growth as the home products market accelerated in the back half of the year as we had expected. 
Our teams also delivered strong profit growth, driven by efficiency gains in our recently expanded capacity and our continued focus on profitable growth in all channels. 
Our strong 2015 results again illustrate that our substantial and leading share positions in each of our categories generate outside sales and earnings growth when our underlying markets are positive. Our leading positions and the momentum we have built position us well for continued strong performance heading into 2016 and beyond.
Let me first take you through some of the fourth quarter highlights and my thoughts on our full year performance in 2015, then I will discuss our view of the U.S. home products market and our 2016 outlook for top line growth. 
So let me start with my perspective on our business performance. For the fourth quarter, sales increased 18% in total and 22% for the U.S. businesses. Importantly, total company operating margin increased to 200 basis points to 12%, with solid performance across all operating segments. 
Starting with our Cabinet segment. We continue to follow a disciplined strategy for cabinets focused on profitable growth, and that strategy is working well. We are focused on the most attractive segments in the market, where we have our strongest structural competitive advantages and the greatest profit potential. Our consistent pace of product innovation and our high levels of reliable service to our channel partners is driving growth. 
For the fourth quarter, our overall cabinet sales were up 33% over the prior year quarter, with broad growth across all channels. Sales in the U.S. increased 38%, including Norcraft acquisition. U.S. sales for dealer and in-stock cabinets and vanities, which account for more than 70% of our annual sales, increased 42%, up 12%, excluding Norcraft acquisition. 
Specifically, sales in our largest channel, dealers, grew 57% and benefited from the Norcraft acquisition. Our share gains in this key channel are coming from deeper relationships with existing customers as well as ramping up recently added dealerships. 
Our home center in-stock cabinets and vanities sales increased strong double digits, due largely to strong sell-through of new programs and product upgrades that launched earlier in the year. 
The remaining 25% of our cabinets business focuses on home center semi-custom, builder direct in select markets and our Canadian sales. 
We are disciplined in our approach to these segments of the cabinet market as we focus on where we can partner with our customers to capture profitable growth. With our focused approach, combined sales for these segments increased strong double digits in the quarter, excluding the impact of currency. 
Overall for cabinets, our teams continue to execute well across multiple facets of a complex category. Our plans are increasingly more efficient, and we're pleased that we added capacity when we did to handle the growth that is now being realized. 
On the front end of the business, we are performing particularly well as we built share in the most attractive segments of the market. The impact of our consistent execution can be seen in our share gains, our stronger mix and our improving margins.
For our Plumbing segment, sales were up 7% in the quarter and increased 10%, excluding the negative impact of currency. Growth was led by U.S. wholesale and retail as well as China. 
Again, in the fourth quarter, our mix was solid and margins were strong. Both wholesale and retail sales increased high single digits, driven by new product performance and strong POS. We're encouraged to see consumers trade up and continue to select our innovative new faucet and shower products for their new homes and repair and remodel projects, including new pull-down faucets, which reflects self-retraction in our Kendall and Glenshire lines, and our Magnetix easy docking/easy releasing showerheads. And we will continue our pace of innovation in the coming quarters, as we introduce new products, which include additional pull-down and pull-up faucets with our new power clean technology that provides 50% more spray nozzle power and additional styles with our motion-sense, hands-free technology. 
Sales in Canada were down high single digits to the prior year, but were up high single digits in local currency as we gained share. China sales increased low double digits versus the prior year, driven primarily by our retail stores and e-commerce. We remain optimistic about both our long-term business model in China and the growth potential, and are encouraged by the R&R activity that we are seeing despite general economic concerns. 
Doors reported sales were up 5% for the quarter, but increased 7% when you exclude the final quarterly impact of exiting some lower-margin business in 2015. 
Door products saw sales growth driven by gains in new construction and retail. Mix continued to improve with consumers more frequently choosing our decorative glass designs and premium upgrades like our recently launched Classic-Craft doors in the American Style and Rustic Collections that capitalize on the growing trend toward taller doors and wider openings. The Therma-Tru brand continues to perform strongly across all channels, and we're benefiting from our expanded distribution. 
In the Security segment, sales increased 3% from the prior year quarter, and we're up 6% excluding the negative impact of currency. High single-digit increases in Master Lock U.S. retail and new program wins for SentrySafe drove the growth. We are excited about the opportunities we see between our Master Lock and Sentry businesses over the next few years. And the integration of Sentry into Master Lock is on track. 
So to recap the quarter, we executed well in our U.S. home products market that is improving as we expected. Results were strong and on plan. Our teams are executing well on delivering profitable growth. 
Before I turn to our outlook for 2016, let me spend some time on our overall full year 2015 performance. The U.S. home products market saw steady growth in repair and remodel activity of around 5% throughout 2015, with growth for new construction accelerating to low double digits in the back half of the year. This was right in line with our initial planning assumption. 
As a result of this market performance and our execution, we delivered sales growth across the businesses that was on plan for 2015, with sales increasing 14% despite the negative impact of currency. The sales growth was significant, with sales for our U.S. home products businesses increasing 20%. 
We also delivered operating margin that improved 110 basis points to 11.8% and EPS growth of 19%. Profit improvement was broad across the businesses. We completed our key capacity additions in cabinets and generated significantly better manufacturing efficiency in the back half of the year. We also added capacity in our door segment and began some modest capacity additions in our plumbing assembly operations. 
During the year, we also took a number of steps to position ourselves for the growth opportunities that we expect over the coming years. First, in May, we purchased Norcraft cabinetry, which is helping us build on our structural competitive advantages with their proven capabilities and positions us even more strongly for growth and share gains in a critical dealer channel. Norcraft has great relationships in the dealer channel and strong operating management throughout their business. The integration is very straightforward and remains right on track. 
Second, in June, we took advantage of the opportunity to secure long-term financing by issuing $900 million in corporate bonds. This provides us significant financial flexibility to drive incremental growth. 
Last, in July, we began integrating the SentrySafe operations into our existing Master Lock platform. As I mentioned, we're excited about the opportunities we see between these 2 businesses, and the teams are working hard to integrate the operations by the middle of 2016. 
Moving forward, we continue to focus on creating meaningful incremental shareholder value by using our strong cash flow and balance sheet to make strategic acquisitions, repurchase our shares and increase our dividend. Our acquisition pipeline is robust, and I'm encouraged by the number of things we're looking at and the potential we have to create incremental shareholder value over time. 
Over the next 3 years, we believe we have the potential to deploy more than $2 billion to drive this incremental value. 
So in 2015, we delivered solid sales and profit growth, driven by reasonable market growth and our strong execution. Importantly, as we enter 2016, our current assessment of the near- and medium-term market, based on the demand indicators that we monitored, point to overall market growth rates similar to 2015, and we see no challenges to our strong execution. Therefore, we are well positioned to deliver similar growth in 2016. 
Now let me turn to our full year outlook for 2016, starting with our view of the U.S. home products market. Our 2016 annual outlook is built on an assumption that U.S. home products market, which impacts over 70% of our sales, grows at a 6% to 7% rate, which is similar to full year 2015 market growth.
Pending that overall assumption, the pace of repair and remodel demand is soon to grow at a continued 5% range. Consumers continue to demonstrate an appetite for stronger styling, product differentiation and project complexity to the effect of these trends and the improving mix across our categories. 
New home construction is assumed to grow at around 10% in 2016, a rate similar to full year 2015 growth. Single-family growth is now expected to grow faster than multi-family, as single-family entry-level activity is beginning to accelerate. 
Therefore, our total global market, which includes assumptions for U.S. market as well as our other international and security markets, is expected to grow at a combined 5% to 6% in 2016. 
Based on [indiscernible] total market assumption, continued share gains post the Norcraft acquisition, we expect solid top line growth for 2016, with our full year sales increasing 10% to 12% over 2015 and our home products businesses again outperforming the market for our products. 
With this market sales growth, our teams are focused on delivering full year EPS in the range of $2.42 to $2.52. 
So overall, our 2016 outlook is based on reasonable market growth assumptions based on the basket of market indicators that we monitor. 
We continue to see steady mix improvement. Our capacity is increasingly more efficient, and we feel good about the winning momentum that our teams are carrying into the year. 
To sum up, we delivered strong sales and profit growth in 2015, and we are well positioned to deliver similar growth in 2016. We remain confident in our ability to continue to outperform the home products market, and our businesses are even stronger. Our strong brands, management teams and capital structure provide flexibility to both focus on profitable organic growth and drive incremental shareholder value with our balance sheet and strong free cash flow. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Lee, who will review our financial performance and provide detail on our guidance."

As Brian mentioned, to best reflect ongoing business performance, the majority of my comments will focus on income before charges and gains from continuing operations. 
Let me start with our fourth quarter results, which were on plan. Sales were $1.22 billion, up 18% from a year ago. As Chris mentioned, sales increased 22% for our U.S. businesses.
Consolidated operating income for the quarter was $147 million, up 42% or $43 million compared to the same quarter last year. Consolidated operating margin improved to 12%.
EPS was $0.56 for the quarter versus $0.44 the same quarter last year, increasing 27% and were at the high end of our guidance range. 
Now let me provide more color on segment results. Our Cabinet sales were $608 million, up $152 million or 33% versus the prior year quarter. Norcraft added $107 million of the sales growth. Dealer sales were $309 million and increased 57% from the prior year. In-stock cabinets and vanities sales of $121 million increased 15%, driven by strong sell-through of new products. The remaining sales for home center, semi-custom, builder direct and Canada increased 21%, excluding the negative impact of currency of approximately $8 million. 
Operating income for the Cabinet segment increased 72% or $26 million over the prior year quarter, with Norcraft adding half of the increase. Operating margin for the quarter increased 220 basis points to 10%. For the full year, Cabinet sales increased 22% over the prior year, and operating income grew 42% to $196 million, with the operating margin increasing 130 basis points to 9%. Excluding the Norcraft acquisition and the negative impact of currency, sales increased 8% and operating income grew 19%. 
Turning to Plumbing. Sales for the fourth quarter were $359 million, up $23 million or 7%, led by U.S. retail, U.S. wholesale and China. Excluding the $9 million negative impact of currency, total plumbing sales increased 10%, Canadian sales increased 8% and China sales increased 14%. 
Operating income increased $12 million to $71 million, up 21%. Operating margin for the segment was 19.8%, up 220 basis points from the prior year quarter. The negative impact of currency was $6 million. For the full year, Plumbing sales increased 6%, operating income was up 12% over the prior year and operating margin increased 120 basis points to 20.7%. 
Door sales were $115 million, up $5 million, up 5% from the prior year quarter. Sales were up 7%, excluding the impact of exiting some low-margin business. Operating income increased $6 million to $13 million, up 77%. Operating margin was 11.6% for the quarter. For the full year, door sales increased 6%, operating income grew 51% and operating margin increased 290 basis points to 10%. 
Security sales were $144 million in the fourth quarter, up 3% to the prior year. The U.S. business was up 7%. The impact of foreign currency reduced sales by $3 million in the quarter. Segment operating income increased to $19 million, up 21%, and the segment operating margin was 13%. For the full year, security sales increased 15%, operating income increased 17% from the prior year and operating margin was 12.5%. We expect significant operating margin improvement in 2017 after we complete the integration of the SentrySafe manufacturing into our Master Lock platform in 2016. 
To sum up, consolidated fourth quarter performance, sales increased 18% and EPS were on plan at $0.56. Our total company operating margin was 12%, with an incremental margin of 44%, excluding acquisitions. For the full year 2015, sales increased 14%, and EPS grew 19% to $2.07, which was at the high end of our outlook. Total company operating margin was 11.8%, a 110 basis point improvement. We are on track to reach our long-term goal of approaching 15% operating margin when the housing market returns to steady state levels.
Before turning to the balance sheet, let me comment on the cumulative impact of currency. The strengthening U.S. dollar reduced our total fourth quarter sales by approximately $20 million, with Canada being the primary source. EPS impact was approximately $0.02. For the full year, currency movements reduced sales by $69 million and EPS by $0.07. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Our December 31 balance sheet remains solid with cash of $239 million, debt of $1.2 billion, and our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage is 1.4x. We had nothing drawn on our $975 million revolving credit facility. 
Since beginning of 2016, we repurchased approximately 2.1 million shares totaling $100 million. 
Turning last to the details of our outlook for 2016. Based on our projected 6% to 7% U.S. home product market growth and our total global market growth of 5% to 6% as well as our continued share gains and additional sales from the Norcraft acquisition, we expect full year 2016 sales to increase 10% to 12% compared to 2015. Our resulting outlook for 2016 EPS are in the range of $2.42 to $2.52. The midpoint of our EPS outlook reflects an increase of 19%, similar growth to 2015, with the first quarter EPS growth rate similar to what we expect for the full year 2016. 
The annual EPS outlook includes the following assumptions: interest expense of around $45 million, a tax rate of 33%, average fully diluted shares of approximately 163 million, a positive impact from commodity cost that will partially offset a negative impact from currency in the first half of 2016, and a double-digit increase in health care costs. 
We expect 2016 free cash flow to be $350 million to $375 million, with conversion rate of over 90%. 
In summary, the fourth quarter and full year EPS were on plan, with market growth as expected. The solid performance of our business for the year, the recent investments made to increase capacity and the expected continued market recovery give us confidence in continued solid growth in the coming years. Importantly, the 110 basis point operating margin increase in 2015 and expected 100 basis point increase at the midpoint of our 2016 outlook place us right on track for achieving our 3-year operating margin targets. 
Also, as demonstrated by the Norcraft acquisition, share repurchases and the dividend rate increase, we remain focused on using our balance sheet and cash flow to drive incremental shareholder value. Additionally, our new debt structure provides significant flexibility to continue to drive incremental shareholder value. 
I will now pass the call back to Brian."

We really look at a lot of different factors to drive our outlook, and to actually break it down a bit, on the supply side, we are looking at a lot of fundamentals, land sales, land development, permits, starts, homes under construction, supply of inventory, labor availability. And then you kind of look at supply versus demand, the fundamentals around alpha formation, affordability, home prices, interest rates, levels of consumer debt. And then we look at builder reported new home sale order rates and new and existing home sales and purchase finance applications and then kind of look at the macro level stuff around consumer confidence, employment rates. So we take all of that plus more  and actually try to drive toward what we think are the fundamentals around the outlook for new construction, existing housing turnover, R&R. Then we compare it to the stuff that we're actually seeing from our customers and discussions that we're having. So keep in mind, we've got -- we're a leader in our category. So we've got a pretty broad network of customers we're getting input from. But we're losing the builders, home centers, probably home sellers, 5,200 kitchen and bath dealers. We're looking at order patterns. We're looking at prior quarter patterns. We're looking at current quarter patterns. We will roll that all together. And then we compare it to what consensus says in the market, whatever they're saying. So I'd say we've got a lot more proprietary. Last year, we came out, and I'd say, almost hit it dead on with where we wound up. So our estimate of how these starts overall between single-family and multi-family was 1,119,000, and I guess the year wound up at 1,107,000. Consensus was at 1.2 million. So we're off by 11,000, and the market was off by 100,000. So I'm not gloating here. I'm just thing we've got much better looking at the drivers at a very granule kind of data-driven level and then comparing to what we're hearing and seeing in the market. Second part of your question was around what we're seeing right now and actually year is off pretty good after a pretty good start. So both order patterns and then January, which is done now, are on plan. Maybe in a little bit stronger, but we're seeing actually really encouraging signs. And that matches up well, so we're out of builder and kitchen and bath show  2 weeks ago, and a lot of positive commentary. And as we look at the current behavior and the builders with order patterns and what we're hearing from home centers. So I just -- I would say, we've built all this over the fourth quarter, and what we're seeing over the first 6 weeks of the year support our outlook and where we think the year is trending and where the year will come in."

So as we think about operating margin growth, it starts with our long-term strategy.

So as we think about operating margin growth, it starts with our long-term strategy. And we said at the spin that our focus was, when we get to steady-state, which is 1.4 million to 1.5 million housing starts a year, which is not peak, but which we consider steady state, we'll be back to 14% to 15% operating margins, which was similar to what we had pre-downturn. And we think we've continued to do that each year, the growth of 110 basis points of operating margin in '15, and then at the midpoint of our guidance was another 100 basis points improvement to maybe 12.8. So we're right on track, if you assume, over the next 3 years, we hit steady-state. But what's really driving that? I think it starts with the focus on disciplined sales growth that drives profit, not just driving sales growth for the sake of sales, but really targeting across all of our segments that we're going to just really drive disciplined profit growth. I think secondly, what you've seen in '15 is with those lack of -- or the reduction in investments that we've had in '14 and even early part of '15, we're getting very good leverage across our business. For the full year, our incremental margin on incremental sales was about 36%. We will normally plan around 25% to 30% on an annual basis, but we're getting -- starting to see that real leverage comes when you reduce investments. So that's driving a lot of this margin expansion. I think the other thing you're seeing is the operating efficiencies are improving since we're not increasing the capacity at this point. And we watch that closely. Our product mix continues to improve across our channels and across our segments. So I think that combination, you're seeing not only for the fourth quarter but for the full year, and it's reflected in our guidance that, that discipline is going to continue to drive this operating margin growth."

So again, they're making nice progress. We put capacity in, in '14, a little bit in early '15. So now you're starting to see the leverage against that, and that should continue to get them on track for that 14-plus at kind of steady state. Moen last year, in '14, was 19.5%. This year, in 2015, they were 20.7%. We kind of think there -- our strategy there is that's a fine margin. It could go up. But the real strategy there is to drive sales above market growth sales at anywhere close to that mark -- that margin. So we're very happy with the 20-plus percent operating margin. We can retain that. But our real goal is to drive incremental value by really driving sales around that same margin rate, would be a better way to create value than just increasing that margin year after year."

And the largest portion of that is in the first half of 2016. Around commodities, I think we said it on our third quarter call that the third quarter '15 was about $3 million benefit-ish benefit. We saw the fourth quarter around that same maybe $4 million. Our assumption in our guidance, that's $7 million for the second half. And the first half was kind of breakeven, to be honest with you, a little bit of cost in the first quarter of '15, a little benefit in the second quarter, but those kind of washed. I'd say our plans for '16 midpoint guidance is first half of '16, $7 million to $8 million benefit, very similar to the second half, and then kind of slowing down in the second half of '16. So some of that benefit going away. So I'd say the first half of '16, from a commodity benefit, is -- should be very similar to the second half of '15."

We're encouraged by the credit availability, especially at the entry level. I think that the bigger constraints has been the inventory of existing housing that's been on the market than there is demand. I think you look at [indiscernible] or other pricing surveys, the pressure you see on existing housing prices rising is because there's inventories not quite where demand is. So I'm encouraged by deman, I'm encouraged by credit availability. Also look at, from just a macro standpoint, level of spending per household on home improvements weren't even back to a 50-year average yet. We've been running below that since 2008. So we look at that and how far up are we on that curve. It's a large number universe, so you're talking about the averages like 725 to 750. But if you actually look at those who are really remodeling, it's in the 1,500, north of that type of number. And then you look at what the home centers activity has been, and that's kind of running mid-single-digits, and I think their outlooks are more for mid-single-digits for the year, so there's a number of those factors that get us pretty comfortable around a 5% rate, which is really the historic average. I think there's potential for upside over that over the next couple of years just based on the fact that we've underinvested in the repair and remodel side of the market, houses are getting older. We underbuilt relative to the housing starts over 8 years. And so you're just kind of continuing to lean on the existing housing starts. So the turnover is one factor, that used to be highly correlated. So back -- I'm talking pre-2006, it was highly correlated to R&R spending. That completely disconnected in the downturn. It's gotten tighter, but it isn't kind of back to that same high level of correlation. So it's important, but it's not the only driver in R&R that we look at."

Over the last 18, 24 months, we've seen much more activity                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 at kind of the entry level, semi-custom level, both in home centers as well as in the dealer channel. We think there probably is some credit support to that, and that's -- you could say at key locks, you could say it's refinancing, it's general savings. And the price points are, frankly, lower. So they can afford -- they're more affordable projects at that kind of entry-level, semi-custom. So you're not being to really finance that much of a purchase. So I think that it's a combination of those 2, depending on the level of activity we're seeing. Anecdotally, across the dealer channel, pretty consistent growth throughout the year. So about 10% in the quarter, 10% for the whole year. And we saw actually a mix shift, a little bit more to some of that semi-custom model to custom, so there's kind of more of that support in the general broader market, but pretty consistent growth rates."

And so just as e-commerce continues to expand across categories in China, we're benefiting from that. And so that's driving some pretty good growth from us, good margins. And our traditional retail where we've got 1,000 outlets in China is supporting R&R activity that's coming through that market. There is some softness in direct-to-builder but, frankly, it's just down low single digits. So it's less than you might expect. It might be that faucets and sinks, fairly small-ticket purchase, remodeling-type ticket purchase, is holding up reasonably well. But we did an -- we obviously pressure-tested as we come into the year, and so we're looking closely at it. But so far, we're seeing reasonable rates for our category, not relying upon new construction, but really more the retail side of that market. Canada, relatively flat. I think it depends on what part of the country. Obviously, alas, Calgary impacted by oil, but the cities are holding up okay. And I'd just say low single digits is what we're planning on for the year."

We did some proprietary research, some real consumer research. And this all kind of comes back to the consumers' desire to personalize their space. They want something rather complex, unique. And so that's translating into consumers buying up in our mix chain, so from entry-level up to first, second upgrade, more semi-custom, more unique finishes, painted versus stained looks, things that we can price for -- not just raising prices but rather the mix that's driving that. Same thing on entry doors, with Therma-Tru, they're buying more unique glass styles, different finishes in that entry. I'd say we're not at peak. I'd say it continues to improve and it's driving some of that margin improvement that we see. So our margin improvement's coming from efficiencies and our plants, it's also coming from some of that mix improvement as they're buying the new products that we're bringing in and mixing and matching for their own unique styles. And that was something that we were sitting there saying, ""How long is this going to run for?"" And actually, based on research, it's going to continue to run. This is pretty fundamental on our consumer behavior in the U.S., people like to customize more and more. And so we're working hard with our designers and our channel partners to provide that mix and provide more unique looks that the consumers are going to get excited about."

First on the margin outlook, always appreciate the detailed guidance and thought process. I was hoping to give -- if you guys could give a little bit on both doors and security margins, how to think about that for 2016. I know you referred to expecting some material margin expansion, I believe, in the security business following the integration of SentrySafe. So I don't know if that puts you solidly above a 13% mark or mid-13s. Also, with the Door business, a lot of improvement there, certainly some driven by the new mix. But from an incremental margin standpoint, would love your thoughts there as well."

We are, as Chris mentioned in his comments, we started the integration in end of June of '15, of SentrySafe manufacturing into Master Lock, that will take a year or so. So sometime this summer, we should finish that. So at that point, at a minimum by the fourth quarter of '16, we should be at a much higher run rate. I'd say you could see SentrySafe going pre-integration of the manufacturing from 7% operating margin to 13%, 14% operating margin for at least the last quarter of '16. And then by the time we hit '17, if they're at 13%, 14%, Master Lock is at 14% to 15%, so you've taken that whole business up nicely from 12.5% this year to 14% to 15% by '17. But '16 is a transition year. We won't get a lot of the benefit until probably the fourth quarter, maybe a little bit into the third. So great profit growth potential there with that integration. In terms of Doors. So Doors, nice growth in '15. Operating margin full year, 10%. Doors are much like Cabinets. We expect them to get back to that 14%, 15% operating margin at steady-state. They're making great progress there. I think if you looked at the guidance, midpoint of our guidance, you could see them approaching or exceeding 11% in '16. So again, just like Cabinets, well on track to get back to that 14-plus at steady-state. So this all goes back to the things Chris talked about and that really disciplined approach to sales growth that really drives profit. So these margin improvements are across all of our segments because it's a philosophy."

You've been very good about kind of creating a decent cadence over the last 2 or 3 years in terms of these bolt-on opportunities and, when those don't present themselves, be willing to buy back some stock. I was wondering if that's the -- that type of balance, let's say, would also be applicable to 2016 where, I presume, you're still, as of the last conference call, very active on the M&A side. But if that doesn't necessarily happen, and given the strong free cash flow and good balance sheet position, that you'd still be willing to repurchase some shares throughout the year. So thoughts around that and, again, the first minor modeling on the corporate expense for the year."

If anything, we're busier now than we were a year ago. And in fact, I'd say that still is a real focus for us. On the other side, we bought back $100 million worth of our shares, $2.1 million in the month of January, I'd say at the value that we're seeing in the market right now versus our plans. We'll remain -- looking at share repurchase this year, we've still got about $148 million left under our authorization. So yes, we're going to look at both of those, and we've got plenty of capacity to both buy back shares and complete acquisitions. We ended the year at only 1.4x debt. So we've got capacity to do things. We've got debt capacity. We've got strong free cash flow. So we'll be very efficient with our cash. We have been coming up on 5 years here, and we're going to continue to do that. And there may be some really nice opportunities looking at us over the next few months. So that's about all I can say on all that. But I'd say we'll be balanced in our approach across those 2."

Our team delivered strong results at the high end of our guidance for the fourth quarter and full year 2015. We achieved strong sales growth as the home products market accelerated in the back half of the year as we had expected. 
Our teams also delivered strong profit growth, driven by efficiency gains in our recently expanded capacity and our continued focus on profitable growth in all channels. 
Our strong 2015 results again illustrate that our substantial and leading share positions in each of our categories generate outside sales and earnings growth when our underlying markets are positive. Our leading positions and the momentum we have built position us well for continued strong performance heading into 2016 and beyond.
Let me first take you through some of the fourth quarter highlights and my thoughts on our full year performance in 2015, then I will discuss our view of the U.S. home products market and our 2016 outlook for top line growth. 
So let me start with my perspective on our business performance. For the fourth quarter, sales increased 18% in total and 22% for the U.S. businesses. Importantly, total company operating margin increased to 200 basis points to 12%, with solid performance across all operating segments. 
Starting with our Cabinet segment. We continue to follow a disciplined strategy for cabinets focused on profitable growth, and that strategy is working well. We are focused on the most attractive segments in the market, where we have our strongest structural competitive advantages and the greatest profit potential. Our consistent pace of product innovation and our high levels of reliable service to our channel partners is driving growth. 
For the fourth quarter, our overall cabinet sales were up 33% over the prior year quarter, with broad growth across all channels. Sales in the U.S. increased 38%, including Norcraft acquisition. U.S. sales for dealer and in-stock cabinets and vanities, which account for more than 70% of our annual sales, increased 42%, up 12%, excluding Norcraft acquisition. 
Specifically, sales in our largest channel, dealers, grew 57% and benefited from the Norcraft acquisition. Our share gains in this key channel are coming from deeper relationships with existing customers as well as ramping up recently added dealerships. 
Our home center in-stock cabinets and vanities sales increased strong double digits, due largely to strong sell-through of new programs and product upgrades that launched earlier in the year. 
The remaining 25% of our cabinets business focuses on home center semi-custom, builder direct in select markets and our Canadian sales. 
We are disciplined in our approach to these segments of the cabinet market as we focus on where we can partner with our customers to capture profitable growth. With our focused approach, combined sales for these segments increased strong double digits in the quarter, excluding the impact of currency. 
Overall for cabinets, our teams continue to execute well across multiple facets of a complex category. Our plants are increasingly more efficient, and we're pleased that we added capacity when we did to handle the growth that is now being realized. 
On the front end of the business, we are performing particularly well as we built share in the most attractive segments of the market. The impact of our consistent execution can be seen in our share gains, our stronger mix and our improving margins.
For our Plumbing segment, sales were up 7% in the quarter and increased 10%, excluding the negative impact of currency. Growth was led by U.S. wholesale and retail as well as China. 
Again, in the fourth quarter, our mix was solid and margins were strong. Both wholesale and retail sales increased high single digits, driven by new product performance and strong POS. We're encouraged to see consumers trade up and continue to select our innovative new faucet and shower products for their new homes and repair and remodel projects, including new pull-down faucets, with Reflex self-retraction in our Kendall and Glenshire lines, and our Magnetix easy docking/easy releasing showerheads. And we will continue our pace of innovation in the coming quarters, as we introduce new products, which include additional pull-down and pull-up faucets with our new power clean technology that provides 50% more spray nozzle power and additional styles with our motion-sense, hands-free technology. 
Sales in Canada were down high single digits to the prior year, but were up high single digits in local currency as we gained share. China sales increased low double digits versus the prior year, driven primarily by our retail stores and e-commerce. We remain optimistic about both our long-term business model in China and the growth potential, and are encouraged by the R&R activity that we are seeing despite general economic concerns. 
Doors reported sales were up 5% for the quarter, but increased 7% when you exclude the final quarterly impact of exiting some lower-margin business in 2015. 
Door products saw sales growth driven by gains in new construction and retail. Mix continued to improve with consumers more frequently choosing our decorative glass designs and premium upgrades like our recently launched Classic-Craft doors in the American Style and Rustic Collections that capitalize on the growing trend toward taller doors and wider openings. The Therma-Tru brand continues to perform strongly across all channels, and we're benefiting from our expanded distribution. 
In the Security segment, sales increased 3% from the prior year quarter, and we're up 6% excluding the negative impact of currency. High single-digit increases in Master Lock U.S. retail and new program wins for SentrySafe drove the growth. We are excited about the opportunities we see between our Master Lock and Sentry businesses over the next few years. And the integration of Sentry into Master Lock is on track. 
So to recap the quarter, we executed well in our U.S. home products market that is improving as we expected. Results were strong and on plan. Our teams are executing well and delivering profitable growth. 
Before I turn to our outlook for 2016, let me spend some time on our overall full year 2015 performance. The U.S. home products market saw steady growth in repair and remodel activity of around 5% throughout 2015, with growth for new construction accelerating to low double digits in the back half of the year. This was right in line with our initial planning assumption. 
As a result of this market performance and our execution, we delivered sales growth across the businesses that was on plan for 2015, with sales increasing 14% despite the negative impact of currency. The sales growth was significant, with sales for our U.S. home products businesses increasing 20%. 
We also delivered operating margin that improved 110 basis points to 11.8% and EPS growth of 19%. Profit improvement was broad across the businesses. We completed our key capacity additions in cabinets and generated significantly better manufacturing efficiency in the back half of the year. We also added capacity in our door segment and began some modest capacity additions in our plumbing assembly operations. 
During the year, we also took a number of steps to position ourselves for the growth opportunities that we expect over the coming years. First, in May, we purchased Norcraft cabinetry, which is helping us build on our structural competitive advantages with their proven capabilities and positions us even more strongly for growth and share gains in a critical dealer channel. Norcraft has great relationships in the dealer channel and strong operating management throughout their business. The integration is very straightforward and remains right on track. 
Second, in June, we took advantage of the opportunity to secure long-term financing by issuing $900 million in corporate bonds. This provides us significant financial flexibility to drive incremental growth. 
Last, in July, we began integrating the SentrySafe operations into our existing Master Lock platform. As I mentioned, we're excited about the opportunities we see between these 2 businesses, and the teams are working hard to integrate the operations by the middle of 2016. 
Moving forward, we continue to focus on creating meaningful incremental shareholder value by using our strong cash flow and balance sheet to make strategic acquisitions, repurchase our shares and increase our dividend. Our acquisition pipeline is robust, and I'm encouraged by the number of things we're looking at and the potential we have to create incremental shareholder value over time. 
Over the next 3 years, we believe we have the potential to deploy more than $2 billion to drive this incremental value. 
So in 2015, we delivered solid sales and profit growth, driven by reasonable market growth and our strong execution. Importantly, as we enter 2016, our current assessment of the near- and medium-term market, based on the demand indicators that we monitored, point to overall market growth rates similar to 2015, and we see no challenges to our strong execution. Therefore, we are well positioned to deliver similar growth in 2016. 
Now let me turn to our full year outlook for 2016, starting with our view of the U.S. home products market. Our 2016 annual outlook is built on an assumption that U.S. home products market, which impacts over 70% of our sales, grows at a 6% to 7% rate, which is similar to full year 2015 market growth.
Given that overall assumption, the pace of repair and remodel demand is soon to grow at a continued 5% rate. Consumers continue to demonstrate an appetite for stronger styling, product differentiation and project complexity to the effect of these trends in the improving mix across our categories. 
New home construction is assumed to grow at around 10% in 2016, a rate similar to full year 2015 growth. Single-family growth is now expected to grow faster than multi-family, as single-family entry-level activity is beginning to accelerate. 
Therefore, our total global market, which includes assumptions for U.S. market as well as our other international and security markets, is expected to grow at a combined 5% to 6% in 2016. 
Based on that total global market assumption, continued share gains post the Norcraft acquisition, we expect solid top line growth for 2016, with our full year sales increasing 10% to 12% over 2015 and our home products businesses again outperforming the market for our products. 
With this market and sales growth, our teams are focused on delivering full year EPS in the range of $2.42 to $2.52. 
So overall, our 2016 outlook is based on reasonable market growth assumptions based on the basket of market indicators that we monitor. 
We continue to see steady mix improvement. Our capacity is increasingly more efficient, and we feel good about the winning momentum that our teams are carrying into the year. 
To sum up, we delivered strong sales and profit growth in 2015, and we are well positioned to deliver similar growth in 2016. We remain confident in our ability to continue to outperform the home products market, and our businesses are even stronger. Our strong brands, management teams and capital structure provide flexibility to both focus on profitable organic growth and drive incremental shareholder value with our balance sheet and strong free cash flow. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Lee, who will review our financial performance and provide detail on our guidance."

As Brian mentioned, to best reflect ongoing business performance, the majority of my comments will focus on income before charges and gains from continuing operations. Let me start with our fourth quarter results, whic",1063,"Thanks, Chris, and good afternoon. As Brian mentioned, to best reflect ongoing business performance, the majority of my comments will focus on income before charges and gains from continuing operations. 
Let me start with our fourth quarter results, which were on plan. Sales were $1.22 billion, up 18% from a year ago. As Chris mentioned, sales increased 22% for our U.S. businesses.
Consolidated operating income for the quarter was $147 million, up 42% or $43 million compared to the same quarter last year. Consolidated operating margin improved to 12%.
EPS was $0.56 for the quarter versus $0.44 the same quarter last year, increasing 27% and were at the high end of our guidance range. 
Now let me provide more color on segment results. Our Cabinet sales were $608 million, up $152 million or 33% versus the prior year quarter. Norcraft added $107 million of the sales growth. Dealer sales were $309 million and increased 57% from the prior year. In-stock cabinets and vanities sales of $121 million increased 15%, driven by strong sell-through of new products. The remaining sales for home center, semi-custom, builder direct and Canada increased 21%, excluding the negative impact of currency of approximately $8 million. 
Operating income for the Cabinet segment increased 72% or $26 million over the prior year quarter, with Norcraft adding half of the increase. Operating margin for the quarter increased 220 basis points to 10%. For the full year, Cabinet sales increased 22% over the prior year, and operating income grew 42% to $196 million, with the operating margin increasing 130 basis points to 9%. Excluding the Norcraft acquisition and the negative impact of currency, sales increased 8% and operating income grew 19%. 
Turning to Plumbing. Sales for the fourth quarter were $359 million, up $23 million or 7%, led by U.S. retail, U.S. wholesale and China. Excluding the $9 million negative impact of currency, total plumbing sales increased 10%, Canadian sales increased 8% and China sales increased 14%. 
Operating income increased $12 million to $71 million, up 21%. Operating margin for the segment was 19.8%, up 220 basis points from the prior year quarter. The negative impact of currency was $6 million. For the full year, Plumbing sales increased 6%, operating income was up 12% over the prior year and operating margin increased 120 basis points to 20.7%. 
Door sales were $115 million, up $5 million, up 5% from the prior year quarter. Sales were up 7%, excluding the impact of exiting some low-margin business. Operating income increased $6 million to $13 million, up 77%. Operating margin was 11.6% for the quarter. For the full year, door sales increased 6%, operating income grew 51% and operating margin increased 290 basis points to 10%. 
Security sales were $144 million in the fourth quarter, up 3% to the prior year. The U.S. business was up 7%. The impact of foreign currency reduced sales by $3 million in the quarter. Segment operating income increased to $19 million, up 21%, and the segment operating margin was 13%. For the full year, security sales increased 15%, operating income increased 17% from the prior year and operating margin was 12.5%. We expect significant operating margin improvement in 2017 after we complete the integration of the SentrySafe manufacturing into our Master Lock platform in 2016. 
To sum up, consolidated fourth quarter performance, sales increased 18% and EPS were on plan at $0.56. Our total company operating margin was 12%, with an incremental margin of 44%, excluding acquisitions. For the full year 2015, sales increased 14%, and EPS grew 19% to $2.07, which was at the high end of our outlook. Total company operating margin was 11.8%, a 110 basis point improvement. We are on track to reach our long-term goal of approaching 15% operating margin when the housing market returns to steady state levels.
Before turning to the balance sheet, let me comment on the cumulative impact of currency. The strengthening U.S. dollar reduced our total fourth quarter sales by approximately $20 million, with Canada being the primary source. EPS impact was approximately $0.02. For the full year, currency movements reduced sales by $69 million and EPS by $0.07. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Our December 31 balance sheet remains solid with cash of $239 million, debt of $1.2 billion, and our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage is 1.4x. We had nothing drawn on our $975 million revolving credit facility. 
Since beginning of 2016, we repurchased approximately 2.1 million shares totaling $100 million. 
Turning last to the details of our outlook for 2016. Based on our projected 6% to 7% U.S. home product market growth and our total global market growth of 5% to 6% as well as our continued share gains and additional sales from the Norcraft acquisition, we expect full year 2016 sales to increase 10% to 12% compared to 2015. Our resulting outlook for 2016 EPS are in the range of $2.42 to $2.52. The midpoint of our EPS outlook reflects an increase of 19%, similar growth to 2015, with the first quarter EPS growth rate similar to what we expect for the full year 2016. 
The annual EPS outlook includes the following assumptions: interest expense of around $45 million, a tax rate of 33%, average fully diluted shares of approximately 163 million, a positive impact from commodity cost that will partially offset a negative impact from currency in the first half of 2016, and a double-digit increase in health care costs. 
We expect 2016 free cash flow to be $350 million to $375 million, with conversion rate of over 90%. 
In summary, the fourth quarter and full year EPS were on plan, with market growth as expected. The solid performance of our business for the year, the recent investments made to increase capacity and the expected continued market recovery give us confidence in continued solid growth in the coming years. Importantly, the 110 basis point operating margin increase in 2015 and expected 100 basis point increase at the midpoint of our 2016 outlook place us right on track for achieving our 3-year operating margin targets. 
Also, as demonstrated by the Norcraft acquisition, share repurchases and the dividend rate increase, we remain focused on using our balance sheet and cash flow to drive incremental shareholder value. Additionally, our new debt structure provides significant flexibility to continue to drive incremental shareholder value. 
I will now pass the call back to Brian."

We really look at a lot of different factors to drive our outlook, and to actually break it down a bit, on the supply side, we are looking at a lot of fundamentals, land sales, land development, permits, starts, homes under construction, supply of inventory, labor availability. And then you kind of look at supply versus demand, the fundamentals around household formation, affordability, home prices, interest rates, levels of consumer debt. And then we look at builder reported new home sale order rates and new and existing home sales and purchase finance applications and then kind of look at the macro level stuff around consumer confidence, employment rates. So we take all of that plus more and actually try to drive toward what we think are the fundamentals around the outlook for new construction, existing housing turnover, R&R. Then we compare it to the stuff that we're actually seeing from our customers and discussions that we're having. So keep in mind, we've got -- we're a leader in our category. So we've got a pretty broad network of customers we're getting input from. But we're listening to the builders, home centers, plumbing home sellers, 5,200 kitchen and bath dealers. We're looking at order patterns. We're looking at prior quarter patterns. We're looking at current quarter patterns. We will roll that all together. And then we compare it to what consensus is in the market and what others are saying. So I'd say we've got a lot more proprietary. Last year, we came out, and I'd say, almost hit it dead on with where we wound up. So our estimate of housing starts overall between single-family and multi-family was 1,119,000, and I guess the year wound up at 1,107,000. Consensus was at 1.2 million. So we're off by 11,000, and the market was off by 100,000. So I'm not gloating here. I'm just thing we've got much better looking at the drivers at a very granule kind of data-driven level and then comparing to what we're hearing and seeing in the market. Second part of your question was around what we're seeing right now and actually year is off pretty good -- off to a pretty good start. So both order patterns and then January, which is done now, are on plan. Maybe even a little bit stronger, but we're seeing actually really encouraging signs. And that matches up well, so we're out to builder and kitchen and bath show 2 weeks ago, and a lot of positive commentary. And as we look at the current behavior in the builders with order patterns and what we're hearing from home centers. So I just -- I would say, we've built all this over the fourth quarter, and what we're seeing over the first 6 weeks of the year support our outlook and where we think the year is trending and where the year will come in."

And maybe if you could just give us a flavor for how much operating leverage is in the business based on the assumptions that Chris outlined for volume growth."
33174798,322182526,926090,"Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2016",2016-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Fortune Brands Innovations, Inc.","Executives","Yes. So as we think about operating margin growth, it starts with our long-term strategy. And we said at the spin that our focus was, when we get to steady-state, which is 1.4 million to 1.5 million housing starts a year, which is not peak, but which we c",334,"Yes. So as we think about operating margin growth, it starts with our long-term strategy. And we said at the spin that our focus was, when we get to steady-state, which is 1.4 million to 1.5 million housing starts a year, which is not peak, but which we consider steady state, we'll be back to 14% to 15% operating margins, which was similar to what we had pre-downturn. And we think we've continued to do that each year, the growth of 110 basis points of operating margin in '15, and then at the midpoint of our guidance was another 100 basis points improvement to maybe 12.8. So we're right on track, if you assume, over the next 3 years, we hit steady-state. But what's really driving that? I think it starts with the focus on disciplined sales growth that drives profit, not just driving sales growth for the sake of sales, but really targeting across all of our segments that we're going to just really drive disciplined profit growth. I think secondly, what you've seen in '15 is with those lack of -- or the reduction in investments that we've had in '14 and even early part of '15, we're getting very good leverage across our business. For the full year, our incremental margin on incremental sales was about 36%. We will normally plan around 25% to 30% on an annual basis, but we're getting -- starting to see that real leverage comes when you reduce investments. So that's driving a lot of this margin expansion. I think the other thing you're seeing is the operating efficiencies are improving since we're not increasing the capacity at this point. And we watch that closely. Our product mix continues to improve across our channels and across our segments. So I think that combination, you're seeing not only for the fourth quarter but for the full year, and it's reflected in our guidance that, that's the discipline is going to continue to drive this operating margin growth."

So again, they're making nice progress. We put capacity in, in '14, a little bit in early '15. So now you're starting to see the leverage against that, and that should continue to get them on track for that 14-plus at kind of steady state. Moen last year, in '14, was 19.5%. This year, in 2015, they were 20.7%. We kind of think there -- our strategy there is that's a fine margin. It could go up. But the real strategy there is to drive sales above market growth sales at anywhere close to that mark -- that margin. So we're very happy with the 20-plus percent operating margin. We can retain that. But our real goal is to drive incremental value by really driving sales around that same margin rate, would be a better way to create value than just increasing that margin year after year."

But we had period cost. It'll probably cost us $0.03 or $0.04 in the first quarter versus last year. We're making the last piece of investment in Moen, which is probably another $0.01. Interest expense, because we did our refinancing in the summer of '15, will cost us about $0.03 or $8 million in the first quarter versus last year. And we got some medical going up and some other things. So yes, there are some -- a few tailwinds, but there's some other things that are going to pull it back down to make that kind of that similar 18% to 20% growth rate reasonable."

And then actually, the starts activity, enough order activity should support our overall guidance for the full year. So we see it as a pretty steady cadence throughout quarter-over-quarter for our products coming in because there is that kind of lag built into the system. So it should be a little bit more even than it was last year when we started out slow and then ramped up second half. We don't see that happening. We see it as more of an even quarter-over-quarter."

And the largest portion of that is in the first half of 2016. Around commodities, I think we said it on our third quarter call that the third quarter '15 was about $3 million benefit-ish benefit. We saw the fourth quarter around that same maybe $4 million. Our assumption in our guidance, that's $7 million for the second half. And the first half was kind of breakeven, to be honest with you, a little bit of cost in the first quarter of '15, a little benefit in the second quarter, but those kind of washed. I'd say our plans for '16 midpoint guidance is first half of '16, $7 million to $8 million benefit, very similar to the second half, and then kind of slowing down in the second half of '16. So some of that benefit going away. So I'd say the first half of '16, from a commodity benefit, is -- should be very similar to the second half of '15."

We're encouraged by the credit availability, especially at the entry level. I think that the bigger constraints has been the inventory of existing housing that's been on the market than there is demand. I think you look at Case-Shiller or other pricing surveys, the pressure you see on existing housing prices rising is because there's inventories not quite where demand is. So I'm encouraged by demand, I'm encouraged by credit availability. Also look at, from just a macro standpoint, level of spending per household on home improvements weren't even back to a 50-year average yet. We've been running below that since 2008. So we look at that and how far up are we on that curve. It's a large number universe, so you're talking about the averages like 725 to 750. But if you actually look at those who are really remodeling, it's in the 1,500, north of that type of number. And then you look at what the home centers activity has been, and that's kind of running mid-single-digits, and I think their outlooks are more for mid-single-digits for the year, so there's a number of those factors that get us pretty comfortable around a 5% rate, which is really the historic average. I think there's potential for upside over that over the next couple of years just based on the fact that we've under invested in the repair and remodel side of the market, houses are getting older. We underbuilt relative to the housing stock over 8 years. And so you're just kind of continuing to lean on the existing housing stock. So the turnover is one factor, that used to be highly correlated. So back -- I'm talking pre-2006, it was highly correlated to R&R spending. That completely disconnected in the downturn. It's gotten tighter, but it isn't kind of back to that same high level of correlation. So it's important, but it's not the only driver in R&R that we look at."

We think there probably is some credit support to that, and that's -- you could say at key locks, you could say it's refinancing, it's general savings. And the price points are, frankly, lower. So they can afford -- they're more affordable projects at that kind of entry-level, semi-custom. So you're not needing to really finance that much of a purchase. So I think that it's a combination of those 2, depending on the level of activity we're seeing. Anecdotally, across the dealer channel, pretty consistent growth throughout the year. So about 10% in the quarter, 10% for the whole year. And we saw actually a mix shift, a little bit more to some of that semi-custom model to custom, so there's kind of more of that support in the general broader market, but pretty consistent growth rates."

And our traditional retail where we've got 1,000 outlets in China is supporting R&R activity that's coming through that market. There is some softness in direct-to-builder but, frankly, it's just down low single digits. So it's less than you might expect. It might be that faucets and sinks, fairly small-ticket purchase, remodeling-type ticket purchase, is holding up reasonably well. But we did an -- we obviously pressure-tested as we come into the year, and so we're looking closely at it. But so far, we're seeing reasonable rates for our category, not relying upon new construction, but really more the retail side of that market. Canada, relatively flat.

We did some proprietary research, some real consumer research. And this all kind of comes back to the consumers' desire to personalize their space. They want something rather complex, unique. And so that's translating into consumers buying up in our mix chain, so from entry-level up to first, second upgrade, more semi-custom, more unique finishes, painted versus stained looks, things that we can price for -- not just raising prices but rather the mix that's driving that. Same thing on entry doors, with Therma-Tru, they're buying more unique glass styles, different finishes in that entry. I'd say we're not at peak. I'd say it continues to improve and it's driving some of that margin improvement that we see. So our margin improvement's coming from efficiencies in our plants, it's also coming from some of that mix improvement as they're buying the new products that we're bringing in and mixing and matching for their own unique styles. And that was something that we were sitting there saying, ""How long is this going to run for?"" And actually, based on research, it's going to continue to run.

We are, as Chris mentioned in his comments, we started the integration in end of June of '15, of SentrySafe manufacturing into Master Lock, that will take a year or so. So sometime this summer, we should finish that. So at that point, at a minimum by the fourth quarter of '16, we should be at a much higher run rate. I'd say you could see SentrySafe going pre-integration of the manufacturing from 7% operating margin to 13%, 14% operating margin for at least the last quarter of '16. And then by the time we hit '17, if they're at 13%, 14%, Master Lock is at 14% to 15%, so you've taken that whole business up nicely from 12.5% this year to 14% to 15% by '17. But '16 is a transition year. We won't get a lot of the benefit until probably the fourth quarter, maybe a little bit into the third. So great profit growth potential there with that integration. In terms of Doors. So Doors, nice growth in '15. Operating margin full year, 10%. Doors are much like Cabinets. We expect them to get back to that 14%, 15% operating margin at steady-state. They're making great progress there. I think if you looked at the guidance, midpoint of our guidance, you could see them approaching or exceeding 11% in '16. So again, just like Cabinets, well on track to get back to that 14-plus at steady-state. So this all goes back to the things Chris talked about and that really disciplined approach to sales growth that really drives profit. So these margin improvements are across all of our segments because it's a philosophy."

You've been very good about kind of creating a decent cadence over the last 2 or 3 years in terms of these bolt-on opportunities and, when those don't present themselves, be willing to buy back some stock. I was wondering if that's the -- that type of balance, let's say, would also be applicable to 2016 where, I presume, you're still, as of the last conference call, very active on the M&A side. But if that doesn't necessarily happen, and given the strong free cash flow and good balance sheet position, that you'd still be willing to repurchase some shares throughout the year. So thoughts around that and, again, the first minor modeling on the corporate expense for the year."

If anything, we're busier now than we were a year ago. And in fact, I'd say that still is a real focus for us. On the other side, we bought back $100 million worth of our shares, $2.1 million in the month of January, I'd say at the value that we're seeing in the market right now versus our plans. We'll remain -- looking hard at share repurchase this year, we've still got about $148 million left under our authorization. So yes, we're going to look at both of those, and we've got plenty of capacity to both buy back shares and complete acquisitions. We ended the year at only 1.4x debt. So we've got capacity to do things. We've got debt capacity. We've got strong free cash flow. So we'll be very efficient with our cash. We have been coming up on 5 years here, and we're going to continue to do that. And there may be some really nice opportunities looking at us over the next few months. So that's about all I can say on all that. But I'd say we'll be balanced in our approach across those 2."

Our teams drove strong sales and profit gains in the first quarter as the home products market continue to grow at the pace we expected. Our core businesses performed well across all segments,",1619,"Thank you, Brian, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Our teams drove strong sales and profit gains in the first quarter as the home products market continue to grow at the pace we expected. Our core businesses performed well across all segments, and we remain focused on driving profitable growth. Based on the solid first quarter performance, the momentum we have inside of our businesses and our recent share repurchases, we're increasing our full year EPS outlook.  Let me first spend some time on our view of the U.S. Home products market. Next I'll provide my perspective on our business performance on the first quarter. Lee will then provide more details on our first quarter performance in 2016. 
Starting with our view of the U.S. Home products market, in the first quarter, the market for our home products continue to grow at the pace that we expected it would. We estimate that repair remodel activity grew over 5% and new construction grew low double digits. Repair and remodel activity remains steady, with consumers continuing to demonstrate an appetite for more on trend styling, product differentiation and project complexity. We see the impact of these trends in the improving mix across our categories. As anticipated, new construction demand is growing at a low double-digit rate, and we expect single-family to grow faster than multifamily as single-family entry level activities are beginning to accelerate. Additionally, we saw added strength for more days of good weather in the first quarter, and more broadly, or basket of near term indicators point to stronger underlying demand and continued market momentum as we head into the busiest seasons of the year for home products. In fact, we think there could be some upside to market growth assumptions as R&R and new construction demand look strong, financing at affordable rates are more accessible and builders and contractors seem to be making progress on attracting more labor into the industry. In spite of these positive indicators, we think it's too early to revise our full year market outlook higher. So our overall assumption remains that the U.S. Home products market, which impacts 70% of our sales, grows at a combined 6% to 7% rate for the full year 2016. However, we are closely monitoring market activity as we move through the spring season, and we will determine any further upside to our market assumptions as the year unfolds. Within the overall assumption, the pace of repair and remodel demand is assumed to grow at around 5% rate and new home construction is assumed to grow around 10%. 
Now let me provide some perspective on our business performance. For the first quarter, sales increased 16% in total and 20% for our U.S. Home Products businesses. Importantly, total company operating margin increased 180 basis points to 9.5%, with solid performance across all our operating segments. Starting with our Cabinet segment, we continue to follow a disciplined strategy focused on profitable growth. Our consistent pace of product innovation and our high levels of reliable service to our channel partners continue to drive strong performance. In the first quarter, our overall cabinet sales were up 34% over the prior year and increased 12%, excluding Norcraft acquisition, with broad growth across all channels. Specifically, sales in our largest channel, Dealers, were 62% and 16% excluding Norcraft acquisition. Our share gains are coming from our new construction product lines in this channel, and deeper multiline relationships with existing customers. We're beginning to cross sell more of our product lines across our recently expanded dealer network. 
Our home seller in-stock cabinets and vanity sales grew mid single digits due largely to sell through of new programs and product upgrades that we launched last year. Our Cabinet team has been focused on partnering with our customers to consistently balance inventory levels of production to further enhance service and manufacturing efficiency. The remaining 25% of our Cabinets business, which includes home service and semi-custom, builder direct in select markets in Canada grew strong double digits. We are displayed in our approach in these segments as we focus on where we can partner with customers to capture profitable growth. With our focused approach, we grew share in the segments and drove strong margin improvement. We are especially pleased with our home center special order business where our partnership approach is working well and driving nice growth.  The Norcraft acquisition is on track. Cost savings are running ahead of initial projections, we are adding capabilities, and we're beginning to see some sales benefits as well. It's a wonderful combination and the teams are working well together. Overall for cabinets, we continue to execute well across multiple facets of a complex category. Our plants are increasingly more efficient and we are pleased we added capacity when we did to handle the growth that is now being realized. The front end of the business are performing particularly well as we build the most attractive segment of the market by deepening our partnerships with dealers, home centers and builders. The impact of our consistent execution can be seen in our share gains, our stronger mix and our improving margins. 
For Improvement segment, sales were up 2% for the quarter with solid mix and strong operating margin. Sales increased 6% excluding the negative impact of currency and some channel inventory reductions by select wholesale and retail customers who drew down inventory in the quarter as we expected. We remain on track for our sales to increase mid- to high single digits for the full year. In the first quarter, POS growth at mid single digits across U.S. wholesale and retail. So far in the second quarter, customer orders are running ahead of POS levels and we have a number of product introductions that are flowing into the market, coupled with investments we have made in showroom displays and marketing partners. Across our markets, we continue to see consumers trade up and our mix improve as innovation and design, finish and function attracted some of our most trusted brands. 
With the coming quarters, we have a strong lineup of new products which include additional magnetics, easy docking, easy release showerheads, pull down and pull up faucets, reflex center, candle, quantifier and [indiscernible] and streets builders and wholesale showrooms. Sales in Canada were down low single digits to the prior year, but were up high single digits excluding the negative impact of currency. China sales increased low single digits versus prior year, but were up mid-single digits in local currency, driven primarily by our retail stores and e-commerce. We remain optimistic about both our long-term business model in China and the growth potential and are encouraged by their R&R activity that we're seeing. 
Reported sales were up 13% for the quarter. Total products against our sales growth driven by gains in both new construction and retail. The mix continued to improve, with consumers more frequently choosing our decorative glass designs and premium upgrades like our recently launched Classic-Craft doors that capitalize on the trend toward taller doors and wider openings. In addition to innovative new products, furniture is benefiting from last year's rollout of a refresh retail strategy that includes an enhanced product lineup, simpler, more intuitive  displays and better sales support for our customer associates. And in wholesale, we continue to benefit from strong new construction placements and our enhanced distribution in Western United States. 
In Security segment, sales increased 1% from the prior year quarter and were up approximately 3.5% excluding the negative impact of currency and exited Sentry product lines. The growth was driven by mid-single-digit increases in both Master Lock U.S. retail and U.S. commercial. Further increases were somewhat offset by the planned exit of select profitable Sentry safe product lines as part of the broader Sentry integration. We continue to be excited about the opportunities we see between our Master Lock and Sentry businesses over the next few years, and the integration of Sentry into Master Lock is on track to be completed this summer.  So to recap the quarter, results were strong. We executed well in the U.S. Home products market but it is continuing to grow as we expected. Our teams are delivering profitable growth on that momentum. 
Before I wrap up, let me comment on our efforts to drive long-term growth. We continue to believe that we can create meaningful incremental shareholder value by using our strong cash flow and balance sheet to make strategic acquisitions, repurchase our shares and increase our dividend. Right now, we're busy evaluating a healthy pipeline of potential acquisitions. We're assessing a number of opportunities and while we cannot guarantee success in any one situation, I'm encouraged with the number of things we're looking at and the quality of these businesses. Meanwhile, on the first quarter, we're again successful at repurchasing some of our shares at very attractive prices. It's important to note that we repurchase our shares as part of a process which highlights when a significant disconnect is occurring between the equity markets valuation and our expected long-term business performance. Over the next 3 years, we continue to believe that we have the potential to deploy more than $2 billion to drive incremental growth and shareholder value. 
To sum up the demand for our home products remain strong as we expected. And we continue to grow faster than our market. Our strong brands, management teams and capital structure provide flexibility to both focus on profitable organic growth and drive incremental shareholder value with our balance sheet and strong free cash flow. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Lee, who will review our financial performance and provide detail in our increased EPS outlook for 2016."

As Brian mentioned, the bass reflect ongoing business performance, the majority of my comments will focus on income before charges and gains from continuing operations. Let me start with our first quarter results. Sales were $1.1 billion, up 16% from a year ago. As Chris mentioned, sales increased 20% for our U.S. Home Products businesses. Consolidated operating income for the quarter was $105 million, up 43% or $32 million compared to the same quarter last year. EPS were $0.39 for the quarter versus $0.28 the same quarter last year. Increasing nearly 40% and we're ahead of plan due to more days of good weather, timing of expenses and recent share repurchases. 
Now let me provide more color on segment results. Our Canada sales were $550 million, up $139 million or 34% versus the prior-year quarter. Norcraft added $89 million of the sales growth. Dealer sales were $273 million and increased 62% from the prior year. In-stock cabinets and vanity sales of $110 million increased 6%. The remaining sales for home center semi-custom, builder direct and Canada increased 23%, excluding the negative impact of approximately $4 million from Canadian currency.  Operating income for the Cabinet segment nearly tripled, increasing $24 million over the prior year quarter, with Norcraft adding $5 million of the increase. Operating margin for the quarter doubled to 6.8%. Operating leverage, excluding Norcraft, was 37% as our recently added capacity continues to become more efficient. For the full year, we continue to expect an operating margin approaching 11% compared to 9% in 2015. 
Turning to plumbing, sales for the first quarter were $339 million, up $5 million or 2%, led by U.S. retail and wholesale and China. Excluding the negative impact of currency of $6 million and U.S. channel inventory reductions, total plumbing sales increased approximately 6%, Canadian sales increased 8% and China sales increased 6%. Operating income increased $7 million to $72 million, up 11%. Operating margin for the segment was 21.2%, up 180 basis points from the prior year quarter. For the full year 2016, operating margin could be above 20%. Total sales were $94 million, up $11 million or 13% from the prior-year quarter. Operating income increased $5 million and operating margin for the segment was 4.5%. Full year operating margin for the segment could be at least 11%. Security sales were $124 million in the first quarter, up 1% to the prior year and up approximately 3.5%, excluding the negative impact of currency of $1 million and the planned exit of less profitable SentrySafe product line as part of the broader Sentry integration. Segment operating income increased to $12 million and the segment operating margin was 9.3%, up 120 basis points from the prior year. 
To sum up consolidated first quarter performance, sales increased 16% and EPS was ahead of plan at $0.39. Our total company operating margin was 9.5%, up 180 basis points from the prior year, with an incremental margin, excluding acquisitions of 40%, which put us on track to reach our long-term goal of approaching 15% operating margin without having market returns to steady-state. 
Before turning to the balance sheet, let me comment on the cumulative impact of currency. The strength in U.S. dollar reduced our total first quarter sales by approximately $11 million, with Canada being the primary source. EPS impact was around $0.01. We expect to continue to experience headwinds from currency until the second half of the year. Now turning to the balance sheet, on March 31, balance sheet remains solid with cash of $254 million, debt of $1.6 billion and our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage is 2x. By year-end, we expect leverage to be about 1.4x. We currently have $450 million drawn on our $975 million revolving credit facility as a result of recent share repurchases. 
In the first quarter, we repurchased more than 7.6 million shares for approximately $363 million. The share repurchases positively impacted first quarter EPS by $0.01 and could provide an incremental $0.06 of EPS for the full year 2016 and $0.02 in the first quarter of 2017. At an average purchase price of $47.43, we already see a significant return on the first quarter share repurchases. And we have $285 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization. 
Turning last to the details of our outlook for 2016, while our basket of market indicator is biased to the upside, we continue to assume 6% to 7% U.S. Home Products market growth and total global market growth of 5% to 6%, with share gains and additional second quarter sales from the Norcraft acquisition. We continue to expect full year 2016 sales to increase 10% to 12% compared to 2015. However, we've increased our full year EPS outlook based on our recent share repurchases and our strong first quarter performance. Our outlook for 2016 EPS is now in the range of $2.50 to $2.60, with the midpoint reflecting a 23% increase over the prior year. 
We continue to expect 2016 free cash flow to be $350 million to $375 million, with converted rate of over 90% [ph]. The annual EPS outlook includes the following assumptions: Interest expense of around $50 million; a tax rate of 33%; average fully diluted shares of approximately $157 million; a positive impact from commodity cost that will partially offset both the negative impact from currency in the first half of 2016 and a double-digit increase in health care cost. 
In summary, we're off to a strong start to 2016. First quarter market growth was as expected and we delivered strong sales and profit growth. We were also able to again opportunistically repurchase shares at attractive prices and we remain focused on using our balance sheet and cash flow to drive incremental shareholder value through acquisitions and share repurchases. 
I will now pass the call back to Brian."

I never predict timing of those things or success rates, but I'd say, we're very busy. And so we foresee some deployments in capital this year in M&A, and I think that I can't predict kind of how many of those or how much. On the repurchase side, we look at this continuously running internal returns against our plan, and our plan is kind of a static plan. It's our plan in light of where we see the underlying demand on the market. And when there's a significant misalignment, it's an opportunistic situation. And that's exactly what we saw in January and February, was a misalignment there between the underlying demand, driving our R&R market, driving new construction, the new orders we were seeing come in and where the equity values were. So it was a very good time. Not that very different from the summer of 2014. We did the same thing in 2014, we popped back $400 million plus in shares and in similar circumstance. We moved out versus demand and saw a similar disconnect. So that's, in a nutshell, that's kind of what drove that.  Lee, you can comment on the share count for the year."

I think the other just comment would be that if you look at what we've done through the end of '15, and we spent about $1.8 billion prior to this year, about $1.1 billion in acquisitions and about $550 million in share repurchases on an opportunistic basis, as Chris defined. That's a nice mix. If we can do that going forward, that would be great. If we have different opportunities on share repurchase, we can do that. So I think the key here is flexibility. We have a lot of capital, and it's just being opportunistic. I think Chris is always very very clear, our major goal is driving incremental value and maximizing it. So it's pretty flexible with us."

But I think it's kind of, as we look at it, it's probably 5% to 6% consistent running throughout the year. I think where we'll see a little bit more upside is in single-family new construction. So if you look at kind overall activity there, it flow from orders, looked like they were up kind of 12%, 13% first quarter. Permits for the whole quarter for single-family is up 14%, starts for the quarter up 22%. There's a little bit longer construction cycle, but total units under construction up for the quarter, 19%. Purchase finance applications, up 18%. So those are big numbers, I mean, relative to where we've been. And so if we're lagging a quarter or 2, that should turn into some more significant demand coming into late second quarter and into the second half. So that's where I'd see that variability. It's got to play through yet, and the reason we haven't factored that into everything we're talking about, guidance yet, is let's see it keep flowing and if building gets backed up, not just new construction but R&R gets backed up on labor and it will flow as good, but keeping pace with it, there really could be some additional tailwind behind us coming into the second half of the year. I'd say, builders and R&R contractors are doing a better job on getting labor. If you look at the latest employment reports, construction jobs up 7%, 8% in residential construction labor. So that's running ahead of overall employment which is only up 2% plus. So doing a nice job of finding labor that's out there, but with this kind of demand coming through the system, they got to keep that up. So let's see how it unfolds, but those looks like pretty good numbers relative to what we've seen in the past few years."

But it was a lot of things that was pretty widespread, and it really reflected a lot of -- we saw a lot of activity in the fourth quarter coming in the first quarter. A lot of showroom activity coming through our dealer base. We got a big dealer base we got about 5,500 dealer customers. We say, hey we see some good activity coming through, we we tend to believe it so that is happening in the fourth quarter and I think that activity start to flow through in the first quarter and should continue second quarter and through the balance of the year.

Construction is growing in certain parts of the market, we'll be there and grow. In terms of taxes, we talked last time kind of the oil patch, no more than 5%. Interestingly in our door business we actually see some growth out there because we expanded some distribution so the door business is actually up in Texas. So we're faster than then some parts of the country. I don't think we've seen anything really extraordinary.

In terms of overall demand, it's kind of the same dynamics in mix. As we talk about cabinets, we are getting the advantage that we're bringing out richer mix products, new products, higher price points. We're seeing consumers trade up both on new construction and R&R and our product we're bringing is targeting to take advantage of that. So pretty healthy market overall. Most of the stuff is talking about North America. China, actually pretty good quarter. POS is running well. R&R there looks solid.

Our teams drove strong sales and profit gains in the first quarter as the home products market continued to grow at the pace that we expected. Our core businesses performed well across all segments, and we remained focused on driving profitable growth. Based on the solid first quarter performance, the momentum we have inside of our businesses and our recent share repurchases, we're increasing our full year EPS outlook. 
Let me first spend some time on our view of the U.S. home products market. Next, I'll provide my perspective on our business performance in the first quarter. Lee will then provide more details on our first quarter performance and 2016 outlook. 
Starting with our view of the U.S. home products market. In the first quarter, the market for our home products continue to grow at the pace that we expected it would. We estimate that repair and remodel activity grew over 5% and new construction grew low double digits. Repair and remodel activity remains steady, with consumers continuing to demonstrate an appetite for more on trend styling, product differentiation and project complexity. We see the impact of these trends in the improving mix across our categories. As anticipated, new construction demand is growing at a low double-digit rate, and we expect single family to grow faster than multifamily as single-family entry level activities are beginning to accelerate. 
Additionally, we saw added strength for more days of good weather in the first quarter, and more broadly, our basket of near-term indicators point to stronger underlying demand and continued market momentum as we head into the busier seasons of the year for home products. In fact, we think there could be some upside to market growth assumptions as R&R and new construction demand look strong, financing at affordable rates is more accessible, and builders and contractors seemed to be making progress on attracting more labor into the industry. 
In spite of these positive indicators, we think it's too early to revise our full year market outlook higher. So our overall assumption remains that the U.S. home products market, which impacts 70% of our sales, grows at a combined 6% to 7% rate for the full year 2016. However, we are closely monitoring market activity as we move through the spring season, and we will determine any further upside to our market assumptions as the year unfolds. Within the overall assumption, the pace of repair and remodel demand is assumed to grow at around 5% rate and new home construction is assumed to grow around 10%. 
Now let me provide some perspective on our business performance. For the first quarter, sales increased 16% in total and 20% for our U.S. home products businesses. Importantly, total company operating margin increased 180 basis points to 9.5%, with solid performance across all operating segments. 
Starting with our Cabinet segment, we continue to follow a disciplined strategy focused on profitable growth. Our consistent pace of product innovation and our high levels of reliable service to our channel partners continue to drive strong performance. In the first quarter, our overall cabinet sales were up 34% over the prior year and increased 12%, excluding Norcraft acquisition, with broad growth across all channels. Specifically, sales in our largest channel, dealers, grew 62% and 16%, excluding Norcraft acquisition. Our share gains are coming from our new construction product lines in this channel, and deeper multiline relationships with existing customers. We're beginning to cross-sell more of our product lines across our recently expanded dealer network. 
Our home center in-stock cabinets and vanity sales grew mid-single digits due largely to sell-through of new programs and product upgrades that we launched last year. Our Cabinet team has been focused on partnering with our customers to consistently balance inventory levels with production to further enhance service and manufacturing efficiency. The remaining 25% of our Cabinets business, which includes home service, semi-custom, builder direct in select markets in Canada, grew strong double digits. We are disciplined in our approach in these segments as we focus on where we can partner with customers to capture profitable growth. With our focused approach, we grew share in these segments and drove strong margin improvement. We are especially pleased with our home center special order business where our partnership approach is working well and driving nice growth. 
The Norcraft acquisition is on track, cost savings are running ahead of initial projections, we are adding capabilities, and we're beginning to see some sales benefits as well. It's a wonderful combination and the teams are working well together. Overall for Cabinets, we continue to execute well across multiple facets of a complex category. Our plants are increasingly more efficient and we are pleased we added capacity when we did to handle the growth that is now being realized. 
The front end of the business are performing particularly well as we built share in the most attractive segments of the market by deepening our partnerships with dealers, home centers and builders. The impact of our consistent execution can be seen in our share gains, our stronger mix and our improving margins. 
For our Plumbing segment, sales were up 2% for the quarter with solid mix and strong operating margin. Sales increased 6%, excluding the negative impact of currency and some channel inventory reductions by select wholesale and retail customers who drew down inventory in the quarter as we expected. We remain on track for our Plumbing sales to increase mid- to high single digits for the full year. 
In the first quarter, POS growth remained [ph] at mid single digits across U.S. wholesale and retail. So far in the second quarter, customer orders are running ahead of POS levels and we have a number of product introductions that are flowing into the market, coupled with investments we have made in showroom displays and marketing partners. Across our markets, we continue to see consumers trade up and our mix improve as innovation and design, finish and function attract consumers who trust our brand. 
In the coming quarters, we have a strong lineup of new products, which include additional Magnetix easy docking/easy releasing showerheads, pull-down and pull-up faucets with Reflex center, Kendall, Glenshire and Kinzel lines and new [indiscernible] and Dartmoor bath suites, targeting builders and wholesale showrooms. 
Sales in Canada were down low single digits to the prior year, but were up high single digits, excluding the negative impact of currency. China sales increased low single digits versus prior year, but were up mid-single digits in local currency, driven primarily by our retail stores and e-commerce. We remain optimistic about both our long-term business model in China and the growth potential and are encouraged by their R&R activity that we're seeing. 
Doors reported sales were up 13% for the quarter. Total products against our sales growth driven by gains in both new construction and retail. Mix continued to improve, with consumers more frequently choosing our decorative glass designs and premium upgrades like our recently launched Classic-Craft doors that capitalize on the growing trend toward taller doors and wider openings. In addition to innovative new products, Therma-Tru is benefiting from last year's rollout of a refresh retail strategy that includes an enhanced product lineup, simpler, more intuitive displays and better sales support for our customers associates. And in wholesale, we continue to benefit from strong new construction placements and our enhanced distribution in the Western United States. 
In Security segment, sales increased 1% from the prior year quarter and were up approximately 3.5%, excluding the negative impact of currency and exited Sentry product lines. The growth was driven by mid-single-digit increases in both Master Lock U.S. retail and U.S. commercial. Further increases were somewhat offset by the planned exit of some less profitable SentrySafe product lines as part of the broader Sentry integration. 
We continue to be excited about the opportunities we see between our Master Lock and Sentry businesses over the next few years, and the integration of Sentry into Master Lock is on track to be completed this summer. So to recap the quarter, results were strong. We again executed well in the U.S. home products market, but it's continuing to grow as we expected. Our teams are delivering profitable growth on that momentum. 
Before I wrap up, let me comment on our efforts to drive long-term growth. We continue to believe that we can create meaningful incremental shareholder value by using our strong cash flow and balance sheet to make strategic acquisitions, repurchase our shares and increase our dividend. Right now, we're busy evaluating a healthy pipeline of potential acquisitions. We're assessing a number of opportunities. And while we cannot guarantee success in any one situation, I'm encouraged with the number of things we're looking at and the quality of these businesses. Meanwhile, on the first quarter, we're again successful at repurchasing some of our shares at very attractive prices. It's important to note that we repurchased our shares as part of a process, which highlights when a significant disconnect is occurring between the equity markets valuation and our expected long-term business performance. Over the next 3 years, we continue to believe that we have the potential to deploy more than $2 billion to drive incremental growth and shareholder value. 
To sum up, the demand for our home products remain strong as we expected. And we continue to grow faster than our market. Our strong brands, management teams and capital structure provide flexibility to both focus on profitable organic growth and drive incremental shareholder value with our balance sheet and strong free cash flow. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Lee, who will review our financial performance and provide detail in our increased EPS outlook for 2016."

As Brian mentioned, to best reflect ongoing business performance, the majority of my comments will focus on income before charges and gains from continuing operations. Let me start with our first quarter results. Sales were $1.1 billion, up",972,"Thanks, Chris. As Brian mentioned, to best reflect ongoing business performance, the majority of my comments will focus on income before charges and gains from continuing operations. Let me start with our first quarter results. Sales were $1.1 billion, up 16% from a year ago. As Chris mentioned, sales increased 20% for our U.S. home products businesses. Consolidated operating income for the quarter was $105 million, up 43% or $32 million compared to the same quarter last year. EPS were $0.39 for the quarter versus $0.28 the same quarter last year, increasing nearly 40%, and we're ahead of plan due to more days of good weather, timing of expenses and recent share repurchases. 
Now let me provide more color on segment results. Our Cabinet sales were $550 million, up $139 million or 34% versus the prior year quarter. Norcraft added $89 million of the sales growth. Dealer sales were $273 million and increased 62% from the prior year. In-stock cabinets and vanity sales of $110 million increased 6%. The remaining sales for home center semi-custom, builder direct and Canada increased 23%, excluding the negative impact of approximately $4 million from Canadian currency. 
Operating income for the Cabinet segment nearly tripled, increasing $24 million over the prior year quarter, with Norcraft adding $5 million of the increase. Operating margin for the quarter doubled to 6.8%. Operating leverage, excluding Norcraft, was 37% as our recently added capacity continues to become more efficient. For the full year, we continue to expect an operating margin approaching 11%, compared to 9% in 2015. 
Turning to Plumbing, sales for the first quarter were $339 million, up $5 million or 2%, led by U.S. retail and wholesale and China. Excluding the negative impact of currency of $6 million and U.S. channel inventory reductions, total Plumbing sales increased approximately 6%, Canadian sales increased 8% and China sales increased 6%. Operating income increased $7 million to $72 million, up 11%. Operating margin for the segment was 21.2%, up 180 basis points from the prior year quarter. For the full year 2016, operating margin could be above 20%. Door sales were $94 million, up $11 million or 13% from the prior year quarter. Operating income increased $5 million and operating margin for the segment was 4.5%. 
Full year operating margin for the segment could be at least 11%. Security sales were $124 million in the first quarter, up 1% to the prior year and up approximately 3.5%, excluding the negative impact of currency of $1 million and the planned exit of less profitable SentrySafe product lines as part of the broader Sentry integration. Segment operating income increased to $12 million and the segment operating margin was 9.3%, up 120 basis points from the prior year. 
To sum up consolidated first quarter performance, sales increased 16% and EPS was ahead of plan at $0.39. Our total company operating margin was 9.5%, up 180 basis points from the prior year, with an incremental margin, excluding acquisitions of 40%, which put us on track to reach our long-term goal of approaching 15% operating margin when the housing market returns to steady state. 
Before turning to the balance sheet, let me comment on the cumulative impact of currency. The strength in U.S. dollar reduced our total first quarter sales by approximately $11 million, with Canada being the primary source. EPS impact was around $0.01. We expect to continue to experience headwinds from currency until the second half of the year. 
Now turning to the balance sheet. On March 31, balance sheet remains solid with cash of $254 million, debt of $1.6 billion and our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage is 2x. By year-end, we expect leverage to be about 1.4x. We currently have $450 million drawn on our $975 million revolving credit facility as a result of recent share repurchases. 
In the first quarter, we repurchased more than 7.6 million shares for approximately $363 million. The share repurchases positively impacted first quarter EPS by $0.01 and could provide an incremental $0.06 of EPS for the full year 2016 and $0.02 in the first quarter of 2017. At an average purchase price of $47.43, we already see a significant return on the first quarter share repurchases. And we have $285 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization. 
Turning last to the details of our outlook for 2016. While our basket of market indicators is biased to the upside, we continue to assume 6% to 7% U.S. home products market growth and total global market growth of 5% to 6%, with share gains and additional second quarter sales from the Norcraft acquisition. We continue to expect full year 2016 sales to increase 10% to 12% compared to 2015. However, we've increased our full year EPS outlook based on our recent share repurchases and our strong first quarter performance. Our outlook for 2016 EPS is now in the range of $2.50 to $2.60, with the midpoint reflecting a 23% increase over the prior year. 
We continue to expect 2016 free cash flow to be $350 million to $375 million, with conversion rate of over 90%. The annual EPS outlook includes the following assumptions: Interest expense of around $50 million; a tax rate of 33%; average fully diluted shares of approximately $157 million; a positive impact from commodity cost that will partially offset both the negative impact from currency in the first half of 2016 and a double-digit increase in health care cost. 
In summary, we're off to a strong start to 2016. First quarter market growth was as expected and we delivered strong sales and profit growth. We were also able to again opportunistically repurchase shares at attractive prices and we remain focused on using our balance sheet and cash flow to drive incremental shareholder value through acquisitions and share repurchases. 
I will now pass the call back to Brian."

So I think we're on track, as we've said, to 15% operating margin at city state, making good progress against that. And kind of, I'd say, the other theme for the year is keeping up with the growth. We see good indicators for the balance of the year, potentially some upside to what we've put out there as our forecast for the total year. We'll see after the spring season where we come in, but things look good. I mean, the market looks very healthy. There's a lot of demand out there both R&R and new construction.

And so we foresee deploying some capital this year in M&A, and I think that -- I can't predict kind of how many of those or how much. On the repurchase side, we look at this continuously running internal returns against our plan. And our plan isn't just kind of a static plan, it's our plan in light of where we see the underlying demand on the market. And when there's a significant misalignment, it's an opportunistic situation. And that's exactly what we saw in January and February, was a misalignment there between the underlying demand, driving our R&R market, driving new construction, new orders that we were seeing come in and where the equity values were. So it was a very good time. Not that very different from summer of 2014, we did the same thing. In 2014, we bought back 400 million plus in shares in a similar circumstance where we moved out versus demand and saw a similar disconnect. So that's, in a nutshell, that's kind of what drove that. Lee, you can comment on the share count for the year."

That's a nice mix. If we can do that going forward, that would be great. If we have different opportunities on share repurchase, we can do that. So I think the key here is flexibility. We have a lot of capital, and it's just being opportunistic. I think Chris is always very clear, our major goal is just driving incremental value and maximizing that.

Permits for the whole quarter in single family up 14%, starts for the quarter were up 22%. There's a little bit longer construction cycle, but total units under construction, up for the quarter, like 19%. Purchase finance applications, up 18%. So those are big numbers, I mean, relative to where we've been. And so if we're lagging a quarter or 2, that should turn into some more significant demand coming into late second quarter and into the second half. So that's where I'd see that variability. It's got to play through yet, and the reason we haven't factored that into everything we're talking about, guidance yet is let's see it keep flowing. And if building gets backed up, not just new construction but R&R gets backed up on labor and it will flow as good, but -- so keeping pace with it, there really could be some additional tailwind behind us coming into the second half of the year. I'd say, builders and R&R contractors are doing a better job on getting labor. If you look at the latest employment reports, construction jobs up 7%, 8% in residential construction labor. So that's running ahead of overall employment, which is only up 2% plus. So we're doing a nice job of finding labor that's out there. But with this kind of demand coming through the system, they got to -- we got to keep that up. So I say it's -- let's see how it unfolds, but boy, those looks like pretty good numbers relative to what we've seen over the last few years."

As I said earlier, kind of North, Northeast, Midwest was a bit better than it had been over the last couple of winters. But it was a lot of things and was pretty widespread, and it really reflected a lot of -- we saw a lot of activity in the fourth quarter coming in the first quarter. A lot of showroom activity coming through our dealer base. We got a big dealer base, so we got 5,500 dealer customers. So when we say, ""Hey, we see some pretty good activity coming through, we tend to believe it."" And so that was happening in the fourth quarter and I think that activity started to flow through in the first quarter and should continue second quarter and through the balance of the year. So it was pretty widespread. The mix, as I said, was driven by continuous pace of new product. Consumers are trading up, so they are buying our new products. It's attractive product and it's on trend. And I just think it's a trend we've seen flow through the business, but that definitely helps if you look at kind of total growth for the year."

Certainly, our Moen business has always been a solid North American as well as, obviously, China business and Therma-Tru strong Northeast historically. But we did a lot to expand out West in terms of distribution, and so that business is really a national U.S. business across. So I think where we had opportunities to expand West, we have. And I like the balance of the business. I don't see any part of the market that we're not capturing that's growing. It's coming on the R&R side. New construction is growing in certain parts of the market, we'll be there and we'll grow. In terms of Texas, we talked a little bit last time about kind of the oil patch, no more than 5%. Interestingly, in our Door business, we've actually seen some growth down there because we've expanded some distribution. So the Door business is actually up in Texas. So we're growing faster there than we are in some other parts of the country. I don't think we've seen anything really extraordinary. And I'm sure it's growing faster in our other businesses in cabinets or faucets in Texas relative to the rest of the country, but we haven't seen it. In the first quarter, we didn't fall off to any extraordinary extent."

In terms of overall demand, it's kind of the same -- seeing some of the same dynamics in mix. As we've -- as I talked about in Cabinets, where we are getting the advantage that we're bringing out richer mix products, new products, higher price points. We're seeing consumers trade up both on new construction and R&R, and a lot of product we're bringing in is targeting to take advantage of that. So pretty healthy market overall. Most of it is just talking about North America. China, actually pretty good quarter. POS is running well. R&R, they look solid. The new construction direct to builders is flat, not down.

On the home center side, we've got a very good position there on special order and we think we picked up some share there. We've been very consistent. We talked in the past about promotions and we've been disciplined and consistent, and that's really resonating. So we bring new product in. We're really focused on service, and we're consistent in whatever we're doing on the promotional side. And that combination and work with the designers really seems to be resonating. So that's going well. And on the builder side, we talked about exiting in the West, some direct to builder business, but we didn't get out of the direct to builder business, we just focused on some good relationships east and southeast, and those are going well. So in that part of that market, we're picking up share there. So it's pretty deep across a lot, and it's a really complicated business, as a lot of the Cabinet guys talked about and as we talk about all the time. And we focus on getting all the complicated stuff right and we have a great team. And I'd say the people are really responsible for executing every day and get this stuff right. So I know it kind of sounds like it's not easy one thing to point to, but really it's like the conductor of an orchestra kind of getting everything to work right and that's what the advantage in our Cabinets guys do every day, is get all that right, and that's resulting in share gain. And I'd say, part of your question was '15 versus '16, I think we're going to continue to pick up share throughout the year. We're executing really well across all these channels and it's good environment and we see underlying demand across the whole thing. So we're having pretty good year in the Cabinets."

Our teams drove strong sales and profit gains in the first quarter as the home products market continued to grow at the pace that we expected. Our core businesses performed well across all segments, and we remained focused on driving profitable growth. Based on the solid first quarter performance, the momentum we have inside of our businesses and our recent share repurchases, we're increasing our full year EPS outlook. 
Let me first spend some time on our view of the U.S. home products market. Next, I'll provide my perspective on our business performance in the first quarter. Lee will then provide more details on our first quarter performance and 2016 outlook. 
Starting with our view of the U.S. home products market. In the first quarter, the market for our home products continue to grow at the pace that we expected it would. We estimate that repair and remodel activity grew over 5% and new construction grew low double digits. Repair and remodel activity remains steady, with consumers continuing to demonstrate an appetite for more on trend styling, product differentiation and project complexity. We see the impact of these trends in the improving mix across our categories. As anticipated, new construction demand is growing at a low double-digit rate, and we expect single family to grow faster than multifamily as single-family entry level activities are beginning to accelerate. 
Additionally, we saw added strength for more days of good weather in the first quarter, and more broadly, our basket of near-term indicators point to stronger underlying demand and continued market momentum as we head into the busier seasons of the year for home products. In fact, we think there could be some upside to market growth assumptions as R&R and new construction demand look strong, financing at affordable rates is more accessible, and builders and contractors seemed to be making progress on attracting more labor into the industry. 
In spite of these positive indicators, we think it's too early to revise our full year market outlook higher. So our overall assumption remains that the U.S. home products market, which impacts 70% of our sales, grows at a combined 6% to 7% rate for the full year 2016. However, we are closely monitoring market activity as we move through the spring season, and we will determine any further upside to our market assumptions as the year unfolds. Within the overall assumption, the pace of repair and remodel demand is assumed to grow at around 5% rate and new home construction is assumed to grow around 10%. 
Now let me provide some perspective on our business performance. For the first quarter, sales increased 16% in total and 20% for our U.S. home products businesses. Importantly, total company operating margin increased 180 basis points to 9.5%, with solid performance across all operating segments. 
Starting with our Cabinet segment, we continue to follow a disciplined strategy focused on profitable growth. Our consistent pace of product innovation and our high levels of reliable service to our channel partners continue to drive strong performance. In the first quarter, our overall cabinet sales were up 34% over the prior year and increased 12%, excluding Norcraft acquisition, with broad growth across all channels. Specifically, sales in our largest channel, dealers, grew 62% and 16%, excluding Norcraft acquisition. Our share gains are coming from our new construction product lines in this channel, and deeper multiline relationships with existing customers. We're beginning to cross-sell more of our product lines across our recently expanded dealer network. 
Our home center in-stock cabinets and vanity sales grew mid-single digits due largely to sell-through of new programs and product upgrades that we launched last year. Our Cabinet team has been focused on partnering with our customers to consistently balance inventory levels with production to further enhance service and manufacturing efficiency. The remaining 25% of our Cabinets business, which includes home service, semi-custom, builder direct in select markets in Canada, grew strong double digits. We are disciplined in our approach in these segments as we focus on where we can partner with customers to capture profitable growth. With our focused approach, we grew share in these segments and drove strong margin improvement. We are especially pleased with our home center special order business where our partnership approach is working well and driving nice growth. 
The Norcraft acquisition is on track, cost savings are running ahead of initial projections, we are adding capabilities, and we're beginning to see some sales benefits as well. It's a wonderful combination and the teams are working well together. Overall for Cabinets, we continue to execute well across multiple facets of a complex category. Our plants are increasingly more efficient and we are pleased we added capacity when we did to handle the growth that is now being realized. 
The front end of the business are performing particularly well as we built share in the most attractive segments of the market by deepening our partnerships with dealers, home centers and builders. The impact of our consistent execution can be seen in our share gains, our stronger mix and our improving margins. 
For our Plumbing segment, sales were up 2% for the quarter with solid mix and strong operating margin. Sales increased 6%, excluding the negative impact of currency and some channel inventory reductions by select wholesale and retail customers who drew down inventory in the quarter as we expected. We remain on track for our Plumbing sales to increase mid- to high single digits for the full year. 
In the first quarter, POS growth remained at mid single digits across U.S. wholesale and retail. So far in the second quarter, customer orders are running ahead of POS levels and we have a number of product introductions that are flowing into the market, coupled with investments we have made in showroom displays and marketing partners. Across our markets, we continue to see consumers trade up and our mix improve as innovation and design, finish and function attract consumers who trust our brand. 
In the coming quarters, we have a strong lineup of new products, which include additional Magnetix easy docking/easy releasing showerheads, pull-down and pull-up faucets with Reflex center, Kendall, Glenshire and Kinzel lines and new [indiscernible] and Dartmoor bath suites, targeting builders and wholesale showrooms. 
Sales in Canada were down low single digits to the prior year, but were up high single digits, excluding the negative impact of currency. China sales increased low single digits versus prior year, but were up mid-single digits in local currency, driven primarily by our retail stores and e-commerce. We remain optimistic about both our long-term business model in China and the growth potential and are encouraged by their R&R activity that we're seeing. 
Doors reported sales were up 13% for the quarter. Total products against our sales growth driven by gains in both new construction and retail. Mix continued to improve, with consumers more frequently choosing our decorative glass designs and premium upgrades like our recently launched Classic-Craft doors that capitalize on the growing trend toward taller doors and wider openings. In addition to innovative new products, Therma-Tru is benefiting from last year's rollout of our refreshed retail strategy that includes an enhanced product lineup, simpler, more intuitive displays and better sales support for our customers associates. And in wholesale, we continue to benefit from strong new construction placements and our enhanced distribution in the Western United States. 
In Security segment, sales increased 1% from the prior year quarter and were up approximately 3.5%, excluding the negative impact of currency and exited Sentry product lines. The growth was driven by mid-single-digit increases in both Master Lock U.S. retail and U.S. commercial. Further increases were somewhat offset by the planned exit of some less profitable SentrySafe product lines as part of the broader Sentry integration. 
We continue to be excited about the opportunities we see between our Master Lock and Sentry businesses over the next few years, and the integration of Sentry into Master Lock is on track to be completed this summer. So to recap the quarter, results were strong. We again executed well in the U.S. home products market, but it's continuing to grow as we expected. Our teams are delivering profitable growth on that momentum. 
Before I wrap up, let me comment on our efforts to drive long-term growth. We continue to believe that we can create meaningful incremental shareholder value by using our strong cash flow and balance sheet to make strategic acquisitions, repurchase our shares and increase our dividend. Right now, we're busy evaluating a healthy pipeline of potential acquisitions. We're assessing a number of opportunities. And while we cannot guarantee success in any one situation, I'm encouraged with the number of things we're looking at and the quality of these businesses. Meanwhile, on the first quarter, we're again successful at repurchasing some of our shares at very attractive prices. It's important to note that we repurchased our shares as part of a process, which highlights when a significant disconnect is occurring between the equity markets valuation and our expected long-term business performance. Over the next 3 years, we continue to believe that we have the potential to deploy more than $2 billion to drive incremental growth and shareholder value. 
To sum up, the demand for our home products remain strong as we expected. And we continue to grow faster than our market. Our strong brands, management teams and capital structure provide flexibility to both focus on profitable organic growth and drive incremental shareholder value with our balance sheet and strong free cash flow. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Lee, who will review our financial performance and provide detail on our increased EPS outlook for 2016."

As Brian mentioned, to best reflect ongoing business performance, the majority of my comments will focus on income before charges and gains from continuing operations. Let me start with our first quarter results. Sales were $1.1 billion, up 16% from a year ago. As Chris mentioned, sales increased 20% for our U.S. home products businesses. Consolidated operating income for the quarter was $105 million, up 43% or $32 million compared to the same quarter last year. EPS were $0.39 for the quarter versus $0.28 the same quarter last year, increasing nearly 40%, and we're ahead of plan due to more days of good weather, timing of expenses and recent share repurchases. 
Now let me provide more color on segment results. Our Cabinet sales were $550 million, up $139 million or 34% versus the prior year quarter. Norcraft added $89 million of the sales growth. Dealer sales were $273 million and increased 62% from the prior year. In-stock cabinets and vanity sales of $110 million increased 6%. The remaining sales for home center semi-custom, builder direct and Canada increased 23%, excluding the negative impact of approximately $4 million from Canadian currency. 
Operating income for the Cabinet segment nearly tripled, increasing $24 million over the prior year quarter, with Norcraft adding $5 million of the increase. Operating margin for the quarter doubled to 6.8%. Operating leverage, excluding Norcraft, was 37% as our recently added capacity continues to become more efficient. For the full year, we continue to expect an operating margin approaching 11%, compared to 9% in 2015. 
Turning to Plumbing, sales for the first quarter were $339 million, up $5 million or 2%, led by U.S. retail and wholesale and China. Excluding the negative impact of currency of $6 million and U.S. channel inventory reductions, total Plumbing sales increased approximately 6%, Canadian sales increased 8% and China sales increased 6%. Operating income increased $7 million to $72 million, up 11%. Operating margin for the segment was 21.2%, up 180 basis points from the prior year quarter. For the full year 2016, operating margin could be above 20%. Door sales were $94 million, up $11 million or 13% from the prior year quarter. Operating income increased $5 million and operating margin for the segment was 4.5%. 
Full year operating margin for the segment could be at least 11%. Security sales were $124 million in the first quarter, up 1% to the prior year and up approximately 3.5%, excluding the negative impact of currency of $1 million and the planned exit of less profitable SentrySafe product lines as part of the broader Sentry integration. Segment operating income increased to $12 million and the segment operating margin was 9.3%, up 120 basis points from the prior year. 
To sum up consolidated first quarter performance, sales increased 16% and EPS was ahead of plan at $0.39. Our total company operating margin was 9.5%, up 180 basis points from the prior year, with an incremental margin, excluding acquisitions of 40%, which put us on track to reach our long-term goal of approaching 15% operating margin when the housing market returns to steady state. 
Before turning to the balance sheet, let me comment on the cumulative impact of currency. The strength in U.S. dollar reduced our total first quarter sales by approximately $11 million, with Canada being the primary source. EPS impact was around $0.01. We expect to continue to experience headwinds from currency until the second half of the year. 
Now turning to the balance sheet. On March 31, balance sheet remains solid with cash of $254 million, debt of $1.6 billion and our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage is 2x. By year-end, we expect leverage to be about 1.4x. We currently have $450 million drawn on our $975 million revolving credit facility as a result of recent share repurchases. 
In the first quarter, we repurchased more than 7.6 million shares for approximately $363 million. The share repurchases positively impacted first quarter EPS by $0.01 and could provide an incremental $0.06 of EPS for the full year 2016 and $0.02 in the first quarter of 2017. At an average purchase price of $47.43, we already see a significant return on the first quarter share repurchases. And we have $285 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization. 
Turning last to the details of our outlook for 2016. While our basket of market indicators is biased to the upside, we continue to assume 6% to 7% U.S. home products market growth and total global market growth of 5% to 6%, with share gains and additional second quarter sales from the Norcraft acquisition. We continue to expect full year 2016 sales to increase 10% to 12% compared to 2015. However, we've increased our full year EPS outlook based on our recent share repurchases and our strong first quarter performance. Our outlook for 2016 EPS is now in the range of $2.50 to $2.60, with the midpoint reflecting a 23% increase over the prior year. 
We continue to expect 2016 free cash flow to be $350 million to $375 million, with conversion rate of over 90%. The annual EPS outlook includes the following assumptions: Interest expense of around $50 million; a tax rate of 33%; average fully diluted shares of approximately 157 million; a positive impact from commodity cost that will partially offset both the negative impact from currency in the first half of 2016 and a double-digit increase in health care cost. 
In summary, we're off to a strong start to 2016. First quarter market growth was as expected and we delivered strong sales and profit growth. We were also able to again opportunistically repurchase shares at attractive prices and we remain focused on using our balance sheet and cash flow to drive incremental shareholder value through acquisitions and share repurchases. 
I will now pass the call back to Brian."

So I think we're on track, as we've said, to 15% operating margin at steady state, making good progress against that. And kind of, I'd say, the other theme for the year is keeping up with the growth. We see good indicators for the balance of the year, potentially some upside to what we've put out there as our forecast for the total year. We'll see after the spring season where we come in, but things look good. I mean, the market looks very healthy. There's a lot of demand out there both R&R and new construction.

And so we foresee deploying some capital this year in M&A, and I think that -- I can't predict kind of how many of those or how much. On the repurchase side, we look at this continuously running internal returns against our plan. And our plan isn't just kind of a static plan, it's our plan in light of where we see the underlying demand on the market. And when there's a significant misalignment, it's an opportunistic situation. And that's exactly what we saw in January and February, was a misalignment there between the underlying demand, driving our R&R market, driving new construction, new orders that we were seeing come in and where the equity values were. So it was a very good time. Not that very different from summer of 2014, we did the same thing. In 2014, we bought back $400 million plus in shares in a similar circumstance where we moved out versus demand and saw a similar disconnect. So that's, in a nutshell, that's kind of what drove that.

That's a nice mix. If we could do that going forward, that would be great. If we have different opportunities on share repurchase, we can do that. So I think the key here is flexibility.

But I think it's kind of, as we look at it, it's probably 5% to 6% consistent, running throughout the year. I think where we'll see a little bit more upside is in single-family new construction. So if you look at kind overall activity there, you flow from orders, it looked like they were up kind of 12%, 13% first quarter. Permits for the whole quarter in single family up 14%, starts for the quarter were up 22%. There's a little bit longer construction cycle, but total units under construction, up for the quarter, like 19%. Purchase finance applications, up 18%. So those are big numbers, I mean, relative to where we've been. And so if we're lagging a quarter or 2, that should turn into some more significant demand coming into late second quarter and into the second half. So that's where I'd see that variability. It's got to play through yet, and the reason we haven't factored that into everything we're talking about or guidance yet is let's see it keep flowing. And if building gets backed up, not just new construction but R&R gets backed up on labor and it won't flow as good, but if they're keeping pace with it, there really could be some additional tailwind behind us coming into the second half of the year. I'd say, builders and R&R contractors are doing a better job on getting labor. If you look at the latest employment reports, construction jobs up 7%, 8% in residential construction labor. So that's running ahead of overall employment, which is only up 2% plus. So we're doing a nice job of finding labor that's out there. But with this kind of demand coming through the system, they got to -- we got to keep that up. So I say it's -- let's see how it unfolds, but boy, those looks like pretty good numbers relative to what we've seen over the last few years."

That will be more like mid to high. We're rolling new product in and that's coming end of the market now, and so we'll get some lift from that as well as overall demand. We looked just over the last 5 weeks, orders are running ahead of POS. So year's setting up strong. There was some inventory, a couple of our larger customers have both retail and wholesale coming into the year. We knew that they'd be taking that down throughout the quarter, which they did and then start bringing back up margin and we'll see that come back in April. In terms of overall demand, it's kind of the same -- seeing some of the same dynamics in mix. As we've -- as I talked about in Cabinets, where we are getting the advantage that we're bringing out richer mix products, new products, higher price points. We're seeing consumers trade up both on new construction and R&R, and a lot of product we're bringing in is targeting to take advantage of that. So pretty healthy market overall. Most of it is just talking about North America. China, actually pretty good quarter. POS is running well. R&R, they look solid. The new construction direct to builders is flat, not down. It's probably a little bit better than we might have thought. Doing well, retail, e-commerce there. POS, kind of high single digits on the retail, e-commerce side. It's actually pretty healthy relative to whatever he talks about what we might have expected so..."

We're getting share across accounts, we're going deeper into accounts, we brought new product in. We're kind of cross-pollinating between Norcraft product line, MBCI product line. That's really a cumulative affect of a number of things we've done over the years that's really positioning us well. On the home center side, we've got a very good position there on special order and we think we picked up some share there. We've been very consistent. We talked in the past about promotions and we've been disciplined and consistent, and that's really resonating. So we bring new product in. We're really focused on service, and we're consistent in whatever we're doing on the promotional side. And that combination and work with the designers really seems to be resonating. So that's going well. And on the builder side, we talked about exiting in the West, some direct to builder business, but we didn't get out of the direct to builder business, we just focused on some good relationships east and southeast, and those are going well. So in that part of that market, we're picking up share there. So it's pretty deep across a lot, and it's a really complicated business, as a lot of the Cabinet guys talk about and as we talk about all the time. And we focus on getting all the complicated stuff right and we have a great team. And I'd say the people are really what are responsible for executing every day and get this stuff right. So I know it kind of sounds like it's not easy one thing to point to, but really it's like the conductor of an orchestra kind of getting everything to work right and that's what the advantage in our Cabinets guys do every day, is get all that right, and that's resulting in share gain. And I'd say, part of your question was '15 versus '16, I think we're going to continue to pick up share throughout the year. We're executing really well across all these channels and it's good environment and we see underlying demand across the whole thing. So we're going to have a pretty good year in Cabinets."

Our teams drove strong sales and profit gains in the first quarter as the home products market continued to grow at the pace that we expected. Our core businesses performed well across all segments, and we remained focused on driving profitable growth. Based on the solid first quarter performance, the momentum we have inside of our businesses and our recent share repurchases, we're increasing our full year EPS outlook. 
Let me first spend some time on our view of the U.S. home products market. Next, I'll provide my perspective on our business performance in the first quarter. Lee will then provide more details on our first quarter performance and 2016 outlook. 
Starting with our view of the U.S. home products market. In the first quarter, the market for our home products continue to grow at the pace that we expected it would. We estimate that repair and remodel activity grew over 5% and new construction grew low double digits. Repair and remodel activity remains steady, with consumers continuing to demonstrate an appetite for more on trend styling, product differentiation and project complexity. We see the impact of these trends in the improving mix across our categories. As anticipated, new construction demand is growing at a low double-digit rate, and we expect single family to grow faster than multifamily as single-family entry level activities are beginning to accelerate. 
Additionally, we saw added strength for more days of good weather in the first quarter, and more broadly, our basket of near-term indicators point to stronger underlying demand and continued market momentum as we head into the busier seasons of the year for home products. In fact, we think there could be some upside to market growth assumptions as R&R and new construction demand look strong, financing at affordable rates is more accessible, and builders and contractors seemed to be making progress on attracting more labor into the industry. 
In spite of these positive indicators, we think it's too early to revise our full year market outlook higher. So our overall assumption remains that the U.S. home products market, which impacts 70% of our sales, grows at a combined 6% to 7% rate for the full year 2016. However, we are closely monitoring market activity as we move through the spring season, and we will determine any further upside to our market assumptions as the year unfolds. Within the overall assumption, the pace of repair and remodel demand is assumed to grow at around 5% rate and new home construction is assumed to grow around 10%. 
Now let me provide some perspective on our business performance. For the first quarter, sales increased 16% in total and 20% for our U.S. home products businesses. Importantly, total company operating margin increased 180 basis points to 9.5%, with solid performance across all operating segments. 
Starting with our Cabinet segment, we continue to follow a disciplined strategy focused on profitable growth. Our consistent pace of product innovation and our high levels of reliable service to our channel partners continue to drive strong performance. In the first quarter, our overall cabinet sales were up 34% over the prior year and increased 12%, excluding Norcraft acquisition, with broad growth across all channels. Specifically, sales in our largest channel, dealers, grew 62% and 16%, excluding Norcraft acquisition. Our share gains are coming from our new construction product lines in this channel, and deeper multiline relationships with existing customers. We're beginning to cross-sell more of our product lines across our recently expanded dealer network. 
Our home center in-stock cabinets and vanity sales grew mid-single digits due largely to sell-through of new programs and product upgrades that we launched last year. Our Cabinet team has been focused on partnering with our customers to consistently balance inventory levels with production to further enhance service and manufacturing efficiency. The remaining 25% of our Cabinets business, which includes home service, semi-custom, builder direct in select markets in Canada, grew strong double digits. We are disciplined in our approach in these segments as we focus on where we can partner with customers to capture profitable growth. With our focused approach, we grew share in these segments and drove strong margin improvement. We are especially pleased with our home center special order business where our partnership approach is working well and driving nice growth. 
The Norcraft acquisition is on track, cost savings are running ahead of initial projections, we are adding capabilities, and we're beginning to see some sales benefits as well. It's a wonderful combination and the teams are working well together. Overall for Cabinets, we continue to execute well across multiple facets of a complex category. Our plants are increasingly more efficient and we are pleased we added capacity when we did to handle the growth that is now being realized. 
The front end of the business are performing particularly well as we built share in the most attractive segments of the market by deepening our partnerships with dealers, home centers and builders. The impact of our consistent execution can be seen in our share gains, our stronger mix and our improving margins. 
For our Plumbing segment, sales were up 2% for the quarter with solid mix and strong operating margin. Sales increased 6%, excluding the negative impact of currency and some channel inventory reductions by select wholesale and retail customers who drew down inventory in the quarter as we expected. We remain on track for our Plumbing sales to increase mid- to high single digits for the full year. 
In the first quarter, POS growth remained at mid single digits across U.S. wholesale and retail. So far in the second quarter, customer orders are running ahead of POS levels and we have a number of product introductions that are flowing into the market, coupled with investments we have made in showroom displays and marketing partners. Across our markets, we continue to see consumers trade up and our mix improve as innovation and design, finish and function attract consumers who trust our brand. 
In the coming quarters, we have a strong lineup of new products, which include additional Magnetix easy docking/easy releasing showerheads, pull-down and pull-up faucets with Reflex center, Kendall, Glenshire and Kinzel lines and new [indiscernible] and Dartmoor bath suites, targeting builders and wholesale showrooms. 
Sales in Canada were down low single digits to the prior year, but were up high single digits, excluding the negative impact of currency. China sales increased low single digits versus prior year, but were up mid-single digits in local currency, driven primarily by our retail stores and e-commerce. We remain optimistic about both our long-term business model in China and the growth potential and are encouraged by their R&R activity that we're seeing. 
Doors reported sales were up 13% for the quarter. Total products against our sales growth driven by gains in both new construction and retail. Mix continued to improve, with consumers more frequently choosing our decorative glass designs and premium upgrades like our recently launched Classic-Craft doors that capitalize on the growing trend toward taller doors and wider openings. In addition to innovative new products, Therma-Tru is benefiting from last year's rollout of our refreshed retail strategy that includes an enhanced product lineup, simpler, more intuitive displays and better sales support for our customers associates. And in wholesale, we continue to benefit from strong new construction placements and our enhanced distribution in the Western United States. 
In Security segment, sales increased 1% from the prior year quarter and were up approximately 3.5%, excluding the negative impact of currency and exited Sentry product lines. The growth was driven by mid-single-digit increases in both Master Lock U.S. retail and U.S. commercial. Further increases were somewhat offset by the planned exit of some less profitable SentrySafe product lines as part of the broader Sentry integration. 
We continue to be excited about the opportunities we see between our Master Lock and Sentry businesses over the next few years, and the integration of Sentry into Master Lock is on track to be completed this summer. So to recap the quarter, results were strong. We again executed well in the U.S. home products market, but it's continuing to grow as we expected. Our teams are delivering profitable growth on that momentum. 
Before I wrap up, let me comment on our efforts to drive long-term growth. We continue to believe that we can create meaningful incremental shareholder value by using our strong cash flow and balance sheet to make strategic acquisitions, repurchase our shares and increase our dividend. Right now, we're busy evaluating a healthy pipeline of potential acquisitions. We're assessing a number of opportunities. And while we cannot guarantee success in any one situation, I'm encouraged with the number of things we're looking at and the quality of these businesses. Meanwhile, on the first quarter, we're again successful at repurchasing some of our shares at very attractive prices. It's important to note that we repurchased our shares as part of a process, which highlights when a significant disconnect is occurring between the equity markets valuation and our expected long-term business performance. Over the next 3 years, we continue to believe that we have the potential to deploy more than $2 billion to drive incremental growth and shareholder value. 
To sum up, the demand for our home products remain strong as we expected. And we continue to grow faster than our market. Our strong brands, management teams and capital structure provide flexibility to both focus on profitable organic growth and drive incremental shareholder value with our balance sheet and strong free cash flow. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Lee, who will review our financial performance and provide detail on our increased EPS outlook for 2016."

As Brian mentioned, to best reflect ongoing business performance, the majority of my comments will focus on income before charges and gains from continuing operations. Let me start with our first quarter results. Sales were $1.1 billion, up 16% from a year ago. As Chris mentioned, sales increased 20% for our U.S. home products businesses. Consolidated operating income for the quarter was $105 million, up 43% or $32 million compared to the same quarter last year. EPS were $0.39 for the quarter versus $0.28 the same quarter last year, increasing nearly 40%, and we're ahead of plan due to more days of good weather, timing of expenses and recent share repurchases. 
Now let me provide more color on segment results. Our Cabinet sales were $550 million, up $139 million or 34% versus the prior year quarter. Norcraft added $89 million of the sales growth. Dealer sales were $273 million and increased 62% from the prior year. In-stock cabinets and vanity sales of $110 million increased 6%. The remaining sales for home center semi-custom, builder direct and Canada increased 23%, excluding the negative impact of approximately $4 million from Canadian currency. 
Operating income for the Cabinet segment nearly tripled, increasing $24 million over the prior year quarter, with Norcraft adding $5 million of the increase. Operating margin for the quarter doubled to 6.8%. Operating leverage, excluding Norcraft, was 37% as our recently added capacity continues to become more efficient. For the full year, we continue to expect an operating margin approaching 11%, compared to 9% in 2015. 
Turning to Plumbing, sales for the first quarter were $339 million, up $5 million or 2%, led by U.S. retail and wholesale and China. Excluding the negative impact of currency of $6 million and U.S. channel inventory reductions, total Plumbing sales increased approximately 6%, Canadian sales increased 8% and China sales increased 6%. Operating income increased $7 million to $72 million, up 11%. Operating margin for the segment was 21.2%, up 180 basis points from the prior year quarter. For the full year 2016, operating margin could be above 20%. Door sales were $94 million, up $11 million or 13% from the prior year quarter. Operating income increased $5 million and operating margin for the segment was 4.5%. 
Full year operating margin for the segment could be at least 11%. Security sales were $124 million in the first quarter, up 1% to the prior year and up approximately 3.5%, excluding the negative impact of currency of $1 million and the planned exit of less profitable SentrySafe product lines as part of the broader Sentry integration. Segment operating income increased to $12 million and the segment operating margin was 9.3%, up 120 basis points from the prior year. 
To sum up consolidated first quarter performance, sales increased 16% and EPS was ahead of plan at $0.39. Our total company operating margin was 9.5%, up 180 basis points from the prior year, with an incremental margin, excluding acquisitions of 40%, which put us on track to reach our long-term goal of approaching 15% operating margin when the housing market returns to steady state. 
Before turning to the balance sheet, let me comment on the cumulative impact of currency. The strength in U.S. dollar reduced our total first quarter sales by approximately $11 million, with Canada being the primary source. EPS impact was around $0.01. We expect to continue to experience headwinds from currency until the second half of the year. 
Now turning to the balance sheet. On March 31, balance sheet remains solid with cash of $254 million, debt of $1.6 billion and our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage is 2x. By year-end, we expect leverage to be about 1.4x. We currently have $450 million drawn on our $975 million revolving credit facility as a result of recent share repurchases. 
In the first quarter, we repurchased more than 7.6 million shares for approximately $363 million. The share repurchases positively impacted first quarter EPS by $0.01 and could provide an incremental $0.06 of EPS for the full year 2016 and $0.02 in the first quarter of 2017. At an average purchase price of $47.43, we already see a significant return on the first quarter share repurchases. And we have $285 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization. 
Turning last to the details of our outlook for 2016. While our basket of market indicators is biased to the upside, we continue to assume 6% to 7% U.S. home products market growth and total global market growth of 5% to 6%, with share gains and additional second quarter sales from the Norcraft acquisition. We continue to expect full year 2016 sales to increase 10% to 12% compared to 2015. However, we've increased our full year EPS outlook based on our recent share repurchases and our strong first quarter performance. Our outlook for 2016 EPS is now in the range of $2.50 to $2.60, with the midpoint reflecting a 23% increase over the prior year. 
We continue to expect 2016 free cash flow to be $350 million to $375 million, with conversion rate of over 90%. The annual EPS outlook includes the following assumptions: Interest expense of around $50 million; a tax rate of 33%; average fully diluted shares of approximately 157 million; a positive impact from commodity cost that will partially offset both the negative impact from currency in the first half of 2016 and a double-digit increase in health care cost. 
In summary, we're off to a strong start to 2016. First quarter market growth was as expected and we delivered strong sales and profit growth. We were also able to again opportunistically repurchase shares at attractive prices and we remain focused on using our balance sheet and cash flow to drive incremental shareholder value through acquisitions and share repurchases. 
I will now pass the call back to Brian."

And so we foresee deploying some capital this year in M&A, and I think that -- I can't predict kind of how many of those or how much. On the repurchase side, we look at this continuously running internal returns against our plan. And our plan isn't just kind of a static plan, it's our plan in light of where we see the underlying demand on the market. And when there's a significant misalignment, it's an opportunistic situation. And that's exactly what we saw in January and February, was a misalignment there between the underlying demand, driving our R&R market, driving new construction, new orders that we were seeing come in and where the equity values were. So it was a very good time. Not that very different from summer of 2014, we did the same thing. In 2014, we bought back $400 million plus in shares in a similar circumstance where we moved out versus demand and saw a similar disconnect. So that's, in a nutshell, that's kind of what drove that. Lee, you can comment on the share count for the year."

I think the other just comment would be that if you look at what we've done through the end of '15, and we spent about $1.8 billion prior to this year, about $1.1 billion in acquisitions and about $550 million in share repurchases on an opportunistic basis, as Chris defined. That's a nice mix. If we could do that going forward, that would be great. If we have different opportunities on share repurchase, we can do that. So I think the key here is flexibility. We have a lot of capital, and it's just being opportunistic. I think Chris is always very clear, our major goal is just driving incremental value and maximizing that. So it's pretty flexible with us."

But I think it's kind of, as we look at it, it's probably 5% to 6% consistent, running throughout the year. I think where we'll see a little bit more upside is in single-family new construction. So if you look at kind overall activity there, you flow from orders, it looked like they were up kind of 12%, 13% first quarter. Permits for the whole quarter in single family up 14%, starts for the quarter were up 22%. There's a little bit longer construction cycle, but total units under construction, up for the quarter, like 19%. Purchase finance applications, up 18%. So those are big numbers, I mean, relative to where we've been. And so if we're lagging a quarter or 2, that should turn into some more significant demand coming into late second quarter and into the second half. So that's where I'd see that variability. It's got to play through yet, and the reason we haven't factored that into everything we're talking about or guidance yet is let's see it keep flowing. And if building gets backed up, not just new construction but R&R gets backed up on labor and it won't flow as good, but if they're keeping pace with it, there really could be some additional tailwind behind us coming into the second half of the year. I'd say, builders and R&R contractors are doing a better job on getting labor. If you look at the latest employment reports, construction jobs up 7%, 8% in residential construction labor. So that's running ahead of overall employment, which is only up 2% plus. So we're doing a nice job of finding labor that's out there. But with this kind of demand coming through the system, they got to -- we got to keep that up. So I say it's -- let's see how it unfolds, but boy, those looks like pretty good numbers relative to what we've seen over the last few years."

So our Aristokraft product line saw some pretty good growth overall as well as to the semi-custom and premium lines that go into that builder business. The remodel business looks strong. As I said earlier, kind of North, Northeast, Midwest was a bit better than it had been over the last couple of winters. But it was a lot of things and was pretty widespread, and it really reflected a lot of -- we saw a lot of activity in the fourth quarter coming in the first quarter. A lot of showroom activity coming through our dealer base. We got a big dealer base, so we got 5,500 dealer customers. So when we say, ""Hey, we see some pretty good activity coming through,"" we tend to believe it. And so that was happening in the fourth quarter and I think that activity started to flow through in the first quarter and should continue second quarter and through the balance of the year. So it was pretty widespread. The mix, as I said, was driven by continuous pace of new product. Consumers are trading up, so they are buying our new products. It's attractive product and it's on trend. And I just think it's a trend we've seen flow through the business, but that definitely helps if you look at kind of total growth for the year."

Certainly, our Moen business has always been a solid North American as well as, obviously, China business and Therma-Tru strong Northeast historically. But we did a lot to expand out West in terms of distribution, and so that business is really a national U.S. business across. So I think where we had opportunities to expand West, we have. And I like the balance of the business. I don't see any part of the market that we're not capturing that's growing. It's coming on the R&R side. New construction is growing in certain parts of the market, we'll be there and we'll grow. In terms of Texas, we talked a little bit last time about kind of the oil patch, no more than 5%. Interestingly, in our Door business, we've actually seen some growth down there because we've expanded some distribution. So the Door business is actually up in Texas. So we're growing faster there than we are in some other parts of the country. I don't think we've seen anything really extraordinary. And I'm sure it's growing faster in our other businesses in cabinets or faucets in Texas relative to the rest of the country, but we haven't seen it.

In terms of overall demand, it's kind of the same -- seeing some of the same dynamics in mix. As we've -- as I talked about in Cabinets, where we are getting the advantage that we're bringing out richer mix products, new products, higher price points. We're seeing consumers trade up both on new construction and R&R, and a lot of product we're bringing in is targeting to take advantage of that. So pretty healthy market overall. Most of it is just talking about North America. China, actually pretty good quarter. POS is running well. R&R, they look solid. The new construction direct to builders is flat, not down.

That's really a cumulative effect of a number of things we've done over the years that's really positioning us well. On the home center side, we've got a very good position there on special order and we think we picked up some share there. We've been very consistent. We talked in the past about promotions and we've been disciplined and consistent, and that's really resonating. So we bring new product in. We're really focused on service, and we're consistent in whatever we're doing on the promotional side. And that combination and work with the designers really seems to be resonating. So that's going well. And on the builder side, we talked about exiting in the West, some direct to builder business, but we didn't get out of the direct to builder business, we just focused on some good relationships east and southeast, and those are going well. So in that part of that market, we're picking up share there. So it's pretty deep across a lot, and it's a really complicated business, as a lot of the Cabinet guys talk about and as we talk about all the time. And we focus on getting all the complicated stuff right and we have a great team. And I'd say the people are really what are responsible for executing every day and get this stuff right. So I know it kind of sounds like it's not easy one thing to point to, but really it's like the conductor of an orchestra kind of getting everything to work right and that's what the advantage in our Cabinets guys do every day, is get all that right, and that's resulting in share gain. And I'd say, part of your question was '15 versus '16, I think we're going to continue to pick up share throughout the year. We're executing really well across all these channels and it's good environment and we see underlying demand across the whole thing. So we're going to have a pretty good year in Cabinets."

Let me first spend some time on our view of the U.S. home products market. Next I'll provide my perspective on our business performance in the second quarter. We will then provide more details on our second quarter performance and the increased 2016 outlook. 
Starting with our view of the U.S. home products market. In the second quarter, the market for our home products continued to grow at the pace that we expected it would. We estimate that repair and remodel activity grew at roughly 5% to 5.5% and new construction grew low double digits. Repair and remodel activity continued to reflect consumers' demonstrated appetite for more on-trend styling, product differentiation and project complexity. This consumer demand continues to drive an improving mix across our categories. 
As expected, new construction demand continues to grow at a low double-digit rate, with single-family growing faster than multi-family, and single-family entry-level activity continues to improve.
Looking forward, our overall assumption remains that the U.S. home products market, which impacts 70% of our sales, grows at a combined 6% to 7% rate for the full year 2016. 
Our basket of near-term indicators for home products remains pointed to strong underlying demand, significant levels of construction activity and progress and continued market momentum as we head into the second half of the year. 
Now let me provide some perspective on our business performance. For the second quarter, our teams delivered strong sales and profit performance across all operating segments. Sales increased 11% in total and 12% for our U.S. home products businesses, and total company operating margin increased to 14.8%. 
Starting with our Cabinet segment. We continue to follow a disciplined strategy focused on profitable growth. Our consistent pace of product innovation and our high levels of reliable service to our channel partners continue to drive strong performance. 
In the second quarter, our overall cabinet sales were up 17% over the prior year and increased 7%, excluding Norcraft, and operating margins expanded to 12.9%. Specifically, sales in our largest channel, dealers, grew 30% and 11%, excluding Norcraft. Our share gains are coming from our new construction product lines in this channel and deeper multilane relationships with existing customers or cross-selling more of our product lines across our recently expanded dealer network. 
Our [indiscernible] cabinets and [indiscernible], which are sold through home centers, grew sales mid-single digits when adjusted for the comparison to last year's second quarter, where we had a major new vanity program launch, which required an inventory low throughout last summer. The sell-through of the new program and product upgrades that launched last year are performing well. Our cabinet team has been focused on partnering with our customers to consistently balance inventory levels with production to further enhance service and manufacturing efficiency in our stock cabinets and vanity programs.
The remaining 27% of our Cabinet business, which includes home center semicustom, builder direct and targeted markets in Canada, grew mid-teens. We're disciplined in our approach to these segments, as we focus on where we can partner with customers to capture profitable growth. With our focused approach, we grew share in these segments and drove strong margin improvement. We're especially pleased with our home center special order business, where our partnership approach is working well and driving growth at above-market rates. 
Overall, for Cabinet, we continue to execute and deliver strong sales and profit results. We're building share in the most attractive segments of the market by deepening our partnerships with dealers, home centers and builders. And our plants are increasingly more efficient. Our new product introductions and program wins are helping us drive a rich number of price points in the market. The impact on our consistent execution can be seen in our share gains, our stronger mix and our improving margins. 
For our Plumbing segment, sales were up 6% for the quarter, driven primarily by strength in the U.S. wholesale channel and China, with solid mix and strong operating margin. Across our markets, we continue to see consumers trade up and our mix improve, as innovation and design, finish and function attract consumers who trust our brand. 
As we look out to the second half of the year, our growth should benefit from incremental marketing spend as well as more focus on recently launched products, including additional easy docking, easy releasing showerheads, new glide and Dartmoor bath suites and new bathroom faucets with microbe and antimicrobial finish in our handling line. 
Organic sales in Canada were up high single digits to the prior year. China sales increased high single digits versus the prior year but were up double digits in local currency, driven by our direct-to-builder efforts, our Moen-branded retail stores and a rapidly expanding e-commerce marketplace. 
China's growth in new construction is picking up again, and we're also encouraged by the level of R&R activity that we are seeing. 
Door's reported sales were up 9% for the quarter. Door products against our sales growth with gains in both wholesale, which was up double digits, and at retail, which was up mid-single digits. Therma-Tru continues to benefit from the rollout of our refreshed retail strategy that includes an enhanced product lineup, simpler, more intuitive displays and better sales support for our customers' associates. In our wholesale, we continue to benefit from strong new construction placements and our enhanced distribution in the southern and western U.S.
In the Security segment, sales increased 6% from the prior year quarter and were up approximately 8%, excluding the negative impact of currency and the planned exit of some less profitable SentrySafe product lines as part of the broader Sentry integration. Growth was driven by increases in Master Lock U.S. retail and U.S. commercial and strong growth in international, particularly in Asia. 
The integration of SentrySafe into Master Lock is now behind us, with only a few logistics changes left. We can now begin to ramp our century sales efforts, as our new production comes online. We continue to be excited about the opportunities we see between our Master Lock and Sentry businesses over the next few years. 
So to recap the quarter, our results were strong and broad across all segments. We again executed well in the U.S. home products market that is continuing to grow as expected. Our teams are consistently leveraging that market momentum to deliver profitable growth. 
Before I wrap up, let me comment on our efforts to drive long-term growth. We continue to believe that we can create meaningful incremental shareholder value by using our strong cash flow and balance sheet, to make strategic acquisitions, repurchase our shares and increase our dividend. Right now we are busy evaluating a healthy pipeline of potential acquisitions. We're assessing a number of opportunities. And while we cannot guarantee success in any one situation, we believe we will complete some transactions over the next 6 to 12 months. 
Over the next 3 years, we continue to believe that we have the potential to deploy more than $2 billion to drive incremental growth and shareholder value.
To sum up, the demand for our home products remains strong, as we expected, and we continue to grow faster than our market. Importantly, our strong brands, management teams and capital structure provide flexibility to both focus on profitable organic growth and drive incremental shareholder value with our balance sheet and strong free cash flow. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Lee, who will review our financial performance and provide detail on our increased EPS outlook for 2016."
33174798,369553624,1014241,"Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2016",2016-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Fortune Brands Innovations, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Chris. As Brian mentioned, to best reflect ongoing business performance, the majority of my comments will focus on income before charges and gains from continuing operations. Let me start with our second quarter results. Sales were $1.3 billion,",1052,"Thanks, Chris. As Brian mentioned, to best reflect ongoing business performance, the majority of my comments will focus on income before charges and gains from continuing operations. 
Let me start with our second quarter results. Sales were $1.3 billion, up 11% from a year ago, with organic growth of 6% across all segments. Consolidated operating income for the quarter was $192 million, up 27% or $41 million compared to the same quarter last year. Earnings per share were $0.82 for the quarter versus $0.59 the same quarter last year, increasing 39% or $0.23, with $0.18 driven by continued stronger operating performance and $0.05 from a lower tax rate.
Now let me provide more color on segment results. Our cabinet sales were $645 million, up $94 million or 17% versus the prior year quarter. Norcraft added $60 million of the sales growth. Dealer sales were $326 million and increased 30% from the prior year. In-stock cabinets and vanity sales of $130 million decreased 4%. However, last year's major vanity program win drove 25% sales growth in the second quarter of 2015. Excluding this prior year impact, inside cabinets and vanity sales increased 4%. 
Remaining sales for home center semicustom, builder direct and Canada increased 14%. Operating income for the Cabinet segment increased $27 million over the prior year quarter, with Norcraft adding $10 million of the increase. Operating margin for the quarter increased 260 basis points to 12.9%. Operating leverage, excluding Norcraft, was around 50%, as our recently added capacity continued to become more efficient and product and channel mix improved. For the full year, we expect an operating margin of around 11% compared to 9% in 2015.
Turning to Plumbing. Sales for the second quarter were $378 million, up $20 million or 6%, led by U.S. wholesale and China. Excluding the negative impact of currency, total plumbing sales increased approximately 7%, with organic Canadian sales increasing 7% and China sales increasing 14%. 
Operating income increased $13 million to $88 million, up 17%. Operating margin for this segment was 23.2%. For the full year 2016, operating margin is expected to be 20% to 21%, including incremental spending on marketing and product initiatives in the third quarter. 
Door sales were $128 million, up $10 million or 9% from the prior year quarter. Operating income increased 29%, with an operating margin of 15.3%. Full year operating margin for this segment is expected to be 11% to 12%. 
Security sales were $147 million in the second quarter, up 6% to the prior year and up approximately 8%, excluding the negative impact of currency and the planned exit of less profitable SentrySafe product lines as part of the broader Sentry integration. Segment operating income was $20 million, and the segment operating margin was 13.4%. We expect to exit 2016 at an operating margin run rate of 15%.
To sum up consolidated second quarter performance, sales increased 11% and EPS were ahead of plan at $0.82. Our total company operating margin was 14.8%, up 190 basis points from the prior year, with an incremental margin, excluding acquisitions, of over 50%. We're squarely on track to reach our goal of approaching 15% operating margin when the housing market returns to steady-state levels.
Before turning to the balance sheet, let me comment on the cumulative impact of currency. The strengthening in U.S. dollar reduced our total second quarter sales by approximately 1%, with Canada being the primary source. The EPS impact was around $0.01. Also, the lower tax rate of 28% in the quarter was due to the adoption of a new accounting standard that requires companies to reflect the tax benefit from stock-based compensation transactions in their tax rate and EPS. 
Turning to the balance sheet. In the second quarter, we amended our credit agreement. The duration of the credit facility has been extended to 2021. The revolver has been expanded to $1.25 billion, and the term loan has been eliminated. With the increased flexibility of this new credit facility, we're now better positioned to drive incremental growth with our balance sheet and cash flow. 
Our June 30 balance sheet remains solid, with cash of $279 million, debt of $1.6 billion and our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage is 1.8x. By year-end, we expect leverage to be about 1.4x, excluding any additional capital transactions. We currently have $540 million available under our new $1.25 billion revolver.
Turning last to the details of our outlook for 2016. Our market and sales assumptions for 2016 are unchanged. We continue to assume 6% to 7% U.S. home products market growth and total global market growth of 5% to 6%. Accordingly, we continue to expect full year 2016 sales to increase 10% to 12% compared to 2015. However, we've increased our full year EPS outlook based on continuing our strong operating margin performance and a lower annual tax rate. Our outlook for 2016 EPS is now in the range of $2.70 to $2.78, with the midpoint reflecting a 32% increase over the prior year. The $2.74 midpoint of our EPS outlook represents an increase of $0.19 over our previous midpoint of $2.55. Stronger than previously expected performance for the second quarter drove $0.02. And expected stronger performance, primarily in the fourth quarter, drove $0.04 of the increase. Stronger than previously expected performance in the third quarter will be offset by increased marketing and product spending to drive future growth. The lower tax rate drove $0.13 of the increase, $0.05 in the second quarter, $0.09 in the first half and $0.04 in the second half. We expect 2016 free cash flow to be around $400 million, with a conversion rate of over 90%. 
The annual EPS outlook includes the following assumptions: interest expense of around $50 million, a tax rate of approximately 31% in the second half of the year, the average fully diluted shares of approximately 158 million. 
In summary, we're set up for a strong 2016. Second quarter market growth was as expected, and we delivered strong sales and profit growth. Due to continuing strong growth and operating margins and a lower tax rate, we, again, increased our EPS outlook for the year, and we remain focused on using our balance sheet and cash flow to drive incremental shareholder value through acquisitions and share repurchases. 
I will now pass the call back to Brian."

So second half looks very different from a commodity perspective for us, but that's built into our guidance. I think what's driving Moen, the operating margins, we have very nice channel mix, with the wholesale business segment up 9% to 10%. We're getting some nice, continuous improvements in our business model there as we continue to get more efficient. And there was a little expense timing that will move from the second to the third. A little bit of that is part of that $0.03 in terms of the media campaign and the spending. But very strong margins, consistently strong. We can now afford in the second half to spend some of that back, still maintaining 20% to 21% margins and be positioned well for driving growth in the first half of next year through that ad spend."

On the R&R side of the market, I'd say that the mix is probably the best indicator that we're seeing across all product categories as consumers are spending more for projects, so that mix continues to improve across. It's been pretty consistent, really. I mean, for the first quarter, we saw some surge because of weather improvements, et cetera, but that continued through the second quarter. And really, we feel like the second half is going to be a continuation of what we saw in the second quarter on R&R. So that's pretty widespread strength. Keeping in mind, we have enormous dealer network in cabinets that we're seeing, big wholesale channels in Plumbing that we're seeing this kind of growth come through. Then on the construction side, I think we're optimistic about second half and '17, just given overall order rates, starts rates. And I'm not talking month-to-month. I'm talking kind of what does the first half total activity look like. We are through all of our builder relationships that everybody's busy. They're still looking for talent. They're still requiring land. And so there's just a good, steady drumbeat, which gives us the confidence in the business overall. And we're performing well against that. So our mix coming through really has to do with the channels that we're positioned against. We're positioned at the most attractive parts of the market with our channels. And then within those channels, we're really positioned against the product categories that offer the strongest growth and margins. So it's all of that together feels like a good strong continuation of what was a good start to the year."

In terms of valuations in the market, I think they're a bit kind of, in a couple of instances, spectrum, I think, where you see strong branded products, strong positions in the market. There's healthy expectations on value, but I think, given kind of what those franchises can deliver, it's probably worth it. And you can see where things can get done at that level. On the other end of the spectrum is companies that are more commodity parts of the market, I think, with maybe higher petitions that may be warranted. So kind of our framework has always been looking at categories where consumers are heavily involved, extending off of our existing platforms, so continuing to grow inside of our attractive positions. And we see a number of things. We're busy on a number of things right now that, we think, can contribute to that. So I don't think valuations have gotten kind of beyond where we feel comfortable.

We have come through a downturn, restructured, starting seeing volumes come owing over fixed cost base and within each of the businesses, strategically directed where we were going to focus areas where we could see more profitable growth. And so what you're seeing in the second quarter, really, is an extension of that. So on mix, stronger mix because we're focusing on the channels where you get stronger mix. Within those channels, we're focused on product categories that are delivering stronger mix. That played out in a strong way in the second quarter. Operating efficiencies, we've got very good leverage coming over our fixed cost base. We put some capacity in a couple of years ago. That capacity is operating very efficiently right now. And so we're just seeing that leverage come through. And then input costs, stable to a bit improved for the quarter. And that we expect to continue throughout the year. So I guess, we're just at a level where we are seeing that strong mix coming through, leveraging our fixed cost base in a consistent way. Our teams are operating very well and in terms of efficiency and continuous improvement. And then input costs look good.

First quarter was stronger than we, I think, most thought it would be. So I think, second quarter moved to an expected range. In terms of regional differences, I'd say, Midwest is strong. The South is strong. South Florida is probably bigger than the rest of the south, especially at the high end of that market. The West still looks strong. And then the East is good but not as strong as Midwest, South, excluding Florida and West. I'd say, in Texas, Houston's probably the market that's weaker than the rest, was tax essentially doing okay because it's recently diverse and [indiscernible] our business is positioned there, and we picked up some distribution in. The rest of Texas is actually performing pretty well. And so there's a few weaker spots in the market. And again, this is comping, in some cases, like South Florida was a very strong last year. So to the extent that it's a little weaker this year, it's because it's coming off of a very strong 2015.

As you're seeing -- now you're starting to see the turnover in existing housing start that prompts spending both before the home is sold and more so after the home is sold. And we're certainly seeing an acceleration there. Home values are rising. And as home values are rising, people get more comfortable putting money into the home. We're finally seeing refinancing, cash-out refinancing and home equity lines coming back. We really started to see that in a meaningful way in '15. It's continuing into '16. Low interest rates, so to the extent people are investing now in their home and borrowing to do that, it's pretty affordable. So I'd say, you roll all that together, you see a picture of a lot of data and kitchens and bathrooms, which is where that's the bread and butter of where we live. And people doing everything from a quick bathroom remodel to a wholesale kitchen and bathroom and everything in between. And so I think, in our own view is that carries on for a while, especially as new construction is trying to catch up but not quite there on the housing. So people are looking for existing housing to move into out of rental properties. And as I move in, they're investing in those properties. And we just got to see that as the consumers kind of moving through in aging housing stock and updating the look as they move in.

I think they moved through the home centers that moved through different categories and have been more careful in their management of inventory and we work with them kind of as they move down. So that impacts in-stock cabinets, vanities and impacts Plumbing, impacts Doors. But through all that, we've continued to have some very good wins. And so new business has come in. POS is strong. So it's, I guess, some headwind as you move through it. But to get to a new baselevel. And as long as we're winning with the consumer, our new products are coming in into the market, and there's good draw through in POS. We'll call out when the headwinds occur on inventory drawdowns and then help it tie it back out again. But I'd say, it hasn't hurt the business. I think they're being careful not to run stock too low so that it's not there. And our response times are good and getting better. So that to the extent that we have to rally because we've got some hot sellers and get inventory back in there, we're able to rise to it. So that combination, I think, you work through it, but I think we'll both come out in a very healthy place."

We did well in that part of the market. But we also were strong within retail and e-commerce. And so I think we're growing at least a little faster than the market. Market there is always hard to gauge. But there is a lot more activity now. On the new construction site, government reduced mortgage, down payment requirements, lowered mortgage rates, really trying to the prompt some activity, and that's generated some activity. But the other part of that market for us is, as they build these units, the haven't finished up the bathrooms and kitchens. And so consumers, as they're moving in, so as they're buying existing housing, that's when they're fitting of those kitchens and bathrooms. So year-to-date, home sales in China's up, like, 30%. So that market, just as sales are complete, there's not a cycle of kind of 6-plus months where they're shopping for to fit out their kitchens and bathrooms. And so we benefit from that. And then we're seeing more R&R activity as well. So we're concentrated more in Tier 1 and Tier 2, which is where we put our bets more heavily than Tier 3, Tier 4 markets. Where we're seeing that market you've all as retail continues to be important in 1 and 2, e-commerce is important there. But 3 or 4 -- Tiers 3 and 4 are more shifting to e-commerce and light retail. And so that's kind of where our mix goes. We continue to update our stores in our Tier 1, Tier 2 and try to get that mix right. So I'm happy with the way we're trying to evolve. Last year was a market was up and we continue to perform into all things we're doing in terms of upgrading the stores, upgrading the mix. And I think some of that is what we're seeing play through now. So it's a little bit like we do with our whole business through the downturn. Never stop working on our new product and never [indiscernible] even if the market gets a little sideways. And that's what we saw in China last year. And now, as the markets pick back up again, consumers are showing up, and we've got a good array of product there. Got the right locations in terms of retail properties. And our focus is strong on the e-commerce side of market. So things are working together. I like China long term. It can have surges and growth and then more plateau, but there's a huge R&R cycle that is going to come through China over the next 5, 7 years. Properties added over the last 15 years turned into a cycle of R&R and we're really good spot to break that out. So that's market I like."

Our teams drove strong sales and profit gains across all segments in the second quarter as the home products market continued to grow at the positive pace that we expected.
Our businesses remained focused on driving profitable growth, targeting the most attractive segments of our markets.
Based on solid the second quarter performance, the momentum we have inside of our businesses for the remainder of the year and the lower projected tax rate, we're increasing our full year EPS outlook.
Let me first spend some time on our view of the U.S. home products market. Next I'll provide my perspective on our business performance in the second quarter. We will then provide more details on our second quarter performance and increased 2016 outlook.
Starting with our view of the U.S. home products market. In the second quarter, the market for our home products continued to grow at the pace that we expected it would. We estimate that repair and remodel activity grew at roughly 5% to 5.5% and new construction grew low double digits. Repair and remodel activity continued to reflect consumers' demonstrated appetite for more on-trend styling, product differentiation and project complexity. This consumer demand continues to drive an improving mix across our categories.
As expected, new construction demand continues to grow at a low double-digit rate with single-family growing faster than multi-family, and single-family entry-level activity continues to improve.
Looking forward, our overall assumption remains that the U.S. home products market, which impacts 70% of our sales, grows at a combined 6% to 7% rate for the full year 2016.
Our basket of near-term indicators for home products remains pointed to strong underlying demand, significant levels of construction activity in progress and continued market momentum as we head into the second half of the year.
Now let me provide some perspective on our business performance. For the second quarter, our teams delivered strong sales and profit performance across all operating segments. Sales increased 11% in total and 12% for our U.S. home products businesses, and total company operating margin increased to 14.8%.
Starting with our Cabinet segment. We continue to follow a disciplined strategy focused on profitable growth. Our consistent pace of product innovation and our high levels of reliable service to our channel partners continue to drive strong performance.
In the second quarter, our overall Cabinet sales were up 17% over the prior year and increased 7%, excluding Norcraft, and operating margins expanded to 12.9%. Specifically, sales in our largest channel, dealers, grew 30% and 11%, excluding Norcraft. Our share gains are coming from our new construction product lines in this channel and deeper multilane relationships with existing customers or cross-selling more of our product lines across our recently expanded dealer network.
Our in-stock cabinets and vanities, which are sold through home centers, grew sales mid-single digits when adjusted for the comparison to last year's second quarter, where we had a major new vanity program launch, which required an inventory load throughout last summer. The sell-through of the new program and product upgrades that we launched last year are performing well. Our Cabinet team has been focused on partnering with our customers to consistently balance inventory levels with production to further enhance service and manufacturing efficiency in our stock cabinets and vanity programs.
The remaining 27% of our Cabinet business, which includes home center semi-custom, builder direct in targeted markets in Canada, grew mid-teens. We're disciplined in our approach to these segments as we focus on where we can partner with customers to capture profitable growth. With our focused approach, we grew share in these segments and drove strong margin improvement. We're especially pleased with our home center special order business, where our partnership approach is working well and driving growth at above-market rates.
Overall, for cabinets, we continue to execute and deliver strong sales and profit results. We're building share in the most attractive segments of the market by deepening our partnerships with dealers, home centers and builders. And our plants are increasingly more efficient. Our new product introductions and program wins are helping us drive [indiscernible] number of price points in the market. The impact of our consistent execution can be seen in our share gains, our stronger mix and our improving margins.
For our Plumbing segment, sales were up 6% for the quarter, driven primarily by strength in the U.S. wholesale channel and China with solid mix and strong operating margin. Across our markets, we continued to see consumers trade up and our mix improve as innovation and design, finish and function attract consumers who trust our brand.
As we look out to the second half of the year, our growth should benefit from incremental marketing spend as well as more focus on recently launched products, including additional Magnetix easy docking, easy releasing showerheads; [indiscernible], Via and Dartmoor bath suites; and new bathroom faucets with microbe and antimicrobial finish in our handling line.
Organic sales in Canada were up high single digits to the prior year. China sales increased high single digits versus the prior year, but were up double digits in local currency, driven by our direct-to-builder efforts, our Moen-branded retail stores and a rapidly expanding e-commerce marketplace.
China's growth in new construction is picking up again, and we're also encouraged by the level of R&R activity that we are seeing.
Doors reported sales were up 9% for the quarter. Door products against our sales growth with gains in both wholesale, which was up double digits, and at retail, which was up mid-single digits. Therma-Tru continues to benefit from the rollout of our refreshed retail strategy that includes an enhanced product lineup, simpler and more intuitive displays and better sales support for our customers' associates. And in wholesale, we continued to benefit from strong new construction placements and our enhanced distribution in the southern and western U.S.
In the security segment, sales increased 6% from the prior year quarter and were up approximately 8%, excluding the negative impact of currency and the planned exit of some less profitable SentrySafe product lines as part of the broader Sentry integration. Growth was driven by increases in Master Lock U.S. retail and U.S. commercial and strong growth in international, particularly in Asia.
The integration of SentrySafe into Master Lock is now behind us with only a few logistics changes left. We can now begin to ramp our Sentry sales efforts as our new production comes online. We continue to be excited about the opportunities we see between our Master Lock and Sentry businesses over the next few years.
So to recap the quarter, our results were strong and broad across all segments. We again executed well in the U.S. home products market that is continuing to grow as we expected. Our teams are consistently leveraging that market momentum to deliver profitable growth.
Before I wrap up, let me comment on our efforts to drive long-term growth. We continue to believe that we can create meaningful incremental shareholder value by using our strong cash flow and balance sheet to make strategic acquisitions, repurchase our shares and increase our dividend. Right now, we are busy evaluating a healthy pipeline of potential acquisitions. We're assessing a number of opportunities. And while we cannot guarantee success in any one situation, we believe we will complete some transactions over the next 6 to 12 months.
Over the next 3 years, we continue to believe that we have the potential to deploy more than $2 billion to drive incremental growth and shareholder value.
To sum up, the demand for our home products remains strong, as we expected, and we continue to grow faster than our market. Importantly, our strong brands, management teams and capital structure provide flexibility to both focus on profitable organic growth and drive incremental shareholder value with our balance sheet and strong free cash flow.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Lee, who will review our financial performance and provide detail on our increased EPS outlook for 2016."

Now let me provide more color on segment results. Our Cabinet sales were $645 million, up $94 million or 17% versus the prior year quarter. Norcraft added $60 million of the sales growth. Dealer sales were $326 million and increased 30% from the prior year. In-stock cabinets and vanity sales of $130 million decreased 4%. However, last year's major vanity program win drove 25% sales growth in the second quarter of 2015. Excluding this prior year impact, in-stock cabinets and vanity sales increased 4%. 
Remaining sales for home center semi-custom, builder direct and Canada increased 14%. Operating income for the Cabinet segment increased $27 million over the prior year quarter with Norcraft adding $10 million of the increase. Operating margin for the quarter increased 260 basis points to 12.9%. Operating leverage, excluding Norcraft, was around 50% as our recently added capacity continues to become more efficient and product and channel mix improved. For the full year, we expect an operating margin of around 11% compared to 9% in 2015.
Turning to Plumbing. Sales for the second quarter were $378 million, up $20 million or 6%, led by U.S. wholesale and China. Excluding the negative impact of currency, total Plumbing sales increased approximately 7% with organic Canadian sales increasing 7% and China sales increasing 14%.
Operating income increased $13 million to $88 million, up 17%. Operating margin for this segment was 23.2%. For the full year 2016, operating margin is expected to be 20% to 21%, including incremental spending on marketing and product initiatives in the third quarter.
Door sales were $128 million, up $10 million or 9% from the prior year quarter. Operating income increased 29% with an operating margin of 15.3%. Full year operating margin for this segment is expected to be 11% to 12%.
Security sales were $147 million in the second quarter, up 6% to the prior year and up approximately 8%, excluding the negative impact of currency and the planned exit of less profitable SentrySafe product lines as part of the broader Sentry integration. Segment operating income was $20 million and the segment operating margin was 13.4%. We expect to exit 2016 at an operating margin run rate of 15%.
To sum up consolidated second quarter performance, sales increased 11% and EPS were ahead of plan at $0.82. Our total company operating margin was 14.8%, up 190 basis points from the prior year, with an incremental margin, excluding acquisitions, of over 50%. We're squarely on track to reach our goal of approaching 15% operating margin when the housing market returns to steady-state levels.
Before turning to the balance sheet, let me comment on the cumulative impact of currency. The strengthening U.S. dollar reduced our total second quarter sales by approximately 1% with Canada being the primary source. The EPS impact was around $0.01. Also, the lower tax rate of 28% in the quarter was due to the adoption of a new accounting standard that requires companies to reflect the tax benefit from stock-based compensation transactions and their tax rate and EPS.
Turning to the balance sheet. In the second quarter, we amended our credit agreement. The duration of the credit facility has been extended to 2021. The revolver has been expanded to $1.25 billion, and the term loan has been eliminated. With the increased flexibility of this new credit facility, we're now better positioned to drive incremental growth with our balance sheet and cash flow.
Our June 30 balance sheet remains solid with cash of $279 million, debt of $1.6 billion, and our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage is 1.8x. By year-end, we expect leverage to be about 1.4x, excluding any additional capital transactions. We currently have $540 million available under our new $1.25 billion revolver.
Turning last to the details of our outlook for 2016. Our market and sales assumptions for 2016 are unchanged. We continue to assume 6% to 7% U.S. home products market growth and total global market growth of 5% to 6%. Accordingly, we continue to expect full year 2016 sales to increase 10% to 12% compared to 2015. However, we've increased our full year EPS outlook based on continuing our strong operating margin performance and a lower annual tax rate. Our outlook for 2016 EPS is now in the range of $2.70 to $2.78 with the midpoint reflecting a 32% increase over the prior year. The $2.74 midpoint of our EPS outlook represents an increase of $0.19 over our previous midpoint of $2.55. Stronger than previously expected performance for the second quarter drove $0.02. And expected stronger performance, primarily in the fourth quarter, drove $0.04 of the increase. Stronger than previously expected performance in the third quarter will be offset by increased marketing and product spending to drive future growth. The lower tax rate drove $0.13 of the increase; $0.05 in the second quarter, $0.09 in the first half and $0.04 in the second half. We expect 2016 free cash flow to be around $400 million with a conversion rate of over 90%.
The annual EPS outlook includes the following assumptions: interest expense of around $50 million, a tax rate of approximately 31% in the second half of the year, the average fully diluted shares of approximately 158 million.
In summary, we're set up for a strong 2016, second quarter market growth was as expected, and we delivered strong sales and profit growth. Due to continuing stronger growth and operating margins and a lower tax rate, we, again, increased our EPS outlook for the year, and we remain focused on using our balance sheet and cash flow to drive incremental shareholder value through acquisitions and share repurchases.
I will now pass the call back to Brian."

We had some benefits in the first half, but basically flat in the second half, and FX will be basically flat. So second half looks very different from a commodity perspective for us, but that's built into our guidance. I think what's driving Moen -- the operating margins, we had very nice channel mix with the wholesale business segment up 9% to 10%. We're getting some nice, continuous improvements in our business model there as we continue to get more efficient. And there was a little expense timing that will move from the second to the third. A little bit of that is part of that $0.03 in terms of the media campaign and the spending. But very strong margins, consistently strong. We can now afford, in the second half, to spend some of that back, still maintain 20% to 21% margins and be positioned well for driving growth in the first half of next year through that ad spend."

On the R&R side of the market, I'd say that the mix is probably the best indicator that we're seeing across all product categories as consumers are spending more per project, so the mix continues to improve across. It's been pretty consistent, really. I mean, first quarter, we saw some surge because of weather improvement, et cetera, but that continued through the second quarter. And really, we feel like the second half is going to be a continuation of what we saw in the second quarter in R&R. So that's pretty widespread strength keeping in mind we have enormous dealer network in cabinets that we're seeing, big wholesale channels in Plumbing that we're seeing this kind of growth come through. Then on the new construction side, I think we're optimistic about second half and '17 just given overall order rates, starts rates. And I'm not talking month-to-month, I'm talking kind of what does the first half total activity look like. We hear through all of our builder relationships that everybody's busy. They're still looking for talent. They're still requiring land. And so there's just a good, steady drumbeat, which gives us the confidence in the business overall, and we're performing well against that. So our mix coming through really has to do with the channels that we're positioned against. We're positioned at the most attractive parts of the market with our channels. And then within those channels, we're really positioned against the product categories that offer the strongest growth in margin. So it's all of that together feels like a good strong continuation of what was a good start to the year."

In terms of valuations in the market, I think they're a bit kind of, on a couple of instances, spectrum, I think, where you see strong branded products strong positions in the market. There's healthy expectations on value, but I think given kind of what those franchises can deliver, it's probably warranted, and you can see where things can get done at that level. On the other end of the spectrum, you see companies that are in more commodity parts of the market, I think, with maybe higher expectations than might be warranted. So kind of our framework has always been looking at categories where consumers are heavily involved, extending off of our existing platforms, so continuing to grow inside of our attractive positions. And we see a number of things. We're busy on a number of things right now that, we think, can contribute to that. So I don't think valuations have gotten kind of beyond where we feel comfortable.

We had come through the downturn, restructured, starting seeing volumes coming over our fixed cost base and within each of the businesses, strategically directed where we were going to focus in areas where we could see more profitable growth. And so what you're seeing in the second quarter, really, is an extension of that. So on mix, stronger mix because we're focusing on the channels where you get stronger mix. Within those channels, we're focused on product categories that are delivering stronger mix. That played out in a strong way in the second quarter. Operating efficiencies, we've got very good leverage coming over our fixed cost base. We put some capacity in a couple of years ago. That capacity is operating very efficiently right now. And so we're just seeing that leverage come through. And then input costs, stable to a bit improved for the quarter. And that, we expect to continue throughout the year. So I guess, we're just at a level where we are seeing that strong mix coming through, leveraging our fixed cost base in a consistent way.

On the retail side of the business, we're up against mid-teens comp from last year. We have rolled new products out, and there was some big load in. So the second quarter of last year was up really strong, so you're running against that. And so it's kind of low single digits on the retail side this year. So that's the math that averages that down. But if I look across wholesale for Moen, again, up strong single digits. China, very strong market right now. It's come back. Government's actually made some changes, policy-wise, to reignite the construction market. And we're seeing, on the R&R side in China, a lot of activity, which is a bit more stable relative to the government policy and everything else. And then Canada is holding up well. So I think across Moen, the one thing that -- as you look at the aggregate numbers, that you say gee, that's a little lighter than we might have thought, is the comp in retail against a very strong second quarter last year, which is good business on the shelf SKUs in the store today.

We then got our in-stock cabinets and vanities, another attractive part of the market. So that segment of the market probably not growing as fast, but the margins are strong there. So it's a good mix part of the business. And then we got the third part of the market that we are very specific about where we're playing. So that's special order in the home centers, that's builder direct and that's our Canadian business. And so there, we're just looking at where are the best places to play. So good mix there as we reoriented ourself, especially in builder direct, we're seeing some nice growth come through there. So when I say it's channel mix, it's really driving toward where we're seeing the more attractive opportunities within those channels. And if, over time, we continue to grow dealer faster than other parts of the market, that's going to drive that mix more profitable overall for the Cabinet business.

That didn't always have that. Can you talk about, in a way that you feel comfortable, kind of regional trends? I mean, there's taxes. I know you guys have set aside a huge part.

So as we came into the year, both new construction and R&R, and second quarter is running at what we thought the whole year would run at, and that's where we're projecting the second half. First quarter was stronger than we and, I think, most thought it would be. So I think second quarter moved in to an expected range. In terms of regional differences, I'd say, Midwest is strong. The South is strong. South Florida is probably weaker than the rest of the south, especially at the high end of that market. The West still looks strong. And then the East is good, but not as strong as Midwest, South, excluding Florida and West. I'd say in Texas, Houston's probably the market that's weaker than the rest. Rest of Texas were actually doing okay because it's reasonably diverse and our [indiscernible] business is positioned there, and we picked up some distribution. And the rest of Texas is actually performing pretty well. And so there's a few weaker spots in the market. And again, this is comping, in some cases, like South Florida was up very strong last year so -- to the extent that it's a little weaker this year. It's because it's coming off of a very strong 2015.

So if you",383,"I'd start with, I think, it's -- if you look -- since we started recovering from the downturn kind of 2011, we've been recovering at a gradual but consistent pace. It was a long period of time, more people are putting anything into their homes. So if you look from 2008, '09, '10 and then they just started in '11, that created some significant pent-up demand. As you're seeing -- now you're starting to see the turnover in existing housing stock that prompts spending both before the home is sold and more so after the home is sold. And we're certainly seeing an acceleration there. Home values are rising. And as home values are rising, people get more confident putting money into the home. We're finally seeing refinancing, cash-out refinancing and home equity lines coming back. We really started to see that in a meaningful way in '15. It's continuing into '16. Low interest rates, so to the extent people are investing now in their home and borrowing to do that, it's pretty affordable. So I'd say you roll all that together, you see a picture of a lot of dated kitchens and bathrooms, which is where that's the bread and butter of where we live. And people doing everything from a quick bathroom remodel to a wholesale kitchen and bathroom and everything in between. And so I think our own view is that carries on for a while, especially as new construction is trying to catch up, but not quite there in the entry-level housing. So people are looking for existing housing to move into out of rental properties. And as I move in, they're investing in those properties. And we just got to see that as the consumer is kind of moving through and aging housing stock and updating the look as they move in. So I'd say across the board, the trends we're looking at in R&R look good. And I'd like kind of running at 5%, 5.5%, I hope that's the pace that we continue over the next 3 to 5 years because I think that's -- compared to historic, that's a good, stable pace. And for us, given our size and scale, that's a good way for us to continue to ramp over a period of time."

So it's, I guess, some headwind as you move through it, but you get to a new base level. And as long as we're winning with the consumer, our new products are coming into the market, and there's good draw through in POS. We'll call out when the headwinds occur on inventory drawdowns and then help it tie us back out again. But I'd say, it hasn't hurt the business. I think they're being careful not to run stock too low so that it's not there. And our response times are good and getting better. So that to the extent that we have to rally because we've got some hot sellers and got to get inventory back in there, we're able to rise to it.

China came back strong for us. I think it's both. I think the market's back on the new construction side. We did well in that part of the market. But we also were strong within retail and e-commerce.

We did well in that part of the market. But we also were strong within retail and e-commerce. And so I think we're growing at least a little faster than the market. Market there is always hard to gauge, but there is a lot more activity now. On the new construction site, government reduced mortgage, down payment requirements, lowered mortgage rates, really trying to prompt some activity, and that's generated some activity. But the other part of that market for us is as they build these units, the haven't finished up the bathrooms and the kitchens. And so consumers, as they're moving in, so as they're buying existing housing, that's when they're fitting out those kitchens and bathrooms. So year-to-date, home sales in China is up, like, 30%. So that market, just as sales are complete, there's been a cycle of kind of 6-plus months where they're shopping for -- to fit out their kitchens and bathrooms. And so we benefit from that. And then we're seeing more R&R activity as well. So we're concentrated more in Tier 1 and Tier 2, which is where we put our bets more heavily than Tier 3, Tier 4 markets. Where we're seeing that market evolve is retail continues to be important in 1 and 2, e-commerce is important there. But 3 or 4 -- Tiers 3 and 4 are more shifting to e-commerce and light retail. And so that's kind of where our mix goes. We continue to upgrade our stores in our Tier 1, Tier 2 and try to get that mix right. So I'm happy with the way we're trying to evolve. Last year was -- the market was soft, we continued to perform into all the things we're doing in terms of upgrading the stores, upgrading the mix. And I think some of that is what we're seeing play through now. It's a little bit like we do with our whole business through the downturn. You never stop bringing out new products, never start change -- stop changing the mix, even if the market gets a little sideways. And that's what we saw in China last year. And now, as the markets pick back up again, consumers are showing up, and we've got a good array of product there. We've got the, I think, the right locations in terms of retail properties. And our focus is strong on the e-commerce side of market. So I think all those things are working together. I like China long term. It's going to have surges and growth and then a more plateau, but there's a huge R&R cycle that is going to come through China over the next 5, 7 years [indiscernible] properties they added over the last 15 years start to turn into a cycle of R&R, and we're in a really good spot to pick that up. So that's market I like."

Our teams drove strong sales and profit gains across all segments in the second quarter as the home products market continued to grow at the positive pace that we expected.
Our businesses remain focused on driving profitable growth, targeting the most attractive segments of our markets.
Based on the solid second quarter performance, the momentum we have inside of our businesses for the remainder of the year and the lower projected tax rate, we're increasing our full year EPS outlook.
Let me first spend some time on our view of the U.S. home products market. Next I'll provide my perspective on our business performance in the second quarter. We will then provide more details on our second quarter performance and increased 2016 outlook.
Starting with our view of the U.S. home products market. In the second quarter, the market for our home products continued to grow at the pace that we expected it would. We estimate that repair and remodel activity grew at roughly 5% to 5.5% and new construction grew low double digits. Repair and remodel activity continued to reflect consumers' demonstrated appetite for more on-trend styling, product differentiation and project complexity. This consumer demand continues to drive an improving mix across our categories.
As expected, new construction demand continues to grow at a low double-digit rate with single family growing faster than multi-family, and single-family entry-level activity continues to improve.
Looking forward, our overall assumption remains that the U.S. home products market, which impacts 70% of our sales, grows at a combined 6% to 7% rate for the full year 2016.
Our basket of near-term indicators for home products remains pointed to strong underlying demand, significant levels of construction activity in progress and continued market momentum as we head into the second half of the year.
Now let me provide some perspective on our business performance. For the second quarter, our teams delivered strong sales and profit performance across all operating segments. Sales increased 11% in total and 12% for our U.S. home products businesses, and total company operating margin increased to 14.8%.
Starting with our Cabinet segment. We continue to follow a disciplined strategy focused on profitable growth. Our consistent pace of product innovation and our high levels of reliable service to our channel partners continue to drive strong performance.
In the second quarter, our overall Cabinet sales were up 17% over the prior year and increased 7%, excluding Norcraft, and operating margins expanded to 12.9%. Specifically, sales in our largest channel, dealers, grew 30%, and 11% excluding Norcraft. Our share gains are coming from our new construction product lines in this channel and deeper multiline relationships with existing customers. We're cross-selling more of our product lines across our recently expanded dealer network.
Our in-stock cabinets and vanities, which are sold through home centers, grew sales mid-single digits when adjusted for the comparison to last year's second quarter, where we had a major new vanity program launch, which required an inventory load throughout last summer. The sell-through of the new program and product upgrades that we launched last year are performing well. Our Cabinet team has been focused on partnering with our customers to consistently balance inventory levels with production to further enhance service and manufacturing efficiency in our stock cabinets and vanity programs.
The remaining 27% of our Cabinet business, which includes home center semi-custom, builder direct and targeted markets in Canada, grew mid-teens. We're disciplined in our approach to these segments as we focus on where we can partner with customers to capture profitable growth. With our focused approach, we grew share in these segments and drove strong margin improvement. We're especially pleased with our home center special-order business, where our partnership approach is working well and driving growth at above-market rates.
Overall, for cabinets, we continue to execute and deliver strong sales and profit results. We're building share in the most attractive segments of the market by deepening our partnerships with dealers, home centers and builders. And our plants are increasingly more efficient. Our new product introductions and program wins are helping us drive reach [ph] across a number of price points in the market. The impact of our consistent execution can be seen in our share gains, our stronger mix and our improving margins.
For our Plumbing segment, sales were up 6% for the quarter, driven primarily by strength in the U.S. wholesale channel and China with solid mix and strong operating margin. Across our markets, we continued to see consumers trade up and our mix improve as innovation in design, finish and function attract consumers who trust our brand.
As we look out to the second half of the year, our growth should benefit from incremental marketing spend as well as more focus on recently launched products, including additional Magnetix easy-docking, easy-releasing showerheads; new Glyde, Via and Dartmoor bath suites; and new bathroom faucets with Microban antimicrobial finish in our Hensley line.
Organic sales in Canada were up high single digits to the prior year. China sales increased high single digits versus the prior year, but were up double digits in local currency, driven by our direct-to-builder efforts, our Moen-branded retail stores and a rapidly expanding e-commerce marketplace.
China's growth in new construction is picking up again, and we're also encouraged by the level of R&R activity that we are seeing.
Doors reported sales were up 9% for the quarter. Door products again saw sales growth with gains in both wholesale, which was up double digits, and at retail, which was up mid-single digits. Therma-Tru continues to benefit from the rollout of our refreshed retail strategy that includes an enhanced product lineup, simpler and more intuitive displays and better sales support for our customers' associates. And in wholesale, we continued to benefit from strong new construction placements and our enhanced distribution in the Southern and Western U.S.
In the Security segment, sales increased 6% from the prior year quarter, and were up approximately 8% excluding the negative impact of currency and the planned exit of some less-profitable SentrySafe product lines as part of the broader Sentry integration. Growth was driven by increases in Master Lock U.S. retail and U.S. commercial and strong growth in international, particularly in Asia.
The integration of SentrySafe into Master Lock is now behind us with only a few logistics changes left. We can now begin to ramp our Sentry sales efforts as our new production comes online. We continue to be excited about the opportunities we see between our Master Lock and Sentry businesses over the next few years.
So to recap the quarter, our results were strong and broad across all segments. We again executed well in the U.S. home products market that is continuing to grow as we expected. Our teams are consistently leveraging that market momentum to deliver profitable growth.
Before I wrap up, let me comment on our efforts to drive long-term growth. We continue to believe that we can create meaningful incremental shareholder value by using our strong cash flow and balance sheet to make strategic acquisitions, repurchase our shares and increase our dividend. Right now, we are busy evaluating a healthy pipeline of potential acquisitions. We're assessing a number of opportunities. And while we cannot guarantee success in any one situation, we believe we will complete some transactions over the next 6 to 12 months.
Over the next 3 years, we continue to believe that we have the potential to deploy more than $2 billion to drive incremental growth and shareholder value.
To sum up, the demand for our home products remains strong, as we expected, and we continue to grow faster than our market. Importantly, our strong brands, management teams and capital structure provide flexibility to both focus on profitable organic growth and drive incremental shareholder value with our balance sheet and strong free cash flow.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Lee, who will review our financial performance and provide detail on our increased EPS outlook for 2016."
33174798,369553624,1014685,"Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2016",2016-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Fortune Brands Innovations, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Chris. As Brian mentioned, to best reflect ongoing business performance, the majority of my comments will focus on income before charges and gains from continuing operations.Let me start with our second quarter results. Sales were $1.3 billion,",1050,"Thanks, Chris. As Brian mentioned, to best reflect ongoing business performance, the majority of my comments will focus on income before charges and gains from continuing operations.
Let me start with our second quarter results. Sales were $1.3 billion, up 11% from a year ago, with organic growth of 6% across all segments. Consolidated operating income for the quarter was $192 million, up 27% or $41 million compared to the same quarter last year. Earnings per share were $0.82 for the quarter versus $0.59 the same quarter last year, increasing 39% or $0.23, with $0.18 driven by continued stronger operating performance and $0.05 from a lower tax rate.
Now let me provide more color on segment results. Our Cabinet sales were $645 million, up $94 million or 17% versus the prior year quarter. Norcraft added $60 million of the sales growth. Dealer sales were $326 million and increased 30% from the prior year. In-stock cabinets and vanity sales of $130 million decreased 4%. However, last year's major vanity program win drove 25% sales growth in the second quarter of 2015. Excluding this prior year impact, in-stock cabinets and vanity sales increased 4%. 
Remaining sales for home center semi-custom, builder direct and Canada increased 14%. Operating income for the Cabinet segment increased $27 million over the prior year quarter, with Norcraft adding $10 million of the increase. Operating margin for the quarter increased 260 basis points to 12.9%. Operating leverage, excluding Norcraft, was around 50% as our recently added capacity continues to become more efficient and product and channel mix improved. For the full year, we expect an operating margin of around 11% compared to 9% in 2015.
Turning to Plumbing. Sales for the second quarter were $378 million, up $20 million or 6%, led by U.S. wholesale and China. Excluding the negative impact of currency, total Plumbing sales increased approximately 7%, with organic Canadian sales increasing 7% and China sales increasing 14%.
Operating income increased $13 million to $88 million, up 17%. Operating margin for this segment was 23.2%. For the full year 2016, operating margin is expected to be 20% to 21%, including incremental spending on marketing and product initiatives in the third quarter.
Door sales were $128 million, up $10 million or 9% from the prior year quarter. Operating income increased 29% with an operating margin of 15.3%. Full year operating margin for this segment is expected to be 11% to 12%.
Security sales were $147 million in the second quarter, up 6% to the prior year, and up approximately 8% excluding the negative impact of currency and the planned exit of less-profitable SentrySafe product lines as part of the broader Sentry integration. Segment operating income was $20 million and the segment operating margin was 13.4%. We expect to exit 2016 at an operating margin run rate of 15%.
To sum up consolidated second quarter performance, sales increased 11% and EPS were ahead of plan at $0.82. Our total company operating margin was 14.8%, up 190 basis points from the prior year, with an incremental margin, excluding acquisitions, of over 50%. We're squarely on track to reach our goal of approaching 15% operating margin when the housing market returns to steady-state levels.
Before turning to the balance sheet, let me comment on the cumulative impact of currency. The strengthening U.S. dollar reduced our total second quarter sales by approximately 1%, with Canada being the primary source. The EPS impact was around $0.01. Also, the lower tax rate of 28% in the quarter was due to the adoption of a new accounting standard that requires companies to reflect the tax benefit from stock-based compensation transactions in their tax rate and EPS.
Turning to the balance sheet. In the second quarter, we amended our credit agreement. The duration of the credit facility has been extended to 2021. The revolver has been expanded to $1.25 billion, and the term loan has been eliminated. With the increased flexibility of this new credit facility, we're now better positioned to drive incremental growth with our balance sheet and cash flow.
Our June 30 balance sheet remains solid with cash of $279 million, debt of $1.6 billion, and our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage is 1.8x. By year-end, we expect leverage to be about 1.4x, excluding any additional capital transactions. We currently have $540 million available under our new $1.25 billion revolver.
Turning last to the details of our outlook for 2016. Our market and sales assumptions for 2016 are unchanged. We continue to assume 6% to 7% U.S. home products market growth and total global market growth of 5% to 6%. Accordingly, we continue to expect full year 2016 sales to increase 10% to 12% compared to 2015. However, we've increased our full year EPS outlook based on continuing our strong operating margin performance and a lower annual tax rate. Our outlook for 2016 EPS is now in the range of $2.70 to $2.78, with the midpoint reflecting a 32% increase over the prior year. The $2.74 midpoint of our EPS outlook represents an increase of $0.19 over our previous midpoint of $2.55. Stronger than previously expected performance for the second quarter drove $0.02. And expected stronger performance, primarily in the fourth quarter, drove $0.04 of the increase. Stronger than previously expected performance in the third quarter will be offset by increased marketing and product spending to drive future growth. The lower tax rate drove $0.13 of the increase: $0.05 in the second quarter, $0.09 in the first half and $0.04 in the second half. We expect 2016 free cash flow to be around $400 million with a conversion rate of over 90%.
The annual EPS outlook includes the following assumptions: interest expense of around $50 million, a tax rate of approximately 31% in the second half of the year, and average fully diluted shares of approximately 158 million.
In summary, we're set up for a strong 2016, second quarter market growth was as expected, and we delivered strong sales and profit growth. Due to continuing stronger growth in operating margins and a lower tax rate, we, again, increased our EPS outlook for the year, and we remain focused on using our balance sheet and cash flow to drive incremental shareholder value through acquisitions and share repurchases.

We had some benefits in the first half, but basically flat in the second half, and FX will be basically flat. So second half looks very different from a commodity perspective for us, but that's built into our guidance. I think what's driving Moen -- the operating margins, we had very nice channel mix with the wholesale business segment up 9% to 10%. We're getting some nice, continuous improvements in our business model there as we continue to get more efficient. And there was a little expense timing that will move from the second to the third. A little bit of that is part of that $0.03 in terms of the media campaign and the spending. But very strong margins, consistently strong. We can now afford, in the second half, to spend some of that back, still maintain 20% to 21% margins and be positioned well for driving growth in the first half of next year through that ad spend."

On the R&R side of the market, I'd say that the mix is probably the best indicator that we're seeing across all product categories as consumers are spending more per project, so the mix continues to improve across. It's been pretty consistent, really. I mean, first quarter, we saw some surge because of weather improvement, et cetera, but that continued through the second quarter. And really, we feel like the second half is going to be a continuation of what we saw in the second quarter in R&R. So that's pretty widespread strength, keeping in mind we have enormous dealer network in cabinets that we're seeing, big wholesale channels in Plumbing that we're seeing this kind of growth come through. Then on the new construction side, I think we're optimistic about second half and '17 just given overall order rates, starts rates. And I'm not talking month-to-month, I'm talking kind of what does the first half total activity look like. We hear through all of our builder relationships that everybody's busy. They're still looking for talent. They're still out acquiring land. And so there's just a good, steady drumbeat, which gives us the confidence in the business overall, and we're performing well against that. So our mix coming through really has to do with the channels that we're positioned against. We're positioned at the most attractive parts of the market with our channels. And then within those channels, we're really positioned against the product categories that offer the strongest growth in margin. So it's all of that together feels like a good strong continuation of what was a good start to the year."

I think we had good flexibility before that. We still have that flexibility. I think we can do the things that we'd like to. Our credit rating is strong. Cash flow is very strong. So I don't feel like we're really that constrained on that front. In terms of valuations in the market, I think they're a bit kind of on a couple ends of the spectrum. I think where you see strong branded products, strong positions in the market, there's healthy expectations on value. But I think given kind of what those franchises can deliver, it's probably warranted, and you can see where things can get done at that level. On the other end of the spectrum, you see companies that are in more commodity parts of the market, I think, with maybe higher expectations than might be warranted. So kind of our framework has always been looking at categories where consumers are heavily involved, extending off of our existing platforms, so continuing to grow inside of our attractive positions. And we see a number of things. We're busy on a number of things right now that we think can contribute to that. So I don't think valuations have gotten kind of beyond where we feel comfortable. On the leverage side, Lee, you can chime in here, but yes, I think we're more comfortable at this point in the cycle taking a little more leverage on and then working that down, but within, I'd say, reasonable parameters."

We had come through the downturn, restructured, starting seeing volumes coming over our fixed cost base, and within each of the businesses, strategically directed where we were going to focus in areas where we could see more profitable growth. And so what you're seeing in the second quarter, really, is an extension of that. So on mix, stronger mix because we're focusing on the channels where you get stronger mix. Within those channels, we're focused on product categories that are delivering stronger mix. That played out in a strong way in the second quarter. Operating efficiencies, we've got very good leverage coming over our fixed cost base. We put some capacity in a couple of years ago. That capacity is operating very efficiently right now. And so we're just seeing that leverage come through. And then input costs, stable to a bit improved for the quarter. And that, we expect to continue throughout the year. So I guess, we're just at a level where we are seeing that strong mix coming through, leveraging our fixed cost base in a consistent way. Our teams are operating very well in terms of efficiency and continuous improvement. And then input costs look good.

Government's actually made some changes, policy-wise, to reignite the construction market. And we're seeing, on the R&R side in China, a lot of activity, which is a bit more stable relative to the government policy and everything else. And then Canada is holding up well. So I think across Moen, the one thing that -- as you look at the aggregate numbers, that you'd say, gee, that's a little lighter than what we might have thought, is the comp in retail against a very strong second quarter last year, which is good business on the shelf, SKUs in the store today.

We then got our in-stock cabinets and vanities, another attractive part of the market. So that segment of the market probably not growing as fast, but the margins are strong there. So it's a good mix part of the business. And then we got the third part of the market that we are very specific about where we're playing. So that's special order in the home centers, that's builder direct and that's our Canadian business. And so there, we're just looking at where are the best places to play. So good mix there as we reoriented ourself, especially in builder direct, we're seeing some nice growth come through there. So when I say it's channel mix, it's really driving toward where we're seeing the more attractive opportunities within those channels. And if, over time, we continue to grow dealer faster than other parts of the market, that's going to drive that mix more profitable overall for the Cabinet business.

That didn't always have that. Can you talk about, in a way that you feel comfortable, kind of regional trends? I mean, there's Texas. I know you guys have set aside a huge part.

So as we came into the year, both new construction and R&R, and second quarter is running at what we thought the whole year would run at, and that's where we're projecting the second half. First quarter was stronger than we and, I think, most thought it would be. So I think second quarter moved in to an expected range. In terms of regional differences, I'd say, Midwest is strong. The South is strong. South Florida is probably weaker than the rest of the South, especially at the high end of that market. The West still looks strong. And then the East is good, but not as strong as Midwest, South, excluding Florida, and West. I'd say in Texas, Houston's probably the market that's weaker than the rest. Rest of Texas we're actually doing okay in because it's reasonably diverse and our [indiscernible] business is positioned there, and we picked up some distribution. And the rest of Texas is actually performing pretty well. And so there's a few weaker spots in the market. And again, this is comping -- in some cases, like South Florida was up very strong last year. So to the extent that it's a little weaker this year, it's because it's coming off of a very strong 2015. So I feel good about kind of the consistency of the growth in general, both on R&R and the new construction. And obviously, some markets are a little higher than others."

So if",384,"I'd start with, I think, it's -- if you look -- since we started recovering from the downturn, kind of 2011, we've been recovering at a gradual but consistent pace. It was a long period of time where people weren't putting anything into their homes. So if you look from 2008, '09, '10 and then they just started in '11, that created some significant pent-up demand. As you're seeing -- now you're starting to see the turnover in existing housing stock. That prompts spending both before the home is sold and more so after the home is sold. And we're certainly seeing an acceleration there. Home values are rising. And as home values are rising, people get more confident putting money into the home. We're finally seeing refinancing, cash-out refinancing and home equity lines coming back. We really started to see that in a meaningful way in '15. It's continuing into '16. Low interest rates, so to the extent people are investing now in their home and borrowing to do that, it's pretty affordable. So I'd say you roll all that together, you see a picture of a lot of dated kitchens and bathrooms, which is where -- that's the bread and butter of where we live. And people doing everything from a quick bathroom remodel to a wholesale kitchen and bathroom and everything in between. And so I think our own view is that carries on for a while, especially as new construction is trying to catch up, but not quite there in the entry-level housing. So people are looking for existing housing to move into out of rental properties. And as they move in, they're investing in those properties. And we just got to see that as the consumer is kind of moving through an aging housing stock and updating the look as they move in. So I'd say across the board, the trends we're looking at in R&R look good. And I like kind of running at 5%, 5.5%. I hope that's the pace that we continue over the next 3 to 5 years because I think that's -- compared to historic, that's a good, stable pace. And for us, given our size and scale, that's a good way for us to continue to ramp over a period of time."

So it's, I guess, some headwind as you move through it, but you get to a new base level. And as long as we're winning with the consumer, our new products are coming into the market, and there's good draw-through on POS. We'll call out when the headwinds occur on inventory drawdowns and then help you tie it back out again. But I'd say, it hasn't hurt the business. I think they're being careful not to run stock too low so that it's not there. And our response times are good and getting better. So that to the extent that we have to rally because we've got some hot sellers and got to get inventory back in there, we're able to rise to it.

We did well in that part of the market. But we also were strong within retail and e-commerce. And so I think we're growing at least a little faster than the market. Market there is always hard to gauge, but there is a lot more activity now. On the new construction side, the government reduced mortgage down-payment requirements, lowered mortgage rates, really trying to prompt some activity, and that's generated some activity. But the other part of that market for us is as they build these units, they haven't finished out the bathrooms and the kitchens. And so consumers, as they're moving in, so as they're buying existing housing, that's when they're fitting out those kitchens and bathrooms. So year-to-date, home sales in China is up, like, 30%. So that market, just as sales are complete, there's been a cycle of kind of 6-plus months where they're shopping for -- to fit out their kitchens and bathrooms. And so we benefit from that. And then we're seeing more R&R activity as well. It's also concentrated more in Tier 1 and Tier 2, which is where we put our bets more heavily than Tier 3, Tier 4 markets. Where we're seeing that market evolve is retail continues to be important in 1 and 2, e-commerce is important there. But 3 and 4 -- Tiers 3 and 4 are more shifting to e-commerce and light retail. And so that's kind of where our mix goes. We continue to upgrade our stores in our Tier 1, Tier 2 and try to get that mix right. So I'm happy with the way China's evolved. Last year was -- the market was soft, but we continued to perform and do all the things we're doing in terms of upgrading the stores, upgrading the mix. And I think some of that is what we're seeing play through now. It's a little bit like we do with our whole business through the downturn. You never stop bringing out new products, never start change -- stop changing the mix, even if the market gets a little sideways. And that's what we saw in China last year. And now, as the markets pick back up again, consumers are showing up, and we've got a good array of product there. We've got the, I think, the right locations in terms of retail properties. And our focus is strong on the e-commerce side of market. So I think all those things are working together. I like China long term. It's going to have surges in growth and then a more plateau, but there's a huge R&R cycle that is going to come through China over the next 5, 7 years. They have all properties they added over the last 15 years, start to enter into a cycle of R&R, and we're in a really good spot to pick that up. So that's a market I like."

So if we do something that really helps us in North America and really helps us in China, but there's an opportunity in that part of the market in Europe, I think that's the way we'll come at it, and we'll take specific parts of the market. But I wouldn't say if equity values are down in Europe, and the time to come in kind of at the bottom of the market, we're not really looking at that as an opportunity today."

Our teams drove strong sales and profit gains across all segments in the second quarter as the home products market continued to grow at the positive pace that we expected.
Our businesses remain focused on driving profitable growth, targeting the most attractive segments of our markets.
Based on the solid second quarter performance, the momentum we have inside of our businesses for the remainder of the year and the lower projected tax rate, we're increasing our full year EPS outlook.
Let me first spend some time on our view of the U.S. home products market. Next I'll provide my perspective on our business performance in the second quarter. We will then provide more details on our second quarter performance and increased 2016 outlook.
Starting with our view of the U.S. home products market. In the second quarter, the market for our home products continued to grow at the pace that we expected it would. We estimate that repair and remodel activity grew at roughly 5% to 5.5% and new construction grew low double digits. Repair and remodel activity continued to reflect consumers' demonstrated appetite for more on-trend styling, product differentiation and project complexity. This consumer demand continues to drive an improving mix across our categories.
As expected, new construction demand continues to grow at a low double-digit rate with single family growing faster than multi-family, and single-family entry-level activity continues to improve.
Looking forward, our overall assumption remains that the U.S. home products market, which impacts 70% of our sales, grows at a combined 6% to 7% rate for the full year 2016.
Our basket of near-term indicators for home products remains pointed to strong underlying demand, significant levels of construction activity in progress and continued market momentum as we head into the second half of the year.
Now let me provide some perspective on our business performance. For the second quarter, our teams delivered strong sales and profit performance across all operating segments. Sales increased 11% in total and 12% for our U.S. home products businesses, and total company operating margin increased to 14.8%.
Starting with our Cabinet segment. We continue to follow a disciplined strategy focused on profitable growth. Our consistent pace of product innovation and our high levels of reliable service to our channel partners continue to drive strong performance.
In the second quarter, our overall Cabinet sales were up 17% over the prior year and increased 7%, excluding Norcraft, and operating margins expanded to 12.9%. Specifically, sales in our largest channel, dealers, grew 30%, and 11% excluding Norcraft. Our share gains are coming from our new construction product lines in this channel and deeper multiline relationships with existing customers. We're cross-selling more of our product lines across our recently expanded dealer network.
Our in-stock cabinets and vanities, which are sold through home centers, grew sales mid-single digits when adjusted for the comparison to last year's second quarter, where we had a major new vanity program launch, which required an inventory load throughout last summer. The sell-through of the new program and product upgrades that we launched last year are performing well. Our Cabinet team has been focused on partnering with our customers to consistently balance inventory levels with production to further enhance service and manufacturing efficiency in our stock cabinets and vanity programs.
The remaining 27% of our Cabinet business, which includes home center semi-custom, builder direct and targeted markets in Canada, grew mid-teens. We're disciplined in our approach to these segments as we focus on where we can partner with customers to capture profitable growth. With our focused approach, we grew share in these segments and drove strong margin improvement. We're especially pleased with our home center special-order business, where our partnership approach is working well and driving growth at above-market rates.
Overall, for cabinets, we continue to execute and deliver strong sales and profit results. We're building share in the most attractive segments of the market by deepening our partnerships with dealers, home centers and builders. And our plants are increasingly more efficient. Our new product introductions and program wins are helping us drive reach [ph] across a number of price points in the market. The impact of our consistent execution can be seen in our share gains, our stronger mix and our improving margins.
For our Plumbing segment, sales were up 6% for the quarter, driven primarily by strength in the U.S. wholesale channel and China with solid mix and strong operating margin. Across our markets, we continued to see consumers trade up and our mix improve as innovation in design, finish and function attract consumers who trust our brand.
As we look out to the second half of the year, our growth should benefit from incremental marketing spend as well as more focus on recently launched products, including additional Magnetix easy-docking, easy-releasing showerheads; new Glyde, Via and Dartmoor bath suites; and new bathroom faucets with Microban antimicrobial finish in our Hensley line.
Organic sales in Canada were up high single digits to the prior year. China sales increased high single digits versus the prior year, but were up double digits in local currency, driven by our direct-to-builder efforts, our Moen-branded retail stores and a rapidly expanding e-commerce marketplace.
China's growth in new construction is picking up again, and we're also encouraged by the level of R&R activity that we are seeing.
Doors reported sales were up 9% for the quarter. Door products again saw sales growth with gains in both wholesale, which was up double digits, and at retail, which was up mid-single digits. Therma-Tru continues to benefit from the rollout of our refreshed retail strategy that includes an enhanced product lineup, simpler and more intuitive displays and better sales support for our customers' associates. And in wholesale, we continued to benefit from strong new construction placements and our enhanced distribution in the Southern and Western U.S.
In the Security segment, sales increased 6% from the prior year quarter, and were up approximately 8% excluding the negative impact of currency and the planned exit of some less-profitable SentrySafe product lines as part of the broader Sentry integration. Growth was driven by increases in Master Lock U.S. retail and U.S. commercial and strong growth in international, particularly in Asia.
The integration of SentrySafe into Master Lock is now behind us with only a few logistics changes left. We can now begin to ramp our Sentry sales efforts as our new production comes online. We continue to be excited about the opportunities we see between our Master Lock and Sentry businesses over the next few years.
So to recap the quarter, our results were strong and broad across all segments. We again executed well in the U.S. home products market that is continuing to grow as we expected. Our teams are consistently leveraging that market momentum to deliver profitable growth.
Before I wrap up, let me comment on our efforts to drive long-term growth. We continue to believe that we can create meaningful incremental shareholder value by using our strong cash flow and balance sheet to make strategic acquisitions, repurchase our shares and increase our dividend. Right now, we are busy evaluating a healthy pipeline of potential acquisitions. We're assessing a number of opportunities. And while we cannot guarantee success in any one situation, we believe we will complete some transactions over the next 6 to 12 months.
Over the next 3 years, we continue to believe that we have the potential to deploy more than $2 billion to drive incremental growth and shareholder value.
To sum up, the demand for our home products remains strong, as we expected, and we continue to grow faster than our market. Importantly, our strong brands, management teams and capital structure provide flexibility to both focus on profitable organic growth and drive incremental shareholder value with our balance sheet and strong free cash flow.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Lee, who will review our financial performance and provide detail on our increased EPS outlook for 2016."
33174798,369553624,1015244,"Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2016",2016-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Fortune Brands Innovations, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Chris. As Brian mentioned, to best reflect ongoing business performance, the majority of my comments will focus on income before charges and gains from continuing operations.Let me start with our second quarter results. Sales were $1.3 billion,",1050,"Thanks, Chris. As Brian mentioned, to best reflect ongoing business performance, the majority of my comments will focus on income before charges and gains from continuing operations.
Let me start with our second quarter results. Sales were $1.3 billion, up 11% from a year ago, with organic growth of 6% across all segments. Consolidated operating income for the quarter was $192 million, up 27% or $41 million compared to the same quarter last year. Earnings per share were $0.82 for the quarter versus $0.59 the same quarter last year, increasing 39% or $0.23, with $0.18 driven by continued stronger operating performance and $0.05 from a lower tax rate.
Now let me provide more color on segment results. Our Cabinet sales were $645 million, up $94 million or 17% versus the prior year quarter. Norcraft added $60 million of the sales growth. Dealer sales were $326 million and increased 30% from the prior year. In-stock cabinets and vanity sales of $130 million decreased 4%. However, last year's major vanity program win drove 25% sales growth in the second quarter of 2015. Excluding this prior year impact, in-stock cabinets and vanity sales increased 4%. 
Remaining sales for home center semi-custom, builder direct and Canada increased 14%. Operating income for the Cabinet segment increased $27 million over the prior year quarter, with Norcraft adding $10 million of the increase. Operating margin for the quarter increased 260 basis points to 12.9%. Operating leverage, excluding Norcraft, was around 50% as our recently added capacity continues to become more efficient and product and channel mix improved. For the full year, we expect an operating margin of around 11% compared to 9% in 2015.
Turning to Plumbing. Sales for the second quarter were $378 million, up $20 million or 6%, led by U.S. wholesale and China. Excluding the negative impact of currency, total Plumbing sales increased approximately 7%, with organic Canadian sales increasing 7% and China sales increasing 14%.
Operating income increased $13 million to $88 million, up 17%. Operating margin for this segment was 23.2%. For the full year 2016, operating margin is expected to be 20% to 21%, including incremental spending on marketing and product initiatives in the third quarter.
Door sales were $128 million, up $10 million or 9% from the prior year quarter. Operating income increased 29% with an operating margin of 15.3%. Full year operating margin for this segment is expected to be 11% to 12%.
Security sales were $147 million in the second quarter, up 6% to the prior year, and up approximately 8% excluding the negative impact of currency and the planned exit of less-profitable SentrySafe product lines as part of the broader Sentry integration. Segment operating income was $20 million and the segment operating margin was 13.4%. We expect to exit 2016 at an operating margin run rate of 15%.
To sum up consolidated second quarter performance, sales increased 11% and EPS were ahead of plan at $0.82. Our total company operating margin was 14.8%, up 190 basis points from the prior year, with an incremental margin, excluding acquisitions, of over 50%. We're squarely on track to reach our goal of approaching 15% operating margin when the housing market returns to steady-state levels.
Before turning to the balance sheet, let me comment on the cumulative impact of currency. The strengthening U.S. dollar reduced our total second quarter sales by approximately 1%, with Canada being the primary source. The EPS impact was around $0.01. Also, the lower tax rate of 28% in the quarter was due to the adoption of a new accounting standard that requires companies to reflect the tax benefit from stock-based compensation transactions in their tax rate and EPS.
Turning to the balance sheet. In the second quarter, we amended our credit agreement. The duration of the credit facility has been extended to 2021. The revolver has been expanded to $1.25 billion, and the term loan has been eliminated. With the increased flexibility of this new credit facility, we're now better positioned to drive incremental growth with our balance sheet and cash flow.
Our June 30 balance sheet remains solid with cash of $279 million, debt of $1.6 billion, and our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage is 1.8x. By year-end, we expect leverage to be about 1.4x, excluding any additional capital transactions. We currently have $540 million available under our new $1.25 billion revolver.
Turning last to the details of our outlook for 2016. Our market and sales assumptions for 2016 are unchanged. We continue to assume 6% to 7% U.S. home products market growth and total global market growth of 5% to 6%. Accordingly, we continue to expect full year 2016 sales to increase 10% to 12% compared to 2015. However, we've increased our full year EPS outlook based on continuing our strong operating margin performance and a lower annual tax rate. Our outlook for 2016 EPS is now in the range of $2.70 to $2.78, with the midpoint reflecting a 32% increase over the prior year. The $2.74 midpoint of our EPS outlook represents an increase of $0.19 over our previous midpoint of $2.55. Stronger than previously expected performance for the second quarter drove $0.02. And expected stronger performance, primarily in the fourth quarter, drove $0.04 of the increase. Stronger than previously expected performance in the third quarter will be offset by increased marketing and product spending to drive future growth. The lower tax rate drove $0.13 of the increase: $0.05 in the second quarter, $0.09 in the first half and $0.04 in the second half. We expect 2016 free cash flow to be around $400 million with a conversion rate of over 90%.
The annual EPS outlook includes the following assumptions: interest expense of around $50 million, a tax rate of approximately 31% in the second half of the year, and average fully diluted shares of approximately 158 million.
In summary, we're set up for a strong 2016, second quarter market growth was as expected, and we delivered strong sales and profit growth. Due to continuing stronger growth in operating margins and a lower tax rate, we, again, increased our EPS outlook for the year, and we remain focused on using our balance sheet and cash flow to drive incremental shareholder value through acquisitions and share repurchases.
I will now pass the call back to Brian."

So second half looks very different from a commodity perspective for us, but that's built into our guidance. I think what's driving Moen -- the operating margins, we had very nice channel mix with the wholesale business segment up 9% to 10%. We're getting some nice, continuous improvements in our business model there as we continue to get more efficient. And there was a little expense timing that will move from the second to the third. A little bit of that is part of that $0.03 in terms of the media campaign and the spending. But very strong margins, consistently strong. We can now afford, in the second half, to spend some of that back, still maintain 20% to 21% margins and be positioned well for driving growth in the first half of next year through that ad spend."

On the R&R side of the market, I'd say that the mix is probably the best indicator that we're seeing across all product categories as consumers are spending more per project, so the mix continues to improve across. It's been pretty consistent, really. I mean, first quarter, we saw some surge because of weather improvement, et cetera, but that continued through the second quarter. And really, we feel like the second half is going to be a continuation of what we saw in the second quarter in R&R. So that's pretty widespread strength, keeping in mind we have enormous dealer network in cabinets that we're seeing, big wholesale channels in Plumbing that we're seeing this kind of growth come through. Then on the new construction side, I think we're optimistic about second half and '17 just given overall order rates, starts rates.

And so there's just a good, steady drumbeat, which gives us the confidence in the business overall, and we're performing well against that. So our mix coming through really has to do with the channels that we're positioned against. We're positioned at the most attractive parts of the market with our channels. And then within those channels, we're really positioned against the product categories that offer the strongest growth in margin. So it's all of that together feels like a good strong continuation of what was a good start to the year."

Obviously, the equity markets have done really well recently, and valuations are high. I was trying to understand if any of the adjustments to the credit agreement are intended to give you incremental flexibility to perform M&A by leveraging the balance sheet. And perhaps, you could give us a view on what you see in terms of the landscape, valuation-wise, in terms of opportunities and how much leverage you'd be comfortable taking on to finance something in the next couple quarters."

I think we had good flexibility before that. We still have that flexibility. I think we can do the things that we'd like to. Our credit rating is strong. Cash flow is very strong. So I don't feel like we're really that constrained on that front. In terms of valuations in the market, I think they're a bit kind of on a couple ends of the spectrum. I think where you see strong branded products, strong positions in the market, there's healthy expectations on value. But I think given kind of what those franchises can deliver, it's probably warranted, and you can see where things can get done at that level. On the other end of the spectrum, you see companies that are in more commodity parts of the market, I think, with maybe higher expectations than might be warranted. So kind of our framework has always been looking at categories where consumers are heavily involved, extending off of our existing platforms, so continuing to grow inside of our attractive positions. And we see a number of things. We're busy on a number of things right now that we think can contribute to that. So I don't think valuations have gotten kind of beyond where we feel comfortable. On the leverage side, Lee, you can chime in here, but yes, I think we're more comfortable at this point in the cycle taking a little more leverage on and then working that down, but within, I'd say, reasonable parameters."

We had come through the downturn, restructured, starting seeing volumes coming over our fixed cost base, and within each of the businesses, strategically directed where we were going to focus in areas where we could see more profitable growth. And so what you're seeing in the second quarter, really, is an extension of that. So on mix, stronger mix because we're focusing on the channels where you get stronger mix. Within those channels, we're focused on product categories that are delivering stronger mix. That played out in a strong way in the second quarter. Operating efficiencies, we've got very good leverage coming over our fixed cost base. We put some capacity in a couple of years ago. That capacity is operating very efficiently right now. And so we're just seeing that leverage come through. And then input costs, stable to a bit improved for the quarter. And that, we expect to continue throughout the year. So I guess, we're just at a level where we are seeing that strong mix coming through, leveraging our fixed cost base in a consistent way. Our teams are operating very well in terms of efficiency and continuous improvement. And then input costs look good.

Government's actually made some changes, policy-wise, to reignite the construction market. And we're seeing, on the R&R side in China, a lot of activity, which is a bit more stable relative to the government policy and everything else. And then Canada is holding up well.

Looking at our Cabinet business, we kind of think about it in 3 parts. We've got the dealer part of the market, which is about half of the business, very strong margins, and we're playing in the attractive parts of the dealer business. So as that business grows, that part of business grows faster than the total category and faster than the rest of our business, it improves the mix. We then got our in-stock cabinets and vanities, another attractive part of the market. So that segment of the market probably not growing as fast, but the margins are strong there. So it's a good mix part of the business. And then we got the third part of the market that we are very specific about where we're playing. So that's special order in the home centers, that's builder direct and that's our Canadian business. And so there, we're just looking at where are the best places to play. So good mix there as we reoriented ourself, especially in builder direct, we're seeing some nice growth come through there. So when I say it's channel mix, it's really driving toward where we're seeing the more attractive opportunities within those channels. And if, over time, we continue to grow dealer faster than other parts of the market, that's going to drive that mix more profitable overall for the Cabinet business. And that's what we've been driving through over the last 3 to 5 years. We're seeing Norcraft help that as well as those margins are as strong for Norcraft as they are for the rest of the dealer business."

If you could kind of comment on, perhaps, that run rate, obviously, I have your full year, but if there was any momentum. And more specifically, there -- obviously, the country is divided up into many regions. We're noticing very strong new construction in many parts of the country in Midwest, Mid-Atlantic, Tennessee. That didn't always have that. Can you talk about, in a way that you feel comfortable, kind of regional trends? I mean, there's Texas. I know you guys have set aside a huge part. But just in general, Northeast, kind of Southeast, West, I mean, could you kind of break down a little difference in the business cadence there since we're seeing very different kind of housing trends?"

I think first quarter was stronger than we thought it would be. Second quarter was what we thought it would be. So as we came into the year, both new construction and R&R, and second quarter is running at what we thought the whole year would run at, and that's where we're projecting the second half. First quarter was stronger than we and, I think, most thought it would be. So I think second quarter moved in to an expected range. In terms of regional differences, I'd say, Midwest is strong. The South is strong. South Florida is probably weaker than the rest of the South, especially at the high end of that market. The West still looks strong. And then the East is good, but not as strong as Midwest, South, excluding Florida, and West. I'd say in Texas, Houston's probably the market that's weaker than the rest. Rest of Texas we're actually doing okay in because it's reasonably diverse and our [indiscernible] business is positioned there, and we picked up some distribution. And the rest of Texas is actually performing pretty well. And so there's a few weaker spots in the market. And again, this is comping -- in some cases, like South Florida was up very strong last year. So to the extent that it's a little weaker this year, it's because it's coming off of a very strong 2015. So I feel good about kind of the consistency of the growth in general, both on R&R and the new construction. And obviously, some markets are a little higher than others."

So if",384,"I'd start with, I think, it's -- if you look -- since we started recovering from the downturn, kind of 2011, we've been recovering at a gradual but consistent pace. It was a long period of time where people weren't putting anything into their homes. So if you look from 2008, '09, '10 and then they just started in '11, that created some significant pent-up demand. As you're seeing -- now you're starting to see the turnover in existing housing stock. That prompts spending both before the home is sold and more so after the home is sold. And we're certainly seeing an acceleration there. Home values are rising. And as home values are rising, people get more confident putting money into the home. We're finally seeing refinancing, cash-out refinancing and home equity lines coming back. We really started to see that in a meaningful way in '15. It's continuing into '16. Low interest rates, so to the extent people are investing now in their home and borrowing to do that, it's pretty affordable. So I'd say you roll all that together, you see a picture of a lot of dated kitchens and bathrooms, which is where -- that's the bread and butter of where we live. And people doing everything from a quick bathroom remodel to a wholesale kitchen and bathroom and everything in between. And so I think our own view is that carries on for a while, especially as new construction is trying to catch up, but not quite there in the entry-level housing. So people are looking for existing housing to move into out of rental properties. And as they move in, they're investing in those properties. And we just got to see that as the consumer is kind of moving through an aging housing stock and updating the look as they move in. So I'd say across the board, the trends we're looking at in R&R look good. And I like kind of running at 5%, 5.5%. I hope that's the pace that we continue over the next 3 to 5 years because I think that's -- compared to historic, that's a good, stable pace. And for us, given our size and scale, that's a good way for us to continue to ramp over a period of time."

So that impacts in-stock cabinets, vanities and impacts Plumbing, impacts Doors. But through all that, we've continued to have some very good wins. And so new business has come in. POS is strong. So it's, I guess, some headwind as you move through it, but you get to a new base level. And as long as we're winning with the consumer, our new products are coming into the market, and there's good draw-through on POS. We'll call out when the headwinds occur on inventory drawdowns and then help you tie it back out again. But I'd say, it hasn't hurt the business. I think they're being careful not to run stock too low so that it's not there. And our response times are good and getting better. So that to the extent that we have to rally because we've got some hot sellers and got to get inventory back in there, we're able to rise to it. So that combination, I think, you work through it, but I think we'll both come out in a very healthy place."

We did well in that part of the market. But we also were strong within retail and e-commerce. And so I think we're growing at least a little faster than the market. Market there is always hard to gauge, but there is a lot more activity now. On the new construction side, the government reduced mortgage down-payment requirements, lowered mortgage rates, really trying to prompt some activity, and that's generated some activity. But the other part of that market for us is as they build these units, they haven't finished out the bathrooms and the kitchens. And so consumers, as they're moving in, so as they're buying existing housing, that's when they're fitting out those kitchens and bathrooms. So year-to-date, home sales in China is up, like, 30%. So that market, just as sales are complete, there's been a cycle of kind of 6-plus months where they're shopping for -- to fit out their kitchens and bathrooms. And so we benefit from that. And then we're seeing more R&R activity as well. It's also concentrated more in Tier 1 and Tier 2, which is where we put our bets more heavily than Tier 3, Tier 4 markets. Where we're seeing that market evolve is retail continues to be important in 1 and 2, e-commerce is important there. But 3 and 4 -- Tiers 3 and 4 are more shifting to e-commerce and light retail. And so that's kind of where our mix goes. We continue to upgrade our stores in our Tier 1, Tier 2 and try to get that mix right. So I'm happy with the way China's evolved. Last year was -- the market was soft, but we continued to perform and do all the things we're doing in terms of upgrading the stores, upgrading the mix. And I think some of that is what we're seeing play through now. It's a little bit like we do with our whole business through the downturn. You never stop bringing out new products, never start change -- stop changing the mix, even if the market gets a little sideways. And that's what we saw in China last year. And now, as the markets pick back up again, consumers are showing up, and we've got a good array of product there. We've got the, I think, the right locations in terms of retail properties. And our focus is strong on the e-commerce side of market. So I think all those things are working together. I like China long term. It's going to have surges in growth and then a more plateau, but there's a huge R&R cycle that is going to come through China over the next 5, 7 years. They have all properties they added over the last 15 years, start to enter into a cycle of R&R, and we're in a really good spot to pick that up. So that's a market I like."

Imp",2037,"Thank you, Brian, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. 
Our teams delivered profitable growth in the third quarter in the face of challenging comps, select channel inventory reductions and slower-than-anticipated repair and remodel activity. 
Importantly, our business has remained focus on targeting the most attractive segments of our markets, and we delivered strong profit performance across all 4 segments. Since late September and through the month of October, we've seen the pace of orders across our business strengthen, returning to level that we would expect. So based on our solid first quarter performance, consistent execution and our current assumption for market growth, we're revising our full year outlook for sales growth to 9% to 10% while confirming our previous EPS outlook.
Let me first spend some time on our view of the U.S. home products market, followed by my thoughts on our business performance in the third quarter. Then I would like to discuss the recent creation of our Global Plumbing Group and why we view this platform as the first step to further accelerating growth in the plumbing segment. And finally, since we just celebrated our 5-year anniversary as an independent company, I'll provide my perspectives on the company that we have built and how we have positioned ourselves to maximize growth and value for the years ahead. Lee will then provide more details on our third quarter performance and our 2016 outlook.
Starting with our view of the U.S. home products market. In the third quarter, the market for our home products grew at the lower end of the pace that we expected. We estimate that repair and remodel activity grew at around 4%, and new construction grew generally as expected.
Our business has experienced repair and remodel activity that began to slow in July and was clearly slower throughout August and the first half of September. While demand was slower over this period, our channels also reported a labor market and available contractors and tradespeople to take on incrementally more projects over the summer months after a fast start to the year.
Notably, over the past 5 weeks, we've seen R&R activity and order patterns improve and more consistent with what we would expect, starting in mid-September and continuing through October. And consumers continued to drive an improving mix within our categories.
New construction and demand continues to grow as expected, with single-family growing faster than multi-family and single-family entry-level activity continuing to improve. 
Looking at the full year 2016. Our overall assumption is that the U.S. home products market, which impacts 70% of our sales, grows at a combined rate of around 6%. 
Within the year, we saw upside in the first quarter, driven by better weather. Second quarter was pretty much as we expected. The third quarter saw slower repair and remodel activity, partially due to labor constraints. And with our current visibility to order patterns, the first quarter is shaping up to be on plan. Taken together, 2016 will be a good year.
Looking forward, our basket of new indicators for the home products market remains pointed to strong underlying demand, some constraints in skilled labor, significant levels of single-family new construction activity and continued market momentum as we head into 2017.
Now let me provide some perspective on our business performance. So the third quarter, our teams delivered strong performance across all operating segments. Sales increased 3%, and total company operating margin increased to 14.8%. 
Starting with our cabinet segment. We continue to follow a disciplined strategy focused on profitable growth. Our consistent pace of product innovation and our high levels of reliable service to our channel partners continue to drive performance. In the third quarter, our overall cabinet sales were flat to the prior year, and operating margins, driven by increasingly efficient operations and an improving mix, expanded to 12.4%. 
Excluding last year's third quarter load-in to support a major new vanity program launch and promotional timing, our total cabinet sales increased mid-single digits in the quarter. And the [indiscernible] channel sales grew low single digits overall. However, sales grew solid mid-single digits in all of our core semi-custom product lines, and we continue to see mix improve. In our luxury lines, which make up a little more than 25% of our dealer channel volume, sales were lower. Overall, dealers are seeing strong growth from our new construction products, we're benefiting from deeper relationships that existing customers and we're beginning to see some cross-sell benefits from our Norcraft acquisition.
Sales for our in-stock cabinets and vanities, which are sold through home centers, were down but grew high single digits when adjusted for the comparison to last year's load-in and promotional timing in the third quarter.
The sell-through of the new program and product upgrades that we launched last year are performing very well, and we're planning for the launch of additional new programs in 2017. Our cabinet team has been focused on partnering with our customers to continue to deliver on consumer trends and drive growth in our in-stock cabinets and vanity programs.
The remaining 25% to 30% of our cabinets business, which includes home center special order semicustom, builder direct in targeted markets and Canada, grew mid-single digits. We're disciplined in our approach to the segment as we focus on where we can partner with our customers to capture profitable growth. With our focused approach, we grew share in these segments and drove strong margin improvement. Our specialty home center special order business where our partnership approach is working well and driving growth and above-market rates with an improving mix.
In summary, I feel good about our industry-leading cabinet business. We continue to execute well and deliver strong results even in a quarter where the market was not as strong as we planned. We're building share in the most attractive segments of the market. Our plans are increasingly more efficient, and our new product introductions and program wins are helping us drive original mix across a number of price points in the market.
For our plumbing segment, sales are up 7% for the quarter, with solid mix and strong operating margin. Excluding select channel inventory reductions and sales from the recent acquisitions, sales increased 6%, driven by strength in U.S. wholesale, China and Canada. 
Across our markets, we see consumers trade up and our mix improve, as innovation and design, finish and function attracts consumers who trust our brand. 
As we look at the remainder of the year, our growth should benefit from incremental marketing spend to help renew construction market and more focused on recently launched products. 
Sales in Canada were up high single digits to the prior year where we are gaining share. Notably, we continue to see strong growth in the urban markets with our home center partners.
China sales increased double digits versus the prior year. Sales gains were broad across China business, particularly in on our Moen-branded stores where we continue to drive increased productivity. 
Doors reported sales were up 4% for the quarter. Door products again saw sales growth in both wholesale and retail. 
Furniture continues to benefit from the rollout of a refreshed retail strategy that includes an enhanced product line, simpler, more intuitive displays and better sales support for our customers' associates.
And in wholesale, we continue to benefit from strong new construction placements and our enhanced distribution in the southern and western U.S. 
In the security segment, sales increased 6% from the prior year quarter and were up approximately 8%, excluding the negative impact of the planned exit of the most profitable SentrySafe products. 
The growth came from multiple channels and geographies, and we are beginning to see profit improvement from the integration of SentrySafe into Master Lock. 
We are also ramping up our Sentry sales efforts as we continue to be excited about the opportunities we see between our Master Lock and Sentry businesses over the next few years. 
So to recap the quarter. Our teams are consistently leveraging our competitive advantages to deliver profitable growth. We executed well in a U.S. home products market that is continuing to expand despite periodic labor constraints among installers and tradesman. And we are gaining momentum in our securities business, with Sentry integration behind us.
Now let me turn to the newly formed Global Plumbing Group, which is a key strategic steps to enable accelerated, organic and incremental long-term growth. 
The approach to the GPG is much like the evolution of our cabinets business into a platform that can support multiple brands across multiple price points, sold into leading channel positions, supported by dedicated supply chains. The new GPG platform structure should allow us to accelerate growth while leveraging our global supply chain and strong distribution. 
It paves the way for additional acquisitions, joint ventures and supply agreements and allows for seamless integration and continued growth. 
While only an initial step, we've recently made our first 2 acquisitions as part of this new platform. Riobel is a premium Canadian showroom brand, which brings strong innovation and best-in-class service. 
We also recently purchased ROHL, which includes both the ROHL and Perrin & Rowe brands, which bring a design-centric, artisanal approach to luxury products. 
Under the GPG, these additions now have even greater potential for profitable growth. 
The new Global Plumbing Group enhances the potential for future growth as we look to grow our plumbing sales to $2.5 billion by 2020. We are excited about the opportunity to transform our business, enter new markets, develop new products, manage our channels and customers more holistically and accelerate both organic and incremental growth.
Finally, before I turn the call over to Lee, we are proud that we just celebrated our 5-year anniversary as an independent company. And we are excited about our accomplishments over a relatively short period of time. Our teams executed extremely well and delivered outstanding results, but I'm even more excited about the foundation that we built to drive both organic and incremental growth over the next 5 years.
Notably, in our first 5 years, this team has nearly doubled our sales and more than doubled our operating margin. We've increased our EPS almost fivefold. We've deployed capital in value-creating ways, which include making 5 acquisitions for $1.4 billion, repurchasing over $900 million of our shares and initiating and consistently increasing a dividend. And we've delivered exceptional returns for our shareholders.
At the same time, we've evolved and positioned our businesses for future growth by building on our structural competitive advantages and our leading market share positions; creating stronger operating capabilities and platforms; driving new products, new programs and new distribution; investing in capacity and productivity; and by strengthening our management team and aligning incentives to focus on driving shareholder value.
With favorable demographics, driven by housing demand from the longer-living baby boomers and, increasingly, the millennials, we've seen an elongated new construction cycle and pent-up R&R demand being realized. These demand drivers, coupled with the stronger business model we have created, position us extremely well, not only for 2017, but for the next several years. 
Additionally, over the next 3 years, we continue to believe that we have the potential to deploy more than $2 billion to drive incremental growth and shareholder value through strategic acquisitions, share repurchases and increasing our dividend. 
To sum up, R&R demand was softer in the summer, but after accounting for inventory impacts and some market labor constraints, the core of our business continued to perform well, and we're maintaining share. So I'm quite comfortable at the top line performance as we head into the balance of the year, as we're picking up sales in the better parts of the market, which drive profitable growth. 
With respect to the bottom line, I am very pleased. Margins in the quarter were again strong, and we're pacing ahead of our planned long-term profit targets.
And lastly, I'm encouraged by what we've seen in terms of our orders over the last 5 weeks. It's a sign to me that fundamental demand is still healthy even if there was some softness this summer. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Lee who will review our third quarter financial performance and provide detail on our outlook for 2016."

As Brian mentioned, to best reflect ongoing business performance, the majority of my comments will focus on income before charges and gains from continuing operations.Let me start with our third quarter results. Sales were $1.28 billion,",1167,"Thanks, Chris. As Brian mentioned, to best reflect ongoing business performance, the majority of my comments will focus on income before charges and gains from continuing operations.
Let me start with our third quarter results. Sales were $1.28 billion, up 3% from a year ago. However, simply adjusting for the major program launch and [indiscernible] event in cabinets last year, company sales would be up 5%. 
Consolidated operating income for the quarter was $189 million, up 13% or $21 million compared to the same quarter last year.
EPS were $0.80 for the quarter versus $0.64 for the same quarter last year, increasing 25% or $0.16. Earnings were strong and ahead of expectations, driven by continued stronger operating performance and a lower tax rate.
Now let me provide more color on segment results. Our third quarter cabinet sales reflect the combination of very challenging comps and a softer R&R market. Sales were $602 million, approximately flat from the prior year but increased mid-single digits, excluding the major program launch and promotional event for in-stock vanities in the third quarter of 2015. Dealer sales increased low single digits from the prior year. [indiscernible] custom sales at dealers increased mid-single digits, while luxury products were lower this quarter. 
Sales from in-stock cabinets and vanities decreased due to the prior year product launch and promotional event. Excluding the prior year activity, which was $23 million of the total $38 million increase last year, in-stock cabinets and vanities sales increased around 7%. 
Remaining sales from home center semicustom, builder direct and Canada increased 6%. Within those remaining sales, Canada declined, largely due to the areas impacted by the downturn in the energy industry. 
In spite of flat sales, our Cabinet segment continued to increase its being operating margin. Operating income for the Cabinet segment increased $11 million or 17% over the prior year. Operating margin for the quarter increased 180 basis points to 12.4%. For the full year, we expect an operating margin of around 11% compared to 9% in 2015.
Turning to Plumbing. The GPG generated solid sales growth in the third quarter. Sales were $391 million, up $27 million or 7%. Excluding select channel inventory reductions and sales from acquisitions, sales increased 6%. Sales in Canada increased 8%, and China sales increased 11%.
In spite of around $7 million in additional brand spending, the GPG maintained its leading operating margin. Operating income increased $3 million to $85 million, up 4% from the prior year quarter. Operating margin for this segment was 21.7%. For the full year 2016, operating margin is expected to be over 21%, including incremental brand spending of $6 million in the fourth quarter.
Door sales were $129 million, up $5 million or 4% from the prior year quarter. Operating income increased 34% with an operating margin of 17.3%, which benefited around 100 basis points due to expense timing. Full year operating margin for this segment is expected to be around 12.5%. 
Security sales were $157 million in the third quarter, up 6% to the prior year. Segment operating income was $27 million, and the segment operating margin was 17%, which also benefited by nearly 100 basis points due to expense timing. For the full year 2016, operating margin is expected to be around 14%, with an expected fourth quarter margin of over 15%. 
To sum up consolidated third quarter performance, sales increased 3% and EPS were ahead of plan at $0.80. Our total company operating margin was 14.8%, up 130 basis points from the prior year, with an incremental margin of more than 50%. We are ahead's of plan on our operating margin growth and squarely on track to reach our goal of approaching 15% operating margin when the housing market returns to steady-state levels.
Before turning to the balance sheet, let me comment on the impact of lower cash rate. Our effective tax rate in the quarter is down from the prior year due to the previous adoption of the new accounting standard that requires companies to reflect the excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation transactions in their tax rate and EPS. While our previous guidance assumes some benefit in both the third and fourth quarters, our current guidance assumes all benefit was realized in the third quarter.
Let me now turn to the balance sheet. Our September 30 balance sheet remains solid with cash of $279 million, debt of $1.59 billion and our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage declined to 1.7x. By year-end, we expect leverage to decline another 10 to 20 basis points, excluding any additional capital 
transactions. 
Turning last to the details of our outlook for 2016.
Our market and sales assumption for 2016 now call for U.S. home products market growth of 6%, down from 6% to 7%, due to softer summer repair and remodel activity that Chris discussed earlier. 
Accordingly, we now assume total global market growth of 5%, down from our 5% to 6% expectation earlier in the year. 
Based on that market assumption, we now expect our full year 2016 sales to increase 9% to 10% compared to 2015. 
We have narrowed the range on our outlook for 2016 EPS to $2.72 to $2.76. The midpoint of our full year EPS outlook remained unchanged at $2.74 based on our continuing strong operating margin performance and the lower annual tax rate. The midpoint reflects a 32% increase over prior year EPS of $2.07. 
The guidance reflects a fourth quarter EPS range, which is unchanged, of $0.67 to $0.71 to achieve the annual EPS outlook of $2.72 to $2.76. 
Note that our year-to-date EPS through the third quarter are $2.05, which includes the benefit of a lower tax rate due to the adoption of the new accounting standard. Although we adopted this new standard in this year's second quarter, our year-to-date EPS of $2.05 also reflects the benefit of $0.04 attributable to the first quarter. This first quarter benefit will begin to be reflected in quarterly comparisons in 2017. 
We expect 2016 free cash flow to be around $400 million, with our conversion rate of over 90%. 
The annual EPS outlook includes the following assumptions: interest expense of around $50 million; a full year tax rate of approximately 29.5%, with no benefit in the fourth quarter from the previously mentioned new accounting standard; average fully diluted shares approximately 158 million. 
In summary, we are pleased with our performance so far this year and are set up for a strong 2017. The R& market growth was softer than expected in the third quarter, but recent trends and long-term fundamentals continue to point to solid demand and an elongated cycle. Our disciplined focus on profitable growth is working well, as we are ahead of plan and on track to hit our long-term operating margin goal of 15% as the housing market reaches its long-term average.
We remain focused on using our balance sheet and cash flow to drive incremental shareholder value through acquisitions and share repurchases. 
I will now pass the call back to Brian."

And so it was quiet, but in the past, we've had quiet Julys and things have picked up in August and September. This year, as we kind of move through August and continue to be pretty flat, I'd say there is activity in pockets, but there are other places where it was kind of quiet. Finally, as we kind of got into second, third week of September, things started picking up. So in many ways, order patterns picked up, and it was kind of too late to really drive third quarter. But since mid-September and through October, we're right back on our plans for where we thought the market would be really across all of our businesses. And so you kind of look at it and say, from what might have been kind of looking back in the mid-June through early part of September, we had a quiet R&R market. New constructions through this whole period kept rolling through. And as we look at the data, I think builders put a lot of attention into completing houses that were under construction. We come in, in the later stages of those homes. So to the extent we're delivering product into those homes, cabinet business builder, faucet business going in, doors business going in, that kept at a good pace. It was this R&R market was quiet. And a little color. Just in the channel feedback that we got, even for those who were out looking, they were feedback that the start the project now, there really wasn't the installation labor, carpenters, plumbers available until later in the fall. And so I don't know how much of that end up having to do with underlying activity. I'm sure some of it was the now more basic drivers because we're seeing confidence, et cetera. But there was this feedback looped inside our distribution that was kind of telling folks that the activity that most the contract is our booked up from the strong spring. And so installers weren't really available. That's freed up a bit. I'd still say there are some labor constraints out the market, but it's freed up a bit. And so I think that's passing through in some of the order activity that we see. I'd say that pretty consistent activity now through late September, October, across all the businesses. So that gives us the confidence to say we're going to come in where we thought we would in the fourth quarter. I have to call this the Goldilocks Year. First quarter, a little bit hot, a little bit too hot. Second quarter was kind of just right. Third quarter is a little bit cool, and looks like fourth quarter is going to be kind of like second quarter, which is basically back on plan. So altogether, a good year. It's just kind of cycling up and down. Not unusual. This is my eighth year on this business, our fifth year being public. And this whole recovery has had these kind of surges, flat spots, dips and then kind of back up. So as a company, we're used to this, we staff accordingly. We kind of take the rolling view of it all. And so that gives us pretty good confidence coming into the end of the year and, frankly, setting up '17."

Summer of '14, some weakness and so we took advantage of that, bought back 440 million of shares. Earlier this year, late January, February, some weakness in the market. We bought back 350 million or so shares. So to the extent there's soft spots, we'll take advantage of that, but I still see some good opportunities in acquisitions so then it'll balance those 2 between.

So we've been more disciplined than the other larger guys who are in the retail channel, just small part of our business, about 14% of our Cabinet business. And so we've been measured. I think we're third most aggressive of the 3. So we have seen elevated promotions, but we've kind of picked our spots. I'd say we were careful because we've got a big dealer business, in-stock business and vanities and in-stock. Those aren't promotional driven, so we don't really have to use promotions to drive volume. Maybe some others are more reliant upon it. And to the extent year more active on the promotion side, it's going to deteriorate margins. And so that's how we balance that. We're targeted, but as you can see from our margin improvements, we're not going that far into it because we're driving that margin improvement across cabinets. And we're getting good digitization and across our business coming out of dealer and coming out of in-stock. So -- and direct to build where, that business, we've obviously readjusted that over time here, but that's really attractive business. So the context where it is, we're participating -- but we're participating, to a lesser extent, I guess the other guys want to go knock themselves out, they can. And for us, there's some business there that we like and that we're partnering with the home centers around. But we have a certain point that we're not comfortable going past."

And there's a little loop in there where acquisitions and then feed into faster organic growth. So our real strategy within Plumbing is to become more multibranded, multiproduct, a wider spectrum of price points. We've got really strong channels strength in our geographies across North America and China, and we can put more through those channels, more brands, more volume. And we're looking at other geographies. So I'd say, in terms of dimensioning it, you can say half of it through acquisition, half of it through organic. But that's -- I'd say, that's rough estimate. Certainly, it's not anticipated to be all organic. And there could be even more upside or more aggressive on the acquisition side. So it's all -- in terms of putting that number out there, we're just trying to create an understanding of how we're looking at it and, frankly, how significant it could be just based on some of the things we're looking at and the power that we see of bringing more through the channels and that we've got and leveraging the brands that we've got. Moen is obviously a huge brand. We think we can do more with it. We required some additional brands. We think we can acquire some other brands. And so it's just great expectation, and internally, it's the way we're talking about what the opportunity could be."

You think about our spectrum of products that we're making from in-stock vanities through semicustom up to our more custom business. And these guys are really on the ball. So if I break it down, we've got better operating efficiency going to the plants. We still have capacity. We made our big capacity investments a couple of years ago. They're just getting better at running it, and we frankly got more volume coming through, so that's part of it. Part of it is we're getting some synergy benefit from Norcraft. You're seeing that come through. They've been aggressive in driving that and improving the operations of the acquired Norcraft businesses. And at some of it is just mix. As we've said, we target profitable growth in the market. We're not chasing every dollar of sales out there. And within the relationships that we've got, we're driving a stronger mix, and that's coming through finishes, that's coming through more complicated projects. And we spend a lot of time off the field with the designers, helping them really design the product into the what consumer's looking for, and that yields a higher mix for us. So you take all those 3 things together, and the team's really been driving things together to improve that margin. We're headed toward mid-teens. That's what we said that business is capable of doing. And we're well on track with that, and the team's focused on it and continue to see improvement in '17 and '18 as we're moving up to that."

So in saying that the veteran of the market is a little softer it's relative to last year. But inside of that segment, we're still driving mix. So it's kind of like saying that, in proportion, as you're saying across all of these price points, if the very high end is a smaller proportion, that doesn't hurt that mix. Well, within side of those, you continue to drive mix, which is continuing to drive margin. It's really kind of fundamental. It's cabinets. It's also inside deposits its inside of doors. When we talk about growing a little faster than the rest of the market by driving innovation, what we're really driving at is bringing new products in that's going to drive that mix up and then working with the channels to allow them or to help them sell that mix through. And that, you can see it as you kind of go through average ASP by price point in cabinets, it's coming through all those. If I look at the Plumbing division and look at Moen in our wholesale segment going into new construction, we're driving it from kind of spec to first upgrade, first upgrade to second upgrade. We continue to see that move up. In doors, we're getting better attachment rates on glass, decorative class, sidelights and so we're driving that by bring out new styles and we are doing that makes up. When you talk generally about mix, it's kind of inside of those price points and inside of those categories. That's where all of our innovation work is going to drive that up."

So I say looking back versus 3 years ago where it was more kind of spread across Tier 1, 2, 3, 4. A lot of the activity we're seeing now is more concentrated in those stronger and better developed markets, which is, again, good because we typically see a better mix coming through there, better price points, through those Tier 1, Tier 2 markets.

Our teams delivered profitable growth in the third quarter in the face of challenging comps, select channel inventory reductions and slower-than-anticipated repair and remodel activity.
Importantly, our business has remained focused on targeting the most attractive segments of our markets, and we delivered strong profit performance across all 4 segments. Since late September and through the month of October, we've seen the pace of orders across our business strengthen, returning to levels that we would expect. So based on our solid third quarter performance, consistent execution and our current assumption for market growth, we're revising our full year outlook for sales growth to 9% to 10% while confirming our previous EPS outlook.
Let me first spend some time on our view of the U.S. home products market, followed by my thoughts on our business performance in the third quarter. Then I would like to discuss the recent creation of our Global Plumbing Group and why we view this platform as the first step to further accelerating growth in the Plumbing segment.
And finally, since we've just celebrated our 5-year anniversary as an independent company, I'll provide my perspectives on the company that we have built and how we have positioned ourselves to maximize growth and value for the years ahead. Lee will then provide more details on our third quarter performance and our 2016 outlook.
Starting with our view of the U.S. home products market. In the third quarter, the market for our home products grew at the lower end of the pace that we expected. We estimate that repair and remodel activity grew at around 4% and new construction grew generally as expected.
Our business has experienced repair and remodel activity that began to slow in July and was clearly slower throughout August and the first half of September. While demand was slower over this period, our channels also reported a tighter labor market and available contractors and tradespeople to take on incrementally more projects over the summer months after a fast start to the year.
Notably, over the past 5 weeks, we've seen R&R activity and order patterns improve and more consistent with what we would expect starting in mid-September and continuing through October. And consumers continued to drive an improving mix within our categories.
New construction demand continues to grow as expected, with single-family growing faster than multi-family and single-family entry-level activity continuing to improve.
Looking at the full year 2016. Our overall assumption is that the U.S. home products market, which impacts 70% of our sales, grows at a combined rate of around 6%.
Within the year, we saw upside in the first quarter driven by better weather. Second quarter was pretty much as we expected. The third quarter saw a slower repair and remodel activity, partially due to labor constraints. And with our current visibility to order patterns, the fourth quarter is shaping up to be on plan. Taken together, 2016 will be a good year.
Looking forward, our basket of near-term indicators for the home products market remains pointed to strong underlying demand, some constraints in skilled labor, significant levels of single-family new construction activity and continued market momentum as we head into 2017.
Now let me provide some perspective on our business performance. For the third quarter, our teams delivered strong performance across all operating segments. Sales increased 3% and total company operating margin increased to 14.8%. 
Starting with our Cabinet segment. We continue to follow a disciplined strategy focused on profitable growth. Our consistent pace of product innovation and our high levels of reliable service to our channel partners continue to drive performance. In the third quarter, our overall cabinet sales were flat to the prior year; and operating margins, driven by increasingly efficient operations and an improving mix, expanded to 12.4%. 
Excluding last year's third quarter load-in to support a major new vanity program launch and promotional timing, our total cabinet sales increased mid-single digits in the quarter and the dealer channel sales grew low single digits overall. However, sales grew solid mid-single digits in all of our core semi-custom product lines, and we continue to see mix improve.
In our luxury lines, which make up a little more than 25% of our dealer channel volume, sales were lower. Overall, dealers are seeing strong growth from our new construction products. We're benefiting from deeper relationships with existing customers and we're beginning to see some cross-sell benefits from our Norcraft acquisition.
Sales for our in-stock cabinets and vanities, which are sold through home centers, were down but grew high single digits when adjusted for the comparison to last year's load-in and promotional timing in the third quarter.
The sell-through of the new program and product upgrades that we launched last year are performing very well, and we're planning for the launch of additional new programs in 2017. Our cabinet team has been focused on partnering with our customers to continue to deliver on consumer trends and drive growth in our in-stock cabinet and vanity programs.
The remaining 25% to 30% of our Cabinets business, which includes home center special order semi-custom, builder direct in targeted markets and Canada, grew mid-single digits. We're disciplined in our approach to these segments as we focus on where we can partner with our customers to capture profitable growth. With our focused approach, we grew share in these segments and drove strong margin improvement. We're especially pleased with our home center special order business where our partnership approach is working well and driving growth at above-market rates with an improving mix.
In summary, I feel good about our industry-leading Cabinet business. We continue to execute well and deliver strong results even in a quarter where the market was not as strong as we planned. We're building share in the most attractive segments of the market. Our plans are increasingly more efficient, and our new product introductions and program wins are helping us drive a richer mix across a number of price points in the market.
For our Plumbing segment, sales were up 7% for the quarter, with solid mix and strong operating margin. Excluding select channel inventory reductions and sales from the recent acquisitions, sales increased 6% driven by strength in U.S. wholesale, China and Canada.
Across our markets, we continue to see consumers trade up and our mix improve, as innovation and design, finish and function attracts consumers who trust our brand.
As we look at the remainder of the year, our growth should benefit from incremental marketing spend, healthy new construction market and more focused on recently launched products.
Sales in Canada were up high single digits to the prior year where we are gaining share. Notably, we continue to see strong growth in the urban markets with our home center partners.
China sales increased double digits versus the prior year. Sales gains were broad across the China business, particularly in on our Moen-branded stores, where we continue to drive increased productivity.
Doors reported sales were up 4% for the quarter. Door products again saw sales growth in both wholesale and retail.
Therma-Tru continues to benefit from the rollout of a refreshed retail strategy that includes an enhanced product line, simpler, more intuitive displays and better sales support for our customers' associates.
And in wholesale, we continue to benefit from strong new construction placements and our enhanced distribution in the Southern and Western U.S.
In the Security segment, sales increased 6% from the prior year quarter and were up approximately 8%, excluding the negative impact of the planned exit of some less-profitable SentrySafe products. The growth came from multiple channels and geographies, and we are beginning to see profit improvement from the integration of SentrySafe into Master Lock. 
We are also ramping up our Sentry sales efforts as we continue to be excited about the opportunities we see between our Master Lock and Sentry businesses over the next few years.
So to recap the quarter: Our teams are consistently leveraging our competitive advantages to deliver profitable growth. We executed well in a U.S. home products market that is continuing to expand despite periodic labor constraints among installers and tradesmen. And we are gaining momentum in our Security business with the Sentry integration behind us.
Now let me turn to the newly formed Global Plumbing Group, which is a key strategic step to enable accelerated, organic and incremental long-term growth.
The approach to the GPG is much like the evolution of our Cabinets business into a platform that can support multiple brands across multiple price points, sold into leading channel positions, supported by dedicated supply chains. The new GPG platform structure should allow us to accelerate growth while leveraging our global supply chain and strong distribution. It paves the way for additional acquisitions, joint ventures and supply agreements and allows for seamless integration and continued growth.
While only an initial step, we've recently made our first 2 acquisitions as part of this new platform. Riobel is a premium Canadian showroom brand, which brings strong innovation and best-in-class service. We also recently purchased ROHL, which includes both the ROHL and Perrin & Rowe brands, which bring a design-centric, artisanal approach to luxury products. Under the GPG, these additions now have even greater potential for profitable growth.
The new Global Plumbing Group enhances the potential for future growth as we look to grow our plumbing sales to $2.5 billion by 2020. We are excited about the opportunity to transform our business, enter new markets, develop new products, manage our channels and customers more holistically and accelerate both organic and incremental growth.
Finally, before I turn the call over to Lee, we're proud that we just celebrated our 5-year anniversary as an independent company, and we're excited about our accomplishments over a relatively short period of time. Our teams have executed extremely well and delivered outstanding results, but I'm even more excited about the foundation that we've built to drive both organic and incremental growth over the next 5 years.
Notably, in our first 5 years, this team has nearly doubled our sales and more than doubled our operating margin. We've increased our EPS almost fivefold. We've deployed capital in value-creating ways, which include making 5 acquisitions for $1.4 billion, repurchasing over $900 million of our shares and initiating and consistently increasing the dividend. And we've delivered exceptional returns for our shareholders.
At the same time, we've evolved and positioned our businesses for future growth by building on our structural competitive advantages and our leading market share positions; creating stronger operating capabilities and platforms; driving new products, new programs and new distribution; investing in capacity and productivity; and by strengthening our management team and aligning incentives to focus on driving shareholder value.
With favorable demographics, driven by housing demand from the longer-living baby boomers and increasingly the millennials, we see an elongated new construction cycle and pent-up R&R demand being realized. These demand drivers, coupled with the stronger business model we have created, position us extremely well, not only for 2017 but for the next several years.
Additionally, over the next 3 years, we continue to believe that we have the potential to deploy more than $2 billion to drive incremental growth and shareholder value through strategic acquisitions, share repurchases and increasing our dividends.
To sum up, R&R demand was softer in the summer. But after accounting for inventory impacts and some market labor constraints, the core of our business continued to perform well, and we're maintaining share. So I'm quite comfortable with the top line performance as we head into the balance of the year, as we're picking up sales in the better parts of the market, which drive profitable growth.
With respect to the bottom line, I am very pleased. Margins in the quarter were again strong, and we're pacing ahead of our planned long-term profit targets.
And lastly, I'm encouraged by what we've seen in terms of our orders over the last 5 weeks. It's a sign to me that fundamental demand is still healthy even if there was some softness this summer. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Lee who will review our third quarter financial performance and provide detail on our outlook for 2016."

As Brian mentioned, to best reflect ongoing business performance, the majority of my comments will focus on income before charges and gains from continuing operations.Let me start with our third quarter results. Sales were $1.28 billion,",1168,"Thanks, Chris. As Brian mentioned, to best reflect ongoing business performance, the majority of my comments will focus on income before charges and gains from continuing operations.
Let me start with our third quarter results. Sales were $1.28 billion, up 3% from a year ago. However, simply adjusting for the major program launch and promo event in cabinets last year, company sales would be up 5%. 
Consolidated operating income for the quarter was $189 million, up 13% or $21 million compared to the same quarter last year.
EPS were $0.80 for the quarter versus $0.64 for the same quarter last year, increasing 25% or $0.16. Earnings were strong and ahead of expectations, driven by continued stronger operating performance and a lower tax rate.
Now let me provide more color on segment results. Our third quarter cabinet sales reflect the combination of very challenging comps and a softer R&R market. Sales were $602 million, approximately flat from the prior year but increased mid-single digits, excluding the major program launch and promotional event for in-stock vanities in the third quarter of 2015. Dealer sales increased low single digits from the prior year. Core semi-custom sales at dealers increased mid-single digits, while luxury products were lower this quarter.
Sales from in-stock cabinets and vanities decreased due to the prior year product launch and promotional event. Excluding the prior year activity, which was $23 million of the total $38 million increase last year, in-stock cabinets and vanities sales increased around 7%. Remaining sales from home center semi-custom, builder direct and Canada increased 6%. Within those remaining sales, Canada declined, largely due to the areas impacted by the downturn in the energy industry.
In spite of flat sales, our Cabinet segment continued to increase its leading operating margin. Operating income for the Cabinet segment increased $11 million or 17% over the prior year. Operating margin for the quarter increased 180 basis points to 12.4%. For the full year, we expect an operating margin of around 11% compared to 9% in 2015.
Turning to Plumbing. The GPG generated solid sales growth in the third quarter. Sales were $391 million, up $27 million or 7%. Excluding select channel inventory reductions and sales from acquisitions, sales increased 6%. Sales in Canada increased 8% and China sales increased 11%.
In spite of around $7 million in additional brand spending, the GPG maintained its leading operating margin. Operating income increased $3 million to $85 million, up 4% from the prior year quarter. Operating margin for this segment was 21.7%. For the full year 2016, operating margin is expected to be over 21%, including incremental brand spending of $6 million in the fourth quarter.
Door sales were $129 million, up $5 million or 4% from the prior year quarter. Operating income increased 34% with an operating margin of 17.3%, which benefited by around 100 basis points due to expense timing. Full year operating margin for this segment is expected to be around 12.5%.
Security sales were $157 million in the third quarter, up 6% to the prior year. Segment operating income was $27 million and the segment operating margin was 17%, which also benefited by nearly 100 basis points due to expense timing. For the full year 2016, operating margin is expected to be around 14%, with an expected fourth quarter margin of over 15%.
To sum up consolidated third quarter performance, sales increased 3% and EPS were ahead of plan at $0.80. Our total company operating margin was 14.8%, up 130 basis points from the prior year with an incremental margin of more than 50%. We are ahead of plan on our operating margin growth and squarely on track to reach our goal of approaching 15% operating margin when the housing market returns to steady-state levels.
Before turning to the balance sheet, let me comment on the impact of lower tax rate. Our effective tax rate in the quarter is down from the prior year due to the previous adoption of the new accounting standard that requires companies to reflect the excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation transactions in their tax rate and EPS. While our previous guidance assumes some benefit in both the third and fourth quarters, our current guidance assumes all benefit was realized in the third quarter.
Let me now turn to the balance sheet. Our September 30 balance sheet remains solid with cash of $279 million, debt of $1.59 billion and our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage declined to 1.7x. By year-end, we expect leverage to decline another 10 to 20 basis points, excluding any additional capital
transactions.
Turning now to the details of our outlook for 2016. Our market and sales assumption for 2016 now call for U.S. home products market growth of 6%, down from 6% to 7% due to softer summer repair and remodel activity that Chris discussed earlier. Accordingly, we now assume total global market growth of 5%, down from our 5% to 6% expectation earlier in the year. 
Based on that market assumption, we now expect our full year 2016 sales to increase 9% to 10% compared to 2015. 
We have narrowed the range on our outlook for 2016 EPS to $2.72 to $2.76. The midpoint of our full year EPS outlook remained unchanged at $2.74 based on our continuing strong operating margin performance and the lower annual tax rate. The midpoint reflects a 32% increase over prior year EPS of $2.07. The guidance reflects a fourth quarter EPS range, which is unchanged, of $0.67 to $0.71 to achieve the annual EPS outlook of $2.72 to $2.76.
Note that our year-to-date EPS through the third quarter are $2.05, which includes the benefit of a lower tax rate due to the adoption of the new accounting standard. Although we adopted this new standard in this year's second quarter, our year-to-date EPS of $2.05 also reflects the benefit of $0.04 attributable to the first quarter. This first quarter benefit will begin to be reflected in quarterly comparisons in 2017.
We expect 2016 free cash flow to be around $400 million with a conversion rate of over 90%.
The annual EPS outlook includes the following assumptions: interest expense of around $50 million; a full year tax rate of approximately 29.5%, with no benefit in the fourth quarter from the previously mentioned new accounting standard; average fully diluted shares of approximately 158 million.
In summary, we're pleased with our performance so far this year and are set up for a strong 2017. The R&R market growth was softer than expected in the third quarter, but recent trends and long-term fundamentals continue to point to solid demand and an elongated cycle. Our disciplined focus on profitable growth is working well, as we are ahead of plan and on track to hit our long-term operating margin goal of 15% as the housing market reaches its long-term average.
We remain focused on using our balance sheet and cash flow to drive incremental shareholder value through acquisitions and share repurchases.
I will now pass the call back to Brian."

But in the past, we've had quiet Julys and things have picked up in August and September. This year, as we kind of move through August, it continued to be pretty flat. I'd say there is activity in pockets, but there are other places where it was kind of quiet. Finally, as we kind of got into second, third week of September, things started picking up. So in many ways, order patterns picked up, and it was kind of too late to really drive third quarter. But since mid-September and through October, we're right back on our plans for where we thought the market would be, really, across all of our businesses. And so you kind of look at it and say, from what might have been kind of looking back kind of mid-June through early part of September, we had a quiet R&R market. New constructions through this whole period kept rolling through. And as we look at the data, I think builders put a lot of attention into completing houses that were under construction. We come in, in the later stages of those homes. So to the extent we're delivering product into those homes, cabinet business, direct to builder, faucet business going in, doors business going in, that kept at a good pace. It was just this R&R market was quiet. I'd give you a little color. Just in the channel feedback that we got, even for those who were out looking -- there were, again, feedback that -- to start a project now, there really wasn't the installation labor, carpenters, plumbers available until later in the fall. And so I don't know how much of that end up having to do with underlying activity. I'm sure some of it was the more basic drivers: consumer confidence, et cetera. But there was this feedback looped inside of our distribution that was kind of telling folks that the activity -- that most of the contractors were booked up from the strong spring. And so installers weren't really available. That's freed up a bit. I'd still say there's some labor constraints out in the market, but it's freed up a bit. And so I think that's passing through in some of the order activity that we see. I'd say that pretty consistent activity now through late September, October across all the businesses. So that gives us the confidence to say we're going to come in where we thought we would in the fourth quarter. I've been calling this the Goldilocks year. First quarter, a little bit hot, a little bit too hot. Second quarter was kind of just right. Third quarter is a little bit cool. And looks like fourth quarter is going to be kind of like second quarter, which is basically back on plan. So altogether, a good year. It's just kind of cycling up and down. Not unusual. This is my eighth year running this business, our fifth year being public. And this whole recovery has had these kind of surges, flat spots, dips and then kind of back up. So as a company, we're used to this. We staff accordingly. We kind of take the rolling view of it all. And so that gives us pretty good confidence coming into the end of the year and, frankly, setting up '17."

To the extent that market is soft overall, we've shown that we've been opportunistic in buying back shares. Summer of '14, some weakness, and so we took advantage of that, bought back 440 million of shares. Earlier this year, late January, February, some weakness in the market, we bought back 350 million or so shares. So to the extent there's soft spots, we'll take advantage of that. But I still see some good opportunities in acquisitions, so that will balance those 2 between. We've said from the start, for the last 5 years, we're going to be efficient with our cash flow. We're not stockpiling cash. We're trying to be efficient for our shareholders to create value. And so that's kind of our mindset as we lean into this whole thing."

So we have seen elevated promotions, but we've kind of picked our spots. I'd say we were careful because we've got such a big dealer business, our in-stock business and vanities and in-stock kitchens, those aren't promotional driven. So we don't really have to use promotions to drive volume. Maybe some others are more reliant upon it. And to the extent you're more active on the promotion side, it's going to deteriorate margins. So that's how we balance that. We're targeted. But as you can see from our margin improvements, we're not going that far into it because we're driving that margin improvement across cabinets. And we're getting good utilization across our business coming out of dealer and coming out of in-stock. So -- and direct to builder, where -- that business, we've obviously readjusted that over time here, but that's really an attractive business.

And it really strikes to the core of why we form the Global Plumbing Group is we think it's a combination of both organic and acquisitions. And there's a little loop in there where acquisitions then feed into faster organic growth. So our real strategy within Plumbing is to become more multi-branded, multiproduct, a wider spectrum of price points. We've got really strong channel strength in our geographies across North America and China, and we can put more through those channels more brands, more volume. And we're looking at other geographies. So I'd say in terms of dimensioning it, you could say half of it through acquisition, half of it through organic. But that's -- I'd say that's rough estimate. Certainly, it's not anticipated to be all organic. And there could be even more upside or more aggressive on the acquisition side. So it's all -- in terms of putting that number out there, we're just trying to create an understanding of how we're looking at it and, frankly, how significant it could be just based on some of the things we're looking at and the power we see of bringing more through the channel strength that we've got and leveraging the brands that we've got.

We're working through that. Frankly, I didn't want to -- we had to get the SentrySafe integration done operationally before, I think, we wanted to move too aggressively into other acquisitions that then have to be integrated. But we got through that milestone this summer, so I think we've freed up some management capacity. And we'll be excited to bring some more product in there. And so when we talk about our acquisition pipeline, that's very much a part of that pipeline."

We probably have 100 basis points on that, which were just some timing of expenses, which gets you down to 16%. I think the thing you're saying in that margin growth, and it's been that way throughout the year, is the structural advantages we have with the strength in wholesale that we established 2 to 3 years ago, especially on the West Coast. You also see that in the last 18 months a real thrust towards the retail and driving the retail side of the business, and that's driving those margins up. We get good leverage in that business. It's a lot like Cabinets. You can really leverage those manufacturing assets well. That's what's happening. We would expect it to continue when you think about -- they finished the year last year with about a 10% operating margin. We think they'll be 12.5 this year, very much like Cabinets, heading back to mid-teens margins at steady state. So them and cabinets, very similar in their margin growth and the same kind of potential to get there."

And then you kind of saw it accelerate similarly kind of across the business. So it's hard to pinpoint it any more than that. It felt like the general market. There's a -- I don't know how to attribute it to. Underlying consumer demand, which I think was part of it, but also it felt like the whole system is a little bit backed up. The ability for R&R activity to get started anew when you've got a lot of project that are coming in, and we're fulfilling a lot of the activity coming out of the spring, the channels felt backed up. And again, I can't be precise to say, well, how much was related to consumer, how much was related to the channel backed up. But it felt like it was a combination of both those things.

Well, with inside of those, you continue to drive mix, which is continuing to drive margin. It's really kind of fundamental. It's cabinets. It's also inside of faucets. It's inside of doors. When we talk about growing a little faster than the rest of the market by driving innovation, what we're really driving at is bringing new product in that's going to drive that mix up and then working with the channels to allow them or to help them sell that mix through. And that -- you can see it as I kind of go through average ASP by price points in cabinets. It's coming through all those. If I look at the Plumbing division and look at Moen in our wholesale segment going into new construction, we're driving it from kind of spec to first upgrade, first upgrade to second upgrade. We continue to see that move up. In Doors, we're getting better attachment rates on glass, decorative glass, sidelights. And so we're driving that by bringing out new styles. We're driving that mix up. Because when I talk generally about mix, it's kind of inside of those price points and inside of those categories.

And so to the extent that the channel is pretty lean, as you see some surge in demand, typically, we have to ship back into that. So on the one hand, it's healthy and then it doesn't give us any help. It's a bit of a headwind in the existing quarter. But you know that's further demand that will come about as the market calls for it. We've gotten good at servicing this business. So to a certain extent, they're leaning on us, and that's fine.

So I'd say, looking back versus 3 years ago, where it was more kind of spread across Tier 1, 2, 3, 4, a lot of the activity we're seeing now is more concentrated in those stronger, better developed markets, which is, again, good because we typically see a better mix coming through there, better price points coming through those Tier 1, Tier 2 markets.

Our teams delivered profitable growth in the third quarter in the face of challenging comps, select channel inventory reductions and slower-than-anticipated repair and remodel activity.
Importantly, our business has remained focused on targeting the most attractive segments of our markets, and we delivered strong profit performance across all 4 segments. Since late September and through the month of October, we've seen the pace of orders across our business strengthen, returning to levels that we would expect. So based on our solid third quarter performance, consistent execution and our current assumption for market growth, we're revising our full year outlook for sales growth to 9% to 10% while confirming our previous EPS outlook.
Let me first spend some time on our view of the U.S. home products market, followed by my thoughts on our business performance in the third quarter. Then I would like to discuss the recent creation of our Global Plumbing Group and why we view this platform as the first step to further accelerating growth in the Plumbing segment.
And finally, since we've just celebrated our 5-year anniversary as an independent company, I'll provide my perspectives on the company that we have built and how we have positioned ourselves to maximize growth and value for the years ahead. Lee will then provide more details on our third quarter performance and our 2016 outlook.
Starting with our view of the U.S. home products market. In the third quarter, the market for our home products grew at the lower end of the pace that we expected. We estimate that repair and remodel activity grew at around 4% and new construction grew generally as expected.
Our business has experienced repair and remodel activity that began to slow in July and was clearly slower throughout August and the first half of September. While demand was slower over this period, our channels also reported a tighter labor market and available contractors and tradespeople to take on incrementally more projects over the summer months after a fast start to the year.
Notably, over the past 5 weeks, we've seen R&R activity and order patterns improve and more consistent with what we would expect starting in mid-September and continuing through October. And consumers continued to drive an improving mix within our categories.
New construction demand continues to grow as expected, with single-family growing faster than multi-family and single-family entry-level activity continuing to improve.
Looking at the full year 2016. Our overall assumption is that the U.S. home products market, which impacts 70% of our sales, grows at a combined rate of around 6%.
Within the year, we saw upside in the first quarter driven by better weather. Second quarter was pretty much as we expected. The third quarter saw a slower repair and remodel activity, partially due to labor constraints. And with our current visibility to order patterns, the fourth quarter is shaping up to be on plan. Taken together, 2016 will be a good year.
Looking forward, our basket of near-term indicators for the home products market remains pointed to strong underlying demand, some constraints in skilled labor, significant levels of single-family new construction activity and continued market momentum as we head into 2017.
Now let me provide some perspective on our business performance. For the third quarter, our teams delivered strong performance across all operating segments. Sales increased 3% and total company operating margin increased to 14.8%. 
Starting with our Cabinet segment. We continue to follow a disciplined strategy focused on profitable growth. Our consistent pace of product innovation and our high levels of reliable service to our channel partners continue to drive performance. In the third quarter, our overall cabinet sales were flat to the prior year; and operating margins, driven by increasingly efficient operations and an improving mix, expanded to 12.4%. 
Excluding last year's third quarter load-in to support a major new vanity program launch and promotional timing, our total cabinet sales increased mid-single digits in the quarter and the dealer channel sales grew low single digits overall. However, sales grew solid mid-single digits in all of our core semi-custom product lines, and we continue to see mix improve.
In our luxury lines, which make up a little more than 25% of our dealer channel volume, sales were lower. Overall, dealers are seeing strong growth from our new construction products. We're benefiting from deeper relationships with existing customers and we're beginning to see some cross-sell benefits from our Norcraft acquisition.
Sales for our in-stock cabinets and vanities, which are sold through home centers, were down but grew high single digits when adjusted for the comparison to last year's load-in and promotional timing in the third quarter.
The sell-through of the new program and product upgrades that we launched last year are performing very well, and we're planning for the launch of additional new programs in 2017. Our cabinet team has been focused on partnering with our customers to continue to deliver on consumer trends and drive growth in our in-stock cabinet and vanity programs.
The remaining 25% to 30% of our Cabinets business, which includes home center special order semi-custom, builder direct in targeted markets and Canada, grew mid-single digits. We're disciplined in our approach to these segments as we focus on where we can partner with our customers to capture profitable growth. With our focused approach, we grew share in these segments and drove strong margin improvement. We're especially pleased with our home center special order business where our partnership approach is working well and driving growth at above-market rates with an improving mix.
In summary, I feel good about our industry-leading Cabinet business. We continue to execute well and deliver strong results even in a quarter where the market was not as strong as we planned. We're building share in the most attractive segments of the market. Our plans are increasingly more efficient, and our new product introductions and program wins are helping us drive a richer mix across a number of price points in the market.
For our Plumbing segment, sales were up 7% for the quarter, with solid mix and strong operating margin. Excluding select channel inventory reductions and sales from the recent acquisitions, sales increased 6% driven by strength in U.S. wholesale, China and Canada.
Across our markets, we continue to see consumers trade up and our mix improve, as innovation and design, finish and function attracts consumers who trust our brand.
As we look at the remainder of the year, our growth should benefit from incremental marketing spend, a healthy new construction market and more focus on recently launched products.
Sales in Canada were up high single digits to the prior year where we are gaining share. Notably, we continue to see strong growth in the urban markets with our home center partners.
China sales increased double digits versus the prior year. Sales gains were broad across the China business, particularly in on our Moen-branded stores, where we continue to drive increased productivity.
Doors reported sales were up 4% for the quarter. Door products again saw sales growth in both wholesale and retail.
Therma-Tru continues to benefit from the rollout of a refreshed retail strategy that includes an enhanced product line, simpler, more intuitive displays and better sales support for our customers' associates.
And in wholesale, we continue to benefit from strong new construction placements and our enhanced distribution in the Southern and Western U.S.
In the Security segment, sales increased 6% from the prior year quarter and were up approximately 8%, excluding the negative impact of the planned exit of some less-profitable SentrySafe product lines. The growth came from multiple channels and geographies, and we are beginning to see profit improvement from the integration of SentrySafe into Master Lock. 
We are also ramping up our Sentry sales efforts as we continue to be excited about the opportunities we see between our Master Lock and Sentry businesses over the next few years.
So to recap the quarter: Our teams are consistently leveraging our competitive advantages to deliver profitable growth. We executed well in a U.S. home products market that is continuing to expand despite periodic labor constraints among installers and tradesmen. And we are gaining momentum in our Security business with the Sentry integration behind us.
Now let me turn to the newly formed Global Plumbing Group, which is a key strategic step to enable accelerated, organic and incremental long-term growth.
The approach to the GPG is much like the evolution of our Cabinets business into a platform that can support multiple brands across multiple price points, sold into leading channel positions, supported by dedicated supply chains. The new GPG platform structure should allow us to accelerate growth while leveraging our global supply chain and strong distribution. It paves the way for additional acquisitions, joint ventures and supply agreements and allows for seamless integration and continued growth.
While only an initial step, we've recently made our first 2 acquisitions as part of this new platform. Riobel is a premium Canadian showroom brand, which brings strong innovation and best-in-class service. We also recently purchased ROHL, which includes both the ROHL and Perrin & Rowe brands, which bring a design-centric, artisanal approach to luxury products. Under the GPG, these additions now have even greater potential for profitable growth.
The new Global Plumbing Group enhances the potential for future growth as we look to grow our plumbing sales to $2.5 billion by 2020. We are excited about the opportunity to transform our business, enter new markets, develop new products, manage our channels and customers more holistically and accelerate both organic and incremental growth.
Finally, before I turn the call over to Lee, we're proud that we just celebrated our 5-year anniversary as an independent company, and we're excited about our accomplishments over a relatively short period of time. Our teams have executed extremely well and delivered outstanding results, but I'm even more excited about the foundation that we've built to drive both organic and incremental growth over the next 5 years.
Notably, in our first 5 years, this team has nearly doubled our sales and more than doubled our operating margin. We've increased our EPS almost fivefold. We've deployed capital in value-creating ways, which include making 5 acquisitions for $1.4 billion, repurchasing over $900 million of our shares and initiating and consistently increasing a dividend. And we've delivered exceptional returns for our shareholders.
At the same time, we've evolved and positioned our businesses for future growth by building on our structural competitive advantages and our leading market share positions; creating stronger operating capabilities and platforms; driving new products, new programs and new distribution; investing in capacity and productivity; and by strengthening our management team and aligning incentives to focus on driving shareholder value.
With favorable demographics, driven by housing demand from the longer-living baby boomers and increasingly the millennials, we see an elongated new construction cycle and pent-up R&R demand being realized. These demand drivers, coupled with the stronger business model we have created, position us extremely well, not only for 2017 but for the next several years.
Additionally, over the next 3 years, we continue to believe that we have the potential to deploy more than $2 billion to drive incremental growth and shareholder value through strategic acquisitions, share repurchases and increasing our dividends.
To sum up, R&R demand was softer in the summer. But after accounting for inventory impacts and some market labor constraints, the core of our business continued to perform well, and we're maintaining share. So I'm quite comfortable with the top line performance as we head into the balance of the year, as we're picking up sales in the better parts of the market, which drive profitable growth.
With respect to the bottom line, I am very pleased. Margins in the quarter were again strong, and we're pacing ahead of our planned long-term profit targets.
And lastly, I'm encouraged by what we've seen in terms of our orders over the last 5 weeks. It's a sign to me that fundamental demand is still healthy even if there was some softness this summer. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Lee who will review our third quarter financial performance and provide detail on our outlook for 2016."

As Brian mentioned, to best reflect ongoing business performance, the majority of my comments will focus on income before charges and gains from continuing operations.Let me start with our third quarter results. Sales were $1.28 billion,",1168,"Thanks, Chris. As Brian mentioned, to best reflect ongoing business performance, the majority of my comments will focus on income before charges and gains from continuing operations.
Let me start with our third quarter results. Sales were $1.28 billion, up 3% from a year ago. However, simply adjusting for the major program launch and promo event in cabinets last year, company sales would be up 5%. 
Consolidated operating income for the quarter was $189 million, up 13% or $21 million compared to the same quarter last year.
EPS were $0.80 for the quarter versus $0.64 for the same quarter last year, increasing 25% or $0.16. Earnings were strong and ahead of expectations, driven by continued stronger operating performance and a lower tax rate.
Now let me provide more color on segment results. Our third quarter cabinet sales reflect the combination of very challenging comps and a softer R&R market. Sales were $602 million, approximately flat from the prior year but increased mid-single digits, excluding the major program launch and promotional event for in-stock vanities in the third quarter of 2015. Dealer sales increased low single digits from the prior year. Core semi-custom sales at dealers increased mid-single digits, while luxury products were lower this quarter.
Sales from in-stock cabinets and vanities decreased due to the prior year product launch and promotional event. Excluding the prior year activity, which was $23 million of the total $38 million increase last year, in-stock cabinets and vanities sales increased around 7%. Remaining sales from home center semi-custom, builder direct and Canada increased 6%. Within those remaining sales, Canada declined, largely due to the areas impacted by the downturn in the energy industry.
In spite of flat sales, our Cabinet segment continued to increase its leading operating margin. Operating income for the Cabinet segment increased $11 million or 17% over the prior year. Operating margin for the quarter increased 180 basis points to 12.4%. For the full year, we expect an operating margin of around 11% compared to 9% in 2015.
Turning to Plumbing. The GPG generated solid sales growth in the third quarter. Sales were $391 million, up $27 million or 7%. Excluding select channel inventory reductions and sales from acquisitions, sales increased 6%. Sales in Canada increased 8% and China sales increased 11%.
In spite of around $7 million in additional brand spending, the GPG maintained its leading operating margin. Operating income increased $3 million to $85 million, up 4% from the prior year quarter. Operating margin for this segment was 21.7%. For the full year 2016, operating margin is expected to be over 21%, including incremental brand spending of $6 million in the fourth quarter.
Door sales were $129 million, up $5 million or 4% from the prior year quarter. Operating income increased 34% with an operating margin of 17.3%, which benefited by around 100 basis points due to expense timing. Full year operating margin for this segment is expected to be around 12.5%.
Security sales were $157 million in the third quarter, up 6% to the prior year. Segment operating income was $27 million and the segment operating margin was 17%, which also benefited by nearly 100 basis points due to expense timing. For the full year 2016, operating margin is expected to be around 14%, with an expected fourth quarter margin of over 15%.
To sum up consolidated third quarter performance, sales increased 3% and EPS were ahead of plan at $0.80. Our total company operating margin was 14.8%, up 130 basis points from the prior year with an incremental margin of more than 50%. We are ahead of plan on our operating margin growth and squarely on track to reach our goal of approaching 15% operating margin when the housing market returns to steady-state levels.
Before turning to the balance sheet, let me comment on the impact of lower tax rate. Our effective tax rate in the quarter is down from the prior year due to the previous adoption of the new accounting standard that requires companies to reflect the excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation transactions in their tax rate and EPS. While our previous guidance assumes some benefit in both the third and fourth quarters, our current guidance assumes all benefit was realized in the third quarter.
Let me now turn to the balance sheet. Our September 30 balance sheet remains solid with cash of $279 million, debt of $1.59 billion and our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage declined to 1.7x. By year-end, we expect leverage to decline another 10 to 20 basis points, excluding any additional capital
transactions.
Turning last to the details of our outlook for 2016. Our market and sales assumption for 2016 now call for U.S. home products market growth of 6%, down from 6% to 7% due to softer summer repair and remodel activity that Chris discussed earlier. Accordingly, we now assume total global market growth of 5%, down from our 5% to 6% expectation earlier in the year. 
Based on that market assumption, we now expect our full year 2016 sales to increase 9% to 10% compared to 2015. 
We have narrowed the range on our outlook for 2016 EPS to $2.72 to $2.76. The midpoint of our full year EPS outlook remained unchanged at $2.74 based on our continuing strong operating margin performance and the lower annual tax rate. The midpoint reflects a 32% increase over prior year EPS of $2.07. The guidance reflects a fourth quarter EPS range, which is unchanged, of $0.67 to $0.71 to achieve the annual EPS outlook of $2.72 to $2.76.
Note that our year-to-date EPS through the third quarter are $2.05, which includes the benefit of a lower tax rate due to the adoption of the new accounting standard. Although we adopted this new standard in this year's second quarter, our year-to-date EPS of $2.05 also reflects a benefit of $0.04 attributable to the first quarter. This first quarter benefit will begin to be reflected in quarterly comparisons in 2017.
We expect 2016 free cash flow to be around $400 million with our conversion rate of over 90%.
The annual EPS outlook includes the following assumptions: interest expense of around $50 million; a full year tax rate of approximately 29.5%, with no benefit in the fourth quarter from the previously mentioned new accounting standard; average fully diluted shares of approximately 158 million.
In summary, we're pleased with our performance so far this year and are set up for a strong 2017. The R&R market growth was softer than expected in the third quarter, but recent trends and long-term fundamentals continue to point to solid demand and an elongated cycle. Our disciplined focus on profitable growth is working well, as we are ahead of plan and on track to hit our long-term operating margin goal of 15% as the housing market reaches its long-term average.
We remain focused on using our balance sheet and cash flow to drive incremental shareholder value through acquisitions and share repurchases.
I will now pass the call back to Brian."

But in the past, we've had quiet Julys and things have picked up in August and September. This year, as we kind of move through August, it continued to be pretty flat. I'd say there is activity in pockets, but there are other places where it was kind of quiet. Finally, as we kind of got into second, third week of September, things started picking up. So in many ways, order patterns picked up, and it was kind of too late to really drive third quarter. But since mid-September and through October, we're right back on our plans for where we thought the market would be, really, across all of our businesses. And so you kind of look at it and say, from what might have been kind of looking back kind of mid-June through early part of September, we had a quiet R&R market. New constructions through this whole period kept rolling through. And as we look at the data, I think builders put a lot of attention into completing the houses that were under construction. We come in, in the later stages of those homes. So to the extent we're delivering product into those homes, cabinet business, direct to builder, faucet business going in, doors business going in, that kept at a good pace. It was just this R&R market was quiet. I'd give you a little color. Just in the channel feedback that we got, even for those who were out looking -- there were, again, feedback that -- to start a project now, there really wasn't the installation labor, carpenters, plumbers available until later in the fall. And so I don't know how much of that end up having to do with underlying activity. I'm sure some of it was the more basic drivers: consumer confidence, et cetera. But there was this feedback looped inside of our distribution that was kind of telling folks that the activity -- that most of the contractors were booked up from the strong spring. And so installers weren't really available. That's freed up a bit. I'd still say there's some labor constraints out in the market, but it's freed up a bit. And so I think that's passing through in some of the order activity that we see. I'd say that pretty consistent activity now through late September, October across all the businesses. So that gives us the confidence to say we're going to come in where we thought we would in the fourth quarter. I've been calling this the Goldilocks year. First quarter, a little bit hot, a little bit too hot. Second quarter was kind of just right. Third quarter is a little bit cool. And looks like fourth quarter is going to be kind of like second quarter, which is basically back on plan. So altogether, a good year. It's just kind of cycling up and down. Not unusual. This is my eighth year running this business, our fifth year being public. And this whole recovery has had these kind of surges, flat spots, dips and then kind of back up. So as a company, we're used to this. We staff accordingly. We kind of take the rolling view of it all. And so that gives us pretty good confidence coming into the end of the year and, frankly, setting up '17."

To the extent that the market is soft overall, we've shown that we've been opportunistic in buying back shares. Summer of '14, some weakness, and so we took advantage of that, bought back 440 million of shares. Earlier this year, late January, February, some weakness in the market, we bought back 350 million or so shares. So to the extent there's soft spots, we'll take advantage of that. But I still see some good opportunities in acquisitions, so that will balance those 2 between. We've said from the start, for the last 5 years, we're going to be efficient with our cash flow. We're not stockpiling cash. We're trying to be efficient for our shareholders to create value. And so that's kind of our mindset as we lean into this whole thing."

So we have seen elevated promotions, but we've kind of picked our spots. I'd say we were careful because we've got such a big dealer business, our in-stock business in vanities and in-stock kitchens, those aren't promotional driven. So we don't really have to use promotions to drive volume. Maybe some others are more reliant upon it. And to the extent you're more active on the promotion side, it's going to deteriorate margins. So that's how we balance that. We're targeted. But as you can see from our margin improvements, we're not going that far into it because we're driving that margin improvement across cabinets. And we're getting good utilization across our business coming out of dealer and coming out of in-stock. So -- and direct to builder, where -- that business, we've obviously readjusted that over time here, but that's really an attractive business.

We had said the first half would be more of a benefit when you net commodity deflation or inflation against FX.

So much less of an impact in the second half, a little more impact in the first half. '17, if you look at commodities right now, it -- they have not started to spike up. There are certain pockets. Steel is a little higher. Glass has actually been higher all year. Wood has been kind of breakeven right now at this point. So not sure the pace right now, don't anticipate huge spikes right now, but we would assume that it would move up commodities -- inflation would move up during the year."

And it really strikes to the core of why we form the Global Plumbing Group is we think it's a combination of both organic and acquisitions. And there's a little loop in there where acquisitions then feed into faster organic growth. So our real strategy within Plumbing is to become more multi-branded, multiproduct, a wider spectrum of price points. We've got really strong channel strength in our geographies across North America and China, and we can put more through those channels, more brands, more volume. And we're looking at other geographies. So I'd say in terms of dimensioning it, you could say half of it through acquisition, half of it through organic. But that's -- I'd say that's rough estimate. Certainly, it's not anticipated to be all organic. And there could be even more upside or more aggressive on the acquisition side. So it's all -- in terms of putting that number out there, we're just trying to create an understanding of how we're looking at it and, frankly, how significant it could be just based on some of the things we're looking at and the power we see of bringing more through the channel strength that we've got and leveraging the brands that we've got. Moen is obviously a huge brand. We think we can do more with it. We've acquired some additional brands. We think we can acquire some other brands. And so it's just to create the expectation. And internally, it's the way we're talking about what the opportunity could be."

So if I break it down, we've got better operating efficiency going through the plants. We still have capacity. We made our big capacity investments a couple of years ago. They're just getting better at running it, and we frankly got more volume coming through, so that's part of it. Part of it is we are getting some synergy benefit from Norcraft. You're seeing that come through. They've been aggressive in driving that and improving the operations of the acquired Norcraft businesses. And then some of it is just mix. As we've said, we target profitable growth in the market. We're not chasing every dollar of sales out there. And within the relationships that we've got, we're driving a stronger mix. And that's coming through finishes. That's coming through more complicated projects. We spend a lot of time out in the field with the designers, helping them really design the product into the -- what the consumer's looking for, and that yields a higher mix for us. So you take all those 3 things together, and that team's really been driving things together to improve that margin. We're headed toward mid-teens.

We'll pick up nothing, we think, in the fourth quarter. So we've got the same kind of tax benefit that we would have thought. We just got it in the third quarter versus the fourth. So pretty much as we had expected. Next year, we'll talk to you about -- our base rate is 33% or so, 33.5%. So -- but that's a starting point. But we'll have some planning ideas for next year, and we'll give you a rate then."

And so to the extent that the channel is pretty lean, as you see some surge in demand, typically, we have to ship back into that. So on the one hand, it's healthy and on the other hand, it doesn't give us any help. It's a bit of a headwind in the existing quarter. But you know that's further demand that will come about as the market calls for it. We've gotten good at servicing this business. So to a certain extent, they're leaning on us, and that's fine.

And that's a good sign because that's both R&R as well as going into new construction, so that was up strong. Direct to builder continues to be okay, but it's really kind of across the board, just healthy growth. A lot of it, Tier 1, Tier 2. So I'd say, looking back versus 3 years ago, where it was more kind of spread across Tier 1, 2, 3, 4, a lot of the activity we're seeing now is more concentrated in those stronger, better developed markets, which is, again, good because we typically see a better mix coming through there, better price points coming through those Tier 1, Tier 2 markets. So for us, China right now is a healthy market. We like that market."

Our teams delivered profitable growth in the third quarter in the face of challenging comps, select channel inventory reductions and slower-than-anticipated repair and remodel activity.
Importantly, our business has remained focused on targeting the most attractive segments of our markets, and we delivered strong profit performance across all 4 segments. Since late September and through the month of October, we've seen the pace of orders across our business strengthen, returning to levels that we would expect. So based on our solid third quarter performance, consistent execution and our current assumption for market growth, we're revising our full year outlook for sales growth to 9% to 10% while confirming our previous EPS outlook.
Let me first spend some time on our view of the U.S. home products market, followed by my thoughts on our business performance in the third quarter. Then I would like to discuss the recent creation of our Global Plumbing Group and why we view this platform as the first step to further accelerating growth in the Plumbing segment.
And finally, since we've just celebrated our 5-year anniversary as an independent company, I'll provide my perspectives on the company that we have built and how we have positioned ourselves to maximize growth and value for the years ahead. Lee will then provide more details on our third quarter performance and our 2016 outlook.
Starting with our view of the U.S. home products market. In the third quarter, the market for our home products grew at the lower end of the pace that we expected. We estimate that repair and remodel activity grew at around 4% and new construction grew generally as expected.
Our business has experienced repair and remodel activity that began to slow in July and was clearly slower throughout August and the first half of September. While demand was slower over this period, our channels also reported a tighter labor market and available contractors and tradespeople to take on incrementally more projects over the summer months after a fast start to the year.
Notably, over the past 5 weeks, we've seen R&R activity and order patterns improve and more consistent with what we would expect starting in mid-September and continuing through October. And consumers continued to drive an improving mix within our categories.
New construction demand continues to grow as expected, with single-family growing faster than multi-family and single-family entry-level activity continuing to improve.
Looking at the full year 2016. Our overall assumption is that the U.S. home products market, which impacts 70% of our sales, grows at a combined rate of around 6%.
Within the year, we saw upside in the first quarter driven by better weather. Second quarter was pretty much as we expected. The third quarter saw a slower repair and remodel activity, partially due to labor constraints. And with our current visibility to order patterns, the fourth quarter is shaping up to be on plan. Taken together, 2016 will be a good year.
Looking forward, our basket of near-term indicators for the home products market remains pointed to strong underlying demand, some constraints in skilled labor, significant levels of single-family new construction activity and continued market momentum as we head into 2017.
Now let me provide some perspective on our business performance. For the third quarter, our teams delivered strong performance across all operating segments. Sales increased 3% and total company operating margin increased to 14.8%. 
Starting with our Cabinet segment. We continue to follow a disciplined strategy focused on profitable growth. Our consistent pace of product innovation and our high levels of reliable service to our channel partners continue to drive performance. In the third quarter, our overall cabinet sales were flat to the prior year; and operating margins, driven by increasingly efficient operations and an improving mix, expanded to 12.4%. 
Excluding last year's third quarter load-in to support a major new vanity program launch and promotional timing, our total cabinet sales increased mid-single digits in the quarter and the dealer channel sales grew low single digits overall. However, sales grew solid mid-single digits in all of our core semi-custom product lines, and we continue to see mix improve.
In our luxury lines, which make up a little more than 25% of our dealer channel volume, sales were lower. Overall, dealers are seeing strong growth from our new construction products. We're benefiting from deeper relationships with existing customers and we're beginning to see some cross-sell benefits from our Norcraft acquisition.
Sales for our in-stock cabinets and vanities, which are sold through home centers, were down but grew high single digits when adjusted for the comparison to last year's load-in and promotional timing in the third quarter.
The sell-through of the new program and product upgrades that we launched last year are performing very well, and we're planning for the launch of additional new programs in 2017. Our cabinet team has been focused on partnering with our customers to continue to deliver on consumer trends and drive growth in our in-stock cabinet and vanity programs.
The remaining 25% to 30% of our Cabinets business, which includes home center special order semi-custom, builder direct in targeted markets and Canada, grew mid-single digits. We're disciplined in our approach to these segments as we focus on where we can partner with our customers to capture profitable growth. With our focused approach, we grew share in these segments and drove strong margin improvement. We're especially pleased with our home center special order business where our partnership approach is working well and driving growth at above-market rates with an improving mix.
In summary, I feel good about our industry-leading Cabinet business. We continue to execute well and deliver strong results even in a quarter where the market was not as strong as we planned. We're building share in the most attractive segments of the market. Our plans are increasingly more efficient, and our new product introductions and program wins are helping us drive a richer mix across a number of price points in the market.
For our Plumbing segment, sales were up 7% for the quarter, with solid mix and strong operating margin. Excluding select channel inventory reductions and sales from the recent acquisitions, sales increased 6% driven by strength in U.S. wholesale, China and Canada.
Across our markets, we continue to see consumers trade up and our mix improve, as innovation and design, finish and function attracts consumers who trust our brand.
As we look at the remainder of the year, our growth should benefit from incremental marketing spend, a healthy new construction market and more focus on recently launched products.
Sales in Canada were up high single digits to the prior year where we are gaining share. Notably, we continue to see strong growth in the urban markets with our home center partners.
China sales increased double digits versus the prior year. Sales gains were broad across the China business, particularly in on our Moen-branded stores, where we continue to drive increased productivity.
Doors reported sales were up 4% for the quarter. Door products again saw sales growth in both wholesale and retail.
Therma-Tru continues to benefit from the rollout of a refreshed retail strategy that includes an enhanced product line, simpler, more intuitive displays and better sales support for our customers' associates.
And in wholesale, we continue to benefit from strong new construction placements and our enhanced distribution in the Southern and Western U.S.
In the Security segment, sales increased 6% from the prior year quarter and were up approximately 8%, excluding the negative impact of the planned exit of some less-profitable SentrySafe product lines. The growth came from multiple channels and geographies, and we are beginning to see profit improvement from the integration of SentrySafe into Master Lock. 
We are also ramping up our Sentry sales efforts as we continue to be excited about the opportunities we see between our Master Lock and Sentry businesses over the next few years.
So to recap the quarter: Our teams are consistently leveraging our competitive advantages to deliver profitable growth. We executed well in a U.S. home products market that is continuing to expand despite periodic labor constraints among installers and tradesmen. And we are gaining momentum in our Security business with the Sentry integration behind us.
Now let me turn to the newly formed Global Plumbing Group, which is a key strategic step to enable accelerated, organic and incremental long-term growth.
The approach to the GPG is much like the evolution of our Cabinets business into a platform that can support multiple brands across multiple price points, sold into leading channel positions, supported by dedicated supply chains. The new GPG platform structure should allow us to accelerate growth while leveraging our global supply chain and strong distribution. It paves the way for additional acquisitions, joint ventures and supply agreements and allows for seamless integration and continued growth.
While only an initial step, we've recently made our first 2 acquisitions as part of this new platform. Riobel is a premium Canadian showroom brand, which brings strong innovation and best-in-class service. We also recently purchased ROHL, which includes both the ROHL and Perrin & Rowe brands, which bring a design-centric, artisanal approach to luxury products. Under the GPG, these additions now have even greater potential for profitable growth.
The new Global Plumbing Group enhances the potential for future growth as we look to grow our plumbing sales to $2.5 billion by 2020. We are excited about the opportunity to transform our business, enter new markets, develop new products, manage our channels and customers more holistically and accelerate both organic and incremental growth.
Finally, before I turn the call over to Lee, we're proud that we just celebrated our 5-year anniversary as an independent company, and we're excited about our accomplishments over a relatively short period of time. Our teams have executed extremely well and delivered outstanding results, but I'm even more excited about the foundation that we've built to drive both organic and incremental growth over the next 5 years.
Notably, in our first 5 years, this team has nearly doubled our sales and more than doubled our operating margin. We've increased our EPS almost fivefold. We've deployed capital in value-creating ways, which include making 5 acquisitions for $1.4 billion, repurchasing over $900 million of our shares and initiating and consistently increasing a dividend. And we've delivered exceptional returns for our shareholders.
At the same time, we've evolved and positioned our businesses for future growth by building on our structural competitive advantages and our leading market share positions; creating stronger operating capabilities and platforms; driving new products, new programs and new distribution; investing in capacity and productivity; and by strengthening our management team and aligning incentives to focus on driving shareholder value.
With favorable demographics, driven by housing demand from the longer-living baby boomers and increasingly the millennials, we see an elongated new construction cycle and pent-up R&R demand being realized. These demand drivers, coupled with the stronger business model we have created, position us extremely well, not only for 2017 but for the next several years.
Additionally, over the next 3 years, we continue to believe that we have the potential to deploy more than $2 billion to drive incremental growth and shareholder value through strategic acquisitions, share repurchases and increasing our dividends.
To sum up, R&R demand was softer in the summer. But after accounting for inventory impacts and some market labor constraints, the core of our business continued to perform well, and we're maintaining share. So I'm quite comfortable with the top line performance as we head into the balance of the year, as we're picking up sales in the better parts of the market, which drive profitable growth.
With respect to the bottom line, I am very pleased. Margins in the quarter were again strong, and we're pacing ahead of our planned long-term profit targets.
And lastly, I'm encouraged by what we've seen in terms of our orders over the last 5 weeks. It's a sign to me that fundamental demand is still healthy even if there was some softness this summer. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Lee who will review our third quarter financial performance and provide detail on our outlook for 2016."
33174798,404017921,1063123,"Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2016",2016-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Fortune Brands Innovations, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Chris. As Brian mentioned, to best reflect ongoing business performance, the majority of my comments will focus on income before charges and gains from continuing operations.Let me start with our third quarter results. Sales were $1.28 billion,",1168,"Thanks, Chris. As Brian mentioned, to best reflect ongoing business performance, the majority of my comments will focus on income before charges and gains from continuing operations.
Let me start with our third quarter results. Sales were $1.28 billion, up 3% from a year ago. However, simply adjusting for the major program launch and promo event in cabinets last year, company sales would be up 5%. 
Consolidated operating income for the quarter was $189 million, up 13% or $21 million compared to the same quarter last year.
EPS were $0.80 for the quarter versus $0.64 for the same quarter last year, increasing 25% or $0.16. Earnings were strong and ahead of expectations, driven by continued stronger operating performance and a lower tax rate.
Now let me provide more color on segment results. Our third quarter cabinet sales reflect the combination of very challenging comps and a softer R&R market. Sales were $602 million, approximately flat from the prior year but increased mid-single digits, excluding the major program launch and promotional event for in-stock vanities in the third quarter of 2015. Dealer sales increased low single digits from the prior year. Core semi-custom sales at dealers increased mid-single digits, while luxury products were lower this quarter.
Sales from in-stock cabinets and vanities decreased due to the prior year product launch and promotional event. Excluding the prior year activity, which was $23 million of the total $38 million increase last year, in-stock cabinets and vanities sales increased around 7%. Remaining sales from home center semi-custom, builder direct and Canada increased 6%. Within those remaining sales, Canada declined, largely due to the areas impacted by the downturn in the energy industry.
In spite of flat sales, our Cabinet segment continued to increase its leading operating margin. Operating income for the Cabinet segment increased $11 million or 17% over the prior year. Operating margin for the quarter increased 180 basis points to 12.4%. For the full year, we expect an operating margin of around 11% compared to 9% in 2015.
Turning to Plumbing. The GPG generated solid sales growth in the third quarter. Sales were $391 million, up $27 million or 7%. Excluding select channel inventory reductions and sales from acquisitions, sales increased 6%. Sales in Canada increased 8% and China sales increased 11%.
In spite of around $7 million in additional brand spending, the GPG maintained its leading operating margin. Operating income increased $3 million to $85 million, up 4% from the prior year quarter. Operating margin for this segment was 21.7%. For the full year 2016, operating margin is expected to be over 21%, including incremental brand spending of $6 million in the fourth quarter.
Door sales were $129 million, up $5 million or 4% from the prior year quarter. Operating income increased 34% with an operating margin of 17.3%, which benefited by around 100 basis points due to expense timing. Full year operating margin for this segment is expected to be around 12.5%.
Security sales were $157 million in the third quarter, up 6% to the prior year. Segment operating income was $27 million and the segment operating margin was 17%, which also benefited by nearly 100 basis points due to expense timing. For the full year 2016, operating margin is expected to be around 14%, with an expected fourth quarter margin of over 15%.
To sum up consolidated third quarter performance, sales increased 3% and EPS were ahead of plan at $0.80. Our total company operating margin was 14.8%, up 130 basis points from the prior year with an incremental margin of more than 50%. We are ahead of plan on our operating margin growth and squarely on track to reach our goal of approaching 15% operating margin when the housing market returns to steady-state levels.
Before turning to the balance sheet, let me comment on the impact of lower tax rate. Our effective tax rate in the quarter is down from the prior year due to the previous adoption of the new accounting standard that requires companies to reflect the excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation transactions in their tax rate and EPS. While our previous guidance assumes some benefit in both the third and fourth quarters, our current guidance assumes all benefit was realized in the third quarter.
Let me now turn to the balance sheet. Our September 30 balance sheet remains solid with cash of $279 million, debt of $1.59 billion and our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage declined to 1.7x. By year-end, we expect leverage to decline another 10 to 20 basis points, excluding any additional capital
transactions.
Turning last to the details of our outlook for 2016. Our market and sales assumption for 2016 now call for U.S. home products market growth of 6%, down from 6% to 7% due to softer summer repair and remodel activity that Chris discussed earlier. Accordingly, we now assume total global market growth of 5%, down from our 5% to 6% expectation earlier in the year. 
Based on that market assumption, we now expect our full year 2016 sales to increase 9% to 10% compared to 2015. 
We have narrowed the range on our outlook for 2016 EPS to $2.72 to $2.76. The midpoint of our full year EPS outlook remained unchanged at $2.74 based on our continuing strong operating margin performance and the lower annual tax rate. The midpoint reflects a 32% increase over prior year EPS of $2.07. The guidance reflects a fourth quarter EPS range, which is unchanged, of $0.67 to $0.71 to achieve the annual EPS outlook of $2.72 to $2.76.
Note that our year-to-date EPS through the third quarter are $2.05, which includes the benefit of a lower tax rate due to the adoption of the new accounting standard. Although we adopted this new standard in this year's second quarter, our year-to-date EPS of $2.05 also reflects a benefit of $0.04 attributable to the first quarter. This first quarter benefit will begin to be reflected in quarterly comparisons in 2017.
We expect 2016 free cash flow to be around $400 million with our conversion rate of over 90%.
The annual EPS outlook includes the following assumptions: interest expense of around $50 million; a full year tax rate of approximately 29.5%, with no benefit in the fourth quarter from the previously mentioned new accounting standard; average fully diluted shares of approximately 158 million.
In summary, we're pleased with our performance so far this year and are set up for a strong 2017. The R&R market growth was softer than expected in the third quarter, but recent trends and long-term fundamentals continue to point to solid demand and an elongated cycle. Our disciplined focus on profitable growth is working well, as we are ahead of plan and on track to hit our long-term operating margin goal of 15% as the housing market reaches its long-term average.
We remain focused on using our balance sheet and cash flow to drive incremental shareholder value through acquisitions and share repurchases.
I will now pass the call back to Brian."

I was hoping you could spend a little bit more time talking about kind of the length of the soft patch and the duration of it. And it sounds like there was a transitory phenomena and you've seen demand pick up. So I was just trying to tie that in as we move towards year-end. What's giving you the confidence in the new guidance range based on the trends you've seen since the end of the quarter?"

But in the past, we've had quiet Julys and things have picked up in August and September. This year, as we kind of move through August, it continued to be pretty flat. I'd say there is activity in pockets, but there are other places where it was kind of quiet. Finally, as we kind of got into second, third week of September, things started picking up. So in many ways, order patterns picked up, and it was kind of too late to really drive third quarter. But since mid-September and through October, we're right back on our plans for where we thought the market would be, really, across all of our businesses. And so you kind of look at it and say, from what might have been kind of looking back kind of mid-June through early part of September, we had a quiet R&R market. New constructions through this whole period kept rolling through. And as we look at the data, I think builders put a lot of attention into completing the houses that were under construction. We come in, in the later stages of those homes. So to the extent we're delivering product into those homes, cabinet business, direct to builder, faucet business going in, doors business going in, that kept at a good pace. It was just this R&R market was quiet. I'd give you a little color. Just in the channel feedback that we got, even for those who were out looking -- there were, again, feedback that -- to start a project now, there really wasn't the installation labor, carpenters, plumbers available until later in the fall. And so I don't know how much of that end up having to do with underlying activity. I'm sure some of it was the more basic drivers: consumer confidence, et cetera. But there was this feedback looped inside of our distribution that was kind of telling folks that the activity -- that most of the contractors were booked up from the strong spring. And so installers weren't really available. That's freed up a bit. I'd still say there's some labor constraints out in the market, but it's freed up a bit. And so I think that's passing through in some of the order activity that we see. I'd say that pretty consistent activity now through late September, October across all the businesses. So that gives us the confidence to say we're going to come in where we thought we would in the fourth quarter. I've been calling this the Goldilocks year. First quarter, a little bit hot, a little bit too hot. Second quarter was kind of just right. Third quarter is a little bit cool. And looks like fourth quarter is going to be kind of like second quarter, which is basically back on plan. So altogether, a good year. It's just kind of cycling up and down. Not unusual. This is my eighth year running this business, our fifth year being public. And this whole recovery has had these kind of surges, flat spots, dips and then kind of back up. So as a company, we're used to this. We staff accordingly. We kind of take the rolling view of it all. And so that gives us pretty good confidence coming into the end of the year and, frankly, setting up '17."

Obviously, we completed a couple acquisitions on the luxury side of the plumbing market, and we're excited about that fitting into the GPG. We continue to be busy looking at a number of other things in plumbing, some things in security and then our other segments and even looking at additional segments. To the extent that the market is soft overall, we've shown that we've been opportunistic in buying back shares. Summer of '14, some weakness, and so we took advantage of that, bought back 440 million of shares. Earlier this year, late January, February, some weakness in the market, we bought back 350 million or so shares. So to the extent there's soft spots, we'll take advantage of that. But I still see some good opportunities in acquisitions, so that will balance those 2 between. We've said from the start, for the last 5 years, we're going to be efficient with our cash flow. We're not stockpiling cash. We're trying to be efficient for our shareholders to create value. And so that's kind of our mindset as we lean into this whole thing."

So we have seen elevated promotions, but we've kind of picked our spots. I'd say we were careful because we've got such a big dealer business, our in-stock business in vanities and in-stock kitchens, those aren't promotional driven. So we don't really have to use promotions to drive volume. Maybe some others are more reliant upon it. And to the extent you're more active on the promotion side, it's going to deteriorate margins. So that's how we balance that. We're targeted. But as you can see from our margin improvements, we're not going that far into it because we're driving that margin improvement across cabinets. And we're getting good utilization across our business coming out of dealer and coming out of in-stock. So -- and direct to builder, where -- that business, we've obviously readjusted that over time here, but that's really an attractive business.

And it really strikes to the core of why we form the Global Plumbing Group is we think it's a combination of both organic and acquisitions. And there's a little loop in there where acquisitions then feed into faster organic growth. So our real strategy within Plumbing is to become more multi-branded, multiproduct, a wider spectrum of price points. We've got really strong channel strength in our geographies across North America and China, and we can put more through those channels, more brands, more volume. And we're looking at other geographies. So I'd say in terms of dimensioning it, you could say half of it through acquisition, half of it through organic. But that's -- I'd say that's rough estimate. Certainly, it's not anticipated to be all organic. And there could be even more upside or more aggressive on the acquisition side. So it's all -- in terms of putting that number out there, we're just trying to create an understanding of how we're looking at it and, frankly, how significant it could be just based on some of the things we're looking at and the power we see of bringing more through the channel strength that we've got and leveraging the brands that we've got.

We -- when we a year ago said that we were going to integrate the manufacturing, we set a target of a 15% operating margin in the fourth quarter of 2016. We said that will be the test that we'd done a good job and we've got that integration done. And so we're at a point now where we can say we'll have a 15% operating margin in the fourth quarter. We'll have 14% for the full year as the margins build throughout the year. But we'll exit at 15%, and that's a good starting point for next year."

And then you kind of saw it accelerate similarly kind of across the business. So it's hard to pinpoint it any more than that. It felt like the general market. There's a -- I don't know how to attribute it to. Underlying consumer demand, which I think was part of it, but also it felt like the whole system is a little bit backed up. The ability for R&R activity to get started anew when you've got a lot of project work coming in, and we're fulfilling a lot of the activity coming out of the spring, the channels felt backed up. And again, I can't be precise to say, well, how much was related to consumer, how much was related to the channel backed up. But it felt like it was a combination of both those things.

So it's kind of like saying, in proportion, as you say, across all of these price points, if the very high end is a smaller proportion, doesn't that hurt that mix? Well, with -- inside of those, you continue to drive mix, which is continuing to drive margin. It's really kind of fundamental. It's cabinets. It's also inside of faucets. It's inside of doors. When we talk about growing a little faster than the rest of the market by driving innovation, what we're really driving at is bringing new product in that's going to drive that mix up and then working with the channels to allow them or to help them sell that mix through. And that -- you can see it as I kind of go through average ASP by price point in cabinets. It's coming through all those. If I look at the Plumbing division and look at Moen in our wholesale segment going into new construction, we're driving it from kind of spec to first upgrade, first upgrade to second upgrade. We continue to see that move up. In Doors, we're getting better attachment rates on glass, decorative glass, sidelights. And so we're driving that by bringing out new styles. We're driving that mix up. Because when I talk generally about mix, it's kind of inside of those price points and inside of those categories. That's where all of our innovation work is going to drive that up."

And so to the extent that the channel is pretty lean, as you see some surge in demand, typically, we have to ship back into that. So on the one hand, it's healthy and on the other hand, it doesn't give us any help. It's a bit of a headwind in the existing quarter. But you know that's further demand that will come about as the market calls for it. We've gotten good at servicing this business. So to a certain extent, they're leaning on us, and that's fine.

Direct to builder continues to be okay, but it's really kind of across the board, just healthy growth. A lot of it, Tier 1, Tier 2. So I'd say, looking back versus 3 years ago, where it was more kind of spread across Tier 1, 2, 3, 4, a lot of the activity we're seeing now is more concentrated in those stronger, better developed markets, which is, again, good because we typically see a better mix coming through there, better price points coming through those Tier 1, Tier 2 markets.
