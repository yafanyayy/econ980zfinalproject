Good evening, everyone. Earlier this month, I met with many of our investors and analysts at the annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference and talked about the important transition that Vertex has made in the last few years. As we enter 20",1597,"Thanks, Michael. Good evening, everyone. Earlier this month, I met with many of our investors and analysts at the annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference and talked about the important transition that Vertex has made in the last few years. As we enter 2016, Vertex is on a path towards sustained earnings and revenue growth-driven by an increasing number of people being treated with our 2 approved medicines for cystic fibrosis, KALYDECO and ORKAMBI. We have a broad and deep pipeline of investigational medicines for CF that we believe may allow us to reach our goal of treating all people with CF in the future. Additionally, our pipeline of medicines for other serious diseases, including cancer, pain and other neurologic diseases, continues to progress at her early stage clinical development. In short, we are a very different company than we were just 4 years ago. 
This evening, I will briefly review our key priorities for 2016 and provide some insight into the upcoming milestones in CF and other parts of our business. Our #1 priority has been and continues to be to increase the number of people eligible for and treated with KALYDECO and ORKAMBI and to develop potential new medicines that they provide even greater benefit for all people with CF in the years ahead. At this time last year, just over 3,000 people were eligible for treatment with KALYDECO. Today, approximately 25,000 people are eligible for KALYDECO or ORKAMBI and we expect the vast majority of these people will begin treatment of these medicines to treat the cost of their CFs. We also expect to increase the number of people eligible for these medicines in 2016 to a later expansion efforts that could include younger patients or patients with other mutations in the CFTR gene. 
Our second key priority for 2016 is to continue building a financial profile of sustained revenues and earnings growth and a strong balance sheet. In 2015, a continued expansion of the KALYDECO label and the approval of ORKAMBI resulted in a significant increase in the number of patients being treated with our medicines, which led to a significant increase in revenues. Our progress in 2015 has positioned us for continued growth and we believe we are on the right path to achieve our goal of building a financial profile consistent with that of other global biotech companies. 
And finally, our third key priority is to invest in our business to create future medicines for other serious diseases. Continued investment in our pipeline is essential for creating additional breakthrough medicines for patients. I'll spend just a few minutes reviewing our recent progress and upcoming milestones that reflect these 3 priorities. 
Our first CF medicine, KALYDECO, was approved by the FDA in January 2012, and since then, our goal has been to bring this medicine to as many people as possible who may benefit. KALYDECO addresses the underlying cause of CF and is a significant medical advance for people with certain mutations in the CFTR gene. Today, approximately 4,000 people are eligible for treatment of KALYDECO in North America, Europe and Australia. We're committed to bringing this medicine to even more patients, who we believe we benefit in years ahead. We are awaiting decision from the U.S. FDA on our application for approval of KALYDECO in people ages 2 and older with CF who have certain residual functional mutations. We are approximately 1,500 people ages 2 and older in the U.S. who have the residual functional mutations represented in the supplemental new drug application for KALYDECO. While our submission for approval in these mutations is primarily based on preclinical data and on a Phase IIa critical study in only 24 patients, we believe that KALYDECO will be beneficial to these patients, given the underlying science behind these precision medicine approach of using genetic markers and predictive assays to identify patients who will likely benefit. Importantly, we chose to seek this approval, knowing that these patients would otherwise have to potentially wait years before potential approval based on Phase III data. With more than 4 years of safety data, we believe that this path towards potential approval is in the best interest of people with CF. However, we also recognize that the application is based upon limited available clinical data and its rare mutations. The PDUFA date for the decision from the FDA is February 7. 
With ORKAMBI, we are working to bring this medicine to more patients, who we believe will benefit, specifically children with 2 copies of the F delta 508 down mutations, similar to approach in KALYDECO. With approval of the European Union at the end of last year, [ph] approximately 20,500 people ages 12 and older are now eligible for treatment with ORKAMBI in the U.S. and Europe. Today, we announced the Phase II study of ORKAMBI in children ages 6 to 11 met its primary safety endpoint and supports our planned submission of a supplemental new drug application in the second quarter of this year in the U.S. If approved, an additional 2,400 people in the U.S. with CF will be eligible for treatment of ORKAMBI. 
While this is primarily a safety study, we also saw encouraging improvements in secondary and exploratory efficacy endpoints, including a statistically significant change in the exploratory endpoint of lung clearance index or LCI. Changes in LCI are also the primary endpoint of an ongoing Phase III [ph] study to support approval of ORKAMBI in this age group in Europe. There are approximately 3,400 children ages 6 to 11 who have 2 copies of the F508 del mutation in the European Union. Additional information on this data was provided in today's press release. 
Today, KALYDECO and ORKAMBI are approved to treat approximately 25,000 people in North America, Europe and Australia. We believe that there are many more people who may benefit from these medicines and we have trials ongoing or planned that could expand the number of people eligible for treatment to approximately 44,000 in years ahead. 
Beyond our approved medicines, we have a pipeline of investigational CF medicines and early-stage research programs, such as gene editing of CRISPR to late-stage developing programs evaluating combinations of our CFTR modulators. This pipeline were present hope for the CF community and our goal is to 1 day treat all people with CF. We have a broad Phase III program underway evaluating the corrector VX-661 in combination with ivacaftor, and we're also advancing the development of 2 next-generation correctors that will be combined with VX-661 and ivacaftor as part of a Phase III study of triple combinations planned for later this year. Both approaches are asking the same fundamental questions: First, can we enhance the benefit for patients already receiving KALYDECO or ORKAMBI? And second, can you provide benefits to new groups of people with CF not currently helped to buy KALYDECO or ORKAMBI, including a very large group of patients with 1 F508 del mutation and the second mutation known to result in minimal CFTR function? The VX-661 program includes 4 Phase III studies in different groups of people with CF, who have at least 1 copy of the F508 del mutation. We will begin to see the first results from the VX-661 program by early 2017, and importantly, this program is also meant to provide a significant amount of safety data to support evaluation of the next-generation corrector with VX-661 and ivacaftor as part of an investigational triple-combination regimen. 
At the end of 2015, we initiated cyclical development of 2 next-generation correctors, VX-152 and VX-440. Phase I study of each compound are ongoing in healthy volunteers and are evaluating single and multiple doses of VX-152 and VX-440 0 as well as well as triple combinations with VX-661 and ivacaftor. Together with a 50 data within the VX-661 program, the studies are designed to support the planned initiation of Phase II studies to evaluate triple combination regimens in patients in the second half of 2016. 
Our business model is unique. The success we've achieved in CF allows us to reinvest into the discovery and development of new transformative medicines. In parallel with CF, we are advancing a number of additional development programs for cancer, pain and other serious diseases. We have significant flexibility in how we may advance these programs it independently for those diseases that we believe are aligned with the focus of our business specifically specialty diseases with G&A expenses are lower your or help collaboration with other companies which we believe will be best suited to rapidly bring these potential medicines to patients. We believe our pipeline represents both potentially trends, to future medicines for patients and significant value for our business. We've begun to provide some additional insight and data for our pipeline programs and I look forward to providing updates and our progress throughout the coming year. 
I mentioned at the start of my remarks that Vertex's undergoing an important transition in recent years. We are now a global biotech company that has independently brought forwards 2 breakthrough medicines to people with CF worldwide and is on the path to delivering significant earnings and cash flow. Our financial performance in 2015 and guidance for 2016 our metrics of the kind of company that we want to become, a company that consistently create transformative new medicines for patients, generate significant value for shareholders and reinvest reinvesting strategic opportunities to create future medicines. This is our business model, and I'm pleased with our success to date and with our outlook for the coming years. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Ian."

I'll also discus",1301,"Thanks, Jeff. For my remarks today, I will review our fourth quarter and full year 2015 financial results and discuss our 2016 financial guidance for total KALYDECO net revenues and non-GAAP operating expenses, excluding cost of revenues. I'll also discuss our expectation for providing ORKAMBI guidance in 2016. 
Financial results first. Our 2015 net CF product revenues were approximately $983 million. This includes KALYDECO net revenues of $632 million and ORKAMBI net revenues of $351 million. Total CF product revenues increased by more than 110% compared to 2014. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we reported total net CF product revenues of approximately $401 million, including KALYDECO net revenues of $181 million and ORKAMBI net revenues up $220 million. Fourth quarter KALYDECO sales of $181 million were up 45% versus the fourth quarter of last year and up 9% versus the third quarter of 2015. This included approximately $6 million and in Mentor restocking that occurred at the end of the fourth quarter. Growth in KALYDECO was driven by both label expansion efforts, which increase the number of eligible patients to approximately 4,000 and by the completion of the reimbursement discussions in Europe. With ORKAMBI, more than 1,500 patients start in the fourth quarter resulting in sales of $220 million, up 68% versus third quarter of 2015. As expected, we saw a very rapid uptake for ORKAMBI in the period immediately following FDA approval with more than 3,000 people starting treatment in the third quarter. Demand for patients and physicians has been strong. But as expected, fewer patients started treatment in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter in line with our prior statements regarding expectations for the rate of uptake for ORKAMBI. We expect this trend to continue through the end of 2016, by which time, we expect the vast majority of the 8.5 thousand eligible patients in U.S. to have initiated treatment with ORKAMBI. 
Gross-to-net adjustments were largely unchanged from the third quarter and were in and the high cycle digits due primarily to a greater proportion of patients with commercial plans initiating treatment in the first 6 months following approval of ORKAMBI as compared to government-paid plans. Each of the 50 state Medicaid programs has now paid a claim for ORKAMBI, thus, we expect gross-to-net adjustments will increase to the mid-teens by the end of 2016 to reflect an increase in patients treated being covered by Medicaid. 
As we enter 2016, we are pleased with the launch of ORKAMBI today and remain focused on working to ensure those who need the medicine have access to it, educating health care providers and supporting appearance to ORKAMBI. Now to operating expenses. Our fourth quarter non-GAAP operating expenses were $282 million, including R&D expenses of $204 million and SG&A expenses of $78 million. The increased R&D expense in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to 2014 were primarily the result of increased costs related to be pivotal Phase III program of VX-661 and in combination with ivacaftor. The increased SG&A expenses were primarily the result of an increased investment in global commercial support for the launch of ORKAMBI. And tonight, I'm pleased to report that for the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded a non-GAAP net profit of $43 [ph] million or $0.17 per diluted share compared to non-GAAP net loss of $132 million or $0.55 per share for the fourth quarter of 2014. Our 2015 non-GAAP net loss was $268 million or $1.11 per share compared to non-GAAP net loss of $511 million or $2.17 per share for the full year 2014. From a balance sheet perspective, we started 2016 with a strong cash position of $1.04 billion. Vertex also has $300 million outstanding from a credit agreement that provides for a secured loan of up to $500 million. 
Now let's turn to be 2016 financial guidance, which we first provide it on January 10. We expect 2016 KALYDECO net revenues of $670 million to $690 million. Our guidance for KALYDECO revenues reflect the continued use of KALYDECO as was seen in the fourth quarter of 2015, which results in revenues of $181 million and the expectation for up to approximately 200 patients with a gating mutation to enroll in the Phase III clinical study of VX-661 in combination with ivacaftor, who would otherwise have received KALYDECO, which will thus reduce 2016 KALYDECO revenues. There is also an approximately $6 million inventory stocking that occurred at the end of the fourth quarter 2015 that is not expected to take your future quarters and is best accounted for in our guidance. Importantly, our current guidance excludes any potential revenues from the approval of KALYDECO for people with residual function mutations. We will update our KALYDECO guidance should we received FDA approval for residual functional mutations. 
With ORKAMBI, more than 4,500 people have begun treatment in the U.S. by the end of 2015. There are 4 primary pieces of information regarding the launch that will inform our decision regarding ORKAMBI guidance. First, since all patients are initiating treatment with ORKAMBI in 2015 have been on treatment for approximately 6 months or less, we are waiting additional information on compliance rate for patients taking ORKAMBI. While we continue to expect that the vast majority of eligible patients in the U.S. will begin treatment with ORKAMBI by the end of 2016, we are waiting additional information with a specific weight of update and on specific proportion of the 8,500 eligible patients who will begin treatment with ORKAMBI in 2016. 
And finally, additional information on the [indiscernible] defined as how many patients remain on treatment will also be taken into account. These 4 factors, the compliance rate, the length of these patients begin treatment, the total number of patients who initiate treatment and the persistence rate, all are important when we consider our guidance for ORKAMBI. 
In 2016, we expect the recognize revenues from sales of ORKAMBI in the U.S. and Germany. In Germany, there are approximately 2,500 people with CF ages 12 and older, with 2 copies of F508del mutation. In Europe, country-by-country reimbursement discussions are underway. However, we do not anticipate any significant ORKAMBI revenue from countries other than the U.S. and Germany in 2016. 
The vital component of our financial guidance's non-GAAP operating expenses, which are comprised of R&D and SG&A expenses and exclude cost of revenues. We expect our total 2016 non-GAAP operating expenses of $1.18 billion to $1.23 billion. As a reminder, our guidance for 2015 operating expenses was for $1.05 billion to $1.1 billion, and we reported 2015 operating expenses at the low end of this range of $1.06 billion, largely as a result of cost related to VX-661 that will now occur in 2016 as opposed to 2015. The increase in expense expected operating expenses for 2016 as compared to 2015 is primarily a result of expanded development efforts related to the pivotal Phase III development program for VX-661 in combination with ivacaftor and for multiple Phase I and II studies of Vertex's early stage in mid-stage pipeline of potential CF medicines and anticipated SG&A costs to support the launch of ORKAMBI in new global markets. The components of Vertex is non-GAAP operating expenses include non-GAAP R&D expenses, which we expect to be in the range of $850 million to $890 [ph] million and non-GAAP SG&A expenses, which we expect will be in the range of $330 million to $350 million. Vertex's expected non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expense excludes stock-based compensation expense and certain other expenses. 
In summary, we are in a strong financial position as we enter in 2016. We remain committed to delivering a financial profile that is similar to many of our large cap biotech peers, which includes sustainable revenue and earnings growth, high operating margins and most importantly, continued investment create future medicines."

So let me just reiterate a couple of things that Ian said about ORKAMBI and the factors we are taking into account when thinking about the launch and we're tracking very closely. One is obviously the peak penetration, so the number of eligible patients in total we get initiated on therapy over time and we continue to expect the vast majority of 8,500 patients well. That is the rate of update. How quickly we get to that peak penetration. As you know, at the end of December, we had about 4,500 patients on therapy. That's about 55% of the total and we expect it will get to peak penetration during the course of 2016. And then as you said, one of the other key component is persistence, the number of patients who stay on therapy. And obviously, it's pretty early days, because whilst we've already been on the market for 6 months, we really don't have long-term experience with very many patients yet. In the Phase III study for ORKAMBI, at about 24 weeks in traffic and transport, about 5% of patients would discontinue. At 48 weeks in the open label expansion with ORKAMBI, we were -- 15% of patients have discontinued. So that's in the ORKAMBI chronicle trials, and time will tell whether we see a higher or lower number but probably a higher number who are discontinuing in the real world. With KALYDECO, in the studies we've done, it was about 5% of patients again discontinued in the KALYDECO clinical trials. It was actually slightly higher than that in the real world. It got closer to 10%, so in the real world over time and largely, that was over a longer period of time, we did see a slightly higher number, a higher percentage of patients of KALYDECO discontinued versus the clinical trials. The last thing we're going to be thinking about that is obviously compliance, not the percentage of patients, who actually take the pills that are being described by their physician. As you know, KALYDECO is very, very high at 85%, certainly the highest I've ever seen personally for a chronic medication of the CF medicines or roundabout the 60% [ph] range, I would anticipate ORKAMBI is going to be in that range probably toward the higher part of that range, but somewhere in that range. And the other question, we'll have to look at very closely and again, we just don't have data on it, we don't have data on it in the clinical program, Jeff, and we'll have to see how it plays out in the real world, is whether physicians and patients choose to reinitiate therapy if they discontinued for some reason. We just have no information from the clinical trials because they just weren't set up to look at that. If the patient discontinued, they would just kind of exclude it from further therapy, so we just don't have data on that right now, Jeff. Hopefully, that gives you some perspective on what we're thinking."

I will say that we're also quite pleased with the evidence of efficacy in the population, where it gets harder to actually demonstrate that. And I think actually, the FEV1 showing that strong trend was actually quite favorable, remembering that these kids get started at a pretty high FEV1 percentage of baseline.

And so both in terms of peak penetration and rate of uptake, I think that's probably the best analog for you to think of in terms of the rate of uptake we might see before approved. And then just to illustrate what Ian said in his prepared remarks, if we're approved in residual function, our anticipation is that we'll update our KALYDECO guidance to reflect that."

That will then sell out of the channel, so it does impact future sales because it was an inventory. We have remove that from our guidance, so when we made an estimate for our 2016 KALYDECO guidance, we removed that. In fact, I think when we all met in JP Morgan in San Francisco, I gave people a simple calculation to think about how we got to our guidance for 2015 and I'll just refer to that again, which is in the fourth quarter of 2015, we get approximately $180 million with the KALYDECO revenue, $181 million to be precise, but approximately $180 million. If you multiplied that -- if you take $6 million out of that and you get $174 million for the fourth quarter run rate revenues and then multiply that by 4, you then actually deduct the patients from that annualized number and you get approximately range of the guidance we provided, which was $670 million to $690 million for KALYDECO.

What I would say, I don't know the assumptions that are being put into other people's models, but I would ask you to listen carefully to Stewart's comments, where we touched on when do we believe we're going to get the peak penetration, the rate of uptake of ORKAMBI? And then importantly, the persistence and compliance, because specifically compliance, if people take 6 pills out of every 10, it's straightforward, you get $6 out of every $10 of your growth price. And then obviously, there is a gross-to-net discount based on but if it got Medicaid patients.

It's just the sheer volume of patients is much larger than it is for KALYDECO and it's just more of an administrative burden to initiate patients.

If you think about where we are today versus where we were even 6 months ago, right, today, we have approval for 8,500 patients in U.S. and we have a launch that we're really pleased with, [indiscernible] 4,500 or 55% of the patients is already in drug in the U.S. which I think is remarkable. We have reimbursement in the U.S. that has gone actually better than we even expected, meaning every state Medicaid is now reimbursing the drug and the majority of the private insurers are. We have approval in Europe and are setting the launch in Germany integrated in the press release in ATU [ph] in France. Now we have approval in Canada, which gives us access to 1,500 private patients and the ability to negotiate reimbursement, as Stuart said, to an on additional, I think, 2,500 patients or so.

It's impossible to predict the exact kinetics, what's going to happen in the in versus the second quarter/ But at least the way we look at it, as we look out over the next couple of years, we see that opportunity intact and progressing really nicely.

I know you're you aware of this, but the RF application is little bit unusual compared to the application that [indiscernible] submitted on KALYDECO and ORKAMBI, which are always based on large Phase III studies. This one's different. It's basically aimed at about 1,500 patients with 23 different predations result in the residual function. And it's based predominantly on preclinical data. That's cell-based data from cells that have been engineered to have those 23 different mutations, supported by a very small Phase IIa study of about 24 patients that comprise the 8 or 9 of those 23 mutations. And so what we're really asking the FDA to look at is both the science and the medicine that we're submitting. But also there's a policy question here, how to extend the label of drugs like KALYDECO to vary of rare population and mutations. Some of these revisions only have 4 patients in the U.S. or 10 patients in the U.S. And that's a very important policy question in precision.  That is, as you know, the FDA is considering much more broadly than just in CF. And so part of the reason why it's a little difficult to handicap is one, because it's a combination of clinical and policy things. We feel very strongly for the patients that's why we did it. There are 1,500 patients in, in U.S. but today don't have any CFTR correction therapy of any sort, and it would be years before they can get to that based on large Phase III trials so for us, the step in the right thing to do for patients. And we believe the science strongly in the clinical support that behalf. But handicapping with the FDA is going to be obviously -- it's a bit more difficult. Monolith a very very and based upon what we do, will honestly, operate strategy.

We are very interested in some of these alternative endpoints for a couple of reasons. One, as Jeff said, this may be much more profitable to populations and widgets that got to measure FEV1 like the kids, particularly as they get younger. But also because, as you know, FEV1, which is really a measure of midsized airway resistance, is it's quite a bit downstream or upstream, if you will, from the problem in CF, which is really a distal airway gas exchange problem. And actually, LCI is probably much more sensitive measure closer to the actual physiology that's going on in CF. And so we've been very eager to start to see results from these kinds of studies to tell whether LCI could actually turn out to be as good or better an endpoint that FEV1 and obviously, you to provide agencies with the clinical data to support that this is the first step in that process."

And then we have a clear strategy with multiple prongs, actually, to get to the vast majority of patients, and they include the ENaC inhibitors, which are in Phase II so they can move very rapidly if we see positive results in combination with ORKAMBs. They included the nextgen correctors, which are moving along in Phase I and which we hope to have in patients in the second half of this year, and we think those have the potential to both increase the efficacy for the patients we're treating today, but also to allow us to get to that large subset of patients indiscernible] today.

Good evening, everyone. Earlier this month, I met with many of our investors and analysts at the annual JPMorgan Healthcare Conference to talk about the important transition that Vertex has made in the last few years.

Earlier this month, I met with many of our investors and analysts at the annual JPMorgan Healthcare Conference to talk about the important transition that Vertex has made in the last few years. As we enter 2016, Vertex is on a path towards sustained earnings and revenue growth driven by an increasing number of people being treated with our 2 approved medicines for cystic fibrosis, KALYDECO and ORKAMBI. We have a broad and deep pipeline of investigational medicines for CF that we believe may allow us to reach our goal of treating all people with CF in the future. Additionally, our pipeline of medicines for other serious diseases, including cancer, pain and other neurologic diseases, continues to progress through early-stage clinical development. In short, we are a very different company than we were just 4 years ago.
This evening, I will briefly review our key priorities for 2016 and provide some insight into upcoming milestones in CF and other parts of our business. Our #1 priority has been and continues to be to increase the number of people eligible for and treated with KALYDECO and ORKAMBI and to develop potential new medicines that they provide even greater benefit for all people with CF in the years ahead.
At this time last year, just over 3,000 people were eligible for treatment with KALYDECO. Today, approximately 25,000 people are eligible for KALYDECO or ORKAMBI, and we expect the vast majority of these people will begin treatment with these medicines to treat the cause of their CF. We also expect to increase the number of people eligible for these medicines in 2016 through label expansion efforts that could include younger patients or patients with other mutations in the CFTR gene.
Our second key priority for 2016 is to continue building a financial profile of sustained revenues and earnings growth and a strong balance sheet. In 2015, a continued expansion of the KALYDECO label and the approval of ORKAMBI resulted in a significant increase in the number of patients being treated with our medicines, which led to a significant increase in revenues. Our progress in 2015 has positioned us for continued growth, and we believe we are on the right path to achieve our goal of building a financial profile consistent with that of other global biotech companies.
And finally, our third key priority is to invest in our business to create future medicines for other serious diseases. Continued investment in our pipeline is essential for creating additional breakthrough medicines for patients. I'll spend just a few minutes reviewing our recent progress and upcoming milestones that reflect these 3 priorities.
Our first CF medicine, KALYDECO, was approved by the FDA in January 2012. And since then, our goal has been to bring this medicine to as many people as possible who may benefit. KALYDECO addresses the underlying cause of CF and is a significant medical advance for people with certain mutations in the CFTR gene. Today, approximately 4,000 people are eligible for treatment with KALYDECO in North America, Europe and Australia. We're committed to bringing this medicine to even more patients who we believe may benefit in the years ahead.
We are awaiting decision from the U.S. FDA on our application for approval of KALYDECO in people ages 2 and older with CF who have certain residual function mutations. There are approximately 1,500 people ages 2 and older in the U.S. who have the residual function mutations represented in the supplemental New Drug Application for KALYDECO. While our submission for approval in these mutations is primarily based on preclinical data and on a Phase IIa critical study in only 24 patients, we believe that KALYDECO would be beneficial to these patients given the underlying science behind this precision medicine approach of using genetic markers and predictive assays to identify patients who are likely to benefit. Importantly, we chose to seek this approval knowing that these patients would otherwise have to potentially wait years before potential approval based on Phase III data. 
With more than 4 years of safety data, we believe that this path toward potential approval is in the best interest of people with CF. However, we also recognize that the application is based upon limited available clinical data in these rare mutations. The PDUFA date for a decision from the FDA is February 7.
With ORKAMBI, we are working to bring this medicine to more patients who we believe would benefit, specifically children with 2 copies of the F508del mutation, similar to the approach we took with KALYDECO. With the approval in the European Union at the end of last year, approximately 20,500 people ages 12 and older are now eligible for treatment with ORKAMBI in the U.S. and Europe. Today, we announced the Phase III study of ORKAMBI in children ages 6 to 11 met its primary safety endpoint and supports our planned submission of a supplemental New Drug Application in the second quarter of this year in the U.S. If approved, an additional 2,400 people in the U.S. with CF would be eligible for treatment with ORKAMBI.
While this was primarily a safety study, we also saw encouraging improvements in secondary and exploratory efficacy endpoints, including a statistically significant change in the exploratory endpoint of lung clearance index or LCI. Changes in LCI are also the primary endpoint of an ongoing Phase III study to support approval of ORKAMBI in this age group in Europe. There are approximately 3,400 children ages 6 to 11 who have 2 copies of the F508del mutation in the European Union. Additional information on this data was provided in today's press release.
Today, KALYDECO and ORKAMBI are approved to treat approximately 25,000 people in North America, Europe and Australia. We believe that there are many more people who may benefit from these medicines, and we have trials ongoing or planned that could expand the number of people eligible for treatment to approximately 44,000 in the years ahead.
Beyond our approved medicines, we have a pipeline of investigational CF medicines from early-stage research programs such as gene editing with CRISPR to late-stage development programs evaluating combinations of our CFTR modulators. This pipeline represents hope for the CF community, and our goal is to one day treat all people with CF.
We have a broad Phase III program underway evaluating the corrector VX-661 in combination with ivacaftor, and we are also advancing the development of 2 next-generation correctors that would be combined with VX-661 and ivacaftor as part of a Phase II study of triple combinations planned for later this year. Both approaches are asking the same fundamental questions. First, can we enhance the benefit for patients already receiving KALYDECO or ORKAMBI? And second, can we provide benefits to new groups of people with CF not currently helped by KALYDECO or ORKAMBI, including a very large group of patients with 1 F508del mutation and a second mutation known to result in minimal CFTR function?
The VX-661 program includes 4 Phase III studies in different groups of people with CF who have at least one copy of the F508del mutation. We will begin to see the first results from the VX-661 program by early 2017, and importantly, this program is also meant to provide a significant amount of safety data to support evaluation of the next-generation corrector with VX-661 and ivacaftor as part of an investigational triple combination regimen.
At the end of 2015, we initiated a clinical development of 2 next-generation correctors, VX-152 and VX-440. Phase I studies of each compound are ongoing in healthy volunteers and are evaluating single and multiple doses of VX-152 and VX-440 as well as triple combinations with VX-661 and ivacaftor. Together with a safety data from the VX-661 program, these studies are designed to support the planned initiation of Phase II studies to evaluate triple combination regimens in patients in the second half of 2016.
Our business model is unique. The success we've achieved in CF allows us to reinvest in the discovery and development of new transformative medicines. In parallel with CF, we are advancing a number of additional development programs for cancer, pain and other serious diseases. We have significant flexibility in how we may advance these programs, either independently for those diseases that we believe are aligned with the focus of our business, specifically specialty diseases where G&A expenses are low, or in collaboration with other companies that we believe would be best suited to rapidly bring these potential medicines to patients. We believe our pipeline represents both potentially transformative future medicines for patients and significant value for our business. We've begun to provide some additional insight and data for our pipeline programs, and I look forward to providing updates on our progress throughout the coming year.
I mentioned at the start of my remarks that Vertex has undergone an important transition in recent years. We are now a global biotech company that has independently brought forward 2 breakthrough medicines to people with CF worldwide and is on the path to delivering significant earnings and cash flow. Our financial performance in 2015 and guidance for 2016 are metrics of the kind of company that we want to become, a company that consistently creates transformative new medicines for patients, generates significant value for shareholders and reinvests in scientific opportunities to create future medicines. This is our business model, and I'm pleased by our success to date and with our outlook for the coming years.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Ian."

For my remarks today, I will review our fourth quarter and full year 2015 financial results and discuss our 2016 financial guidance for total KALYDECO net revenues and non-GAAP operating expenses, excluding cost of revenues. I'll also discus",1297,"Thanks, Jeff. For my remarks today, I will review our fourth quarter and full year 2015 financial results and discuss our 2016 financial guidance for total KALYDECO net revenues and non-GAAP operating expenses, excluding cost of revenues. I'll also discuss our expectation for providing ORKAMBI guidance in 2016.
Financial results first. Our 2015 net CF product revenues were approximately $983 million. This includes KALYDECO net revenues of $632 million and ORKAMBI net revenues of $351 million. Total CF product revenues increased by more than 110% compared to 2014. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we reported total net CF product revenues of approximately $401 million, including KALYDECO net revenues of $181 million and ORKAMBI net revenues of $220 million.
Fourth quarter KALYDECO sales of $181 million were up 45% versus the fourth quarter of last year and up 9% versus the third quarter of 2015. This included approximately $6 million inventory stocking that occurred at the end of the fourth quarter. Growth in KALYDECO was driven by both label expansion efforts, which increased the number of eligible patients to approximately 4,000, and by the completion of key reimbursement discussions in Europe. 
With ORKAMBI, more than 1,500 patients starts in the fourth quarter, resulting in sales of $220 million, up 68% versus third quarter of 2015. As expected, we saw a very rapid uptake for ORKAMBI in the period immediately following the FDA approval with more than 3,000 people starting treatment in the third quarter. Demand from patients and physicians has been strong. But as expected, fewer patients started treatment in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter, in line with our prior statements regarding expectations for the rate of uptake for ORKAMBI. We expect this trend to continue through the end of 2016, by which time, we expect the vast majority of the 8,500 eligible patients in the U.S. to have initiated treatment with ORKAMBI.
Gross-to-net adjustments were largely unchanged from the third quarter and were in the high single digits due primarily to a greater proportion of patients within commercial plans initiating treatment in the first 6 months following the approval of ORKAMBI as compared to government-paid plans. Each of the 50 state Medicaid programs has now paid a claim for ORKAMBI. Thus, we expect gross-to-net adjustments will increase to the mid-teens by the end of 2016 to reflect an increase in patients treated being covered by Medicaid.
As we enter 2016, we are pleased with the launch of ORKAMBI to date and remain focused on working to ensure those who need the medicine have access to it, educating health care providers and supporting adherence to ORKAMBI.
Now to operating expenses. Our fourth quarter non-GAAP operating expenses were $282 million, including R&D expenses of $204 million and SG&A expenses of $78 million. The increased R&D expense in the fourth quarter 2015 compared to 2014 were primarily the result of increased costs related to the pivotal Phase III program for VX-661 in combination with ivacaftor. The increased SG&A expenses were primarily the result of an increased investment in global commercial support for the launch of ORKAMBI.
And tonight, I'm pleased to report that for the fourth quarter 2015, we recorded a non-GAAP net profit of $43 million or $0.17 per diluted share compared to non-GAAP net loss of $132 million or $0.55 per share for the fourth quarter of 2014. Our 2015 non-GAAP net loss was $268 million or $1.11 per share compared to non-GAAP net loss of $511 million or $2.17 per share for the full year 2014.
From a balance sheet perspective, we started 2016 with a strong cash position of $1.04 billion. Vertex also has $300 million outstanding from a credit agreement that provides for a secured loan of up to $500 million.
Now let's turn to the 2016 financial guidance, which we first provided on January 10. We expect 2016 KALYDECO net revenues of $670 million to $690 million. Our guidance for KALYDECO revenues reflects the continued use of KALYDECO, as was seen in the fourth quarter of 2015, which results in revenues of $181 million, and the expectation for up to approximately 200 patients with a gating mutation to enroll in the Phase III clinical study of VX-661 in combination with ivacaftor who would otherwise have received KALYDECO, which will thus reduce 2016 KALYDECO revenues. There was also an approximately $6 million inventory stocking that occurred at the end of the fourth quarter 2015 that is not expected to recur in future quarters and is thus accounted for in our guidance. Importantly, our current guidance excludes any potential revenues from the approval of KALYDECO for people with residual function mutations. We will update our KALYDECO guidance should we receive FDA approval for residual function mutations.
With ORKAMBI, more than 4,500 people have begun treatment in the U.S. by the end of 2015. There are 4 primary pieces of information regarding the launch that will inform our decision regarding ORKAMBI guidance. First, since all patients who initiated treatment with ORKAMBI in 2015 have been on treatment for approximately 6 months or less, we are awaiting additional information on the compliance rate for patients taking ORKAMBI. While we continue to expect that the vast majority of eligible patients in the U.S. will begin treatment with ORKAMBI by the end of 2016, we are awaiting additional information on the specific rate of uptake and on the specific proportion of the 8,500 eligible patients who will begin treatment with ORKAMBI in 2016.
And finally, additional information on the persistence rate defined as how many patients remain on treatment will also be taken into account. These 4 factors, the compliance rate, the rate at which patients begin treatment, the total number of patients who initiate treatment and the persistence rate, all are important in considering our guidance for ORKAMBI.
In 2016, we expect to recognize revenues from sales of ORKAMBI in the U.S. and Germany. In Germany, there are approximately 2,500 people with CF ages 12 and older with 2 copies of F508del mutation. In Europe, country-by-country reimbursement discussions are underway. However, we do not anticipate any significant ORKAMBI revenues from countries other than the U.S. and Germany in 2016.
The final component of our financial guidance is non-GAAP operating expenses, which are comprised of R&D and SG&A expenses and exclude cost of revenues. We expect our total 2016 non-GAAP operating expenses of $1.18 billion to $1.23 billion. As a reminder, our guidance for 2015 operating expenses was for $1.05 billion to $1.1 billion. And we reported 2015 operating expenses at the low end of this range of $1.06 billion, largely as a result of cost related to VX-661 that will now occur in 2016 as opposed to 2015. The increase in expense -- expected operating expenses for 2016 as compared to 2015 is primarily a result of expanded development efforts related to the pivotal Phase III development program for VX-661 in combination with ivacaftor and for multiple Phase I and II studies of Vertex's early-stage and mid-stage pipeline of potential CF medicines and anticipated SG&A costs to support the launch of ORKAMBI in new global markets.
The components of Vertex's non-GAAP operating expenses include non-GAAP R&D expenses, which we expect to be in the range of $850 million to $880 million, and non-GAAP SG&A expenses, which we expect will be in the range of $330 million to $350 million. Vertex's expected non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses exclude stock-based compensation expense and certain other expenses.
In summary, we are in a strong financial position as we enter 2016. We remain committed to delivering a financial profile that is similar to many of our large cap biotech peers, which includes sustainable revenue and earnings growth, high operating margins and most importantly, continued investment to create future medicines."

It's Stuart here. So yes, let me just reiterate a couple of things that Ian said about ORKAMBI and the factors we're taking into account when thinking about the launch and that we're tracking very closely. One is obviously the peak penetration",520,"Yes, Geoff. It's Stuart here. So yes, let me just reiterate a couple of things that Ian said about ORKAMBI and the factors we're taking into account when thinking about the launch and that we're tracking very closely. One is obviously the peak penetration, so the number of eligible patients in total we get initiated on therapy over time, and we continue to expect the vast majority of 8,500 patients will. Then there's the rate of uptake, how quickly we get to that peak penetration. As you know, at the end of December, we had about 4,500 patients on therapy. That's about 55% of the total. And we expect that we'll get to peak penetration during the course of 2016. And then as you said, one of the other key components is persistence, the number of patients who stay on therapy. And obviously, it's pretty early days because whilst we've only been on the market for 6 months, we really don't have long-term experience with very many patients yet. In the Phase III study for ORKAMBI, at about 24 weeks in TRAFFIC and TRANSPORT, about 5% of patients have discontinued. At 48 weeks in the open label expansion with ORKAMBI, we were -- 15% of patients have discontinued. So that's in the ORKAMBI clinical trials, and time will tell whether we see a higher or lower number but probably a higher number who are discontinuing in the real world. With KALYDECO, in the studies we've looked at, it was about 5% of patients again discontinued in the KALYDECO clinical trials. It was actually slightly higher than that in the real world. It got closer to 10%, so in the real world over time. And largely, that was good [ph], but over a longer period of time, we did see a slightly higher number of -- a higher percentage of patients on KALYDECO discontinued versus the clinical trials. The last thing we're going to be thinking about then is obviously compliance, not the percentage of patients who actually take the pills that have been described by their physician. As you know, KALYDECO is very, very high at 85%, certainly the highest I've ever seen personally for a chronic medication of the CF medicines or around about the 60% range. I would anticipate ORKAMBI is going to be in that range, probably toward the higher part of that range but somewhere in that range. The only other question we will have to look at very closely and we -- again, we just don't have data on it, we don't have data on it in the clinical program, Geoff, and we'll have to see how it plays out in the real world, is whether physicians and patients choose to reinitiate therapy if they have discontinued for some reason. And we just have no information from the clinical trials because they just weren't set up to look at that. If the patient discontinued, they would then kind of exclude it from further therapy. So we just don't have data on that right now, Geoff. Hopefully, that gives you some perspective on what we're thinking."

And then on the commercial side, I want to ask, you've left the residual function mutations out of the KALYDECO guidance. But just trying to get a sense for if that were to be approved, how should we think about the onboarding of those patients on the commercial drug? I would imagine that you have a conversion of those that are on trial to commercial, but apart from that, would you characterize this as a highly motivated subset of patients? Or because they have a milder phenotype, could this be a slower rate of penetration?"

I will say that I think we're also quite pleased with the evidence of efficacy in the population where it gets harder to actually demonstrate that. And I think actually, the FEV1 showing that strong trend was actually quite favorable, remembering that these kids started at a pretty high FEV1 percentage at baseline. And as actually you noted, the fact that the LCI measure, which is in its earlier days was nicely positive, and that's our primary endpoint in the European study.

In terms of patients transferring from clinical trials, clearly the clinical trial on which the application is based or what's included in the clinical trial is very small. So it's not as if there's a huge bolus of patients to transition from clinical supply to commercial supply. In terms of rate of uptake, the best analog, I think, for you there would be R117H, which by definition is a residual function mutation. And so both in terms of peak penetration and rate of uptake, I think that's probably the best analog for you to think of in terms of the rate of uptake we might see before approved. And then just to illustrate what Ian said in his prepared remarks, if we're approved in residual function, our anticipation is that we'll update our KALYDECO guidance to reflect that."

That will then sell out of the channel, so it does impact future sales because it was an inventory. We have removed that from our guidance. So when we made an estimate for our 2016 KALYDECO guidance, we removed that. In fact, I think when we all met in JPMorgan in San Francisco, I gave people a simple calculation to think about how we got to our guidance for 2016. I'll just refer to that again, which is in the fourth quarter of 2015, we did approximately $180 million with the KALYDECO revenues, $181 million to be precise, but approximately $180 million. If you multiply that -- if you take $6 million out of that, you get $174 million with the fourth quarter run rate revenues and then multiply that by 4, you then actually deduct the patients from that annualized number and you get to approximate range of the guidance that we provided, which was $670 million to $690 million for KALYDECO.

But I appreciate the opportunity maybe to comment on how people are thinking about the ORKAMBI launch and how we're seeing it reflected in sell side models. And specifically, 2016, let's say, forecasted that are in the sell side models. So obviously, when you look at consensus, there are a number of different models that are out there, a number of different numbers. And so there's some extreme numbers and then there's some that are more towards the normal. What I would say, I don't know the assumptions that are being put into other people's models, but I would ask you to listen carefully to Stuart's comments, where we touch on when do we believe we're going to get to peak penetration, the rate of uptake of ORKAMBI? And then importantly, the persistence and compliance, because specifically compliance, if people take 6 pills out of every 10, it's straightforward, you get $6 out of every $10 of your growth price. And then obviously, there is a gross-to-net discount based on whether you've got Medicaid patients versus private-paying patients. And so I just -- the opportunity to comment on this call to all people at once is I just want to make sure that people are giving a thorough consideration to all these aspects of the launch, and we'd be happy to talk to you after the call as well."

In terms of rate of uptake, much as we're seeing here in the U.S., I'd anticipate that the relative rate of uptake will be slower for ORKAMBI than it was with KALYDECO in Canada, and indeed, other markets outside of the U.S. for the same reason. It's just the sheer volume of patients is much larger than it is for KALYDECO, and it's just more of an administrative burden to initiate patients.

Obviously, we've heard a lot from Ian and Stuart on some of the questions about the kinetics of the launch and some of the short-term modeling. I do think it's important to stand back as well and remember what the total opportunity is, which, I think is where your question is going. So if you think about where we are today versus where we were even 6 months ago, right, today, we have approval for 8,500 patients in U.S. and we have a launch that we're really pleased with, with more than 4,500 or 55% of the patients already on the drug in the U.S., which I think is remarkable. We have reimbursement in the U.S. that's gone actually better than we even expected, meaning every state Medicaid is now reimbursing the drug and the majority of the private insurers are. We have approval in Europe, and are starting a launch in Germany, as you heard in the press release; an ATU in France. Now we have approval in Canada, which gives us access to 1,500 private patients and the ability to negotiate reimbursement, as Stuart said, to an additional, I think, 2,500 patients or so. And so when you look at the total opportunity, it's actually every bit of what we thought before, and we've made significant progress. And nothing with that has changed. It's impossible to predict the exact kinetics, what's going to happen in the first quarter versus the second quarter. But at least, the way we look at it, as we look out over the next couple of years, we see that opportunity intact and progressing really nicely. And I think it's important to sort of see that in the big picture as well as the short-term model. So I hope that helps."

So the information I can give you is somewhat imperfect, just so you know.

Their pulmonary function really is far from normal. It allows you to measure that. And over reasonably short periods of time, sort of like a 6-month period, as we go in our clinical studies, there could be small decreases. But we think overall, that, that should be relatively stable. There may be modest shift over time, but we think we'd be able to have a reasonable baseline for assessing it. So -- and actually, that's part of why the data that we had coming out of our pediatric study, even without the control arm, was encouraging to us. Maybe I'll take a comment on the study in patients whose FEV1s are less than 40. We're still actually the process of collecting all that data. We are still enrolling. But we think that there's some useful information. They are just in terms of the experience that we've accrued.

And then Jeff, you can take the second question on the chest tightness. So maybe just to give you a little background, and I know you're you aware of this, but the RF application is a little bit unusual compared to the applications that Vertex has submitted on KALYDECO and ORKAMBI, which are always based on large Phase III studies. This one's different. It's basically aimed at about 1,500 patients, with 23 different mutations resulting in residual function. And it's based predominantly on preclinical data. That is cell-based data from cells that have been engineered to have those 23 different mutations, supported by a very small Phase IIa study of about 24 patients that comprise the 8 or 9 of those 23 mutations. And so what we're really asking the FDA to look at is both the science and the medicine that we're submitting. But also there's a policy question here, which is, how do you extend the label of drugs like KALYDECO to very rare population and mutations. Some of these mutations only have 4 patients in the U.S. or 10 patients in the U.S. And that's a very important policy question in precision medicine. As you know, the FDA is considering much more broadly than just in CF. And so part of the reason why it's a little difficult handicap is, one, because it's this combination of clinical and policy sort of things. We feel very strongly, the right thing to do for patients, that's why we did it. There are 1,500 patients in the U.S. that today don't have any CFTR correction therapy of any sort, and it would be years before they could get them based on large Phase III trials. And so for us, this is definitely the right thing to do for patients. And we believe in the science strongly and in the clinical support that we have. But handicapping what the FDA is going to do, obviously, it's a bit more difficult. We'll know by February 7. And then based upon what we do, we'd obviously come up with a strategy. But again, our goal is to try to get this medicine as fully as a safety data to these patients as soon as possible."

One, as Jeff said, this may be much more applicable to populations in which it's difficult to measure FEV1, like the kids, particularly as they get younger. But also because, as you know, FEV1, which is really a measure of mid-sized airway resistance, is it's quite a bit downstream or upstream, if you will, from the problem in CF, which is really a distal airway gas-exchange problem. And actually, LCI is a probably much more sensitive measure, closer to the actual physiology of what's going on in CF. And so we've been very eager to start to see results from these kinds of studies that tell whether LCI could actually turn out to be as good or better an endpoint that FEV1 and, obviously, you need to provide agencies with clinical data to support that. And this is the first step in that process."

I'd certainly recommend that people take into account the same consideration that the peak penetration, times of peak, persistence rate and compliance, and model over each individually. In terms of what we've seen with KALYDECO, we have seen that the worst compliance we see tends to be in that sort of teenage to young adult still. And so because kids -- our assumption, because kids are very closely monitored by their parents, particularly in that kind of 6-to-11-year age group, perhaps not surprisingly, we see high levels of compliance with that particular patient group. We tend to see a bit of a dip, perhaps unsurprisingly, in the sort of teenage-to-young-adults group. So we might anticipate in the 6-to-11 group that, that would be our best complying patient population. And that's certainly what we've seen with KALYDECO."

At the risk of running for 1 or 2 more minutes, I did want to make a couple of concluding remarks. And again, I always like to do this sort of in retrospect and say, where are we today as a company as compared to where we were 6 or 12 months ago. And I must say from a personal standpoint and from the standpoint of CF patients, I'm very, very encouraged with the progress that we've made. I think we've -- it's now clear that KALYDECO and ORKAMBI together are approved for about 2,500 patients, or almost 1/3 of all patients, CF patients in the world. And as we discussed at JPMorgan, it's a fairly straightforward strategy to label expansion in the younger populations and others to take that number from 25,000 to 44,000 patients in the next couple of years. 
And then we have a clear strategy with multiple prongs, actually, to get to the vast majority of patients, and they include the ENaC inhibitors, which are in Phase II, so they can move very rapidly if we see positive results there in combination with ORKAMBI. They include the next-gen correctors, which are moving along in Phase I, and which we hope to have in patients in the second half of this year. And we think those have the potential to both increase the efficacy for the patients we're treating today, but also to let us to get to that large subset of het-min patients that don't have anything today. 
And then finally, the progress we've made with some of our deals, particularly the CRISPR deal here. And although that's the Holy Grail, 10 or 15 years down the road, we do have a vision of potentially correcting the underlying mutation in curing patients with CF. 
And so as I look at the world from our perspective, obviously, I'm tremendously encouraged about the future opportunity, and particularly, the future opportunity for patients and improves with the progress we're making. And we look forward to updating you over the next year as we continue that."

Good evening, everyone. Earlier this month, I met with many of our investors and analysts at the annual JPMorgan Healthcare Conference to talk about the important transition that Vertex has made in the last few years. As we enter 2016, Ve",1588,"Thanks, Michael. Good evening, everyone. Earlier this month, I met with many of our investors and analysts at the annual JPMorgan Healthcare Conference to talk about the important transition that Vertex has made in the last few years. As we enter 2016, Vertex is on a path towards sustained earnings and revenue growth driven by an increasing number of people being treated with our 2 approved medicines for cystic fibrosis, KALYDECO and ORKAMBI. We have a broad and deep pipeline of investigational medicines for CF that we believe may allow us to reach our goal of treating all people with CF in the future. Additionally, our pipeline of medicines for other serious diseases, including cancer, pain and other neurologic diseases, continues to progress through early-stage clinical development. In short, we are a very different company than we were just 4 years ago.
This evening, I will briefly review our key priorities for 2016 and provide some insight into upcoming milestones in CF and other parts of our business. Our #1 priority has been and continues to be to increase the number of people eligible for and treated with KALYDECO and ORKAMBI and to develop potential new medicines that may provide even greater benefit for all people with CF in the years ahead.
At this time last year, just over 3,000 people were eligible for treatment with KALYDECO. Today, approximately 25,000 people are eligible for KALYDECO or ORKAMBI, and we expect the vast majority of these people will begin treatment with these medicines to treat the cause of their CF. We also expect to increase the number of people eligible for these medicines in 2016 through label expansion efforts that could include younger patients or patients with other mutations in the CFTR gene.
Our second key priority for 2016 is to continue building a financial profile of sustained revenues and earnings growth and a strong balance sheet. In 2015, the continued expansion of the KALYDECO label and the approval of ORKAMBI resulted in a significant increase in the number of patients being treated with our medicines, which led to a significant increase in revenues. Our progress in 2015 has positioned us for continued growth, and we believe we are on the right path to achieve our goal of building a financial profile consistent with that of other global biotech companies.
And finally, our third key priority is to invest in our business to create future medicines for other serious diseases. Continued investment in our pipeline is essential for creating additional breakthrough medicines for patients. I'll spend just a few minutes reviewing our recent progress and upcoming milestones that reflect these 3 priorities.
Our first CF medicine, KALYDECO, was approved by the FDA in January 2012. And since then, our goal has been to bring this medicine to as many people as possible who may benefit. KALYDECO addresses the underlying cause of CF and is a significant medical advance for people with certain mutations in the CFTR gene. Today, approximately 4,000 people are eligible for treatment with KALYDECO in North America, Europe and Australia. We're committed to bringing this medicine to even more patients who we believe may benefit in the years ahead.
We are awaiting decision from the U.S. FDA on our application for approval of KALYDECO in people ages 2 and older with CF who have certain residual function mutations. There are approximately 1,500 people ages 2 and older in the U.S. who have the residual function mutations represented in the supplemental New Drug Application for KALYDECO. While our submission for approval in these mutations is primarily based on preclinical data and on a Phase IIa critical study in only 24 patients, we believe that KALYDECO would be beneficial to these patients given the underlying science behind this precision medicine approach of using genetic markers and predictive assays to identify patients who are likely to benefit. Importantly, we chose to seek this approval knowing that these patients would otherwise have to potentially wait years before potential approval based on Phase III data. 
With more than 4 years of safety data, we believe that this path toward potential approval is in the best interest of people with CF. However, we also recognize that the application is based upon limited available clinical data in these rare mutations. The PDUFA date for a decision from the FDA is February 7.
With ORKAMBI, we are working to bring this medicine to more patients who we believe would benefit, specifically children with 2 copies of the F508del mutation, similar to the approach we took with KALYDECO. With the approval in the European Union at the end of last year, approximately 20,500 people ages 12 and older are now eligible for treatment with ORKAMBI in the U.S. and Europe. Today, we announced the Phase III study of ORKAMBI in children ages 6 to 11 met its primary safety endpoint and supports our planned submission of a supplemental New Drug Application in the second quarter of this year in the U.S. If approved, an additional 2,400 people in the U.S. with CF would be eligible for treatment with ORKAMBI.
While this was primarily a safety study, we also saw encouraging improvements in secondary and exploratory efficacy endpoints, including a statistically significant change in the exploratory endpoint of lung clearance index or LCI. Changes in LCI are also the primary endpoint of an ongoing Phase III study to support approval of ORKAMBI in this age group in Europe. There are approximately 3,400 children ages 6 to 11 who have 2 copies of the F508del mutation in the European Union. Additional information on this data was provided in today's press release.
Today, KALYDECO and ORKAMBI are approved to treat approximately 25,000 people in North America, Europe and Australia. We believe that there are many more people who may benefit from these medicines, and we have trials ongoing or planned that could expand the number of people eligible for treatment to approximately 44,000 in the years ahead.
Beyond our approved medicines, we have a pipeline of investigational CF medicines from early-stage research programs such as gene editing with CRISPR to late-stage development programs evaluating combinations of our CFTR modulators. This pipeline represents hope for the CF community, and our goal is to one day treat all people with CF.
We have a broad Phase III program underway evaluating the corrector VX-661 in combination with ivacaftor, and we are also advancing the development of 2 next-generation correctors that would be combined with VX-661 and ivacaftor as part of a Phase II study of triple combinations planned for later this year. Both approaches are asking the same fundamental questions. First, can we enhance the benefit for patients already receiving KALYDECO or ORKAMBI? And second, can we provide benefits to new groups of people with CF not currently helped by KALYDECO or ORKAMBI, including a very large group of patients with 1 F508del mutation and a second mutation known to result in minimal CFTR function?
The VX-661 program includes 4 Phase III studies in different groups of people with CF who have at least one copy of the F508del mutation. We will begin to see the first results from the VX-661 program by early 2017, and importantly, this program is also meant to provide a significant amount of safety data to support evaluation of a next-generation corrector with VX-661 and ivacaftor as part of an investigational triple combination regimen.
At the end of 2015, we initiated clinical development of 2 next-generation correctors, VX-152 and VX-440. Phase I studies of each compound are ongoing in healthy volunteers and are evaluating single and multiple doses of VX-152 and VX-440 as well as triple combinations with VX-661 and ivacaftor. Together with the safety data from the VX-661 program, these studies are designed to support the planned initiation of Phase II studies to evaluate triple combination regimens in patients in the second half of 2016.
Our business model is unique. The success we've achieved in CF allows us to reinvest in the discovery and development of new transformative medicines. In parallel with CF, we are advancing a number of additional development programs for cancer, pain and other serious diseases. We have significant flexibility in how we may advance these programs, either independently for those diseases that we believe are aligned with the focus of our business, specifically specialty diseases where G&A expenses are low, or in collaboration with other companies that we believe would be best suited to rapidly bring these potential medicines to patients. We believe our pipeline represents both potentially transformative future medicines for patients and significant value for our business. We've begun to provide some additional insight and data for our pipeline programs, and I look forward to providing updates on our progress throughout the coming year.
I mentioned at the start of my remarks that Vertex has undergone an important transition in recent years. We are now a global biotech company that has independently brought forward 2 breakthrough medicines to people with CF worldwide and is on the path to delivering significant earnings and cash flow. Our financial performance in 2015 and guidance for 2016 are metrics of the kind of company that we want to become, a company that consistently creates transformative new medicines for patients, generates significant value for shareholders and reinvests in scientific opportunities to create future medicines. This is our business model, and I'm pleased by our success to date and with our outlook for the coming years.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Ian."

I'll also discus",1298,"Thanks, Jeff. For my remarks today, I will review our fourth quarter and full year 2015 financial results and discuss our 2016 financial guidance for total KALYDECO net revenues and non-GAAP operating expenses, excluding cost of revenues. I'll also discuss our expectation for providing ORKAMBI guidance in 2016.
Financial results first. Our 2015 net CF product revenues were approximately $983 million. This includes KALYDECO net revenues of $632 million and ORKAMBI net revenues of $351 million. Total CF product revenues increased by more than 110% compared to 2014. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we reported total net CF product revenues of approximately $401 million, including KALYDECO net revenues of $181 million and ORKAMBI net revenues of $220 million.
Fourth quarter KALYDECO sales of $181 million were up 45% versus the fourth quarter of last year and up 9% versus the third quarter of 2015. This included approximately $6 million in inventory stocking that occurred at the end of the fourth quarter. Growth in KALYDECO was driven by both label expansion efforts, which increased the number of eligible patients to approximately 4,000, and by the completion of key reimbursement discussions in Europe. 
With ORKAMBI, more than 1,500 patients started in the fourth quarter, resulting in sales of $220 million, up 68% versus third quarter of 2015. As expected, we saw a very rapid uptake for ORKAMBI in the period immediately following the FDA approval with more than 3,000 people starting treatment in the third quarter. Demand from patients and physicians has been strong. But as expected, fewer patients started treatment in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter, in line with our prior statements regarding expectations for the rate of uptake for ORKAMBI. We expect this trend to continue through the end of 2016, by which time we expect the vast majority of the 8,500 eligible patients in the U.S. to have initiated treatment with ORKAMBI.
Gross-to-net adjustments were largely unchanged from the third quarter and were in the high single digits due primarily to a greater proportion of patients within commercial plans initiating treatment in the first 6 months following the approval of ORKAMBI as compared to government-paid plans. Each of the 50 state Medicaid programs has now paid a claim for ORKAMBI. Thus, we expect gross-to-net adjustments will increase to the mid-teens by the end of 2016 to reflect an increase in patients treated being covered by Medicaid.
As we enter 2016, we are pleased with the launch of ORKAMBI to date and remain focused on working to ensure those who need the medicine have access to it, educating health care providers and supporting adherence to ORKAMBI.
Now to operating expenses. Our fourth quarter non-GAAP operating expenses were $282 million, including R&D expenses of $204 million and SG&A expenses of $78 million. The increased R&D expense in the fourth quarter 2015 compared to 2014 were primarily the result of increased costs related to the pivotal Phase III program for VX-661 in combination with ivacaftor. The increased SG&A expenses were primarily the result of an increased investment in global commercial support for the launch of ORKAMBI.
And tonight, I'm pleased to report that for the fourth quarter 2015, we recorded a non-GAAP net profit of $43 million or $0.17 per diluted share compared to non-GAAP net loss of $132 million or $0.55 per share for the fourth quarter of 2014. Our 2015 non-GAAP net loss was $268 million or $1.11 per share compared to non-GAAP net loss of $511 million or $2.17 per share for the full year 2014.
From a balance sheet perspective, we started 2016 with a strong cash position of $1.04 billion. Vertex also has $300 million outstanding from a credit agreement that provides for a secured loan of up to $500 million.
Now let's turn to the 2016 financial guidance, which we first provided on January 10. We expect 2016 KALYDECO net revenues of $670 million to $690 million. Our guidance for KALYDECO revenues reflects the continued use of KALYDECO, as was seen in the fourth quarter of 2015, which resulted in revenues of $181 million, and the expectation for up to approximately 200 patients with a gating mutation to enroll in the Phase III clinical study of VX-661 in combination with ivacaftor who would otherwise have received KALYDECO, which will thus reduce 2016 KALYDECO revenues. There was also an approximately $6 million inventory stocking that occurred at the end of the fourth quarter 2015 that is not expected to occur in future quarters and is thus accounted for in our guidance. Importantly, our current guidance excludes any potential revenues from the approval of KALYDECO for people with residual function mutations. We will update our KALYDECO guidance should we receive FDA approval for residual function mutations.
With ORKAMBI, more than 4,500 people have begun treatment in the U.S. by the end of 2015. There are 4 primary pieces of information regarding the launch that will inform our decision regarding ORKAMBI guidance. First, since all patients who initiated treatment with ORKAMBI in 2015 have been on treatment for approximately 6 months or less, we are awaiting additional information on the compliance rate for patients taking ORKAMBI. While we continue to expect that the vast majority of eligible patients in the U.S. will begin treatment with ORKAMBI by the end of 2016, we are awaiting additional information on the specific rate of uptake and on the specific proportion of the 8,500 eligible patients who will begin treatment with ORKAMBI in 2016.
And finally, additional information on the persistence rate defined as how many patients remain on treatment will also be taken into account. These 4 factors, the compliance rate, the rate at which patients begin treatment, the total number of patients who initiate treatment and the persistence rate, all are important in considering our guidance for ORKAMBI.
In 2016, we expect to recognize revenues from sales of ORKAMBI in the U.S. and Germany. In Germany, there are approximately 2,500 people with CF ages 12 and older with 2 copies of F508del mutation. In Europe, country-by-country reimbursement discussions are underway. However, we do not anticipate any significant ORKAMBI revenues from countries other than the U.S. and Germany in 2016.
The final component of our financial guidance is non-GAAP operating expenses, which are comprised of R&D and SG&A expenses and exclude cost of revenues. We expect our total 2016 non-GAAP operating expenses of $1.18 billion to $1.23 billion. As a reminder, our guidance for 2015 operating expenses was for $1.05 billion to $1.1 billion. And we reported 2015 operating expenses at the low end of this range of $1.06 billion, largely as a result of cost related to VX-661 that will now occur in 2016 as opposed to 2015. The increase in expense -- expected operating expenses for 2016 as compared to 2015 is primarily a result of expanded development efforts related to the pivotal Phase III development program for VX-661 in combination with ivacaftor and for multiple Phase I and II studies of Vertex's early-stage and mid-stage pipeline of potential CF medicines and anticipated SG&A costs to support the launch of ORKAMBI in new global markets.
The components of Vertex's non-GAAP operating expenses include non-GAAP R&D expenses, which we expect to be in the range of $850 million to $880 million, and non-GAAP SG&A expenses, which we expect will be in the range of $330 million to $350 million. Vertex's expected non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses exclude stock-based compensation expense and certain other expenses.
In summary, we are in a strong financial position as we enter 2016. We remain committed to delivering a financial profile that is similar to many of our large cap biotech peers, which includes sustainable revenue and earnings growth, high operating margins and most importantly, continued investment to create future medicines."

It's Stuart here. So yes, let me just reiterate a couple of things that Ian said about ORKAMBI and the factors we're taking into account when thinking about the launch and that we're tracking very closely. One is obviously the peak penetration",519,"Yes, Geoff. It's Stuart here. So yes, let me just reiterate a couple of things that Ian said about ORKAMBI and the factors we're taking into account when thinking about the launch and that we're tracking very closely. One is obviously the peak penetration, so the number of eligible patients in total who get initiated on therapy over time, and we continue to expect the vast majority of 8,500 patients will. Then there's the rate of uptake, how quickly we get to that peak penetration. As you know, at the end of December, we had about 4,500 patients on therapy. That's about 55% of the total. And we expect that we'll get to peak penetration during the course of 2016. And then as you said, one of the other key components is persistence, the number of patients who stay on therapy. And obviously, it's pretty early days because whilst we've only been on the market for 6 months, we really don't have long-term experience with very many patients yet. In the Phase III study for ORKAMBI, at about 24 weeks in TRAFFIC and TRANSPORT, about 5% of patients had discontinued. At 48 weeks in the open label extension with ORKAMBI, we were at 15% of patients had discontinued. So that's in the ORKAMBI clinical trials, and time will tell whether we see a higher or lower number but probably a higher number who are discontinuing in the real world. With KALYDECO, in the studies we've looked at, it was about 5% of patients again discontinued in the KALYDECO clinical trials. It was actually slightly higher than that in the real world. It got closer to 10%, so in the real world over time. And largely, that was because it was over a longer period of time. We did see a slightly higher number of -- a higher percentage of patients on KALYDECO discontinued versus the clinical trials. The last thing we're going to be thinking about then is obviously compliance, and that's the percentage of patients who actually take the pills that have been prescribed by their physician. As you know, KALYDECO is very, very high at 85%, certainly the highest I've ever seen, personally, for a chronic medication. Other CF medicines are around about the 60% range. I would anticipate ORKAMBI is going to be in that range, probably toward the higher part of that range but somewhere in that range. The only other question we will have to look at very closely and we -- again, we just don't have data on it, we don't have data on it in the clinical program, Geoff, and we'll have to see how it plays out in the real world, is whether physicians and patients choose to reinitiate therapy if they have discontinued for some reason. And we just have no information from the clinical trials because they just weren't set up to look at that. If a patient discontinued, they would then kind of excluded from further therapy. So we just don't have data on that right now, Geoff. Hopefully, that gives you some perspective on what we're thinking."

And then on the commercial side, I wanted to ask, you've left the residual function mutations out of the KALYDECO guidance. But just trying to get a sense for if that were to be approved, how should we think about the onboarding of those patients onto commercial drug? I would imagine that you have a conversion of those that are on trial to commercial, but apart from that, would you characterize this as a highly motivated subset of patients?

The expectation with the FDA is that once you've established efficacy in the same disease in older children, that as you move to younger age groups, really, it's really about that exposure and safety consistent with the design of the study. I will say that I think we were also quite pleased with the evidence of efficacy in the population where it gets harder to actually demonstrate that. And I think actually, the FEV1 showing that strong trend was actually quite favorable, remembering that these kids started at a pretty high FEV1 percentage at baseline. And as actually you noted, the fact that the LCI measure, which is in its earlier days was nicely positive, and that's our primary endpoint in the European study.

In terms of patients transferring from clinical trials, clearly the clinical trial on which the application is based or what's included in the clinical trial is very small. So it's not as if there's a huge bolus of patients to transition from clinical supply to commercial supply. In terms of rate of uptake, the best analog, I think, for you there would be R117H, which by definition is a residual function mutation. And so both in terms of peak penetration and rate of uptake, I think that's probably the best analog for you to think of in terms of the rate of uptake we might see if we're approved. And then just to illustrate what Ian said in his prepared remarks, if we're approved in residual function, our anticipation is that we'll update our KALYDECO guidance to reflect that."

That will then sell out of the channel, so it does impact future sales because it was in inventory. We have removed that from our guidance. So when we made an estimate for our 2016 KALYDECO guidance, we removed that. In fact, I think when we all met in JPMorgan in San Francisco, I gave people a simple calculation to think about how we got to our guidance for 2016. I'll just refer to that again, which is in the fourth quarter of 2015, we did approximately $180 million with the KALYDECO revenues, $181 million to be precise, but approximately $180 million. If you multiply that -- if you take $6 million out of that, you get $174 million with the fourth quarter run rate revenues and then multiply that by 4. You then actually deduct the patients from that annualized number and you get to approximate range of the guidance that we provided, which was $670 million to $690 million for KALYDECO.

So first of all, actually, no, we're not trying to say discontinuations is a bigger issue than compliance. So I actually appreciate asking the question so we can clarify that. That's not what we're trying to say, and it's not actually what we are seeing even earlier on in this launch. But I appreciate the opportunity maybe to comment on how people are thinking about the ORKAMBI launch and how we're seeing it reflected in sell side models. And specifically, 2016, let's say, forecasted that are in the sell side models. So obviously, when you look at consensus, there are a number of different models that are out there, a number of different numbers. And so there's some extreme numbers and then there's some that are more towards the normal. What I would say, I don't know the assumptions that are being put into other people's models, but I would ask you to listen carefully to Stuart's comments, where we touch on when do we believe we're going to get to peak penetration, the rate of uptake of ORKAMBI? And then importantly, the persistence and compliance, because specifically compliance, if people take 6 pills out of every 10, it's straightforward, you get $6 out of every $10 of your gross price. And then obviously, there is a gross-to-net discount based on whether you've got Medicaid patients versus private-payer patients. And so I just -- the opportunity to comment on this call to all people at once is I just want to make sure that people are giving thorough consideration to all these aspects of the launch, and we'd be happy to talk to you after the call as well. 
And as far as your question regarding Germany, Germany is the only country that we expect any significant revenues from outside of the U.S. And just to give you the background of Germany, Germany has an estimated 2,500 patients. We believe it could take 12 to 18 months to reach the peak penetration in those patients, and we provided people with a price in Germany. And it is one aspect of the sell side models that I do struggle with, because when I look at an ex U.S. consensus of the sell side model, that's a number that's close to $300 million. I find it very challenging for us to accrue that much revenue from Germany alone. And so I do appreciate you calling that out, and so I just hope that people are giving consideration to all these features when modeling the ORKAMBI launch. And then over to Jeff."

It's just the sheer volume of patients is much larger than it is for KALYDECO, and it's just more of an administrative burden to initiate patients.

Obviously, we've heard a lot from Ian and Stuart on some of the questions about the kinetics of the launch and some of the short-term modeling. I do think it's important to stand back as well and remember what the total opportunity is, which, I think is where your question is going. So if you think about where we are today versus where we were even 6 months ago, right? Today, we have approval for 8,500 patients in U.S. and we have a launch that we're really pleased with, with more than 4,500 or 55% of the patients already on drug in the U.S., which I think is remarkable. We have reimbursement in the U.S. that's gone actually better than we even expected, meaning every state Medicaid is now reimbursing the drug and the majority of the private insurers are. We have approval in Europe, and are starting a launch in Germany, as you heard in the press release; an ATU in France. Now we have approval in Canada, which gives us access to 1,500 private patients and the ability to negotiate reimbursement, as Stuart said, to an additional, I think, 2,500 patients or so. And so when you look at the total opportunity, it's actually every bit of what we thought before, and we've made significant progress. And nothing with that has changed. It's impossible to predict the exact kinetics, what's going to happen in the first quarter versus the second quarter. But at least, the way we look at it, as we look out over the next couple of years, we see that opportunity intact and progressing really nicely. And I think it's important to sort of see that in the big picture as well as the short-term model. So I hope that helps."

Their pulmonary function really is far from normal. It allows you to measure that. And over reasonably short periods of time, sort of like a 6-month period, as we go in our clinical studies, there could be small decreases. But we think overall, that, that should be relatively stable. There may be modest shift over time, but we think we'd be able to have a reasonable baseline for assessing it. So -- and actually, that's part of why the data that we had coming out of our pediatric study, even without the control arm, was encouraging to us. Maybe I'll take a comment on the less than -- on the study in patients whose FEV1s are less than 40. We're still actually in the process of collecting all that data. We are still enrolling. But we think that there's some useful information there just in terms of the experience that we've accrued.

And then Jeff, you can take the second question on the chest tightness. So maybe just to give you a little background, and I know you're you aware of this, but the RF application is a little bit unusual compared to the other applications that Vertex has submitted on KALYDECO and ORKAMBI, which are always based on large Phase III studies. This one's different. It's basically aimed at about 1,500 patients, with 23 different mutations resulting in residual function. And it's based predominantly on preclinical data. That is cell-based data from cells that have been engineered to have those 23 different mutations, supported by a very small Phase IIa study of about 24 patients that comprise the 8 or 9 of those 23 mutations. And so what we're really asking the FDA to look at is both the science and the medicine that we're submitting. But also there's a policy question here, which is, how do you extend the label of drugs like KALYDECO to very rare population and mutations. Some of these mutations only have 4 patients in the U.S. or 10 patients in the U.S. And that's a very important policy question in precision medicine that as you know, the FDA is considering much more broadly than just in CF. And so part of the reason why it's a little difficult to handicap this one is because it's this combination of clinical and policy sorts of things. We feel very strongly, it's the right thing to do for patients, that's why we did it. There are 1,500 patients in the U.S. that today don't have any CFTR correction therapy of any sort, and it would be years before they could get them based on large Phase III trials. And so for us, this is definitely the right thing to do for patients. And we believe in the science strongly and in the clinical support that we have. But handicapping what the FDA is going to do, obviously, it's a bit more difficult. We'll know by February 7. And then based upon what we do, we'd obviously come up with a strategy. But again, our goal is to try to get this medicine that has 4 years of safety data to these patients as soon as possible."

But also because, as you know, FEV1, which is really a measure of mid-sized airway resistance, is it's quite a bit downstream or upstream, if you will, from the problem in CF, which is really a distal airway gas-exchange problem. And actually, LCI is probably a much more sensitive measure, closer to the actual physiology of what's going on in CF. And so we've been very eager to start to see results from these kinds of studies to tell whether LCI could actually turn out to be as good or better an endpoint than FEV1 and, obviously, you need to provide agencies with clinical data to support that.

That study is across all different types of genotypes in terms of the patient population, and so we're going to really be looking for early evidence of activity in that study. And not just looking over all, but  we're going to be trying to learn looking among the different subpopulations. And we still expect the results of that to come out around midyear. At the same time, we're going to be starting our study, which is very complementary to the study that's ongoing, and that is this quarter. And that study is going to be in 508 homozygous patients who already are going to be receiving ORKAMBI, and then looking to see whether the ENaC inhibitor can add to the efficacy for that population. And actually, preclinical data in our hands actually suggest that, that may be the best way to get activity and benefit for patients from that mechanism. And so ultimately, it's going to be learning from both of those trials as we better understand what the potential for that mechanism may be."

At the risk of running for 1 or 2 more minutes, I did want to make a couple of concluding remarks. And again, I always like to do this sort of in retrospect and say where are we today as a company as compared to where we were 6 or 12 months ago. And I must say from a personal standpoint and from the standpoint of CF patients, I'm very, very encouraged with the progress that we've made. I think we've -- it's now clear that KALYDECO and ORKAMBI together are approved for about 25,000 patients, or almost 1/3 of all patients, CF patients in the world. And as we discussed at JPMorgan, it's a fairly straightforward strategy through label expansion in the younger populations and others to take that number from 25,000 to 44,000 patients in the next couple of years. 
And then we have a clear strategy with multiple prongs, actually, to get to the vast majority of patients, and they include the ENaC inhibitors, which are in Phase II, so they can move very rapidly if we see positive results there in combination with ORKAMBI. They include the next-gen correctors, which are moving along in Phase I, and which we hope to have in patients in the second half of this year. And we think those have the potential to both increase the efficacy for the patients we're treating today, but also to let us to get to that large subset of het-min patients that don't have anything today. 
And then finally, the progress we've made with some of our deals, particularly the CRISPR deal here. And although that's the Holy Grail, 10 or 15 years down the road, we do have a vision of potentially correcting the underlying mutation and curing patients with CF. 
And so as I look at the world from our perspective, obviously, I'm tremendously encouraged about the future opportunity, and particularly, the future opportunity for patients and the future of the progress we're making. And we look forward to updating you over the next year as we continue that."

Good evening, everyone. Over the last 4 years, Vertex has delivered 2 transformative medicines to people with cystic fibrosis. Today, there are approximately 27,000 people eligible for 1 of our approved CF medicines. And we have a clear p",1797,"Thanks, Michael. Good evening, everyone. Over the last 4 years, Vertex has delivered 2 transformative medicines to people with cystic fibrosis. Today, there are approximately 27,000 people eligible for 1 of our approved CF medicines. And we have a clear path toward our goal of helping potentially all people with this rare and life-shortening disease in the future.
We're confident that our experience with ORKAMBI and KALYDECO and our scientific leadership and progress in targeting the underlying biology of this disease positions us well to increase the number of people treated with our approved medicines and to develop new medicines in the years ahead that may provide even greater benefit for all people with CF.
Tonight, I'll provide brief comments on 3 key areas and service markers of our progress towards treating all people with CF, including: first, the performance of our approved medicines, ORKAMBI and KALYDECO and our road map toward treating more patients with these medicines that will drive revenue growth in 2016 and beyond; second, the role of VX-661 in helping to achieve our long-term goal in CF; and third, our pipeline of additional CFTR modulators and other mechanisms we are advancing as part of collaborations. These approaches include the ENaC inhibition and in the longer-term, gene editing with CRISPR-Cas9 and may position us to help all people with CF.
We're approximately 9 months into the launch of ORKAMBI in the U.S. for people with 2 copies of the F508del CFTR mutation ages 12 and older. As of the end of March, approximately 65%, or 5,500 of the 8,500 currently eligible patients in the U.S. have initiated treatment with ORKAMBI. We expect the number of patients who've initiated treatment with ORKAMBI will continue to grow during 2016. And we continue to expect that by the end of the year, the vast majority of all eligible patients ages 12 and older in the U.S. will have initiated treatment.
We've seen excellent reimbursement and access for ORKAMBI from public and private payers in the U.S and the feedback from the CF community continues to be very positive. Importantly, patients across the U.S. have broad access to the medicine through public and private insurance. And we have assistance programs in place for eligible patients who need additional help. All major commercial insurers in all 50 state Medicaid programs are currently covering ORKAMBI, reflecting the important advance and value this medicine represents in the treatment of CF.
We're now moving forward to our bringing ORKAMBI to younger patients. And at the end of March, we submitted a supplemental New Drug Application to the FDA, requesting approval of ORKAMBI for children ages 6 to 11 with 2 copies of the F508del mutation. We requested priority review which if granted would provide us with a decision on the application in the second half of this year. If approved, approximately 2,400 additional patients in the U.S. would be eligible for treatment.
Outside the U.S., we have commenced discussions with reimbursement agencies in various European and other countries. Given the clinical benefits of ORKAMBI and the severity of the disease for people with 2 copies of the F508del mutation, we believe that we will achieve reimbursement from key European and other government payers just as we've seen in the U.S.
ORKAMBI is already commercially available in Germany and through early access programs in France.
In the near term, the [indiscernible] understanding of treating eligible patients with ORKAMBI gives us clarity on revenue expectations for 2016. Later in the call, Stuart and Ian will talk about the ORKAMBI  launch in detail, our guidance and how we think about revenue trends from 2015 and growth into 2016 and further into the future.
For KALYDECO, we're increasing our revenue guidance for 2016, which Stuart will discuss in his remarks. As we think about the future opportunities for ORKAMBI and KALYDECO, I want to emphasize that revenue growth in 2016 and beyond is largely a function of additional patients who are currently eligible for ORKAMBI or KALYDECO, initiating treatment with these medicines. On that basis alone, we believe there is significant growth ahead for both medicines. Consider that today, ORKAMBI and KALYDECO approved for approximately 27,000 people worldwide, but we're only currently treating approximately 1/3 of these patients. As we see additional uptake of ORKAMBI in the U.S. and achieve reimbursement for eligible patients outside the U.S., growth will continue as additional patients continue to initiate the treatment.
In addition, there are many more patients not currently eligible for treatment who may benefit from either ORKAMBI or KALYDECO. In total, we believe there are approximately 44,000 people and additional 17,000 people beyond those eligible today who could benefit from 1 or 2 of these medicines. This additional group of patients was largely comprised of the following: First, approximately 12,000 people less than 12 years of age who have 2 copies of the F508del mutation and who may be helped by ORKAMBI; and second, approximately 5,000 patients who may be helped by KALYDECO comprised mostly of patients who have a residual function mutation. Treating a substantial portion of this additional group of 17,000 patients would further drive ORKAMBI and KALYDECO  growth if we obtain future approvals for these additional groups of patients. We have ongoing studies, regulatory submissions and development plans to support these efforts, including ongoing discussions with the FDA regarding our application for approval of KALYDECO in approximately 1,500 people ages 2 and older with 1 of 23 residual function mutations as well as our recent sNDA submission to the FDA for approval of ORKAMBI in children ages 6 to 11 with 2 copies of the F508del mutation.
While we are focused on getting ORKAMBI and KALYDECO to as many patients as possible as soon as possible, we also recognize that there are many patients who are still waiting for a treatment for the underlying cause of their disease. We hear from these patients often. So I'm particularly pleased to report that our CF pipeline is advancing. This gives us great confidence that we will ultimately be able to treat the vast majority of people with CF and potentially enhance the benefit for those people currently taking our approved medicines.
I'll start with VX-661, which could play an important role in the treatment of people with CF and is currently in Phase III development.
In combination with ivacaftor, our Phase II data suggested that VX-661 may have an improved benefit risk profile compared to ORKAMBI in people with 2 copies of the F508del mutation and may provide enhanced clinical benefits over ivacaftor monotherapy for other patients with gating mutations. We're on track to obtain the first data from the ongoing Phase III program for VX-661 in early 2017 from the study in people with 2 copies of the F508del mutation.
Additionally, VX-661 is positioned to play a key role in the development of the triple combination with the next-generation corrector and ivacaftor. We believe that this triple combination approach will be fundamental for 2 reasons: first, triple combinations may allow us to treat a very large group of patients who are not held today by either ORKAMBI or KALYDECO, including those with 1 F508del mutation and a second mutation that causes minimal CFTR function; and second, these regimens could provide even greater benefit to patients currently eligible for our approved medicines who have at least 1 F508del mutation.
Today, we have 2 next-gen correctors in clinical development. VX-152 and VX-440. These potential medicines are currently being evaluated in Phase I studies in healthy volunteers. Successful completion of these studies would enable us to move rapidly into Phase II studies in the second half of 2016 to evaluate 1 or more next-generation correctors with VX-661 and ivacaftor in people with CF.
I'll now turn to our pipeline of other potential CF medicines that could be complementary to our portfolio see if CFTR modulators, and it may enable us to treat more patients and provide greater clinical benefit in the years to come. The most advanced example of this is our lead ENaC inhibitor, VX-371. Today, we announced data from a Phase II 14-day study of VX-371 in 142 people with CF, who are not receiving ORKAMBI or KALYDECO. The study met its primary endpoint of safety. 96% of the patients who enrolled in the study completed all treatment and the treatment regimens consisting of VX-371 were generally well tolerated. There were no statistically significant changes from baseline in FEV1 for those patients who received VX-371 compared to placebo. The data announced today are consistent with our in-vitro data that did not show a meaningful change in cilia beat frequency when VX-371 was used alone in human bronchial epithelial cells with 2 copies of the F508del mutation. In contrast, these in-vitro data did show a meaningful change in cilia beat frequency when VX-371 was used in combination with ORKAMBI. Together, the in-vitro and clinical safety data generated to date provide further support for our ongoing study of VX-371 in combination with ORKAMBI. This ongoing study began enrolling people with 2 copies of the F508del mutation ages 12 and older in the first quarter of this year. And the primary endpoints are safety and mean absolute change from baseline in lung function at day 28 of treatment as compared to placebo. Additional information on these studies can be found in our first quarter press release issued today.
Additionally, last year, we entered into a collaboration with CRISPR Therapeutics with the longer-term goal of discovering gene editing approaches for the treatment of genetic diseases, including CF. The use of this technology in people with CF may be many years away. But it is strategically important as we think about future advances that could fundamentally change treatment of this disease in the years to come.
Tonight, I've summarized how we think about our opportunity in CF. An opportunity that is unique both in terms of the potential benefit of ORKAMBI and KALYDECO provide to people with CF today and also for the long-term potential of our development-stage medicines to treat the vast majority of people with CF in the future.
In conclusion, I'll make just a few comments about the type of company we will become as we achieve the success in CF that I've just outlined. Vertex is on a path toward sustained earnings and and revenue growth, driven by an increasing number of people being treated with KALYDECO and ORKAMBI. We believe our business model when focused on significant investment to create value through innovation, research and development, positions us to consistently discover and deliver transformative new medicines for patients and to reinvest in scientific opportunities to create future medicines.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Stuart to make more specific comments on the ORKAMBI launch."

Global sales of ORKAMBI in the first quarter were $223 million, comprised of U.S. sales of approximately $214 million and ex-U.S. sales of approximately $9 million, which were mainly from Germany. 
At the beginning of the year, our intention was to provide financial guidance for 2016 ORKAMBI revenues once we have gained sufficient understanding of the dynamics of the launch in the U.S. Today, we have a deeper understanding as our doctors and patients are using the medicine based on the real world treatment patterns we've observed in more than 4,500 patients who initiated treatment in the U.S. in 2015. 
I'll now share with you our understanding of the launch dynamics that informed our guidance. First, uptake. Defined as the total proportion of the 8,500 eligible patients in the U.S. who will begin treatment with ORKAMBI by the end of 2016. And also the rate at which these patients initiate treatment.
Second, the persistence rate. Defined as the proportion of patients who start and remain on treatment. 
And third, the compliance rate, which reflects the number of pills actually taken by a patient in a given month.
First, the uptake. To date, approximately 65% of the 8,500 eligible patients in the U.S. have initiated treatment with ORKAMBI. Comprised of more than 3,000 patients who initiated treatment in the third quarter of 2015, more than 1,500 in the fourth quarter and approximately 800 in the first quarter of 2016. We have seen further initiations in April and expect that patient initiations will continue throughout 2016, albeit at a lower rate than in the first 3 quarters post launch.
We continue to expect that the vast majority of the eligible patients ages 12 and older in the U.S., will initiate treatment with ORKAMBI by the end of this year.
Second, persistence. Among patients who have initiated ORKAMBI since launch, we've seen that approximately 15% of patients discontinued treatment within 3 months of starting treatment. Our clinical trial and market research and data indicate that these discontinuations are largely related to respiratory adverse events. After the first 3 months of treatment, the discontinuation rate that is close considerably. Based on what we've observed to date from all patients taking ORKAMBI, including those have been on commercial drug for up to 9 months and those who continue to receive ORKAMBI as part of our Phase III long-term extension study, we expect that the proportion of all patients who initiate and remain on treatment will stabilize at approximately 70% to 80%.
It is also important to point out that the pattern of patient initiations and discontinuations have an offsetting effect on our first quarter ORKAMBI revenues. Specifically, because more than 4,500 patients began treatment with ORKAMBI in 2015, the impact of approximately 15% of these patients discontinuing ORKAMBI was highly evident in the first quarter. Therefore, while approximately 800 new patients initiated treatment in the first quarter, this growth was largely offset by the bolus of patients who discontinued treatment. This bolus of discontinuations began in the fourth quarter but had a larger impact on the first quarter of 2016, where there were also fewer patient initiations to offset these discontinuations.
And finally, compliance. Based on what we've observed to date from the launch, we expect the compliance rate with ORKAMBI to be between 70% and 80%.
In summary, based on our understanding of the launch dynamics for ORKAMBI and the fact that we have continued to see additional patients initiating treatment with ORKAMBI in April, we expect to deliver quarter-to-quarter revenue growth for ORKAMBI beginning in that second quarter and continuing through the end of 2016 and into 2017.
I'll now turn to the use of ORKAMBI to date outside the U.S. We are now well into the reimbursement process in all key European countries, Canada and Australia. Specifically, the clinical and cost-effectiveness assessment portions of the reimbursement process. These discussions are going as expected and have been productive. We believe that government payers across Europe recognize both the severity of this disease and the broad clinical benefits of ORKAMBI. These discussions will take time to complete. However, as Jeff mentioned earlier, we believe that we will achieve broader reimbursement from key European and other government payers, just as we've seen in the United States.
ORKAMBI is already available commercially in Germany and through early access programs in France. We are only 3 months into the launch of ORKAMBI in Germany and the uptake has been slower than we observed in the U.S. We attribute this to a number of factors, including that CFK in Germany is not concentrated in large centers as we've seen in other countries. Meaning, there are many smaller centers and also many centers and physicians who have not yet had personal experience with CFTR modulators.
In Germany, there are approximately 2,500 patients eligible for treatment. As of March 31, 2016, approximately 230 patients have initiated treatment. However, we expect the number of patients initiating treatment in Germany will grow through 2016 and into 2017.
We do not expect what we're seeing in Germany will be a representative of the uptake in other European countries. In fact, in France, where early access programs provide the opportunity for physicians to begin treating patients with ORKAMBI prior to formal reimbursement approval, we have already seen approximately 400 of the 1,500 eligible patients initiate treatment with ORKAMBI in 2016.
We took all of this information into account when we set 2016 revenue guidance for ORKAMBI of $1.0 billion to $1.1 billion. Our guidance reflect our understanding of the ongoing U.S. launch as I just discussed as well as expectations that we will receive both approval for ORKAMBI in the U.S. for patients ages 6 to 11 in the second half of 2016, and certain revenues from sales of ORKAMBI outside the U.S., primarily from Germany.
Taking a longer-term view, we expect significant further growth for ORKAMBI revenues in 2017, driven primarily by patients initiating treatment following the completion of reimbursement discussions outside the U.S.
And now to KALYDECO. Today, we are increasing our financial guidance for 2016 revenues. We now expect KALYDECO net revenues of $685 million to $705 million. The prior guidance provided on January 10, 2016, was for KALYDECO net revenues of $670 million to $690 million.
We increased our KALYDECO guidance based primarily on an increasing number of patients initiating treatment with KALYDECO globally and on expectations of a reduced impact this year from the VX-661 Phase III program. Our guidance for KALYDECO excludes any potential revenues from the approval of KALYDECO, the people with residual function mutations.
I'll now hand the call over to Ian."

Notably, we are seeing increasing number of patients being treate",560,"Thank you, Stuart, and good evening, to everyone. With the closing of the first quarter 2016 and 9 months into the launch of ORKAMBI, we are seeing significant progress across our business. Notably, we are seeing increasing number of patients being treated with our approved medicines, resulting in a growing revenue base that we expect to drive earnings growth. 
I will now review our first quarter financial results and provide some specific comments about the long-term financial trajectory of our business.
Financial results first. In the first quarter of 2016, we reported total CF product revenues of approximately $394 million, a significant increase compared to $130 million in the first quarter in 2015. With ORKAMBI, we reported sales of $223 million for the first quarter of 2016. We have recorded approximately $574 million of ORKAMBI revenues in the first 9 months since the U.S. launch in July 2015.
The first quarter KALYDECO sales of $171 million were up $41 million versus the first quarter of last year. 
Now to the operating expenses. Our first quarter on a non-GAAP operating expenses were $306 million compared to non-GAAP operating expenses of $246 million for 2015. The increased operating expenses were primarily due to increased costs related to the progression of our CF pipeline and to increased investments in global commercial support for their launch of ORKAMBI. Our non-GAAP net profit for the first quarter 2016 was $22 million or $0.09 per diluted share compared to a non-GAAP net loss of $148 million or $0.62 per share for 2015.
From a balance sheet perspective, we ended the first quarter with approximately $1.03 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Vertex also has $300 million outstanding from a credit agreement, repayable by the end of the third quarter of 2017. The agreement also allows for the facility to increase to $500 million. 
Now to financial trends. As to what provided 2016 ORKAMBI and KALYDECO revenue guidance on the assumptions that drive our projections and therefore, I will focus my comments on the longer-term growth opportunities that may come with achieving more patients with our currently approved medicines. 
We expect ORKAMBI revenues will continue to grow as we treat more patients in the U.S., achieve reimbursement outside the U.S. and expand the ORKAMBI label to younger patients. KALYDECO's growth is based on gaining reimbursement for certain group of patients outside the U.S, including those with R117H mutation and the people ages 2 to 5 with gating mutations.
In summary, as Jeff noted earlier, approximately 27,000 people are eligible for our CF medicines, yet we are only treating approximately 1/3 of these patients. As additional patients in the U.S. start treatment, we complete reimbursement discussions outside the us, we expect the number of patients treated with our medicines to increase significantly and we expect revenue growth will follow. 
I will note that in 2015, reported total CF revenues of $983 million. Based on 2016 guidance provided for ORKAMBI and KALYDECO, we anticipate that total CF revenues of approximately $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion, an approximate 75% increase over the prior year.
As our revenues grow over future years, we are committed to managing our operating expenses to drive earnings growth and we expect to deliver financial profile as similar to many of our large cap biotech peers.
With that, I open the line to questions."

Is there anything out there that you can do to either improve these things? Education, getting people to just get patients to take more drug? And can you apply any additional learnings to Europe? Are you seeing the same stuff in Germany? Are there any ways to improve it there? And then the second question is a pipeline question on the 661 you mentioned in the press release that you're changing the enrollment to 200 instead of 300. But is that assuming you actually passed the futility? Can you just clarify a little bit? I guess why we're talking about change in enrollment if we haven't passed the futility?"

And then I'll have Jeff and Stu to answer the pipeline questions. So on the discontinuation and compliance, and what we might be able to do to improve those, much as we did with KALYDECO, we will be continuing to generate data on the long-term benefits and even broader benefit of ORKAMBI when used in the real world. And I suspect that data, if its compelling, may lead physicians and patients to reconsider restocking ORKAMBI. So we'll continue to develop the overall clinical profile of ORKAMBI as we have more experience in the market. In terms of compliance, really, many of the same things that we did with KALYDECO we'll be doing with ORKAMBI, and that's really providing both providers and physicians with the education materials to be able to understand how this is a product which is treating the underlying cause of their disease. And so it's a product that they want to try and stay compliant with as much as they possibly can or certainly will be leveraging all the learnings we have in KALYDECO, with ORKAMBI and those programs are already in place. Lastly, to your point about the Germany. Clearly, one of the things we're going to be doing is transferring all of the learnings from our launch experience in the U.S. to all of the other markets that we're launching into. And that's, in many ways, the benefit that those market coming on stream a little bit later is that they can learn from our experience here in the U.S. With that, I'll hand over to Jeff to answer the question on the pipeline."

So really whilst we try to extrapolate from the clinical trial experience, the real world experience, that's one of the reasons -- that uncertainty is one of the reasons why we wanted to make sure we have sufficient time in market before we gave guidance was because you really want to see how the product we get used in the real world. In terms of the contribution of the various different parts of the world to our ORKAMBI revenue guidance that you might expect the vast majority of these revenues is going to come from here in the U.S. There will be a contribution ex-U.S. but it's going to be relatively small. And then incorporate with our guidance as we said is also an expectation that we will see an approval in 6 to 11 -year-olds in the latter part of 2016, which would give us access to an eligible population for about 2.5 and is also incorporated in our guidance by that approval is not anticipated until the back end of 2016."

Yes, that point in time, it was early in the launch my yes. In a number of patients onto ORKAMBI but it was still early the launch to understand treatment patterns. We stated that very clearly. What we've been able to do now we sit here as you point out, just over 9 months into the launch, we've been able to take significant bolus of patients. For example, 3,000 patients that initiates in the first 3 months of disapproval and we've been asked to track those 6 to 9 months. What that allows us to do was to understand compliance rates and help us understand discontinuation rates and also the kind of discontinuation as to what measure, that's been an important feature for us. So this was the -- we feel that we're in this position at this point in time where we've been able to attract a sufficient amount of patients over a good period of time to have the confidence to provide guidance for 2016. In comparison to KALYDECO, it was less relevant. For us, it was more about the treatment patterns for ORKAMBI.

First, the continuous increase in the number of patients that we can treat, actually dramatic increase in the number of patients that we can treat with KALYDECO and ORKAMBI. And as we look forward, the increase in the number of patients that we can treat with today approval. As I mentioned, 27,000 eligible, we're still only treating 1/3e of those. And I think we have a clear path to get to the majority of those patients both in the U.S. and Europe over '16 and '17 and beyond. The second thing I would say is the pipeline progression. We're pleased with 661 progressing alone into Phase III of multiple trials and multiple patient populations. But equally important, the next-gen correctors which are progressing through Phase I with our -- and still on a timeline to get it to patients as later this year. We think that's going to be very important both for the patients we treat potentially for additional patient to find. And then finally the progression of the science. We didn't talk about that a lot today but the science in CF I think has progressed significantly. And we have a much better understanding of the folding and correction process. And the science that today driving the rest of research some of the new diseases and touched on those little CRISPR-Cas9 but also others that I hope we will be able to have a chance to talk to you about over the rest of '16 and '17.

Good evening, everyone. Over the last 4 years, Vertex has delivered 2 transformative medicines to people with cystic fibrosis. Today, there are approximately 27,000 people eligible for 1 of our approved CF medicines, and we have a clear p",1797,"Thanks, Michael. Good evening, everyone. Over the last 4 years, Vertex has delivered 2 transformative medicines to people with cystic fibrosis. Today, there are approximately 27,000 people eligible for 1 of our approved CF medicines, and we have a clear path toward our goal of helping potentially all people with this rare and life-shortening disease in the future.
We're confident that our experience with ORKAMBI and KALYDECO, and our scientific leadership and progress in targeting the underlying biology of this disease, positions us well to increase the number of people treated with our approved medicines and to develop new medicines in the years ahead that may provide even greater benefit for all people with CF.
Tonight, I'll provide brief comments on 3 key areas which serve as markers of our progress toward treating all people with CF, including: first, the performance of our approved medicines, ORKAMBI and KALYDECO, and our road map toward treating more patients with these medicines that will drive revenue growth in 2016 and beyond; second, the role of VX-661 in helping to achieve our long-term goal in CF; and third, our pipeline of additional CFTR modulators and other mechanisms we're advancing as part of collaborations. These approaches include the ENaC inhibition, and in the longer-term, gene editing with CRISPR-Cas9, and may position us to help all people with CF.
We're approximately 9 months into the launch of ORKAMBI in the U.S. for people with 2 copies of the F508del CFTR mutation ages 12 and older. As of the end of March, approximately 65% or 5,500 of the 8,500 currently eligible patients in the U.S. have initiated treatment with ORKAMBI. We expect the number of patients who've initiated treatment with ORKAMBI will continue to grow during 2016. And we continue to expect that by the end of the year, the vast majority of all eligible patients ages 12 and older in the U.S. will have initiated treatment.
We've seen excellent reimbursement and access for ORKAMBI from public and private payers in the U.S., and the feedback from the CF community continues to be very positive. Importantly, patients across the U.S. have broad access to the medicine through public and private insurance. And we have assistance programs in place for eligible patients who need additional help. All major commercial insurers in all 50 state Medicaid programs are currently covering ORKAMBI, reflecting the important advance and value this medicine represents in the treatment of CF.
We're now moving forward to our bringing ORKAMBI to younger patients. And at the end of March, we submitted a supplemental New Drug Application to the FDA, requesting approval of ORKAMBI for children ages 6 to 11 with 2 copies of the F508del mutation. We requested priority review, which if granted, would provide us with the decision on the application in the second half of this year. If approved, approximately 2,400 additional patients in the U.S. would be eligible for treatment.
Outside the U.S., we have commenced discussions with reimbursement agencies in various European and other countries. Given the clinical benefits of ORKAMBI and the severity of the disease for people with 2 copies of the F508del mutation, we believe that we will achieve reimbursement from key European and other government payers, just as we've seen in the U.S. ORKAMBI is already commercially available in Germany and through early access programs in France.
In the near term, the progress and our understanding of treating eligible patients with ORKAMBI gives us clarity on a revenue expectation for 2016. Later in the call, Stuart and Ian will talk about the ORKAMBI launch in detail, our guidance and how we think about revenue trends from 2015 and growth into 2016 and further into the future.
For KALYDECO, we're increasing our revenue guidance for 2016, which Stuart will discuss in his remarks. As we think about the future opportunities for ORKAMBI and KALYDECO, I want to emphasize that revenue growth in 2016 and beyond is largely a function of additional patients who are currently eligible for ORKAMBI or KALYDECO and initiating treatment with these medicines. On that basis alone, we believe there's significant growth ahead for both medicines. 
Consider that today, ORKAMBI and KALYDECO are approved for approximately 27,000 people worldwide. But we're only currently treating approximately 1/3 of these patients. As we see additional uptake of ORKAMBI in the U.S. and achieve reimbursement for eligible patients outside the U.S., growth will continue as additional patients continue to initiate treatment.
In addition, there are many more patients not currently eligible for treatment who may benefit from either ORKAMBI or KALYDECO. In total, we believe there are approximately 44,000 people, an additional 17,000 people beyond those eligible today, who could benefit from 1 of these 2 medicines. This additional group of patients was largely comprised of the following: first, approximately 12,000 people less than 12 years of age who have 2 copies of the F508del mutation and who may be helped by ORKAMBI; and second, approximately 5,000 patients who may be helped by KALYDECO comprised mostly of patients who have a residual function mutation. 
Treating a substantial portion of this additional group of 17,000 patients would further drive ORKAMBI and KALYDECO growth if we obtain future approvals for these additional groups of patients. We have ongoing studies, regulatory submissions and development plans to support these efforts, including ongoing discussions with the FDA regarding our application for approval of KALYDECO in approximately 1,500 people ages 2 and older with 1 of 23 residual function mutations as well as our recent sNDA submission to the FDA for approval of ORKAMBI in children ages 6 to 11 with 2 copies of the F508del mutation.
While we are focused on getting ORKAMBI and KALYDECO to as many patients as possible as soon as possible, we also recognize that there are many patients who are still waiting for a treatment for the underlying cause of their disease. We hear from these patients often, so I'm particularly pleased to report that our CF pipeline is advancing. This gives us great confidence that we will ultimately be able to treat the vast majority of people with CF and potentially enhance the benefit for those people currently taking our approved medicines.
I'll start with VX-661, which could play an important role in the treatment of people with CF and is currently in Phase III development. In combination with ivacaftor, our Phase II data suggested that VX-661 may have an improved benefit risk profile compared to ORKAMBI in people with 2 copies of the F508del mutation and may provide enhanced clinical benefits over ivacaftor monotherapy for other patients with gating mutations. We are on track to obtain the first data from the ongoing Phase III program for VX-661 in early 2017 from the study in people with 2 copies of the F508del mutation.
Additionally, VX-661 is positioned to play a key role in the development of a triple combination with a next-generation corrector in ivacaftor. We believe that this triple-combination approach will be fundamental for 2 reasons: first, triple combinations may allow us to treat a very large group of patients who are not helped today by either ORKAMBI or KALYDECO, including those with 1 F508del mutation and a second mutation that causes minimal CFTR function; and second, these regimens could provide even greater benefit to patients currently eligible for our approved medicines who have at least 1 F508del mutation.
Today, we have 2 next-gen correctors in clinical development: VX-152 and VX-440. These potential medicines are currently being evaluated in Phase I studies in healthy volunteers. Successful completion of these studies would enable us to move rapidly into Phase II studies in the second half of 2016 to evaluate 1 or more next-generation correctors with VX-661 and ivacaftor in people with CF.
I'll now turn to our pipeline of other potential CF medicines that could be complementary to our portfolio of CFTR modulators, and it may enable us to treat more patients and provide greater clinical benefit in the years to come. The most advanced example of this is our lead ENaC inhibitor, VX-371. Today, we announced data from a Phase II 14-day study of VX-371 in 142 people with CF who are not receiving ORKAMBI or KALYDECO. The study met its primary endpoint of safety. 96% of the patients who enrolled in the study completed all treatment, and the treatment regimens consisting of VX-371 were generally well tolerated. There were no statistically significant changes from baseline in FEV1 for those patients who received VX-371 compared to placebo. 
The data announced today are consistent with our in-vitro data that did not show a meaningful change in cilia beat frequency when VX-371 was used alone in human bronchial epithelial cells with 2 copies of the F508del mutation. In contrast, these in-vitro data did show a meaningful change in cilia beat frequency when VX-371 was used in combination with ORKAMBI. Together, the in-vitro and clinical safety data generated to date provide further support for our ongoing study of VX-371 in combination with ORKAMBI. This ongoing study began enrolling people with 2 copies of the F508del mutation ages 12 and older in the first quarter of this year. And the primary endpoints are safety and mean absolute change from baseline in lung function at Day 28 of treatment as compared to placebo. Additional information on these studies can be found in our first quarter press release issued today.
Additionally, last year, we entered into a collaboration with CRISPR Therapeutics, with a longer-term goal of discovering gene-editing approaches for the treatment of genetic diseases, including CF. The use of this technology in people with CF may be many years away, but it is strategically important as we think about future advances that could fundamentally change the treatment of this disease in the years to come.
Tonight, I've summarized how we think about our opportunity in CF, an opportunity that is unique, both in terms of the potential benefit that ORKAMBI and KALYDECO provides the people with CF today and also for the long-term potential of our development-stage medicines to treat the vast majority of people with CF in the future.
In conclusion, I'll make just a few comments about the type of company we will become as we achieve the success in CF that I've just outlined. Vertex is on a path towards sustained earnings and revenue growth, driven by an increasing number of people being treated with KALYDECO and ORKAMBI. We believe our business model, one focused on significant investment to create value through innovation, research and development, positions us to consistently discover and deliver transformative new medicines for patients and to reinvest in scientific opportunities to create future medicines.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Stuart to make more specific comments on the ORKAMBI launch."
36235,331185758,965228,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2016",2016-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Jeff, and hello, everyone. Tonight, I will review our progress with the launch of ORKAMBI, the basis of our 2016 guidance for ORKAMBI product revenues and our ongoing efforts to obtain reimbursement outside the U.S. to drive further growth of ORKA",1180,"Thanks, Jeff, and hello, everyone. Tonight, I will review our progress with the launch of ORKAMBI, the basis of our 2016 guidance for ORKAMBI product revenues and our ongoing efforts to obtain reimbursement outside the U.S. to drive further growth of ORKAMBI in 2017 and beyond.
We are now just over 9 months into the launch, and we are pleased that approximately 65% of eligible patients in the U.S. have initiated treatment with ORKAMBI to date. Global sales of ORKAMBI in the first quarter were $223 million, comprised of U.S. sales of approximately $214 million and ex U.S. sales of approximately $9 million, which were mainly from Germany. 
At the beginning of the year, our intention was to provide financial guidance for 2016 ORKAMBI revenues once we have gained sufficient understanding of the dynamics of the launch in the U.S. Today, we have a deeper understanding if our doctors and their patients are using the medicine, based on the real-world treatment patterns we've observed in more than 4,500 patients who initiated treatment in the U.S. in 2015. 
I'll now share with you our understanding of the launch dynamics that informed our guidance. First, uptake, defined as the total proportion of the 8,500 eligible patients in the U.S. who will begin treatment with ORKAMBI by the end of 2016 and also the rate at which these patients initiate treatment. Second, the persistence rate, defined as the proportion of patients who start and remain on treatment. And third, the compliance rate, which reflects the number of pills actually taken by a patient in a given month.
First, to uptake. To date, approximately 65% of the 8,500 eligible patients in the U.S. have initiated treatment with ORKAMBI, comprised of more than 3,000 patients who initiated treatment in the third quarter of 2015, more than 1,500 in the fourth quarter and approximately 800 in the first quarter of 2016. We have seen further initiations in April and expect that patient initiations will continue throughout 2016, albeit the lower rate than in the first 3 quarters post-launch. We continue to expect that the vast majority of the eligible patients ages 12 and older in the U.S. will initiate treatment with ORKAMBI by the end of this year.
Second, persistence. Among patients who have initiated ORKAMBI since launch, we've seen that approximately 15% of patients discontinued treatment within 3 months of starting treatment. Our clinical trial and market research data indicate that these discontinuations are largely related to respiratory adverse events. After the first 3 months of treatment, the discontinuation rate then slows considerably. Based on what we've observed to date from all patients taking ORKAMBI, including those who have been on commercial drug for up to 9 months and those who continue to receive ORKAMBI as part of our Phase III long-term extension study, we expect that the proportion of all patients who initiate and remain on treatment will stabilize at approximately 70% to 80%.
It is also important to point out that the pattern of patient initiations and discontinuations have an offsetting effect on our first quarter ORKAMBI revenues. Specifically because more than 4,500 patients began treatment with ORKAMBI in 2015, the impact of approximately 15% of these patients discontinuing ORKAMBI was highly evident in the first quarter. Therefore, while approximately 800 new patients initiated treatments in the first quarter, this growth was largely offset by the bolus of patients who discontinued treatment. This bolus of discontinuations began in the fourth quarter, but had a larger impact on the first quarter of 2016 where there were also fewer patient initiations to offset these discontinuations.
And finally, compliance. Based on what we've observed to date from the launch, we expect the compliance rate with ORKAMBI to be between 70% and 80%.
In summary, based on our understanding of the launch dynamics for ORKAMBI and the fact that we have continued to see additional patients initiating treatment with ORKAMBI in April, we expect to deliver quarter-to-quarter revenue growth for ORKAMBI beginning in the second quarter and continuing through the end of 2016 and into 2017.
I will now turn to the use of ORKAMBI to date outside the U.S. We are now well into the reimbursement process in all key European countries, Canada and Australia. Specifically, the clinical and cost-effectiveness assessment portions of the reimbursement process. These discussions are going as expected and have been productive. We believe that government payers across Europe recognize both the severity of this disease and the broad clinical benefits of ORKAMBI. These discussions will take time to complete. However, as Jeff mentioned earlier, we believe that we will achieve broad reimbursement from key European and other government payers, just as we've seen in the United States.
ORKAMBI is already available commercially in Germany and through early-access programs in France. We are only 3 months into the launch of ORKAMBI in Germany, and the uptake has been slower than we observed in the U.S. We attribute this to a number of factors, including that CF care in Germany is not concentrated in large centers as is seen in other countries. Meaning, there are many smaller centers and also many centers and physicians who have not yet had personal experience with CFTR modulators.
In Germany, there are approximately 2,500 patients eligible for treatment. As of March 31, 2016, approximately 230 patients had initiated treatment. However, we expect the number of patients initiating treatment in Germany will grow through 2016 and into 2017.
We do not expect what we are seeing in Germany will be representative of the uptake in other European countries. In fact, in France, where early-access programs provide the opportunity for physicians to begin treating patients with ORKAMBI prior to formal reimbursement approval, we have already seen approximately 400 of the 1,500 eligible patients initiate treatment with ORKAMBI in 2016.
We took all of this information into account when we set 2016 revenue guidance for ORKAMBI of $1.0 billion to $1.1 billion. Our guidance reflects our understanding of the ongoing U.S. launch, as I just discussed, as well as expectations that we will receive both approval for ORKAMBI in the U.S. for patients ages 6 to 11 in the second half of 2016 and certain revenues from sales of ORKAMBI outside the U.S., primarily from Germany.
Taking a longer-term view, we expect significant further growth for ORKAMBI revenues in 2017, driven primarily by patients initiating treatment following the completion of reimbursement discussions outside the U.S.
And now to KALYDECO. Today, we are increasing our financial guidance for 2016 revenues. We now expect KALYDECO net revenues of $685 million to $705 million. The prior guidance provided on January 10, 2016, was for KALYDECO net revenues of $670 million to $690 million.
We increased our KALYDECO guidance based primarily on an increasing number of patients initiating treatment with KALYDECO globally and on expectations of a reduced impact this year from the VX-661 Phase III program. Our guidance for KALYDECO excludes any potential revenues from the approval of KALYDECO, the people with residual function mutations.
I'll now hand the call over to Ian."

With the closing of the first quarter of 2016 and 9 months into the launch of ORKAMBI, we are seeing significant progress across our business. Notably, we are seeing increasing number of patients being treated with our approved medicines, resulting in a growing revenue base that we expect to drive earnings growth. 
I will now review our first quarter financial results and provide some specific comments about the long-term financial trajectory of our business.
Financial results first. In the first quarter of 2016, we reported total CF product revenues of approximately $394 million, a significant increase compared to $130 million in the first quarter of 2015. With ORKAMBI, we reported sales of $223 million for the first quarter of 2016. We have recorded approximately $574 million of ORKAMBI revenues in the first 9 months since the U.S. launch in July 2015. The first quarter KALYDECO sales of $171 million were up $41 million versus the first quarter of last year. 
Now to the operating expenses. Our first quarter non-GAAP operating expenses were $306 million compared to non-GAAP operating expenses of $246 million for 2015. The increased operating expenses were primarily due to increased costs related to the progression of our CF pipeline and to increased investments in global commercial support for the launch of ORKAMBI. Our non-GAAP net profit for the first quarter of 2016 was $22 million or $0.09 per diluted share compared to a non-GAAP net loss of $148 million or $0.62 per share for 2015.
From a balance sheet perspective, we ended the first quarter with approximately $1.03 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Vertex also has $300 million outstanding from a credit agreement, repayable by the end of the third quarter of 2017. The agreement also allows for the facility to increase to $500 million. 
Now to financial trends. Stuart provided 2016 ORKAMBI and KALYDECO revenue guidance and the assumptions that drive our projections, and therefore, I will focus my comments on the longer-term growth opportunities that may come with treating more patients with our currently approved medicines. 
We expect ORKAMBI revenues will continue to grow as we treat more patients in the U.S., achieve reimbursement outside the U.S. and expand the ORKAMBI label to younger patients. KALYDECO's growth is based on gaining reimbursement for certain groups of patients outside the U.S, including those with R117H mutation and the people ages 2 to 5 with gating mutations.
In summary, as Jeff noted earlier, approximately 27,000 people are eligible for our CF medicines, yet we are only treating approximately 1/3 of these patients. As additional patients in the U.S. start treatment and we complete reimbursement discussions outside the U.S., we expect the number of patients treated with our medicines to increase significantly and we expect revenue growth will follow. 
I will note that in 2015, we reported total CF revenues of $983 million. Based on 2016 guidance provided for ORKAMBI and KALYDECO, we anticipate the total CF revenues of approximately $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion, an approximate 75% increase over the prior year.
As our revenues grow over future years, we are committed to managing our operating expenses to drive earnings growth, and we expect to deliver financial profile as similar to many of our large cap biotech peers.
With that, I open the line to questions."

You mentioned in the press release that you're changing the enrollment to do 200 instead of 300. But is that assuming you actually pass the futility? Can you just clarify that a little bit?

And then I'll hand over to Jeff Chodakewitz to answer the pipeline questions. So on discontinuations and compliance and what we might be able to do to improve those, much as we did with KALYDECO. We will be continuing to generate data on the long-term benefits and even broader benefits of ORKAMBI when used in the real world. And I suspect that data, if its compelling, may lead physicians and patients to reconsider restocking ORKAMBI. So we'll continue to develop the overall clinical profile of ORKAMBI as we have more experience in the market. In terms of compliance, really, many of the same things that we did with KALYDECO we'll be doing with ORKAMBI, and that's really providing both providers and physicians with the educational materials to be able to understand how this is a product which is treating the underlying cause of their disease and so is a product that they want to try and stay compliant with as much as they possibly can. We'll certainly be leveraging all the learnings we've had with KALYDECO, with ORKAMBI, and those programs are already in place. And lastly, to your point about -- to Germany. Clearly, one of the things we're going to be doing is transferring all of the learnings from our launch experience in the U.S. to all of the other markets that we're launching into. And that's, in many ways, the benefits of those markets coming onstream a little bit later is that they can learn from our experiences here in the U.S. With that, I'll hand over to Jeff to answer the question on the pipeline."

So on the respiratory events, I think what I'd say there is what we're reporting today is what we're seeing in the real-world usage of ORKAMBI in the broad population. Obviously, the clinical trial population that we studied in TRAFFIC and TRANSPORT is a very controlled situation. That was patients with an FEV1 between 40 and 90. So really, whilst we try to extrapolate from the clinical trial experience to the real-world experience, that's one of the reasons -- that uncertainty is one of the reasons why we wanted to make sure we had sufficient time in market before we gave guidance. It was because we really wanted to see how the product would get used in the real world. In terms of the contribution of the various different parts of the world to our ORKAMBI revenue guidance that you might expect the vast majority of these, the revenues is going to come from here in the U.S. There will be a contribution ex U.S., but it's going to be relatively small. And then incorporated within our guidance, as we said, is also an expectation that we will see an approval in 6- to 11-year-olds in the latter part of 2016, which would give us access to an eligible population of about 2,500, and that's also incorporated within our guidance. But that approval is not anticipated until the back end of 2016."

It's -- for us, at that point in time, it was early in the launch. Yes, we've recruited a number of patients on to ORKAMBI, but it was still early in the launch to understand treatment patterns. We stated that very clearly. What we've been able to do now as we sit here, as you point out, just over 9 months into the launch, we've been able to take a significant bolus of patients. For example, 3,000 patients that initiates in the first 3 months of disapproval, and we've been able to track those 6 to 9 months. What that allows us to do was to understand compliance rates. It helped us understand discontinuation rates and also the time of discontinuation, as Stuart mentioned. That's been an important feature for us. So this was the -- we feel as though we're in this position at this point in time where we've been able to attract a substantial amount of patients over a good period of time to have the confidence to provide guidance for 2016. The comparison to KALYDECO was less relevant for us. It was more about the treatment patterns for ORKAMBI.

Maybe just to add a little bit more of a 10,000 foot view on both KALYDECO and ORKAMBI. Like you have been involved with many, many drug launches -- and I think it's worth just putting those in perspective a little bit. From the standpoint, as an example, in ORKAMBI of getting to 65% of the patients in 9 months and of course, with KALYDECO, it was close to 90%, that's a fairly unusually fast ramp. And from the standpoint of persistence, the kind of numbers Stuart was talking about, let's say 70% to 80% is the number that we said aloud at, is still a very, very high number compared to most chronic medicines. And we believe that really represents the correct perception that both physicians and patients have about the value of these medicines and treating the underlying cause of the disease for a long period of time. And that really underlines our thinking about the pipeline as well because as we develop this next set of medicines, including next gens and hopefully, ultimately, things like CRISPR, we're talking about progressively increasing the benefit/risk profile of our portfolio of drugs that these patients can take. And that will only, of course, increase both persistence and compliance rates. So overall, very; pleased of where we are. We know we have more work to do to get to more patients and improve therapy, but these 2 drugs have really performed quite well so far."

In terms of restarts, yes, your survey is consistent with what we've heard in that we have heard from physicians that they are trying to restart ORKAMBI in some of their patients, who they have previously had to discontinue the product in largely because, as you know, that they are often firm believers that treating the underlying cause of the disease is clearly a good thing for those patients if they can tolerate the medicine. In terms of the absolute volume of that, at the minute, that's hard to quantify. We certainly heard it anecdotally. We've certainly heard success stories. It's fair to say though that within our guidance, we've assumed relatively minimal impact from restarts because, at this time, we really don't have evidence that it's happening in quite the numbers that perhaps people have said that they might do it in.

There are some 3-month prescriptions written, but the vast majority of prescriptions are written for -- on a monthly basis.

And that'll give us an ability to learn how the product performs with those patients in the real world. Again, one of the things that we have seen obviously with the younger population with KALYDECO is they tend to be slightly more compliant than the average, not surprisingly, because they've got a lot of parental and caregiver supervision. But really, those assumptions that we've given you are really much more related to the 12 and above population.

So that's why we said, while we think CRISPR is an incredibly powerful technology for the future, it's going to take a number of years to conquer both the -- some of the editing challenges but also, in particular, the delivery challenges, and that's what we're working on in CF. Now we're also -- I'll just remind you that CRISPR-Cas9 collaboration, we have rights to several targets, fixed targets, and some of those will be in other diseases where some of these issues, like delivery and editing, are much more straightforward.

First of all, thank you for your questions, thanks for your patience. I know it was a long call, but we do want to give you not only our guidance but a detailed rationale for the guidance so that you understand our model. And we appreciate your questions on that.
As I look at our progress as a company over the last year, I guess I would call out 3 things that I think are important. First, the continuous increase in the number of patients that we can treat and actually fairly dramatic increase in the number of patients that we can treat with KALYDECO and ORKAMBI; and as we look forward, the increasing number of patients that we can treat with today's approval. So as I mentioned, 27,000 eligible, we're still only treating 1/3 of those, and I think we have a clear path to get to the majority of those patients both in the U.S. and Europe over '16 and '17 and beyond.
Second thing I would say is the pipeline progression. We're pleased with 661 progressing well into Phase III of multiple trials and multiple patient populations but equally important, the next-gen correctors, which are progressing through Phase I with our -- and still on a time line to get into patients as triple combinations later this year. We think that's going to be very important both for the patients we treat and potentially for additional subsets of patients.
And then finally, the progression of the science. We didn't talk about that a lot today, but the science of CF, I think, has progressed significantly, and we have a much better understanding of the folding and correction process. And the science that David Altshuler is driving and the rest of research group in some of the new diseases, we touched on those a little bit with CRISPR-Cas9 but also others that I hope we will be able to have a chance to talk to you about over the rest of '16 and '17. It's an important long-term growth engine for the company.
So with that, maybe I'll close the call, and thanks again for joining us."

Good evening, everyone. Over the last 4 years, Vertex has delivered 2 transformative medicines to people with cystic fibrosis. Today, there are approximately 27,000 people eligible for 1 of our approved CF medicines, and we have a clear p",1797,"Thanks, Michael. Good evening, everyone. Over the last 4 years, Vertex has delivered 2 transformative medicines to people with cystic fibrosis. Today, there are approximately 27,000 people eligible for 1 of our approved CF medicines, and we have a clear path toward our goal of helping potentially all people with this rare and life-shortening disease in the future.
We're confident that our experience with ORKAMBI and KALYDECO, and our scientific leadership and progress in targeting the underlying biology of this disease, positions us well to increase the number of people treated with our approved medicines and to develop new medicines in the years ahead that may provide even greater benefit for all people with CF.
Tonight, I'll provide brief comments on 3 key areas which serve as markers of our progress toward treating all people with CF, including: first, the performance of our approved medicines, ORKAMBI and KALYDECO, and our road map toward treating more patients with these medicines that will drive revenue growth in 2016 and beyond; second, the role of VX-661 in helping to achieve our long-term goal in CF; and third, our pipeline of additional CFTR modulators and other mechanisms we're advancing as part of collaborations. These approaches include the ENaC inhibition, and in the longer-term, gene editing with CRISPR-Cas9, and may position us to help all people with CF.
We're approximately 9 months into the launch of ORKAMBI in the U.S. for people with 2 copies of the F508del CFTR mutation ages 12 and older. As of the end of March, approximately 65% or 5,500 of the 8,500 currently eligible patients in the U.S. have initiated treatment with ORKAMBI. We expect the number of patients who've initiated treatment with ORKAMBI will continue to grow during 2016. And we continue to expect that by the end of the year, the vast majority of all eligible patients ages 12 and older in the U.S. will have initiated treatment.
We've seen excellent reimbursement and access for ORKAMBI from public and private payers in the U.S., and the feedback from the CF community continues to be very positive. Importantly, patients across the U.S. have broad access to the medicine through public and private insurance. And we have assistance programs in place for eligible patients who need additional help. All major commercial insurers in all 50 state Medicaid programs are currently covering ORKAMBI, reflecting the important advance and value this medicine represents in the treatment of CF.
We're now moving forward to our bringing ORKAMBI to younger patients. And at the end of March, we submitted a supplemental New Drug Application to the FDA, requesting approval of ORKAMBI for children ages 6 to 11 with 2 copies of the F508del mutation. We requested priority review, which if granted, would provide us with the decision on the application in the second half of this year. If approved, approximately 2,400 additional patients in the U.S. would be eligible for treatment.
Outside the U.S., we have commenced discussions with reimbursement agencies in various European and other countries. Given the clinical benefits of ORKAMBI and the severity of the disease for people with 2 copies of the F508del mutation, we believe that we will achieve reimbursement from key European and other government payers, just as we've seen in the U.S. ORKAMBI is already commercially available in Germany and through early access programs in France.
In the near term, the progress and our understanding of treating eligible patients with ORKAMBI gives us clarity on a revenue expectation for 2016. Later in the call, Stuart and Ian will talk about the ORKAMBI launch in detail, our guidance and how we think about revenue trends from 2015 and growth into 2016 and further into the future.
For KALYDECO, we're increasing our revenue guidance for 2016, which Stuart will discuss in his remarks. As we think about the future opportunities for ORKAMBI and KALYDECO, I want to emphasize that revenue growth in 2016 and beyond is largely a function of additional patients who are currently eligible for ORKAMBI or KALYDECO and initiating treatment with these medicines. On that basis alone, we believe there's significant growth ahead for both medicines. 
Consider that today, ORKAMBI and KALYDECO are approved for approximately 27,000 people worldwide. But we're only currently treating approximately 1/3 of these patients. As we see additional uptake of ORKAMBI in the U.S. and achieve reimbursement for eligible patients outside the U.S., growth will continue as additional patients continue to initiate treatment.
In addition, there are many more patients not currently eligible for treatment who may benefit from either ORKAMBI or KALYDECO. In total, we believe there are approximately 44,000 people, an additional 17,000 people beyond those eligible today, who could benefit from 1 of these 2 medicines. This additional group of patients was largely comprised of the following: first, approximately 12,000 people less than 12 years of age who have 2 copies of the F508del mutation and who may be helped by ORKAMBI; and second, approximately 5,000 patients who may be helped by KALYDECO comprised mostly of patients who have a residual function mutation. 
Treating a substantial portion of this additional group of 17,000 patients would further drive ORKAMBI and KALYDECO growth if we obtain future approvals for these additional groups of patients. We have ongoing studies, regulatory submissions and development plans to support these efforts, including ongoing discussions with the FDA regarding our application for approval of KALYDECO in approximately 1,500 people ages 2 and older with 1 of 23 residual function mutations as well as our recent sNDA submission to the FDA for approval of ORKAMBI in children ages 6 to 11 with 2 copies of the F508del mutation.
While we are focused on getting ORKAMBI and KALYDECO to as many patients as possible as soon as possible, we also recognize that there are many patients who are still waiting for a treatment for the underlying cause of their disease. We hear from these patients often, so I'm particularly pleased to report that our CF pipeline is advancing. This gives us great confidence that we will ultimately be able to treat the vast majority of people with CF and potentially enhance the benefit for those people currently taking our approved medicines.
I'll start with VX-661, which could play an important role in the treatment of people with CF and is currently in Phase III development. In combination with ivacaftor, our Phase II data suggested that VX-661 may have an improved benefit risk profile compared to ORKAMBI in people with 2 copies of the F508del mutation and may provide enhanced clinical benefits over ivacaftor monotherapy for other patients with gating mutations. We are on track to obtain the first data from the ongoing Phase III program for VX-661 in early 2017 from the study in people with 2 copies of the F508del mutation.
Additionally, VX-661 is positioned to play a key role in the development of a triple combination with a next-generation corrector in ivacaftor. We believe that this triple-combination approach will be fundamental for 2 reasons: first, triple combinations may allow us to treat a very large group of patients who are not helped today by either ORKAMBI or KALYDECO, including those with 1 F508del mutation and a second mutation that causes minimal CFTR function; and second, these regimens could provide even greater benefit to patients currently eligible for our approved medicines who have at least 1 F508del mutation.
Today, we have 2 next-gen correctors in clinical development: VX-152 and VX-440. These potential medicines are currently being evaluated in Phase I studies in healthy volunteers. Successful completion of these studies would enable us to move rapidly into Phase II studies in the second half of 2016 to evaluate 1 or more next-generation correctors with VX-661 and ivacaftor in people with CF.
I'll now turn to our pipeline of other potential CF medicines that could be complementary to our portfolio of CFTR modulators, and it may enable us to treat more patients and provide greater clinical benefit in the years to come. The most advanced example of this is our lead ENaC inhibitor, VX-371. Today, we announced data from a Phase II 14-day study of VX-371 in 142 people with CF who are not receiving ORKAMBI or KALYDECO. The study met its primary endpoint of safety. 96% of the patients who enrolled in the study completed all treatment, and the treatment regimens consisting of VX-371 were generally well tolerated. There were no statistically significant changes from baseline in FEV1 for those patients who received VX-371 compared to placebo. 
The data announced today are consistent with our in-vitro data that did not show a meaningful change in cilia beat frequency when VX-371 was used alone in human bronchial epithelial cells with 2 copies of the F508del mutation. In contrast, these in-vitro data did show a meaningful change in cilia beat frequency when VX-371 was used in combination with ORKAMBI. Together, the in-vitro and clinical safety data generated to date provide further support for our ongoing study of VX-371 in combination with ORKAMBI. This ongoing study began enrolling people with 2 copies of the F508del mutation ages 12 and older in the first quarter of this year. And the primary endpoints are safety and mean absolute change from baseline in lung function at Day 28 of treatment as compared to placebo. Additional information on these studies can be found in our first quarter press release issued today.
Additionally, last year, we entered into a collaboration with CRISPR Therapeutics, with a longer-term goal of discovering gene-editing approaches for the treatment of genetic diseases, including CF. The use of this technology in people with CF may be many years away, but it is strategically important as we think about future advances that could fundamentally change the treatment of this disease in the years to come.
Tonight, I've summarized how we think about our opportunity in CF, an opportunity that is unique, both in terms of the potential benefit that ORKAMBI and KALYDECO provides the people with CF today and also for the long-term potential of our development-stage medicines to treat the vast majority of people with CF in the future.
In conclusion, I'll make just a few comments about the type of company we will become as we achieve the success in CF that I've just outlined. Vertex is on a path towards sustained earnings and revenue growth, driven by an increasing number of people being treated with KALYDECO and ORKAMBI. We believe our business model, one focused on significant investment to create value through innovation, research and development, positions us to consistently discover and deliver transformative new medicines for patients and to reinvest in scientific opportunities to create future medicines.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Stuart to make more specific comments on the ORKAMBI launch."
36235,331185758,965292,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2016",2016-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Jeff, and hello, everyone. Tonight, I will review our progress with the launch of ORKAMBI, the basis of our 2016 guidance for ORKAMBI product revenues and our ongoing efforts to obtain reimbursement outside the U.S. to drive further growth of ORKA",1180,"Thanks, Jeff, and hello, everyone. Tonight, I will review our progress with the launch of ORKAMBI, the basis of our 2016 guidance for ORKAMBI product revenues and our ongoing efforts to obtain reimbursement outside the U.S. to drive further growth of ORKAMBI in 2017 and beyond.
We are now just over 9 months into the launch, and we are pleased that approximately 65% of eligible patients in the U.S. have initiated treatment with ORKAMBI to date. Global sales of ORKAMBI in the first quarter were $223 million, comprised of U.S. sales of approximately $214 million and ex U.S. sales of approximately $9 million, which were mainly from Germany. 
At the beginning of the year, our intention was to provide financial guidance for 2016 ORKAMBI revenues once we have gained sufficient understanding of the dynamics of the launch in the U.S. Today, we have a deeper understanding if our doctors and their patients are using the medicine, based on the real-world treatment patterns we've observed in more than 4,500 patients who initiated treatment in the U.S. in 2015. 
I'll now share with you our understanding of the launch dynamics that informed our guidance. First, uptake, defined as the total proportion of the 8,500 eligible patients in the U.S. who will begin treatment with ORKAMBI by the end of 2016 and also the rate at which these patients initiate treatment. Second, the persistence rate, defined as the proportion of patients who start and remain on treatment. And third, the compliance rate, which reflects the number of pills actually taken by a patient in a given month.
First, to uptake. To date, approximately 65% of the 8,500 eligible patients in the U.S. have initiated treatment with ORKAMBI, comprised of more than 3,000 patients who initiated treatment in the third quarter of 2015, more than 1,500 in the fourth quarter and approximately 800 in the first quarter of 2016. We have seen further initiations in April and expect that patient initiations will continue throughout 2016, albeit the lower rate than in the first 3 quarters post-launch. We continue to expect that the vast majority of the eligible patients ages 12 and older in the U.S. will initiate treatment with ORKAMBI by the end of this year.
Second, persistence. Among patients who have initiated ORKAMBI since launch, we've seen that approximately 15% of patients discontinued treatment within 3 months of starting treatment. Our clinical trial and market research data indicate that these discontinuations are largely related to respiratory adverse events. After the first 3 months of treatment, the discontinuation rate then slows considerably. Based on what we've observed to date from all patients taking ORKAMBI, including those who have been on commercial drug for up to 9 months and those who continue to receive ORKAMBI as part of our Phase III long-term extension study, we expect that the proportion of all patients who initiate and remain on treatment will stabilize at approximately 70% to 80%.
It is also important to point out that the pattern of patient initiations and discontinuations have an offsetting effect on our first quarter ORKAMBI revenues. Specifically because more than 4,500 patients began treatment with ORKAMBI in 2015, the impact of approximately 15% of these patients discontinuing ORKAMBI was highly evident in the first quarter. Therefore, while approximately 800 new patients initiated treatments in the first quarter, this growth was largely offset by the bolus of patients who discontinued treatment. This bolus of discontinuations began in the fourth quarter, but had a larger impact on the first quarter of 2016 where there were also fewer patient initiations to offset these discontinuations.
And finally, compliance. Based on what we've observed to date from the launch, we expect the compliance rate with ORKAMBI to be between 70% and 80%.
In summary, based on our understanding of the launch dynamics for ORKAMBI and the fact that we have continued to see additional patients initiating treatment with ORKAMBI in April, we expect to deliver quarter-to-quarter revenue growth for ORKAMBI beginning in the second quarter and continuing through the end of 2016 and into 2017.
I will now turn to the use of ORKAMBI to date outside the U.S. We are now well into the reimbursement process in all key European countries, Canada and Australia. Specifically, the clinical and cost-effectiveness assessment portions of the reimbursement process. These discussions are going as expected and have been productive. We believe that government payers across Europe recognize both the severity of this disease and the broad clinical benefits of ORKAMBI. These discussions will take time to complete. However, as Jeff mentioned earlier, we believe that we will achieve broad reimbursement from key European and other government payers, just as we've seen in the United States.
ORKAMBI is already available commercially in Germany and through early-access programs in France. We are only 3 months into the launch of ORKAMBI in Germany, and the uptake has been slower than we observed in the U.S. We attribute this to a number of factors, including that CF care in Germany is not concentrated in large centers as is seen in other countries. Meaning, there are many smaller centers and also many centers and physicians who have not yet had personal experience with CFTR modulators.
In Germany, there are approximately 2,500 patients eligible for treatment. As of March 31, 2016, approximately 230 patients had initiated treatment. However, we expect the number of patients initiating treatment in Germany will grow through 2016 and into 2017.
We do not expect what we are seeing in Germany will be representative of the uptake in other European countries. In fact, in France, where early-access programs provide the opportunity for physicians to begin treating patients with ORKAMBI prior to formal reimbursement approval, we have already seen approximately 400 of the 1,500 eligible patients initiate treatment with ORKAMBI in 2016.
We took all of this information into account when we set 2016 revenue guidance for ORKAMBI of $1.0 billion to $1.1 billion. Our guidance reflects our understanding of the ongoing U.S. launch, as I just discussed, as well as expectations that we will receive both approval for ORKAMBI in the U.S. for patients ages 6 to 11 in the second half of 2016 and certain revenues from sales of ORKAMBI outside the U.S., primarily from Germany.
Taking a longer-term view, we expect significant further growth for ORKAMBI revenues in 2017, driven primarily by patients initiating treatment following the completion of reimbursement discussions outside the U.S.
And now to KALYDECO. Today, we are increasing our financial guidance for 2016 revenues. We now expect KALYDECO net revenues of $685 million to $705 million. The prior guidance provided on January 10, 2016, was for KALYDECO net revenues of $670 million to $690 million.
We increased our KALYDECO guidance based primarily on an increasing number of patients initiating treatment with KALYDECO globally and on expectations of a reduced impact this year from the VX-661 Phase III program. Our guidance for KALYDECO excludes any potential revenues from the approval of KALYDECO, the people with residual function mutations.
I'll now hand the call over to Ian."

Notably, we are seeing increasing number of patients being trea",560,"Thank you, Stuart, and good evening to everyone. With the closing of the first quarter of 2016 and 9 months into the launch of ORKAMBI, we are seeing significant progress across our business. Notably, we are seeing increasing number of patients being treated with our approved medicines, resulting in a growing revenue base that we expect to drive earnings growth. 
I will now review our first quarter financial results and provide some specific comments about the long-term financial trajectory of our business.
Financial results first. In the first quarter of 2016, we reported total CF product revenues of approximately $394 million, a significant increase compared to $130 million in the first quarter of 2015. With ORKAMBI, we reported sales of $223 million for the first quarter of 2016. We have recorded approximately $574 million of ORKAMBI revenues in the first 9 months since the U.S. launch in July 2015. The first quarter KALYDECO sales of $171 million were up $41 million versus the first quarter of last year. 
Now to the operating expenses. Our first quarter non-GAAP operating expenses were $306 million compared to non-GAAP operating expenses of $246 million for 2015. The increased operating expenses were primarily due to increased costs related to the progression of our CF pipeline and to increased investments in global commercial support for the launch of ORKAMBI. Our non-GAAP net profit for the first quarter of 2016 was $22 million or $0.09 per diluted share compared to a non-GAAP net loss of $148 million or $0.62 per share for 2015.
From a balance sheet perspective, we ended the first quarter with approximately $1.03 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Vertex also has $300 million outstanding from a credit agreement, repayable by the end of the third quarter of 2017. The agreement also allows for the facility to increase to $500 million. 
Now to financial trends. Stuart provided 2016 ORKAMBI and KALYDECO revenue guidance and the assumptions that drive our projections, and therefore, I will focus my comments on the longer-term growth opportunities that may come with treating more patients with our currently approved medicines. 
We expect ORKAMBI revenues will continue to grow as we treat more patients in the U.S., achieve reimbursement outside the U.S. and expand the ORKAMBI label to younger patients. KALYDECO's growth is based on gaining reimbursement for certain groups of patients outside the U.S, including those with R117H mutation and the people ages 2 to 5 with gating mutations.
In summary, as Jeff noted earlier, approximately 27,000 people are eligible for our CF medicines, yet we are only treating approximately 1/3 of these patients. As additional patients in the U.S. start treatment and we complete reimbursement discussions outside the U.S., we expect the number of patients treated with our medicines to increase significantly and we expect revenue growth will follow. 
I will note that in 2015, we reported total CF revenues of $983 million. Based on 2016 guidance provided for ORKAMBI and KALYDECO, we anticipate the total CF revenues of approximately $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion, an approximate 75% increase over the prior year.
As our revenues grow over future years, we are committed to managing our operating expenses to drive earnings growth, and we expect to deliver financial profile as similar to many of our large cap biotech peers.
With that, I open the line to questions."

Are you seeing the same stuff in Germany? Are there any ways to improve it there? And then the second question is a pipeline question on the 661 het-min. You mentioned in the press release that you're changing the enrollment to do 200 instead of 300. But is that assuming you actually pass the futility? Can you just clarify that a little bit?

And then I'll hand over to Jeff Chodakewitz to answer the pipeline questions. So on discontinuations and compliance and what we might be able to do to improve those, much as we did with KALYDECO. We will be continuing to generate data on the long-term benefits and even broader benefits of ORKAMBI when used in the real world. And I suspect that data, if it’s compelling, may lead physicians and patients to reconsider restarting ORKAMBI. So we'll continue to develop the overall clinical profile of ORKAMBI as we have more experience in the market. In terms of compliance, really, many of the same things that we did with KALYDECO we'll be doing with ORKAMBI, and that's really providing both providers and physicians with the educational materials to be able to understand how this is a product which is treating the underlying cause of their disease and so is a product that they want to try and stay compliant with as much as they possibly can. We'll certainly be leveraging all the learnings we've had with KALYDECO, with ORKAMBI, and those programs are already in place. And lastly, to your point about -- to Germany. Clearly, one of the things we're going to be doing is transferring all of the learnings from our launch experience in the U.S. to all of the other markets that we're launching into. And that's, in many ways, the benefits of those markets coming on-stream a little bit later is that they can learn from our experiences here in the U.S. With that, I'll hand over to Jeff to answer the question on the pipeline."

So on the respiratory events, I think what I'd say there is what we're reporting today is what we're seeing in the real-world usage of ORKAMBI in the broad population. Obviously, the clinical trial population that we studied in TRAFFIC and TRANSPORT is a very controlled situation. That was patients with an FEV1 between 40 and 90. So really, whilst we try to extrapolate from the clinical trial experience to the real-world experience, that's one of the reasons -- that uncertainty is one of the reasons why we wanted to make sure we had sufficient time in market before we gave guidance. It was because we really wanted to see how the product would get used in the real world. In terms of the contribution of the various different parts of the world to our ORKAMBI revenue guidance that you might expect the vast majority of these, the revenues is going to come from here in the U.S. There will be a contribution ex U.S., but it's going to be relatively small. And then incorporated within our guidance, as we said, is also an expectation that we will see an approval in 6- to 11-year-olds in the latter part of 2016, which would give us access to an eligible population of about 2,500, and that's also incorporated within our guidance.

It's -- for us, at that point in time, it was early in the launch. Yes, we've recruited a number of patients on to ORKAMBI, but it was still early in the launch to understand treatment patterns. We stated that very clearly. What we've been able to do now as we sit here, as you point out, just over 9 months into the launch, we've been able to take a significant bolus of patients. For example, 3,000 patients that initiates in the first 3 months of disapproval, and we've been able to track those 6 to 9 months. What that allows us to do was to understand compliance rates. It helped us understand discontinuation rates and also the time of discontinuation, as Stuart mentioned. That's been an important feature for us. So this was the -- we feel as though we're in this position at this point in time where we've been able to attract a substantial amount of patients over a good period of time to have the confidence to provide guidance for 2016. The comparison to KALYDECO was less relevant for us. It was more about the treatment patterns for ORKAMBI.

First of all, what's clear from speaking to our investigators and also to physicians in the field, that clearly the support for the patients, both setting expectations for the patient and for the physician and helping patients in those early weeks manage any symptoms, we think is very important and something that goes back to some of the education questions that we've heard about earlier. We are also collecting information in our own study for patients who's FEV1 were less than 40, and we're in the process of summarizing that. We did, in that study, we give patients the option to start on a lower dose. And we'll set -- we'll get that data together and summarize it.

And we believe that really represents the correct perception that both physicians and patients have about the value of these medicines and treating the underlying cause of the disease for a long period of time. And that really underlines our thinking about the pipeline as well because as we develop this next set of medicines, including next gens and hopefully, ultimately, things like CRISPR, we're talking about progressively increasing the benefit/risk profile of our portfolio of drugs that these patients can take.

In terms of the compliance trend, compliance is the metric that you need the longest period of time to measure because, clearly, this is a chronic medicine, and so in the first prescription they get, your kind of assumption is that you're 100% compliant. You have to wait until they get the second prescription to work out exactly what it is. So this is the one that really takes the longest period of time for us to get a good handle on. I don't know obviously the intricacies of your model. I'll just reiterate that, based on the trends that we've seen to date and the experience we've got with the patients who have been treated to date, our expectation for the year and the assumption on which our guidance is built is that it'll be somewhere between 70% and 80% for ORKAMBI this year. In terms of the 1- or 3-month script, the vast majority are written for 1 month. There are some 3-month prescriptions written, but the vast majority of prescriptions are written for -- on a monthly basis. And in terms of kind of qualitatively, what would lead you to one end versus the other, to me, this is all about education and our ability to help providers to give to their patients information, which educates them on the nature of the disease, the underlying defects, the fact that ORKAMBI is designed to treat those underlying defects, and to the extent they believe in the science, believe in the long-term benefits that ORKAMBI can provide to them, then I think that's only likely to lead to patients having a higher compliance rate. We're very focused on that. We're certainly taking all the learnings we can from our experience with KALYDECO to support patients to take the prescriptions in line with their physician's recommendations."

First of all, thank you for your questions, thanks for your patience. I know it was a long call, but we do want to give you not only our guidance but a detailed rationale for the guidance so that you understand our model. And we appreciate your questions on that.
As I look at our progress as a company over the last year, I guess I would call out 3 things that I think are important. First, the continuous increase in the number of patients that we can treat and actually fairly dramatic increase in the number of patients that we can treat with KALYDECO and ORKAMBI; and as we look forward, the increasing number of patients that we can treat with today's approval. So as I mentioned, 27,000 eligible, we're still only treating 1/3 of those, and I think we have a clear path to get to the majority of those patients both in the U.S. and Europe over '16 and '17 and beyond.
Second thing I would say is the pipeline progression. We're pleased with 661 progressing well into Phase III of multiple trials and multiple patient populations but equally important, we have the next-gen correctors, which are progressing through Phase I with our -- and still on a time line to get into patients as triple combinations later this year. We think that's going to be very important both for the patients we treat and potentially for additional subsets of patients.
And then finally, the progression of the science. We didn't talk about that a lot today, but the science of CF, I think, has progressed significantly, and we have a much better understanding of the folding and correction process. And the science that David Altshuler is driving and the rest of research group in some of the new diseases, we touched on those a little bit with CRISPR-Cas9 but also others that I hope we will be able to have a chance to talk to you about over the rest of '16 and '17. It's an important long-term growth engine for the company.
So with that, maybe I'll close the call, and thanks again for joining us."

Good evening, everyone. Over the last 4 years, Vertex has delivered 2 transformative medicines to people with cystic fibrosis. Today, there are approximately 27,000 people eligible for 1 of our approved CF medicines, and we have a clear p",1797,"Thanks, Michael. Good evening, everyone. Over the last 4 years, Vertex has delivered 2 transformative medicines to people with cystic fibrosis. Today, there are approximately 27,000 people eligible for 1 of our approved CF medicines, and we have a clear path toward our goal of helping potentially all people with this rare and life-shortening disease in the future.
We're confident that our experience with ORKAMBI and KALYDECO, and our scientific leadership and progress in targeting the underlying biology of this disease, positions us well to increase the number of people treated with our approved medicines and to develop new medicines in the years ahead that may provide even greater benefit for all people with CF.
Tonight, I'll provide brief comments on 3 key areas which serve as markers of our progress toward treating all people with CF, including: first, the performance of our approved medicines, ORKAMBI and KALYDECO, and our road map toward treating more patients with these medicines that will drive revenue growth in 2016 and beyond; second, the role of VX-661 in helping to achieve our long-term goal in CF; and third, our pipeline of additional CFTR modulators and other mechanisms we're advancing as part of collaborations. These approaches include the ENaC inhibition, and in the longer-term, gene editing with CRISPR-Cas9, and may position us to help all people with CF.
We're approximately 9 months into the launch of ORKAMBI in the U.S. for people with 2 copies of the F508del CFTR mutation ages 12 and older. As of the end of March, approximately 65% or 5,500 of the 8,500 currently eligible patients in the U.S. have initiated treatment with ORKAMBI. We expect the number of patients who've initiated treatment with ORKAMBI will continue to grow during 2016. And we continue to expect that by the end of the year, the vast majority of all eligible patients ages 12 and older in the U.S. will have initiated treatment.
We've seen excellent reimbursement and access for ORKAMBI from public and private payers in the U.S., and the feedback from the CF community continues to be very positive. Importantly, patients across the U.S. have broad access to the medicine through public and private insurance. And we have assistance programs in place for eligible patients who need additional help. All major commercial insurers in all 50 state Medicaid programs are currently covering ORKAMBI, reflecting the important advance and value this medicine represents in the treatment of CF.
We're now moving forward to our bringing ORKAMBI to younger patients. And at the end of March, we submitted a supplemental New Drug Application to the FDA, requesting approval of ORKAMBI for children ages 6 to 11 with 2 copies of the F508del mutation. We requested priority review, which if granted, would provide us with the decision on the application in the second half of this year. If approved, approximately 2,400 additional patients in the U.S. would be eligible for treatment.
Outside the U.S., we have commenced discussions with reimbursement agencies in various European and other countries. Given the clinical benefits of ORKAMBI and the severity of the disease for people with 2 copies of the F508del mutation, we believe that we will achieve reimbursement from key European and other government payers, just as we've seen in the U.S. ORKAMBI is already commercially available in Germany and through early access programs in France.
In the near term, the progress and our understanding of treating eligible patients with ORKAMBI gives us clarity on a revenue expectation for 2016. Later in the call, Stuart and Ian will talk about the ORKAMBI launch in detail, our guidance and how we think about revenue trends from 2015 and growth into 2016 and further into the future.
For KALYDECO, we're increasing our revenue guidance for 2016, which Stuart will discuss in his remarks. As we think about the future opportunities for ORKAMBI and KALYDECO, I want to emphasize that revenue growth in 2016 and beyond is largely a function of additional patients who are currently eligible for ORKAMBI or KALYDECO and initiating treatment with these medicines. On that basis alone, we believe there's significant growth ahead for both medicines. 
Consider that today, ORKAMBI and KALYDECO are approved for approximately 27,000 people worldwide. But we're only currently treating approximately 1/3 of these patients. As we see additional uptake of ORKAMBI in the U.S. and achieve reimbursement for eligible patients outside the U.S., growth will continue as additional patients continue to initiate treatment.
In addition, there are many more patients not currently eligible for treatment who may benefit from either ORKAMBI or KALYDECO. In total, we believe there are approximately 44,000 people, an additional 17,000 people beyond those eligible today, who could benefit from 1 of these 2 medicines. This additional group of patients was largely comprised of the following: first, approximately 12,000 people less than 12 years of age who have 2 copies of the F508del mutation and who may be helped by ORKAMBI; and second, approximately 5,000 patients who may be helped by KALYDECO comprised mostly of patients who have a residual function mutation. 
Treating a substantial portion of this additional group of 17,000 patients would further drive ORKAMBI and KALYDECO growth if we obtain future approvals for these additional groups of patients. We have ongoing studies, regulatory submissions and development plans to support these efforts, including ongoing discussions with the FDA regarding our application for approval of KALYDECO in approximately 1,500 people ages 2 and older with 1 of 23 residual function mutations as well as our recent sNDA submission to the FDA for approval of ORKAMBI in children ages 6 to 11 with 2 copies of the F508del mutation.
While we are focused on getting ORKAMBI and KALYDECO to as many patients as possible as soon as possible, we also recognize that there are many patients who are still waiting for a treatment for the underlying cause of their disease. We hear from these patients often, so I'm particularly pleased to report that our CF pipeline is advancing. This gives us great confidence that we will ultimately be able to treat the vast majority of people with CF and potentially enhance the benefit for those people currently taking our approved medicines.
I'll start with VX-661, which could play an important role in the treatment of people with CF and is currently in Phase III development. In combination with ivacaftor, our Phase II data suggested that VX-661 may have an improved benefit risk profile compared to ORKAMBI in people with 2 copies of the F508del mutation and may provide enhanced clinical benefits over ivacaftor monotherapy for other patients with gating mutations. We are on track to obtain the first data from the ongoing Phase III program for VX-661 in early 2017 from the study in people with 2 copies of the F508del mutation.
Additionally, VX-661 is positioned to play a key role in the development of a triple combination with a next-generation corrector in ivacaftor. We believe that this triple-combination approach will be fundamental for 2 reasons: first, triple combinations may allow us to treat a very large group of patients who are not helped today by either ORKAMBI or KALYDECO, including those with 1 F508del mutation and a second mutation that causes minimal CFTR function; and second, these regimens could provide even greater benefit to patients currently eligible for our approved medicines who have at least 1 F508del mutation.
Today, we have 2 next-gen correctors in clinical development: VX-152 and VX-440. These potential medicines are currently being evaluated in Phase I studies in healthy volunteers. Successful completion of these studies would enable us to move rapidly into Phase II studies in the second half of 2016 to evaluate 1 or more next-generation correctors with VX-661 and ivacaftor in people with CF.
I'll now turn to our pipeline of other potential CF medicines that could be complementary to our portfolio of CFTR modulators, and it may enable us to treat more patients and provide greater clinical benefit in the years to come. The most advanced example of this is our lead ENaC inhibitor, VX-371. Today, we announced data from a Phase II 14-day study of VX-371 in 142 people with CF who are not receiving ORKAMBI or KALYDECO. The study met its primary endpoint of safety. 96% of the patients who enrolled in the study completed all treatment, and the treatment regimens consisting of VX-371 were generally well tolerated. There were no statistically significant changes from baseline in FEV1 for those patients who received VX-371 compared to placebo. 
The data announced today are consistent with our in-vitro data that did not show a meaningful change in cilia beat frequency when VX-371 was used alone in human bronchial epithelial cells with 2 copies of the F508del mutation. In contrast, these in-vitro data did show a meaningful change in cilia beat frequency when VX-371 was used in combination with ORKAMBI. Together, the in-vitro and clinical safety data generated to date provide further support for our ongoing study of VX-371 in combination with ORKAMBI. This ongoing study began enrolling people with 2 copies of the F508del mutation ages 12 and older in the first quarter of this year. And the primary endpoints are safety and mean absolute change from baseline in lung function at Day 28 of treatment as compared to placebo. Additional information on these studies can be found in our first quarter press release issued today.
Additionally, last year, we entered into a collaboration with CRISPR Therapeutics, with a longer-term goal of discovering gene-editing approaches for the treatment of genetic diseases, including CF. The use of this technology in people with CF may be many years away, but it is strategically important as we think about future advances that could fundamentally change the treatment of this disease in the years to come.
Tonight, I've summarized how we think about our opportunity in CF, an opportunity that is unique, both in terms of the potential benefit that ORKAMBI and KALYDECO provides the people with CF today and also for the long-term potential of our development-stage medicines to treat the vast majority of people with CF in the future.
In conclusion, I'll make just a few comments about the type of company we will become as we achieve the success in CF that I've just outlined. Vertex is on a path towards sustained earnings and revenue growth, driven by an increasing number of people being treated with KALYDECO and ORKAMBI. We believe our business model, one focused on significant investment to create value through innovation, research and development, positions us to consistently discover and deliver transformative new medicines for patients and to reinvest in scientific opportunities to create future medicines.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Stuart to make more specific comments on the ORKAMBI launch."

Tonight, I will review our progress with the launch of ORKAMBI, the basis of our 2016 guidance for ORKAMBI product revenues and our ongoing efforts to obtain reimbursement outside the U.S. to drive further growth of ORKA",1180,"Thanks, Jeff, and hello, everyone. Tonight, I will review our progress with the launch of ORKAMBI, the basis of our 2016 guidance for ORKAMBI product revenues and our ongoing efforts to obtain reimbursement outside the U.S. to drive further growth of ORKAMBI in 2017 and beyond.
We are now just over 9 months into the launch, and we are pleased that approximately 65% of eligible patients in the U.S. have initiated treatment with ORKAMBI to date. Global sales of ORKAMBI in the first quarter were $223 million, comprised of U.S. sales of approximately $214 million and ex U.S. sales of approximately $9 million, which were mainly from Germany. 
At the beginning of the year, our intention was to provide financial guidance for 2016 ORKAMBI revenues once we have gained sufficient understanding of the dynamics of the launch in the U.S. Today, we have a deeper understanding if our doctors and their patients are using the medicine, based on the real-world treatment patterns we've observed in more than 4,500 patients who initiated treatment in the U.S. in 2015. 
I'll now share with you our understanding of the launch dynamics that informed our guidance. First, uptake, defined as the total proportion of the 8,500 eligible patients in the U.S. who will begin treatment with ORKAMBI by the end of 2016 and also the rate at which these patients initiate treatment. Second, the persistence rate, defined as the proportion of patients who start and remain on treatment. And third, the compliance rate, which reflects the number of pills actually taken by a patient in a given month.
First, to uptake. To date, approximately 65% of the 8,500 eligible patients in the U.S. have initiated treatment with ORKAMBI, comprised of more than 3,000 patients who initiated treatment in the third quarter of 2015, more than 1,500 in the fourth quarter and approximately 800 in the first quarter of 2016. We have seen further initiations in April and expect that patient initiations will continue throughout 2016, albeit the lower rate than in the first 3 quarters post-launch. We continue to expect that the vast majority of the eligible patients ages 12 and older in the U.S. will initiate treatment with ORKAMBI by the end of this year.
Second, persistence. Among patients who have initiated ORKAMBI since launch, we've seen that approximately 15% of patients discontinued treatment within 3 months of starting treatment. Our clinical trial and market research data indicate that these discontinuations are largely related to respiratory adverse events. After the first 3 months of treatment, the discontinuation rate then slows considerably. Based on what we've observed to date from all patients taking ORKAMBI, including those who have been on commercial drug for up to 9 months and those who continue to receive ORKAMBI as part of our Phase III long-term extension study, we expect that the proportion of all patients who initiate and remain on treatment will stabilize at approximately 70% to 80%.
It is also important to point out that the pattern of patient initiations and discontinuations have an offsetting effect on our first quarter ORKAMBI revenues. Specifically because more than 4,500 patients began treatment with ORKAMBI in 2015, the impact of approximately 15% of these patients discontinuing ORKAMBI was highly evident in the first quarter. Therefore, while approximately 800 new patients initiated treatments in the first quarter, this growth was largely offset by the bolus of patients who discontinued treatment. This bolus of discontinuations began in the fourth quarter, but had a larger impact on the first quarter of 2016 where there were also fewer patient initiations to offset these discontinuations.
And finally, compliance. Based on what we've observed to date from the launch, we expect the compliance rate with ORKAMBI to be between 70% and 80%.
In summary, based on our understanding of the launch dynamics for ORKAMBI and the fact that we have continued to see additional patients initiating treatment with ORKAMBI in April, we expect to deliver quarter-to-quarter revenue growth for ORKAMBI beginning in the second quarter and continuing through the end of 2016 and into 2017.
I will now turn to the use of ORKAMBI to date outside the U.S. We are now well into the reimbursement process in all key European countries, Canada and Australia. Specifically, the clinical and cost-effectiveness assessment portions of the reimbursement process. These discussions are going as expected and have been productive. We believe that government payers across Europe recognize both the severity of this disease and the broad clinical benefits of ORKAMBI. These discussions will take time to complete. However, as Jeff mentioned earlier, we believe that we will achieve broad reimbursement from key European and other government payers, just as we've seen in the United States.
ORKAMBI is already available commercially in Germany and through early-access programs in France. We are only 3 months into the launch of ORKAMBI in Germany, and the uptake has been slower than we observed in the U.S. We attribute this to a number of factors, including that CF care in Germany is not concentrated in large centers as is seen in other countries. Meaning, there are many smaller centers and also many centers and physicians who have not yet had personal experience with CFTR modulators.
In Germany, there are approximately 2,500 patients eligible for treatment. As of March 31, 2016, approximately 230 patients had initiated treatment. However, we expect the number of patients initiating treatment in Germany will grow through 2016 and into 2017.
We do not expect what we are seeing in Germany will be representative of the uptake in other European countries. In fact, in France, where early-access programs provide the opportunity for physicians to begin treating patients with ORKAMBI prior to formal reimbursement approval, we have already seen approximately 400 of the 1,500 eligible patients initiate treatment with ORKAMBI in 2016.
We took all of this information into account when we set 2016 revenue guidance for ORKAMBI of $1.0 billion to $1.1 billion. Our guidance reflects our understanding of the ongoing U.S. launch, as I just discussed, as well as expectations that we will receive both approval for ORKAMBI in the U.S. for patients ages 6 to 11 in the second half of 2016 and certain revenues from sales of ORKAMBI outside the U.S., primarily from Germany.
Taking a longer-term view, we expect significant further growth for ORKAMBI revenues in 2017, driven primarily by patients initiating treatment following the completion of reimbursement discussions outside the U.S.
And now to KALYDECO. Today, we are increasing our financial guidance for 2016 revenues. We now expect KALYDECO net revenues of $685 million to $705 million. The prior guidance provided on January 10, 2016, was for KALYDECO net revenues of $670 million to $690 million.
We increased our KALYDECO guidance based primarily on an increasing number of patients initiating treatment with KALYDECO globally and on expectations of a reduced impact this year from the VX-661 Phase III program. Our guidance for KALYDECO excludes any potential revenues from the approval of KALYDECO, the people with residual function mutations.
I'll now hand the call over to Ian."

With the closing of the first quarter of 2016 and 9 months into the launch of ORKAMBI, we are seeing significant progress across our business. Notably, we are seeing increasing number of patients being treated with our approved medicines, resulting in a growing revenue base that we expect to drive earnings growth. 
I will now review our first quarter financial results and provide some specific comments about the long-term financial trajectory of our business.
Financial results first. In the first quarter of 2016, we reported total CF product revenues of approximately $394 million, a significant increase compared to $130 million in the first quarter of 2015. With ORKAMBI, we reported sales of $223 million for the first quarter of 2016. We have recorded approximately $574 million of ORKAMBI revenues in the first 9 months since the U.S. launch in July 2015. The first quarter KALYDECO sales of $171 million were up $41 million versus the first quarter of last year. 
Now to the operating expenses. Our first quarter non-GAAP operating expenses were $306 million compared to non-GAAP operating expenses of $246 million for 2015. The increased operating expenses were primarily due to increased costs related to the progression of our CF pipeline and to increased investments in global commercial support for the launch of ORKAMBI. Our non-GAAP net profit for the first quarter of 2016 was $22 million or $0.09 per diluted share compared to a non-GAAP net loss of $148 million or $0.62 per share for 2015.
From a balance sheet perspective, we ended the first quarter with approximately $1.03 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Vertex also has $300 million outstanding from a credit agreement, repayable by the end of the third quarter of 2017. The agreement also allows for the facility to increase to $500 million. 
Now to financial trends. Stuart provided 2016 ORKAMBI and KALYDECO revenue guidance and the assumptions that drive our projections, and therefore, I will focus my comments on the longer-term growth opportunities that may come with treating more patients with our currently approved medicines. 
We expect ORKAMBI revenues will continue to grow as we treat more patients in the U.S., achieve reimbursement outside the U.S. and expand the ORKAMBI label to younger patients. KALYDECO's growth is based on gaining reimbursement for certain groups of patients outside the U.S, including those with R117H mutation and the people ages 2 to 5 with gating mutations.
In summary, as Jeff noted earlier, approximately 27,000 people are eligible for our CF medicines, yet we are only treating approximately 1/3 of these patients. As additional patients in the U.S. start treatment and we complete reimbursement discussions outside the U.S., we expect the number of patients treated with our medicines to increase significantly and we expect revenue growth will follow. 
I will note that in 2015, we reported total CF revenues of $983 million. Based on 2016 guidance provided for ORKAMBI and KALYDECO, we anticipate the total CF revenues of approximately $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion, an approximate 75% increase over the prior year.
As our revenues grow over future years, we are committed to managing our operating expenses to drive earnings growth, and we expect to deliver financial profile as similar to many of our large cap biotech peers.
With that, I open the line to questions."

And then I'll hand over to Jeff Chodakewitz to answer the pipeline questions. So on discontinuations and compliance and what we might be able to do to improve those, much as we did with KALYDECO. We will be continuing to generate data on the long-term benefits and even broader benefits of ORKAMBI when used in the real world. And I suspect that data, if it’s compelling, may lead physicians and patients to reconsider restarting ORKAMBI. So we'll continue to develop the overall clinical profile of ORKAMBI as we have more experience in the market. In terms of compliance, really, many of the same things that we did with KALYDECO we'll be doing with ORKAMBI, and that's really providing both providers and physicians with the educational materials to be able to understand how this is a product which is treating the underlying cause of their disease and so is a product that they want to try and stay compliant with as much as they possibly can. We'll certainly be leveraging all the learnings we've had with KALYDECO, with ORKAMBI, and those programs are already in place. And lastly, to your point about -- to Germany. Clearly, one of the things we're going to be doing is transferring all of the learnings from our launch experience in the U.S. to all of the other markets that we're launching into. And that's, in many ways, the benefits of those markets coming on-stream a little bit later is that they can learn from our experiences here in the U.S. With that, I'll hand over to Jeff to answer the question on the pipeline."

So on the respiratory events, I think what I'd say there is what we're reporting today is what we're seeing in the real-world usage of ORKAMBI in the broad population. Obviously, the clinical trial population that we studied in TRAFFIC and TRANSPORT is a very controlled situation. That was patients with an FEV1 between 40 and 90. So really, whilst we try to extrapolate from the clinical trial experience to the real-world experience, that's one of the reasons -- that uncertainty is one of the reasons why we wanted to make sure we had sufficient time in market before we gave guidance. It was because we really wanted to see how the product would get used in the real world. In terms of the contribution of the various different parts of the world to our ORKAMBI revenue guidance that you might expect the vast majority of these, the revenues is going to come from here in the U.S. There will be a contribution ex U.S., but it's going to be relatively small. And then incorporated within our guidance, as we said, is also an expectation that we will see an approval in 6- to 11-year-olds in the latter part of 2016, which would give us access to an eligible population of about 2,500, and that's also incorporated within our guidance. But that approval is not anticipated until the back end of 2016."

It's -- for us, at that point in time, it was early in the launch. Yes, we've recruited a number of patients on to ORKAMBI, but it was still early in the launch to understand treatment patterns. We stated that very clearly. What we've been able to do now as we sit here, as you point out, just over 9 months into the launch, we've been able to take a significant bolus of patients. For example, 3,000 patients that initiates in the first 3 months of disapproval, and we've been able to track those 6 to 9 months. What that allows us to do was to understand compliance rates. It helped us understand discontinuation rates and also the time of discontinuation, as Stuart mentioned. That's been an important feature for us. So this was the -- we feel as though we're in this position at this point in time where we've been able to attract a substantial amount of patients over a good period of time to have the confidence to provide guidance for 2016. The comparison to KALYDECO was less relevant for us. It was more about the treatment patterns for ORKAMBI.

And we believe that really represents the correct perception that both physicians and patients have about the value of these medicines and treating the underlying cause of the disease for a long period of time. And that really underlines our thinking about the pipeline as well because as we develop this next set of medicines, including next gens and hopefully, ultimately, things like CRISPR, we're talking about progressively increasing the benefit/risk profile of our portfolio of drugs that these patients can take.

Of the ones you have, most have a time clock of 6 to 12 months. So we're really only now beginning to get to the point of patients getting to the time point when they are having to go through the reauthorization process. Having said that, the payers that have published policies or where their reauthorization criteria are known, the vast majority of them are either in line with the label or reflect the systemic benefits of ORKAMBI. And by that, I mean they recognize that this product can have benefits across multiple endpoints, and either improvements or stabilization in those endpoints qualifies as a successful outcome. So whilst we are only now beginning to get into the period of seeing those reauthorizations, I feel good about the reauthorization criteria that we've seen to date.

But as we think about the priority of capital allocation for our business, I'll just give you a broader thought, which is we're still in this transitional period of moving into profitability and cash generation and watching the revenue curve. As we go up the revenue curve and we drive revenue growth and therefore, earnings growth, which translates to cash gen -- more cash generation, we look to apply that capital to reinvest back in the business first, first, internally into our pipeline but then potentially outside of the company to diversify and expand our pipeline. And we've already done activities in that area, as you know, with CRISPR and our ENaC inhibitor. So those continue to be the priorities. It's the internal investments. It's the external investments. But as we go up that revenue growth curve and have greater capital to allocate, we will give consideration to capital strategies such as share buybacks, but at this point in time, it's a little early for us. And if we were to move into something in the near future, it would be of a smaller scale to stop the shares outstanding creep that occurs each year through option exercises."

And then third, just when you think about 70% to 80% range on compliance, which actually does move the model quite a bit, what kind of qualitatively do you think about that kind of gets you in the 70% range versus the 80% range?

In terms of the compliance trend, compliance is the metric that you need the longest period of time to measure because, clearly, this is a chronic medicine, and so in the first prescription they get, your kind of assumption is that you're 100% compliant. You have to wait until they get the second prescription to work out exactly what it is. So this is the one that really takes the longest period of time for us to get a good handle on. I don't know obviously the intricacies of your model. I'll just reiterate that, based on the trends that we've seen to date and the experience we've got with the patients who have been treated to date, our expectation for the year and the assumption on which our guidance is built is that it'll be somewhere between 70% and 80% for ORKAMBI this year. In terms of the 1- or 3-month script, the vast majority are written for 1 month. There are some 3-month prescriptions written, but the vast majority of prescriptions are written for -- on a monthly basis. And in terms of kind of qualitatively, what would lead you to one end versus the other, to me, this is all about education and our ability to help providers to give to their patients information, which educates them on the nature of the disease, the underlying defects, the fact that ORKAMBI is designed to treat those underlying defects, and to the extent they believe in the science, believe in the long-term benefits that ORKAMBI can provide to them, then I think that's only likely to lead to patients having a higher compliance rate. We're very focused on that. We're certainly taking all the learnings we can from our experience with KALYDECO to support patients to take the prescriptions in line with their physician's recommendations."

This is Jeff Leiden. Thanks for the question. I think, as you know, right -- if you look today, CRISPR is most amenable to actually inactivate, which is making cleavages, because that's what it does most efficiently, and obviously, that's not what we would want to do in a Delta 508 case. Then, you move to making corrections, and then you move to more complex deletions and insertions. So there's no doubt that there are still challenges to conquer both in terms of how we correct deletions like in Delta 508 but also how we deliver this because, obviously, this has to be delivered efficiently to large numbers of cells in the lungs, and we don't know how to do that yet. So that's why we said, while we think CRISPR is an incredibly powerful technology for the future, it's going to take a number of years to conquer both the -- some of the editing challenges but also, in particular, the delivery challenges, and that's what we're working on in CF. Now we're also -- I'll just remind you that CRISPR-Cas9 collaboration, we have rights to several targets, fixed targets, and some of those will be in other diseases where some of these issues, like delivery and editing, are much more straightforward. So I think you can expect to hear from us over the next couple of years on our progress in some of those other diseases."

First of all, thank you for your questions, thanks for your patience. I know it was a long call, but we do want to give you not only our guidance but a detailed rationale for the guidance so that you understand our model. And we appreciate your questions on that.
As I look at our progress as a company over the last year, I guess I would call out 3 things that I think are important. First, the continuous increase in the number of patients that we can treat and actually fairly dramatic increase in the number of patients that we can treat with KALYDECO and ORKAMBI; and as we look forward, the increasing number of patients that we can treat with today's approval. So as I mentioned, 27,000 eligible, we're still only treating 1/3 of those, and I think we have a clear path to get to the majority of those patients both in the U.S. and Europe over '16 and '17 and beyond.
Second thing I would say is the pipeline progression. We're pleased with 661 progressing well into Phase III of multiple trials and multiple patient populations but equally important, we have the next-gen correctors, which are progressing through Phase I with our -- and still on a time line to get into patients as triple combinations later this year. We think that's going to be very important both for the patients we treat and potentially for additional subsets of patients.
And then finally, the progression of the science. We didn't talk about that a lot today, but the science of CF, I think, has progressed significantly, and we have a much better understanding of the folding and correction process. And the science that David Altshuler is driving and the rest of research group in some of the new diseases, we touched on those a little bit with CRISPR-Cas9 but also others that I hope we will be able to have a chance to talk to you about over the rest of '16 and '17. It's an important long-term growth engine for the company.
So with that, maybe I'll close the call, and thanks again for joining us."

Good evening, everyone. It was just over 1 year ago that we received FDA approval for ORKAMBI, marking the most significant step to date in our journey to develop new medicines for people with cystic fibrosis. Tonight, I'm pleased to repo",1091,"Thanks, Michael. Good evening, everyone. It was just over 1 year ago that we received FDA approval for ORKAMBI, marking the most significant step to date in our journey to develop new medicines for people with cystic fibrosis. Tonight, I'm pleased to report on our significant and steady progress in CF, and I'll review 3 key phases in our efforts to bring all people with CF a medicine to treat the underlying cause of their disease. If we're successful in these efforts, we believe significant and sustained revenue and earnings growth will follow.
Today, there are approximately 27,000 people eligible for treatment with ORKAMBI or KALYDECO. However, we're only treating approximately 9,000 or 1/3 of these patients. The first and most significant near-term step to increase the number of eligible patients being treated for their medicines is to gain reimbursement of ORKAMBI in key European and other countries. Progress with reimbursement for ORKAMBI will enable the vast majority of currently eligible patients to be treated with one of our CF medicines. 
The second step to treat more people with CF is to further expand the labels for both ORKAMBI and KALYDECO, which could increase the total number of eligible patients from 27,000 to approximately 44,000. And the third step is to potentially treat all people with CF with new combinations of CFTR modulators as well as other approaches to treatment such as ENaC inhibition, gene editing and mRNA therapies.
First, the reimbursement for ORKAMBI. Outside the U.S., the reimbursement process is ongoing, and these discussions are progressing as anticipated across Europe, Canada and Australia. We are encouraged that many reimbursement authorities have acknowledged the significant clinical benefits that ORKAMBI provides. We believe that we will achieve reimbursement from European and other government payers just as we've seen in the U.S. We look forward to updating you as we obtain reimbursement in key countries going forward.
Second, to our label expansion efforts for both ORKAMBI and KALYDECO. Specific leaders some [ph] 12,000 additional patients younger than age 12 with 2 copies of the Delta F508 mutation whom we believe could be helped by ORKAMBI. In the second quarter, the FDA accepted for review our supplemental new drug application for the use of ORKAMBI in children ages 6 to 11 and granted our request for priority review, setting a target review date or PDUFA date September 30, 2016. If approved, we expect to be ready to bring ORKAMBI to these patients immediately following approval. 
In parallel, we're also progressing with our efforts to bring ORKAMBI to children ages 6 to 11 in Europe where we plan to submit our application for approval in the first half of next year, following the conclusion of our fully enrolled Phase III efficacy and safety study in this group of patients. We estimate that there are approximately 2,400 children ages 6 to 11 in the U.S. and 3,400 in Europe who would be eligible for ORKAMBI.
There are approximately 5,000 additional patients in North America, Europe and Australia, largely those with residual function mutations who could be helped by KALYDECO. While we received the complete response letter from the FDA earlier this year regarding our application for approval of KALYDECO in people with CF ages 2 and older who have 1 of 23 residual function mutations, our belief that KALYDECO would be beneficial to these patients is unchanged, and we continue to pursue FDA approval for these patients as was possible. There are approximately 1,500 people with CF in the U.S. who have the mutations included in our residual function sNDA. 
And third, our expanding pipeline of investigational CF medicines. Most advanced pipeline program in CF is our broad Phase III program for VX-661 in combination with ivacaftor. VX-661 plus ivacaftor may have an improved benefit risk profile compared to ORKAMBI and people with 2 copies of the Delta F508 mutation and may provide enhanced clinical benefits over ivacaftor monotherapy for other patients with gating mutations. Enrollment in the study of VX-661 plus ivacaftor in people ages 12 and older with 2 copies of the Delta F508 mutation is expected to complete in August. Data from the 6-month study are expected in the first half of 2017. The other 3 Phase III studies of VX-661 are also progressing as planned. We plan to submit a new drug application to the U.S. FDA for VX-661 in combination with ivacaftor in the second half of 2017.
Importantly, VX-661 is also positioned to play a key role in the triple-combination regimen with the next generation corrector and ivacaftor. We believe that this triple combination approach may allow us to treat an additional large group of patients, specifically those with one Delta F508 mutation and one mutation that results in minimal CFTR function. These patients do not currently have medicines to treat the cause of their disease.
Our 2 next-generation correctors, VX-152 and VX-440, are being evaluated in Phase I studies in healthy volunteers. Spending data from these studies, we expect to move into Phase II clinical development in the second half of 2016 in people with CF. These studies would evaluate 1 or both of our next generation corrector is with VX-661 and ivacaftor. Beyond the CFTR modulators, we entered into multiple strategic collaborations that broaden our ability to evaluate additional approaches to CF treatment that may be complementary to the CFTR modulation in the future. While the underlying technology and science of each approach differs, the collaborations have a shared goal to develop the best possible future treatments for all people with CF. Earlier this month, we entered into a collaboration with Therapeutics aimed at using messenger RNA to potentially enable cells in the lungs of people with CF to produce functional CF care protein. This is the second platform technology collaboration we have entered into following our agreement with CRISPR Therapeutics focused on the use of CRISPR-Cas9 for gene editing that we began in late 2015. These platform technologies add to our development stage collaboration with Sciences use of ENaC inhibition to treat CF.
As we ended the second half of 2016, I'm pleased with both the near- and long-term growth opportunities for our business. Our goal is to consistently discover and deliver conservative new medicines for patients and to reinvest in scientific opportunities to create future medicines. We believe our business model, which is focused on significant investment to create value through innovation for research and development, will position us to achieve this goal over the coming years.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Ian."

Through the second quarter of the year, we created a great revenue base with ORKAMBI and KALYDECO, which we expect to drive future earnings growth. Tonight, I'll discuss our second quarter revenues for ORKAMBI and KALYDEC",681,"Thanks, Jeff and hello, everyone. Through the second quarter of the year, we created a great revenue base with ORKAMBI and KALYDECO, which we expect to drive future earnings growth. Tonight, I'll discuss our second quarter revenues for ORKAMBI and KALYDECO, review our 2016 financial guidance and discuss our anticipated financial trajectory for the coming years.
In the second quarter of 2016, we reported total CF product revenues of approximately $426 million, a significant increase compared to $155 million for the second quarter of last year. 
Turning to the revenues for each of our CF medicines. Global sales of ORKAMBI in the second quarter were $245 million, comprised of U.S. sales of approximately $229 million and ex U.S. sales of approximately $16 million, which were mainly from Germany. As of June 30, approximately 6,000 patients have initiated treatment with ORKAMBI in the U.S. Outside the U.S., ORKAMBI is already available commercially in Germany and also through early access programs in France. In Germany, uptake continues to be slower than we observed in the U.S as of June 30, approximately 380 of the 2,500 eligible patients in Germany had initiated treatment. In contrast, in France, we continue to see strong and rapid uptake. Approximately 700 of 1500 eligible patients in France have already initiated treatment with ORKAMBI as of June 30 as part of the country's early access programs. These programs provided the opportunity for physicians in France to begin treating patients prior to their formal reimbursement approval. We are pleased the ORKAMBI launch has continued to progress consistent with what we discussed on our first quarter call. And today, we are reiterating our expectation for 2016 ORKAMBI revenues of $1 billion to $1.1 billion. Given the slower-than-expected launch in Germany and that we are approaching peak penetration for ORKAMBI in patients aged 12 and older in the U.S., we expect the further revenue growth for ORKAMBI will occur primarily in the fourth quarter following the potential approval and launch ORKAMBI for children ages 6 to 11.
Now to KALYDECO. Second quarter KALYDECO sales were $180 million, up $25 million compared to the second quarter of last year. We continue to see small number of additional eligible patients beginning treatment in the U.S. and Europe. As with ORKAMBI, we are reiterating our 2016 revenue guidance for KALYDECO of $685 million to $705 million. Our 2016 guidance exclude any potential revenues for the approval of KALYDECO in residual function mutations where we continue to pursue the FDA approval for patients ages 2 and older in the U.S.
Now to the operating expenses. Our second quarter non-GAAP operating expenses were $306 million compared to non-GAAP operating expenses of $254 million in 2015. The increased operating expenses were mainly due to increased cost related to the progression of our CF pipeline and to increase investment in global commercial support for the launch of ORKAMBI. Our non-GAAP net profit for the second quarter of 2016 was $58 million or $0.24 per diluted share as compared to a non-GAAP net loss of $131 million or $0.54 per share for 2015. From a balance sheet perspective, we ended the second quarter with approximately $1.07 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Vertex also has $300 million outstanding from a credit agreement repayable by the end of the third quarter 2017.
I'll conclude tonight's call with a few brief comments and financial trends, including revenue and earnings growth. Our goal is to discover and develop new medicines for all people with CF. And as Jeff has discussed, there are 3 important phases to support these efforts: obtaining reimbursement for ORKAMBI outside the U.S; expanding labels to both ORKAMBI and KALYDECO; and developing new medicines to treat potentially all people with CF. As we progress towards this goal, significant and sustainable revenue growth will follow. Importantly, as our revenues grow over future years, we are committed to managing our operating expenses to drive earnings growth. And we expect to deliver a financial profile similar to many of our large biotech peers. With that, I open the line to questions."

Just to remind you persistence, we said that our expectation was it would track towards about 70% to 80%, between 70% and 80% by the end of this year, and the same for compliance, and we continue to believe in those estimates and those estimates are what underpins our revenue guidance that we reiterated today. In terms of Europe and as you noted, Germany is relatively slow, and he mentioned that prepared remarks incorporated within our guidance really were only expecting significant contributions ex- U.S. from Germany. In terms of how we see things playing out in the rest of Europe really -- as you know that's very dependent on proceeding country by country reimbursement negotiation process what I can tell you, those are progressing as we planned, as expected. But given our learnings and the analogy to KALYDECO and the time it took there, we're really anticipating to conclude many of those reimbursement negotiations until 2017. Having said that, we recently concluded our first formal reimbursement negotiation in Australia and how it's going into effect from September 1, but we continue to believe that most of the major markets were not likely to see any major contributors -- contributions in terms of revenue growth until 2017 and beyond."

Way, that excludes primarily stock compensation. And as we look into next year, we actually we hope expect the programs to progress. And as we look into next year as we think about OpEx more broadly, we see maybe some marginal increases in marketing investments for the launch of ORKAMBI more broadly and particularly, in Europe as we have reimbursement approval. And as we look at the development investment, maybe there's -- it's more consistent 2015 to 2016 as program cycle in and out towards the expectation that the 661 program comes to closure, and we're refiling next year, and the progression of the triple into a larger Phase II study.

I think on a long-term data perspective, we think that many meaningful to patients and to prescribers, and I think the reason for that are several fold. As you know, that information really has a couple of chunks to it. One is about the long-term safety of the drug, very important. And that continues to look very favorable consistent with what we have seen before, and then we had several efficacy kind of measures. Some of that came from the study itself. Our following patients for a long time we saw that there SVG ones where they maintained their BMI, continued to improve. And although there's no active comparison there, the great in terms of pulmonary really remained low and consistent with what we saw during the trials. So that was all very impactful, we think, for physicians and for patients. The other thing we did was take the information from a mass cohort of historical patients, and what that allows you to do over that kind of time frame is to compare the rate of decline of patients on our study versus what we think the historical expectation would be, and that's really -- as we did with KALYDECO helps us understand if we're shifting that curve and slowing the rate of decline, really modifying the disease. And we were very pleased to see that approximately 40% reduction in the rate of decline. So overall, we think that data is very impactful and useful. In terms of triple combination, really can't give you a lot of details, as Jeff Leiden said actually already, that both drugs do continue in the Phase 1 studies, and our expectation of core spending data is to have one or both of those in the second half of this year."

In terms of what we might anticipate for access to answer the first part of your question, my expectation is that access is going to be very good for ORKAMBI when we first introduced it for the 12 and over population. And in some ways, this is a somewhat simpler review for the payers. It's a labeled extension just extending it down to a younger age. And so my expectation is that we'll secure broad access very quickly. In terms of [indiscernible] similarly, I wouldn't anticipate the demand to be robust just as it was for 12 plus. And in terms of persistence and compliance. Again, it's difficult to say exactly how it's going to play out in the real word as opposite we saw in the clinical trial. Certainly, a couple of things that I think give us some encouragement we certainly saw in the study we did that forms the basis of our application and the adverse event rate and particularly the rates of events much lower and patients discontinued adverse event but as you know that's been one of the primary reasons for discontinuation on ORKAMBI the 12 and over population and then again could help us the 6 to 11 population with KALYDECO we do see compliance rates being much higher in the younger population not surprisingly as they tend to be very heavily managed by their parents and so why we don't know exactly how it's going to play out in the real-world. I certainly expect the access to be very good, and I also expect the uptake to be very rapid as well."

But as Ian said in his prepared remarks in terms of U.S. growth, obviously, the next phase in growth in the U.S. is likely from the approval and 6 to 11, which we hope will come in the next couple of months. So moving on for how things are panning out in Europe. And you're right, there is a contrast in uptake between Germany and France. Germany is slower than we anticipated. And much of that I attribute to the fact that the German market is all fragmented than many of the other markets that we operate in. What I mean by that is anymore sensors treating patients and as a result, they have less experience with CFTR modulators, and the educational need is higher there. And also, we did see a slightly slower uptake of KALYDECO in Germany than we saw other EU markets. In contrast with France where 2 access programs, we have 700 patients have already been initiated in ORKAMBI, and that update in 6 months is much more U.S.-like. So based on that, based on the other research we've done, we do anticipate that Germany is more likely to be an outlier in terms of uptake, although I continue to believe that we will get the vast majority of patients in Germany over time. And in terms of rates of uptake, I would expect it to be more like France in the rest of Europe pending reimbursement that we've seen in Germany, which I continue to believe this likely to be more of the outlier based on our previous experience with KALYDECO and experience with ORKAMBI."

First of all, as we indicated for the homozygous study, we have a lot of confidence in that finishing enrollment in August. In fact, we've actually already stopped screening patients for that study, so it's just the last patients completing the screening process and if they qualify going into the trial. We've already talked about the timing of the study in patients and the futility analysis that's going to be done. We expect that next trial that's going to be completed will be the study in patients with 508 or [indiscernible] residual function As we indicated, we expect that to complete in the second half of this year, very much as we've indicated earlier this year, really right on track. And then the last study with 508 [indiscernible] again as we've indicated previously we think in the second half of this year or early next year and as we get that will allow it to evaluate our best submission strategy and final pending data in the second half of 17. In terms of the long-term data, I want to be sure that I understand your question. We do think that the results from that long-term data are quite compelling. You asked specifically about pulmonary exacerbation, and so we do look at what basically we use in assessment of how many events are happening for the patients that we're following and think about it as and what we do see is that as you've gone out further in time, that remains quite well compared to what we had as our initial comparison. We think that is quite meaningful to patients and physicians. And actually, that linked up with the other information like body weight and particularly, the slow [indiscernible] evidence of disease modification. We think that is driving considerations like starting therapy earlier and considering whether patients who discontinue may want to think about restarting therapy."

Good evening, everyone. It was just over 1 year ago that we received FDA approval for ORKAMBI, marking the most significant step to date in our journey to develop new medicines for people with cystic fibrosis. Tonight, I'm pleased to repo",1092,"Thanks, Michael. Good evening, everyone. It was just over 1 year ago that we received FDA approval for ORKAMBI, marking the most significant step to date in our journey to develop new medicines for people with cystic fibrosis. Tonight, I'm pleased to report on our significant and steady progress in CF, and I'll review 3 key phases in our efforts to bring all people with CF a medicine to treat the underlying cause of their disease. If we're successful in these efforts, we believe significant and sustained revenue and earnings growth will follow.
Today, there are approximately 27,000 people eligible for treatment with ORKAMBI or KALYDECO. However, we're only treating approximately 9,000 or 1/3 of these patients. The first and most significant near-term step to increase the number of eligible patients being treated for their medicines is to gain reimbursement of ORKAMBI in key European and other countries. Progress with reimbursement for ORKAMBI would enable the vast majority of currently eligible patients to be treated with one of our CF medicines. 
The second step to treat more people with CF is to further expand the labels for both ORKAMBI and KALYDECO, which could increase the total number of eligible patients from 27,000 to approximately 44,000. And the third step is to potentially treat all people with CF with new combinations of CFTR modulators as well as other approaches to treatments such as ENaC inhibition, gene editing and mRNA therapies.
First, the reimbursement for ORKAMBI. Outside the U.S., the reimbursement process is ongoing, and these discussions are progressing as anticipated across Europe, Canada and Australia. We're encouraged that many reimbursement authorities have acknowledged the significant clinical benefits that ORKAMBI provides. We believe that we will achieve reimbursement from European and other government payers just as we've seen in the U.S. We look forward to updating you as we obtain reimbursement in key countries going forward.
Second, to our label expansion efforts for both ORKAMBI and KALYDECO. Specifically, there's some 12,000 additional patients younger than age 12 with 2 copies of the Delta F508 mutation whom we believe could be helped by ORKAMBI. In the second quarter, the FDA accepted for review our supplemental new drug application for the use of ORKAMBI in children ages 6 to 11, and granted our request for priority review, setting a target review date or PDUFA date September 30, 2016. If approved, we expect to be ready to bring ORKAMBI to these patients immediately following approval. 
In parallel, we're also progressing with our efforts to bring ORKAMBI to children ages 6 to 11 in Europe where we plan to submit our application for approval in the first half of next year, following the conclusion of our fully enrolled Phase III efficacy and safety study in this group of patients. We estimate that there are approximately 2,400 children ages 6 to 11 in the U.S., and 3,400 in Europe who would be eligible for ORKAMBI.
There are approximately 5,000 additional patients in North America, Europe and Australia, largely those with residual function mutations who could be helped by KALYDECO. While we received the complete response letter from the FDA earlier this year regarding our application for approval of KALYDECO in people with CF ages 2 and older who have 1 of 23 residual function mutations, our belief that KALYDECO would be beneficial to these patients is unchanged, and we continue to pursue FDA approval for these patients as soon as possible. There are approximately 1,500 people with CF in the U.S. who have the mutations included in our residual function sNDA. 
And third, to our expanding pipeline of investigational CF medicine. The most advanced pipeline program in CF is our broad Phase III program for VX-661 in combination with ivacaftor. VX-661 plus ivacaftor may have an improved benefit risk profile compared to ORKAMBI in people with 2 copies of the Delta F508 mutation and may provide enhanced clinical benefits over ivacaftor monotherapy for other patients with gating mutations. Enrollment in the study of VX-661 plus ivacaftor in people ages 12 and older with 2 copies of the Delta F508 mutation is expected to complete in August. Data from the 6-month study are expected in the first half of 2017. The other 3 Phase III studies of VX-661 are also progressing as planned. We plan to submit a new drug application to the U.S. FDA for VX-661 in combination with ivacaftor in the second half of 2017.
Importantly, VX-661 is also positioned to play a key role in a triple-combination regimen with a next-generation corrector and ivacaftor. We believe that this triple combination approach may allow us to treat an additional large group of patients, specifically those with one Delta F508 mutation and one mutation that results in minimal CFTR function. These patients do not currently have medicines to treat the cause of their disease.
Our 2 next-generation correctors, VX-152 and VX-440, are being evaluated in Phase I studies in healthy volunteers. Pending data from these studies, we expect to move into Phase II clinical development in the second half of 2016 in people with CF. These studies would evaluate 1 or both of our next generation correctors with VX-661 and ivacaftor. 
Beyond our CFTR modulators, we've entered into multiple strategic collaborations that broaden our ability to evaluate additional approaches to CF treatment that may be complementary to CFTR modulation in the future. While the underlying technology and science of each approach differs, the collaborations have a shared goal to develop the best possible future treatments for all people with CF. Earlier this month, we entered into a collaboration with Moderna Therapeutics aimed at using messenger RNA to potentially enable cells in the lungs of people with CF to produce functional CFTR protein. This is the second platform technology collaboration we have entered into, following our agreement with CRISPR Therapeutics focused on the use of CRISPR-Cas9 for gene editing that we began in late 2015. These platform technologies add to our development stage collaboration with Parion Sciences focused on the use of ENaC inhibition to treat CF.
As we ended the second half of 2016, I'm pleased with both the near and long-term growth opportunities for our business. Our goal is to consistently discover and deliver transformative new medicines for patients and to reinvest in scientific opportunities to create future medicines. We believe our business model, which is focused on significant investment to create value through innovation, research and development, will position us to achieve this goal over the coming years.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Ian."

Tonight, I'll discuss our second quarter revenues for ORKAMBI and K",683,"Thanks, Jeff, and hello, everyone. Through the second quarter of the year, we've created a growing revenue base with ORKAMBI and KALYDECO, which we expect to drive future earnings growth. Tonight, I'll discuss our second quarter revenues for ORKAMBI and KALYDECO, review our 2016 financial guidance and discuss our anticipated financial trajectory for the coming years.
In the second quarter of 2016, we reported total CF product revenues of approximately $426 million, a significant increase compared to $155 million for the second quarter of last year. 
Turning to the revenues for each of our CF medicines. Global sales of ORKAMBI in the second quarter were $245 million, comprised of U.S. sales of approximately $229 million, and ex-U.S. sales of approximately $16 million, which were mainly from Germany. As of June 30, approximately 6,000 patients have initiated treatment with ORKAMBI in the U.S. Outside the U.S., ORKAMBI is already available commercially in Germany, and also through early access programs in France. In Germany, uptake continues to be slower than we observed in the U.S. As of June 30, approximately 380 of the 2,500 eligible patients in Germany had initiated treatment. 
In contrast, in France, we continue to see strong and rapid uptake. Approximately 700 of 1,500 eligible patients in France have already initiated treatment with ORKAMBI as of June 30 as part of the country's early access programs. These programs provided the opportunity for physicians in France to begin treating patients prior to their formal reimbursement approval. We are pleased the ORKAMBI launch has continued to progress consistent with what we discussed on our first quarter call. And today, we are reiterating our expectation for 2016 ORKAMBI revenues of $1 billion to $1.1 billion. 
Given the slower than expected launch in Germany and that we are approaching peak penetration for ORKAMBI in patients aged 12 and older in the U.S., we expect that revenue growth for ORKAMBI will occur primarily in the fourth quarter, following the potential approval and launch of ORKAMBI for children ages 6 to 11.
Now to KALYDECO. Second quarter KALYDECO sales were $180 million, up $25 million compared to the second quarter of last year. We continue to see small number of additional eligible patients beginning treatment in the U.S. and Europe. As with ORKAMBI, we are reiterating our 2016 revenue guidance for KALYDECO of $685 million to $705 million. Our 2016 guidance exclude any potential revenues for the approval of KALYDECO in residual function mutations where we continue to pursue the FDA approval for patients ages 2 and older in the U.S.
Now to the operating expenses. Our second quarter non-GAAP operating expenses were $306 million compared to non-GAAP operating expenses of $254 million in 2015. The increased operating expenses were mainly due to increased costs related to the progression of our CF pipeline and to increase investment in global commercial support for the launch of ORKAMBI. Our non-GAAP net profit for the second quarter of 2016 was $58 million or $0.24 per diluted share as compared to a non-GAAP net loss of $131 million or $0.54 per share for 2015. 
From a balance sheet perspective, we ended the second quarter with approximately $1.07 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Vertex also has $300 million outstanding from a credit agreement repayable by the end of the third quarter 2017.
I'll conclude tonight's call with a few brief comments on financial trends, including revenue and earnings growth. Our goal is to discover and develop new medicines for all people with CF. And as Jeff has discussed, there are 3 important phases to support these efforts: obtaining reimbursement for ORKAMBI outside the U.S.; expanding labels for both ORKAMBI and KALYDECO; and developing new medicines to treat potentially all people with CF. As we progress towards this goal, significant and sustainable revenue growth will follow. Importantly, as our revenues grow over future years, we are committed to managing our operating expenses to drive earnings growth. And we expect to deliver a financial profile similar to many of our large cap biotech peers. 
With that, I open the line to questions."

In fact, all the trends really in initiations, persistence and compliance are entirely in line with what we said then. Just to remind you and others on the phone, for persistence, we said that our expectation was it would track towards about 70% to 80%, between 70% and 80% by the end of this year, and the same for compliance, and we continue to believe in those estimates, and those estimates are what underpins our revenue guidance that we reiterated today. In terms of Europe, and as you noted, Germany's uptake is relatively slow, and Ian mentioned that in his prepared remarks. Incorporated within our guidance, really, we're only expecting significant contributions ex-U.S. from Germany. In terms of how we see things playing out in the rest of Europe, really, as you know, that's going to be very dependent on us proceeding through country by country reimbursement negotiation processes. And what I can tell you is that those are progressing as we planned, as expected. But given our learnings and the analogy to KALYDECO and the time it took there, we're really not anticipating to conclude many of those reimbursement negotiations until 2017. Having said that, we recently concluded our first formal reimbursement negotiation in Austria, and that will go into effect from September 1, but we continue to believe that most of the major markets were not likely to see any major contributors -- contributions in terms of revenue growth until 2017 and beyond."

We always plan and provide guidance based on assuming success and that's why we're investing behind the programs. So our OpEx guidance for the year is at $1.18 billion to $1.23 billion, and we reiterated that number in the press release tonight. And that's a non-GAAP number, by the way. Excludes primarily stock compensation. And then, as we look into next year, we actually -- we hope and expect the programs to progress. And as we look into next year, as we think about OpEx more broadly, we see maybe some marginal increases in marketing investments for the launch of ORKAMBI more broadly, and particularly in Europe as we get reimbursement approval. And as we look at the development investment, maybe there's -- it's more consistent with 2015 to 2016 as programs cycle in and out with the expectation that the 661 Phase III program comes to closure, and we're refiling next year, and the progression of the triple into a larger Phase II study.

I think, from a long-term data perspective, we think that is very meaningful to patients and to prescribers. And I think, the reason for that are several fold. As you know, that information really has a couple of chunks to it. One is about the long-term safety of the drug, which is very important. And that continues to look very favorable, consistent with what we have seen before. And then, we had several for efficacy kind of measure. Some of that came from the study itself, our following patients for a long time and we saw that their FEV1s where maintained, their BMI continued to improve. And although there's no active comparison there, the event rate in terms of pulmonary exacerbation really remained low and consistent with what we saw during the trials. So that was all very impactful, we think, for physicians and for patients. The other thing we did was take the information from a mass cohort of historical patients, and what that allows you to do over that kind of time frame is to compare the rate of decline of patients' FEV1s who were on our study versus what we think the historical expectation would be, and that really then, as we did with KALYDECO, helps us understand if we're shifting that curve and slowing the rate of decline, really modifying the disease. And we were very pleased to see that approximately 40% reduction in the rate of decline. So overall, we think that data is very impactful and useful. In terms of triple combination, really can't give you a lot of details, as Jeff Leiden said actually already, that, that -- both drugs do continue in Phase 1 studies, and our expectation, of course, pending data, is that one or both of those will start in patients in the second half of this year."

Obviously, we're deep into the planning for that launch because it's only just a couple of months away. In terms of what we might anticipate for access, to answer the first part of your question, my expectation is that access is going to be very good, just as it was for ORKAMBI when we first introduced it for the 12 and over population. And in some ways, this is a somewhat simpler review for the payers. It's a labeled extension just extending it down to a younger age. And so my expectation is that we'll secure broad access very quickly. In terms of rate of uptake, similarly, I would anticipate the demand to be robust, just as it was for 12 plus. And in terms of persistence and compliance, again, it's difficult to say exactly how it's going to play out in the real world as opposed to what we saw in the clinical trial setting. Certainly, a couple of things that I think give us some encouragement, we certainly saw in the study that we did that forms the basis of our application that the adverse event rate and particularly the rate of respiratory adverse events was much lower and none of the patients discontinued for that adverse event, and as you know, that's been one of the primary reasons for discontinuations on ORKAMBI in the 12 and over population. And then, again, one thing could help us, the 6 to 11 population, certainly with KALYDECO, we do tend to see compliance rates being much higher in the younger population, not surprisingly, as they tend to be very heavily managed by their parents. And so whilst I don't know exactly how it's going to play out in the real world, I certainly expect access to be very good and us to secure that quickly, and I'd also expect the uptake to be very rapid as well."

The data sources are not quite as robust as we have here in the U.S. in terms of tracking at a non-biased level individual patient data in Europe. And I would say, at this relatively early stage, the persistence rates are certainly in line in the same kind of ballpark as we saw with ORKAMBI here in the U.S. As that data matures over time, we'll be able to give you kind of more detail on exactly how it's playing out, but at the minute, the data is relatively immature.

So moving on to how things are panning out in Europe, and you're right, there is a contrast in uptake between Germany and France. Germany is slower than we anticipated. And much of that I attribute to the fact that the German market is more fragmented than many of the other markets that we operate in. What I mean by that is there's many more centers treating CF patients, and as a result, they've had less experience with CFTR modulators, and therefore, the kind of the educational need is higher there. And also, we did see a slightly slower uptake for KALYDECO in Germany than we saw in other EU markets. Contrast with France where through early access programs, we have 700 patients have already been initiated on ORKAMBI, and that uptake in 6 months is much more U.S.-like. So based on that, based on all the other research we've done, we do anticipate that Germany is more likely to be an outlier in terms of rate of uptake, although I continue to believe that we will get to the vast majority of patients in Germany over time. And in terms of rate of uptake, I would expect it to be more like France in the rest of Europe, pending reimbursements than we've seen in Germany, which I continue to believe is likely to be more of the outlier based on our previous experience with KALYDECO and comparing to experience with ORKAMBI."

We continue to see more initiations, and we continue to believe, as we did at the end of Q1, that the persistence rate of that patient population is going to be somewhere in the 70% to 80% range, as indeed, we believe the compliance rate will be somewhere in the 70% to 80% range. And so that's the -- what we believe at the end of Q1, we continue to perform against those expectations, and that is in the 12 and above -- in 12 and above patients in the U.S. is what underlies our revenue guidance that we reiterated today. So in terms of pricing, clearly, that's a very hot topic across the industry. We continue to believe that we are developing very high value medicines, medicines that treat the underlying cause of what is a horrible life-shortening disease. It's for a very small patient population, and we believe, and I think that's reinforced by the discussions we've had with governments through the reimbursement of KALYDECO and the ongoing discussions we're having with ORKAMBI, this is exactly the sort of medicine that they want to be able to provide to their patient population, so whilst there will be pricing pressures because of the overall macroeconomics on every pharma and biotech company, I continue to believe that sort of agents we are bringing to bear are the sorts of products that governments are going to want to pay for."

And in my remarks, I did comment that, that launch in France is going very well and that we're accessing a lot of patients. We do get a payment for that drug that might be similar to how the ultimate price of the drug plays out in France. However, from a GAAP perspective, we are unable to report those, let's say, access to those medicine as revenue until we have an agreed price in France. So I appreciate your question. We'd anticipate that, that would be a 2017 event. At this point, if we do get approval on price, which provides uncertainty to recording those revenues, we actually record the revenues as long, big catch-up. So as we've been selling drug since, let's say, January 1, 2016, all the way through to the point of reimbursement approval, we will record that cash that we will have ultimately have received as part of revenues in the quarter that we received reimbursement approval, and we do think that would be a 2017 event."

In terms of the long-term data, I want to be sure that I understand your question. We do think that the results from that long-term data are quite compelling. You asked specifically about pulmonary exacerbations, and so we do look at what basically we use in assessment of how many events are happening for the patients that we're following and think about it as an event rate, and what we do see is that as we've gone out further in time, that remains quite low compared to what we had as our initial comparison. We think that is quite meaningful to patients and physicians. And actually, that's linked up with the other information like body weight and particularly the change in [indiscernible] FEV1 evidence of disease modification, we think that is driving considerations like starting therapy earlier and considering whether patients who discontinued may want to think about restarting therapy."

Good evening, everyone. It was just over 1 year ago that we received FDA approval for ORKAMBI, marking the most significant step to date in our journey to develop new medicines for people with cystic fibrosis. Tonight, I'm pleased to repo",1092,"Thanks, Michael. Good evening, everyone. It was just over 1 year ago that we received FDA approval for ORKAMBI, marking the most significant step to date in our journey to develop new medicines for people with cystic fibrosis. Tonight, I'm pleased to report on our significant and steady progress in CF, and I'll review 3 key phases in our efforts to bring all people with CF a medicine to treat the underlying cause of their disease. If we're successful in these efforts, we believe significant and sustained revenue and earnings growth will follow.
Today, there are approximately 27,000 people eligible for treatment with ORKAMBI or KALYDECO. However, we're only treating approximately 9,000 or 1/3 of these patients. The first and most significant near-term step to increase the number of eligible patients being treated for their medicines is to gain reimbursement of ORKAMBI in key European and other countries. Progress with reimbursement for ORKAMBI would enable the vast majority of currently eligible patients to be treated with one of our CF medicines. 
The second step to treat more people with CF is to further expand the labels for both ORKAMBI and KALYDECO, which could increase the total number of eligible patients from 27,000 to approximately 44,000. And the third step is to potentially treat all people with CF with new combinations of CFTR modulators as well as other approaches to treatments such as ENaC inhibition, gene editing and mRNA therapies.
First, the reimbursement for ORKAMBI. Outside the U.S., the reimbursement process is ongoing, and these discussions are progressing as anticipated across Europe, Canada and Australia. We're encouraged that many reimbursement authorities have acknowledged the significant clinical benefits that ORKAMBI provides. We believe that we will achieve reimbursement from European and other government payers just as we've seen in the U.S. We look forward to updating you as we obtain reimbursement in key countries going forward.
Second, to our label expansion efforts for both ORKAMBI and KALYDECO. Specifically, there's some 12,000 additional patients younger than age 12 with 2 copies of the Delta F508 mutation whom we believe could be helped by ORKAMBI. In the second quarter, the FDA accepted for review our supplemental new drug application for the use of ORKAMBI in children ages 6 to 11, and granted our request for priority review, setting a target review date or PDUFA date September 30, 2016. If approved, we expect to be ready to bring ORKAMBI to these patients immediately following approval. 
In parallel, we're also progressing with our efforts to bring ORKAMBI to children ages 6 to 11 in Europe where we plan to submit our application for approval in the first half of next year, following the conclusion of our fully enrolled Phase III efficacy and safety study in this group of patients. We estimate that there are approximately 2,400 children ages 6 to 11 in the U.S., and 3,400 in Europe who would be eligible for ORKAMBI.
There are approximately 5,000 additional patients in North America, Europe and Australia, largely those with residual function mutations who could be helped by KALYDECO. While we received the complete response letter from the FDA earlier this year regarding our application for approval of KALYDECO in people with CF ages 2 and older who have 1 of 23 residual function mutations, our belief that KALYDECO would be beneficial to these patients is unchanged, and we continue to pursue FDA approval for these patients as soon as possible. There are approximately 1,500 people with CF in the U.S. who have the mutations included in our residual function sNDA. 
And third, to our expanding pipeline of investigational CF medicine. The most advanced pipeline program in CF is our broad Phase III program for VX-661 in combination with ivacaftor. VX-661 plus ivacaftor may have an improved benefit risk profile compared to ORKAMBI in people with 2 copies of the Delta F508 mutation and may provide enhanced clinical benefits over ivacaftor monotherapy for other patients with gating mutations. Enrollment in the study of VX-661 plus ivacaftor in people ages 12 and older with 2 copies of the Delta F508 mutation is expected to complete in August. Data from the 6-month study are expected in the first half of 2017. The other 3 Phase III studies of VX-661 are also progressing as planned. We plan to submit a new drug application to the U.S. FDA for VX-661 in combination with ivacaftor in the second half of 2017.
Importantly, VX-661 is also positioned to play a key role in a triple-combination regimen with a next-generation corrector and ivacaftor. We believe that this triple combination approach may allow us to treat an additional large group of patients, specifically those with one Delta F508 mutation and one mutation that results in minimal CFTR function. These patients do not currently have medicines to treat the cause of their disease.
Our 2 next-generation correctors, VX-152 and VX-440, are being evaluated in Phase I studies in healthy volunteers. Pending data from these studies, we expect to move into Phase II clinical development in the second half of 2016 in people with CF. These studies would evaluate 1 or both of our next generation correctors with VX-661 and ivacaftor. 
Beyond our CFTR modulators, we've entered into multiple strategic collaborations that broaden our ability to evaluate additional approaches to CF treatment that may be complementary to CFTR modulation in the future. While the underlying technology and science of each approach differs, the collaborations have a shared goal to develop the best possible future treatments for all people with CF. Earlier this month, we entered into a collaboration with Moderna Therapeutics aimed at using messenger RNA to potentially enable cells in the lungs of people with CF to produce functional CFTR protein. This is the second platform technology collaboration we have entered into, following our agreement with CRISPR Therapeutics focused on the use of CRISPR-Cas9 for gene editing that we began in late 2015. These platform technologies add to our development stage collaboration with Parion Sciences focused on the use of ENaC inhibition to treat CF.
As we ended the second half of 2016, I'm pleased with both the near and long-term growth opportunities for our business. Our goal is to consistently discover and deliver transformative new medicines for patients and to reinvest in scientific opportunities to create future medicines. We believe our business model, which is focused on significant investment to create value through innovation, research and development, will position us to achieve this goal over the coming years.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Ian."

Through the second quarter of the year, we've created a growing revenue base with ORKAMBI and KALYDECO, which we expect to drive future earnings growth. Tonight, I'll discuss our second quarter revenues for ORKAMBI and K",683,"Thanks, Jeff, and hello, everyone. Through the second quarter of the year, we've created a growing revenue base with ORKAMBI and KALYDECO, which we expect to drive future earnings growth. Tonight, I'll discuss our second quarter revenues for ORKAMBI and KALYDECO, review our 2016 financial guidance and discuss our anticipated financial trajectory for the coming years.
In the second quarter of 2016, we reported total CF product revenues of approximately $426 million, a significant increase compared to $155 million for the second quarter of last year. 
Turning to the revenues for each of our CF medicines. Global sales of ORKAMBI in the second quarter were $245 million, comprised of U.S. sales of approximately $229 million, and ex-U.S. sales of approximately $16 million, which were mainly from Germany. As of June 30, approximately 6,000 patients have initiated treatment with ORKAMBI in the U.S. Outside the U.S., ORKAMBI is already available commercially in Germany, and also through early access programs in France. In Germany, uptake continues to be slower than we observed in the U.S. As of June 30, approximately 380 of the 2,500 eligible patients in Germany had initiated treatment. 
In contrast, in France, we continue to see strong and rapid uptake. Approximately 700 of 1,500 eligible patients in France have already initiated treatment with ORKAMBI as of June 30 as part of the country's early access programs. These programs provided the opportunity for physicians in France to begin treating patients prior to their formal reimbursement approval. We are pleased the ORKAMBI launch has continued to progress consistent with what we discussed on our first quarter call. And today, we are reiterating our expectation for 2016 ORKAMBI revenues of $1 billion to $1.1 billion. 
Given the slower than expected launch in Germany and that we are approaching peak penetration for ORKAMBI in patients aged 12 and older in the U.S., we expect that revenue growth for ORKAMBI will occur primarily in the fourth quarter, following the potential approval and launch of ORKAMBI for children ages 6 to 11.
Now to KALYDECO. Second quarter KALYDECO sales were $180 million, up $25 million compared to the second quarter of last year. We continue to see small number of additional eligible patients beginning treatment in the U.S. and Europe. As with ORKAMBI, we are reiterating our 2016 revenue guidance for KALYDECO of $685 million to $705 million. Our 2016 guidance exclude any potential revenues for the approval of KALYDECO in residual function mutations where we continue to pursue the FDA approval for patients ages 2 and older in the U.S.
Now to the operating expenses. Our second quarter non-GAAP operating expenses were $306 million compared to non-GAAP operating expenses of $254 million in 2015. The increased operating expenses were mainly due to increased costs related to the progression of our CF pipeline and to increase investment in global commercial support for the launch of ORKAMBI. Our non-GAAP net profit for the second quarter of 2016 was $58 million or $0.24 per diluted share as compared to a non-GAAP net loss of $131 million or $0.54 per share for 2015. 
From a balance sheet perspective, we ended the second quarter with approximately $1.07 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Vertex also has $300 million outstanding from a credit agreement repayable by the end of the third quarter 2017.
I'll conclude tonight's call with a few brief comments on financial trends, including revenue and earnings growth. Our goal is to discover and develop new medicines for all people with CF. And as Jeff has discussed, there are 3 important phases to support these efforts: obtaining reimbursement for ORKAMBI outside the U.S.; expanding labels for both ORKAMBI and KALYDECO; and developing new medicines to treat potentially all people with CF. As we progress towards this goal, significant and sustainable revenue growth will follow. Importantly, as our revenues grow over future years, we are committed to managing our operating expenses to drive earnings growth. And we expect to deliver a financial profile similar to many of our large cap biotech peers. 
With that, I open the line to questions."

In fact, all the trends really in initiations, persistence and compliance are entirely in line with what we said then. Just to remind you and others on the phone, for persistence, we said that our expectation was it would track towards about 70% to 80%, between 70% and 80% by the end of this year, and the same for compliance, and we continue to believe in those estimates, and those estimates are what underpins our revenue guidance that we reiterated today. In terms of Europe, and as you noted, Germany's uptake is relatively slow, and Ian mentioned that in his prepared remarks. Incorporated within our guidance, really, we're only expecting significant contributions ex-U.S. from Germany.

But given our learnings and the analogy to KALYDECO and the time it took there, we're really not anticipating to conclude many of those reimbursement negotiations until 2017. Having said that, we recently concluded our first formal reimbursement negotiation in Austria, and that will go into effect from September 1, but we continue to believe that most of the major markets were not likely to see any major contributors -- contributions in terms of revenue growth until 2017 and beyond."

We always plan and provide guidance based on assuming success and that's why we're investing behind the programs. So our OpEx guidance for the year is at $1.18 billion to $1.23 billion, and we reiterated that number in the press release tonight. And that's a non-GAAP number, by the way. Excludes primarily stock compensation. And then, as we look into next year, we actually -- we hope and expect the programs to progress. And as we look into next year, as we think about OpEx more broadly, we see maybe some marginal increases in marketing investments for the launch of ORKAMBI more broadly, and particularly in Europe as we get reimbursement approval. And as we look at the development investment, maybe there's -- it's more consistent with 2015 to 2016 as programs cycle in and out with the expectation that the 661 Phase III program comes to closure, and we're refiling next year, and the progression of the triple into a larger Phase II study.

I think, from a long-term data perspective, we think that is very meaningful to patients and to prescribers. And I think, the reason for that are several fold. As you know, that information really has a couple of chunks to it. One is about the long-term safety of the drug, which is very important. And that continues to look very favorable, consistent with what we have seen before. And then, we had several for efficacy kind of measure. Some of that came from the study itself, our following patients for a long time and we saw that their FEV1s where maintained, their BMI continued to improve. And although there's no active comparison there, the event rate in terms of pulmonary exacerbation really remained low and consistent with what we saw during the trials. So that was all very impactful, we think, for physicians and for patients. The other thing we did was take the information from a mass cohort of historical patients, and what that allows you to do over that kind of time frame is to compare the rate of decline of patients' FEV1s who were on our study versus what we think the historical expectation would be, and that really then, as we did with KALYDECO, helps us understand if we're shifting that curve and slowing the rate of decline, really modifying the disease. And we were very pleased to see that approximately 40% reduction in the rate of decline. So overall, we think that data is very impactful and useful. In terms of triple combination, really can't give you a lot of details, as Jeff Leiden said actually already, that, that -- both drugs do continue in Phase 1 studies, and our expectation, of course, pending data, is that one or both of those will start in patients in the second half of this year."

Obviously, we're deep into the planning for that launch because it's only just a couple of months away. In terms of what we might anticipate for access, to answer the first part of your question, my expectation is that access is going to be very good, just as it was for ORKAMBI when we first introduced it for the 12 and over population. And in some ways, this is a somewhat simpler review for the payers. It's a labeled extension just extending it down to a younger age. And so my expectation is that we'll secure broad access very quickly. In terms of rate of uptake, similarly, I would anticipate the demand to be robust, just as it was for 12 plus. And in terms of persistence and compliance, again, it's difficult to say exactly how it's going to play out in the real world as opposed to what we saw in the clinical trial setting. Certainly, a couple of things that I think give us some encouragement, we certainly saw in the study that we did that forms the basis of our application that the adverse event rate and particularly the rate of respiratory adverse events was much lower and none of the patients discontinued for that adverse event, and as you know, that's been one of the primary reasons for discontinuations on ORKAMBI in the 12 and over population. And then, again, one thing could help us, the 6 to 11 population, certainly with KALYDECO, we do tend to see compliance rates being much higher in the younger population, not surprisingly, as they tend to be very heavily managed by their parents. And so whilst I don't know exactly how it's going to play out in the real world, I certainly expect access to be very good and us to secure that quickly, and I'd also expect the uptake to be very rapid as well."

The data sources are not quite as robust as we have here in the U.S. in terms of tracking at a non-biased level individual patient data in Europe.

Having said that, we are continuing to add new patients on a weekly and daily basis. But as Ian said in his prepared remarks in terms of U.S. growth, obviously, the next phase in growth in the U.S. is likely to be from the approval in 6 to 11s, which we hope will come in the next couple of months. So moving on to how things are panning out in Europe, and you're right, there is a contrast in uptake between Germany and France. Germany is slower than we anticipated. And much of that I attribute to the fact that the German market is more fragmented than many of the other markets that we operate in. What I mean by that is there's many more centers treating CF patients, and as a result, they've had less experience with CFTR modulators, and therefore, the kind of the educational need is higher there. And also, we did see a slightly slower uptake for KALYDECO in Germany than we saw in other EU markets. Contrast with France where through early access programs, we have 700 patients have already been initiated on ORKAMBI, and that uptake in 6 months is much more U.S.-like. So based on that, based on all the other research we've done, we do anticipate that Germany is more likely to be an outlier in terms of rate of uptake, although I continue to believe that we will get to the vast majority of patients in Germany over time. And in terms of rate of uptake, I would expect it to be more like France in the rest of Europe, pending reimbursements than we've seen in Germany, which I continue to believe is likely to be more of the outlier based on our previous experience with KALYDECO and comparing to experience with ORKAMBI."

One, the very, very rapid uptake we saw in ORKAMBI posting the initial launch. And then, we did see about 15% of patients discontinue within the first 3 months therapy, largely as a result of respiratory adverse events. And then, what we saw with the rate of adverse -- rate of discontinuations ameliorated substantially, didn't soften, didn't flatten, but it certainly ameliorated substantially. And is a result of that, that's why we gave the guidance that we see the discontinuations, or the persistence rate, which is the opposite of discontinuations being in that 70% to 80% range by the end of 2016. And everything we've seen through Q2 continues to reinforce, I believe, that, that's where we will end the year, somewhere in that 70% to 80% range.

First of all, as we indicated for the homozygous study, we have a lot of confidence in that finishing enrollment in August. In fact, we've actually already stopped screening patients for that study, so it's just having the last patients completing the screening process and if they qualify going into the trial. We've already talked about the timing of the study of in-patients and the futility analysis that's going to be done. We expect that the next trial that's going to be completed will be the study in patients with 508 on one allele and a residual function mutation on the other allele. And as we've indicated, we expect that to complete in the second half of this year, very much as we've indicated earlier this year, it's really right on track. And then, the last study with 508 and in gating on the other allele, again, as we've indicated previously, we think, in the second half of this year or early next year, and as we get the data, then that will allow us to evaluate our best submission strategy and file a pending data in the second half of '17. In terms of the long-term data, I want to be sure that I understand your question. We do think that the results from that long-term data are quite compelling. You asked specifically about pulmonary exacerbations, and so we do look at what basically we use in assessment of how many events are happening for the patients that we're following and think about it as an event rate, and what we do see is that as we've gone out further in time, that remains quite low compared to what we had as our initial comparison. We think that is quite meaningful to patients and physicians. And actually, that's linked up with the other information like body weight and particularly the change in slope of FEV1 evidence of disease modification, we think that is driving considerations like starting therapy earlier and considering whether patients who discontinued may want to think about restarting therapy."

I'll just pick up on that and say, because many people ask me this, are we going to be an oncology company? And I think that's a little early to suggest that, given that we have one lead molecule at the moment in early stage studies in oncology. We're going to continue to progress those studies, as Jeff Chodakewitz said. And based on that data, we will make a choice at that time whether we'd provide further investments. Well, we actually look to see whether the mechanism is better served working with other companies. And therefore, looking more of a portfolio approach to drive forward, let's say, our oncology opportunities. We do have other mechanisms. One of the -- is in the clinic and then a couple at -- are just late preclinical right now. So we have a late preclinical, a couple of compounds and also early clinical compounds, and that's what determines our oncology portfolio and we'll make a decision of how to progress that best for greatest value once we receive the data from VX-970, our lead program."

Good evening, everyone. It was just over 1 year ago that we received FDA approval for ORKAMBI, marking the most significant step to date in our journey to develop new medicines for people with cystic fibrosis. Tonight, I'm pleased to repo",1092,"Thanks, Michael. Good evening, everyone. It was just over 1 year ago that we received FDA approval for ORKAMBI, marking the most significant step to date in our journey to develop new medicines for people with cystic fibrosis. Tonight, I'm pleased to report on our significant and steady progress in CF, and I'll review 3 key phases in our efforts to bring all people with CF a medicine to treat the underlying cause of their disease. If we're successful in these efforts, we believe significant and sustained revenue and earnings growth will follow.
Today, there are approximately 27,000 people eligible for treatment with ORKAMBI or KALYDECO. However, we're only treating approximately 9,000 or 1/3 of these patients. The first and most significant near-term step to increase the number of eligible patients being treated for their medicines is to gain reimbursement of ORKAMBI in key European and other countries. Progress with reimbursement for ORKAMBI would enable the vast majority of currently eligible patients to be treated with one of our CF medicines. 
The second step to treat more people with CF is to further expand the labels for both ORKAMBI and KALYDECO, which could increase the total number of eligible patients from 27,000 to approximately 44,000. And the third step is to potentially treat all people with CF with new combinations of CFTR modulators as well as other approaches to treatments such as ENaC inhibition, gene editing and mRNA therapies.
First, the reimbursement for ORKAMBI. Outside the U.S., the reimbursement process is ongoing, and these discussions are progressing as anticipated across Europe, Canada and Australia. We're encouraged that many reimbursement authorities have acknowledged the significant clinical benefits that ORKAMBI provides. We believe that we will achieve reimbursement from European and other government payers just as we've seen in the U.S. We look forward to updating you as we obtain reimbursement in key countries going forward.
Second, to our label expansion efforts for both ORKAMBI and KALYDECO. Specifically, there's some 12,000 additional patients younger than age 12 with 2 copies of the Delta F508 mutation whom we believe could be helped by ORKAMBI. In the second quarter, the FDA accepted for review our supplemental new drug application for the use of ORKAMBI in children ages 6 to 11, and granted our request for priority review, setting a target review date or PDUFA date September 30, 2016. If approved, we expect to be ready to bring ORKAMBI to these patients immediately following approval. 
In parallel, we're also progressing with our efforts to bring ORKAMBI to children ages 6 to 11 in Europe where we plan to submit our application for approval in the first half of next year, following the conclusion of our fully enrolled Phase III efficacy and safety study in this group of patients. We estimate that there are approximately 2,400 children ages 6 to 11 in the U.S., and 3,400 in Europe who would be eligible for ORKAMBI.
There are approximately 5,000 additional patients in North America, Europe and Australia, largely those with residual function mutations who could be helped by KALYDECO. While we received the complete response letter from the FDA earlier this year regarding our application for approval of KALYDECO in people with CF ages 2 and older who have 1 of 23 residual function mutations, our belief that KALYDECO would be beneficial to these patients is unchanged, and we continue to pursue FDA approval for these patients as soon as possible. There are approximately 1,500 people with CF in the U.S. who have the mutations included in our residual function sNDA. 
And third, to our expanding pipeline of investigational CF medicine. The most advanced pipeline program in CF is our broad Phase III program for VX-661 in combination with ivacaftor. VX-661 plus ivacaftor may have an improved benefit risk profile compared to ORKAMBI in people with 2 copies of the Delta F508 mutation and may provide enhanced clinical benefits over ivacaftor monotherapy for other patients with gating mutations. Enrollment in the study of VX-661 plus ivacaftor in people ages 12 and older with 2 copies of the Delta F508 mutation is expected to complete in August. Data from the 6-month study are expected in the first half of 2017. The other 3 Phase III studies of VX-661 are also progressing as planned. We plan to submit a new drug application to the U.S. FDA for VX-661 in combination with ivacaftor in the second half of 2017.
Importantly, VX-661 is also positioned to play a key role in a triple-combination regimen with a next-generation corrector and ivacaftor. We believe that this triple combination approach may allow us to treat an additional large group of patients, specifically those with one Delta F508 mutation and one mutation that results in minimal CFTR function. These patients do not currently have medicines to treat the cause of their disease.
Our 2 next-generation correctors, VX-152 and VX-440, are being evaluated in Phase I studies in healthy volunteers. Pending data from these studies, we expect to move into Phase II clinical development in the second half of 2016 in people with CF. These studies would evaluate 1 or both of our next generation correctors with VX-661 and ivacaftor. 
Beyond our CFTR modulators, we've entered into multiple strategic collaborations that broaden our ability to evaluate additional approaches to CF treatment that may be complementary to CFTR modulation in the future. While the underlying technology and science of each approach differs, the collaborations have a shared goal to develop the best possible future treatments for all people with CF. Earlier this month, we entered into a collaboration with Moderna Therapeutics aimed at using messenger RNA to potentially enable cells in the lungs of people with CF to produce functional CFTR protein. This is the second platform technology collaboration we have entered into, following our agreement with CRISPR Therapeutics focused on the use of CRISPR-Cas9 for gene editing that we began in late 2015. These platform technologies add to our development stage collaboration with Parion Sciences focused on the use of ENaC inhibition to treat CF.
As we ended the second half of 2016, I'm pleased with both the near and long-term growth opportunities for our business. Our goal is to consistently discover and deliver transformative new medicines for patients and to reinvest in scientific opportunities to create future medicines. We believe our business model, which is focused on significant investment to create value through innovation, research and development, will position us to achieve this goal over the coming years.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Ian."

Through the second quarter of the year, we've created a growing revenue base with ORKAMBI and KALYDECO, which we expect to drive future earnings growth. Tonight, I'll discuss our second quarter revenues for ORKAMBI and K",683,"Thanks, Jeff, and hello, everyone. Through the second quarter of the year, we've created a growing revenue base with ORKAMBI and KALYDECO, which we expect to drive future earnings growth. Tonight, I'll discuss our second quarter revenues for ORKAMBI and KALYDECO, review our 2016 financial guidance and discuss our anticipated financial trajectory for the coming years.
In the second quarter of 2016, we reported total CF product revenues of approximately $426 million, a significant increase compared to $155 million for the second quarter of last year. 
Turning to the revenues for each of our CF medicines. Global sales of ORKAMBI in the second quarter were $245 million, comprised of U.S. sales of approximately $229 million, and ex-U.S. sales of approximately $16 million, which were mainly from Germany. As of June 30, approximately 6,000 patients have initiated treatment with ORKAMBI in the U.S. Outside the U.S., ORKAMBI is already available commercially in Germany, and also through early access programs in France. In Germany, uptake continues to be slower than we observed in the U.S. As of June 30, approximately 380 of the 2,500 eligible patients in Germany had initiated treatment. 
In contrast, in France, we continue to see strong and rapid uptake. Approximately 700 of 1,500 eligible patients in France have already initiated treatment with ORKAMBI as of June 30 as part of the country's early access programs. These programs provided the opportunity for physicians in France to begin treating patients prior to their formal reimbursement approval. We are pleased the ORKAMBI launch has continued to progress consistent with what we discussed on our first quarter call. And today, we are reiterating our expectation for 2016 ORKAMBI revenues of $1 billion to $1.1 billion. 
Given the slower than expected launch in Germany and that we are approaching peak penetration for ORKAMBI in patients aged 12 and older in the U.S., we expect that revenue growth for ORKAMBI will occur primarily in the fourth quarter, following the potential approval and launch of ORKAMBI for children ages 6 to 11.
Now to KALYDECO. Second quarter KALYDECO sales were $180 million, up $25 million compared to the second quarter of last year. We continue to see small number of additional eligible patients beginning treatment in the U.S. and Europe. As with ORKAMBI, we are reiterating our 2016 revenue guidance for KALYDECO of $685 million to $705 million. Our 2016 guidance exclude any potential revenues for the approval of KALYDECO in residual function mutations where we continue to pursue the FDA approval for patients ages 2 and older in the U.S.
Now to the operating expenses. Our second quarter non-GAAP operating expenses were $306 million compared to non-GAAP operating expenses of $254 million in 2015. The increased operating expenses were mainly due to increased costs related to the progression of our CF pipeline and to increase investment in global commercial support for the launch of ORKAMBI. Our non-GAAP net profit for the second quarter of 2016 was $58 million or $0.24 per diluted share as compared to a non-GAAP net loss of $131 million or $0.54 per share for 2015. 
From a balance sheet perspective, we ended the second quarter with approximately $1.07 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Vertex also has $300 million outstanding from a credit agreement repayable by the end of the third quarter 2017.
I'll conclude tonight's call with a few brief comments on financial trends, including revenue and earnings growth. Our goal is to discover and develop new medicines for all people with CF. And as Jeff has discussed, there are 3 important phases to support these efforts: obtaining reimbursement for ORKAMBI outside the U.S.; expanding labels for both ORKAMBI and KALYDECO; and developing new medicines to treat potentially all people with CF. As we progress towards this goal, significant and sustainable revenue growth will follow. Importantly, as our revenues grow over future years, we are committed to managing our operating expenses to drive earnings growth. And we expect to deliver a financial profile similar to many of our large cap biotech peers. 
With that, I open the line to questions."

So on persistence rates, what we're seeing in the U.S. is very consistent with what we outlined on our Q1 call. In fact, all the trends really in initiations, persistence and compliance are entirely in line with what we said then. Just to remind you and others on the phone, for persistence, we said that our expectation was it would track towards about 70% to 80%, between 70% and 80% by the end of this year, and the same for compliance, and we continue to believe in those estimates, and those estimates are what underpins our revenue guidance that we reiterated today. In terms of Europe, and as you noted, Germany's uptake is relatively slow, and Ian mentioned that in his prepared remarks. Incorporated within our guidance, really, we're only expecting significant contributions ex-U.S. from Germany. In terms of how we see things playing out in the rest of Europe, really, as you know, that's going to be very dependent on us proceeding through country by country reimbursement negotiation processes. And what I can tell you is that those are progressing as we planned, as expected. But given our learnings and the analogy to KALYDECO and the time it took there, we're really not anticipating to conclude many of those reimbursement negotiations until 2017. Having said that, we recently concluded our first formal reimbursement negotiation in Austria, and that will go into effect from September 1, but we continue to believe that most of the major markets were not likely to see any major contributors -- contributions in terms of revenue growth until 2017 and beyond."

We always plan and provide guidance based on assuming success and that's why we're investing behind the programs. So our OpEx guidance for the year is at $1.18 billion to $1.23 billion, and we reiterated that number in the press release tonight. And that's a non-GAAP number, by the way. Excludes primarily stock compensation. And then, as we look into next year, we actually -- we hope and expect the programs to progress. And as we look into next year, as we think about OpEx more broadly, we see maybe some marginal increases in marketing investments for the launch of ORKAMBI more broadly, and particularly in Europe as we get reimbursement approval. And as we look at the development investment, maybe there's -- it's more consistent with 2015 to 2016 as programs cycle in and out with the expectation that the 661 Phase III program comes to closure, and we're refiling next year, and the progression of the triple into a larger Phase II study.

I think, from a long-term data perspective, we think that is very meaningful to patients and to prescribers. And I think, the reason for that are several fold. As you know, that information really has a couple of chunks to it. One is about the long-term safety of the drug, which is very important. And that continues to look very favorable, consistent with what we have seen before. And then, we had several for efficacy kind of measure. Some of that came from the study itself, our following patients for a long time and we saw that their FEV1s where maintained, their BMI continued to improve. And although there's no active comparison there, the event rate in terms of pulmonary exacerbation really remained low and consistent with what we saw during the trials. So that was all very impactful, we think, for physicians and for patients. The other thing we did was take the information from a mass cohort of historical patients, and what that allows you to do over that kind of time frame is to compare the rate of decline of patients' FEV1s who were on our study versus what we think the historical expectation would be, and that really then, as we did with KALYDECO, helps us understand if we're shifting that curve and slowing the rate of decline, really modifying the disease. And we were very pleased to see that approximately 40% reduction in the rate of decline. So overall, we think that data is very impactful and useful. In terms of triple combination, really can't give you a lot of details, as Jeff Leiden said actually already, that, that -- both drugs do continue in Phase 1 studies, and our expectation, of course, pending data, is that one or both of those will start in patients in the second half of this year."

Obviously, we're deep into the planning for that launch because it's only just a couple of months away. In terms of what we might anticipate for access, to answer the first part of your question, my expectation is that access is going to be very good, just as it was for ORKAMBI when we first introduced it for the 12 and over population. And in some ways, this is a somewhat simpler review for the payers. It's a labeled extension just extending it down to a younger age. And so my expectation is that we'll secure broad access very quickly. In terms of rate of uptake, similarly, I would anticipate the demand to be robust, just as it was for 12 plus. And in terms of persistence and compliance, again, it's difficult to say exactly how it's going to play out in the real world as opposed to what we saw in the clinical trial setting. Certainly, a couple of things that I think give us some encouragement, we certainly saw in the study that we did that forms the basis of our application that the adverse event rate and particularly the rate of respiratory adverse events was much lower and none of the patients discontinued for that adverse event, and as you know, that's been one of the primary reasons for discontinuations on ORKAMBI in the 12 and over population. And then, again, one thing could help us, the 6 to 11 population, certainly with KALYDECO, we do tend to see compliance rates being much higher in the younger population, not surprisingly, as they tend to be very heavily managed by their parents. And so whilst I don't know exactly how it's going to play out in the real world, I certainly expect access to be very good and us to secure that quickly, and I'd also expect the uptake to be very rapid as well."

The data sources are not quite as robust as we have here in the U.S. in terms of tracking at a non-biased level individual patient data in Europe.

And as you might expect with the launch where we're getting to a steeper part of the curve, adding new patient becomes a little bit tricky. Having said that, we are continuing to add new patients on a weekly and daily basis. But as Ian said in his prepared remarks in terms of U.S. growth, obviously, the next phase in growth in the U.S. is likely to be from the approval in 6 to 11s, which we hope will come in the next couple of months. So moving on to how things are panning out in Europe, and you're right, there is a contrast in uptake between Germany and France. Germany is slower than we anticipated. And much of that I attribute to the fact that the German market is more fragmented than many of the other markets that we operate in. What I mean by that is there's many more centers treating CF patients, and as a result, they've had less experience with CFTR modulators, and therefore, the kind of the educational need is higher there. And also, we did see a slightly slower uptake for KALYDECO in Germany than we saw in other EU markets. Contrast with France where through early access programs, we have 700 patients have already been initiated on ORKAMBI, and that uptake in 6 months is much more U.S.-like. So based on that, based on all the other research we've done, we do anticipate that Germany is more likely to be an outlier in terms of rate of uptake, although I continue to believe that we will get to the vast majority of patients in Germany over time. And in terms of rate of uptake, I would expect it to be more like France in the rest of Europe, pending reimbursements than we've seen in Germany, which I continue to believe is likely to be more of the outlier based on our previous experience with KALYDECO and comparing to experience with ORKAMBI."

We've discovered a series of second-generation correctors, and they have different -- or mix generation correctors, they have different flavors, which is interesting.

First of all, as we indicated for the homozygous study, we have a lot of confidence in that finishing enrollment in August. In fact, we've actually already stopped screening patients for that study, so it's just having the last patients completing the screening process and if they qualify going into the trial. We've already talked about the timing of the study of in-patients and the futility analysis that's going to be done. We expect that the next trial that's going to be completed will be the study in patients with 508 on one allele and a residual function mutation on the other allele. And as we've indicated, we expect that to complete in the second half of this year, very much as we've indicated earlier this year, it's really right on track. And then, the last study with 508 and in gating on the other allele, again, as we've indicated previously, we think, in the second half of this year or early next year, and as we get the data, then that will allow us to evaluate our best submission strategy and file a pending data in the second half of '17. In terms of the long-term data, I want to be sure that I understand your question. We do think that the results from that long-term data are quite compelling. You asked specifically about pulmonary exacerbations, and so we do look at what basically we use in assessment of how many events are happening for the patients that we're following and think about it as an event rate, and what we do see is that as we've gone out further in time, that remains quite low compared to what we had as our initial comparison. We think that is quite meaningful to patients and physicians. And actually, that's linked up with the other information like body weight and particularly the change in slope of FEV1 evidence of disease modification, we think that is driving considerations like starting therapy earlier and considering whether patients who discontinued may want to think about restarting therapy."

First, to increase the number of eligible patients being treated with our approved medicines, mainly by obtaining reimbursement for ORKAMBI for more patients outside the U.S.; second to further expand the labels for KALYDECO and ORKAMBI around the world; and third to develop new commission regimented CFTR modulators designed to enhance benefit for all patients. 
This evening, I'm pleased to report that we continue to make excellent progress on all of these fronts. Last month, the FDA approved ORKAMBI for the treatment of children with CF ages 6 through 11 who have 2 copies of the F508 mutation. With this disapproval, approximately 29,000 patients worldwide are now eligible for our medicines. 
Today, we are treating approximately 9,000 of these 29,000 eligible patients. Going forward, we remain focused on expanding access to ORKAMBI and KALYDECO for the many eligible patients who are still awaiting treatment, largely through obtaining reimbursement for ORKAMBI in Europe, Canada and Australia.
We're also continuing to make progress in our efforts to expand the labels for KALYDECO and ORKAMBI. In the U.S., we are focused on obtaining approval for KALYDECO in patients with residual function mutations. And in the EU, we expect data this quarter from our Phase III trial of ORKAMBI in children ages 6 through 11 who are homozygous for the F508del mutation. 
If successful, these would represent approximately 5,000 additional patients who may benefit from our approved medicines.
Beyond this important progress, our long-term goal is to treat all people with CF. And during the last year, we have significantly advanced our CF pipeline, which now spans all phases of research and development. Today, we announced the planned initiation of 2 separate Phase II studies of our next-generation correctors, the VX-440 and VX-152 in people with CF. And also a Phase I study of our third next-generation corrector, VX-659 as part of a triple combination. 
These studies represent significant milestones in our efforts to treat as many people with CF as possible, and we'll provide the first safety and clinical efficacy data in patients including het min patients for a triple combination regimen that includes a next-generation corrector. 
We expect to have data from the Phase II studies in the second half of 2017. Additionally, we look forward to obtaining Phase III data for the combination regimen of VX-661, which now carries the generic name Tessa Cather and ivacaftor in the first half of 2017. 
As we entered the fourth quarter of 2016, Vertex is a global biotech company that is discovered and developed 2 breakthrough medicines for people with CF, while broadening our pipeline of future medicines. A significant revenue growth and return to profitability over the past year, our metrics are the kind of company that we are becoming, a company that consistently creates transformative medicines for patients and deliver significant and sustained revenue and earnings growth for our shareholders.
With that, I'll hand the call over to Stuart to discuss the performance of our medicines."

Tonight, I will review the performance of ORKAMBI, our ongoing efforts to obtain reimbursement in Europe, the label expansion for children ages 6 through 11 in the United States and the outlook for KALYDECO. 
In the third quarter, global sales of ORKAMBI were $234 million, comprised of U.S. sales of $211 million and ex-U.S. sales of $23 million.
This quarter, sales in the U.S. declined compared to the second quarter of this year, largely due to a slowing in refills during the summer months of July and August. We're announcing the vast majority of these patients refill their prescriptions. The overall compliance and persistent rates we are observing remain as we outlined earlier in the year. 
During the quarter, patients in the U.S. continue to initiate treatment at a slower rate as we approach peak penetration in the U.S. for patients aged 12 and over. As of the end of September, approximately 6,400 patients in the U.S. have initiated therapy on ORKAMBI.
Last month, we revised our 2016 ORKAMBI revenue guidance to be between $950 million and $990 million for the full year, and we are reiterating that guidance today. The U.S. treatment trends were one reason for the revised guidance. And the other main driver was the ongoing launch in Germany, which has been slower-than-expected. 
As of September 30, approximately 500 of the 2,500 eligible patients have initiated treatment in Germany. We remain confident that they will treat the vast majority of eligible patients over time in Germany, but it will take longer than we had originally anticipated to reach that goal.
In contrast to Germany, we continue to see strong demand in France where approximately 900 of the 1,500 eligible patients have initiated therapy through early access programs as of the end of September. I would note that we are not recognizing revenue for these patients in France until we achieve a formal reimbursement agreement.
Throughout Europe, reimbursement is progressing as anticipated. While there are unique aspects to each process, reimbursement typically falls into 3 phases: A clinical benefit assessment and economic evaluation and price negotiations. In several countries, benefit assessments and economic evaluations are complete. We are pleased that government payers across Europe recognize the severity of this disease and the broad clinical benefits of ORKAMBI. We have now entered the third phase of the reimbursement process, which includes price negotiations in many key countries. While the process takes time to complete, we believe that we will achieve broad reimbursement from key European and other government payers. We expect our first pricing agreement in a major European market to come in Germany this December. 
Pricing and reimbursement approvals for patients eligible for ORKAMBI outside of the U.S. are expected to drive significant revenue growth in 2017.
I will now turn to our recent sNDA approval for ORKAMBI announced last month. We were delighted the FDA approved ORKAMBI for the treatment of children ages 6 to 11 who have 2 copies of the F508del mutation. And since then, we have been working to get the medicine to the approximately 2,400 eligible patients as rapidly as possible. 
Interest in ORKAMBI for this age group has been very high, and our interactions with public and private payers have been productive. We expect broad coverage of ORKAMBI for this patient population as payers have already evaluated the product after approval last year in patients 12 years and older. Thanks to the commitment of health care providers at CF centers across the country, I am pleased to report the first children ages 6 through 11 are already receiving ORKAMBI. We expect the launch to drive revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2016 and in 2017. 
Turning to KALYDECO. Net revenues for the product were $176 million in the third quarter. We are now treating the vast majority of currently eligible patients and, therefore, we expect this level of quarterly revenues to be maintained in the near term unless KALYDECO is approved in CF patients with residual function mutations. Today, there are approximately 29,000 people eligible for ORKAMBI or KALYDECO globally, yet we are only treating approximately 1/3 of these patients. Therefore, expanding access to both of our medicines for eligible patients around the world is our top priority. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff Chodakewitz."

Tonight, I'll review the significant progress we are making with our CF pipeline, and I'll start with the Phase III program of Tessa Cather. We believe the investigation or combination of Tessa Cather and ivacaftor could play an important role in the treatment of people with CF. Enrollment is now complete in the Phase III study in F508del homozygous patients and also in the study in people who have residual function mutations. 
Data from both studies are expected in the first half of 2017.  The Phase III study in people with gating mutations is expected to complete enrollment in early 2017. Pending data from the Phase III program, we plan to submit an NDA in the U.S. for Tessa Cather and ivacaftor in the second half of 2017. I'd like to turn now to the progression of our next-generation correctors and triple combination regimens. 
Our research and development strategy is to advance multiple compounds into development on the basis of our predictive preclinical assays and on Phase I safety studies, so we can choose the best combinations to evaluate in Phase III development. The advancement of VX-440 and VX-512 interface 2 and the selection of VX-6594 for clinical development reflect this strategy. VX-440 and VX-512  will evaluate triple combination dosing for 4 weeks and 2 weeks, respectively, and we'll evaluate both het min and F508del homozygous patients. 
Data from both of these studies are expected in the second half of 2017. The Phase II study of VX-440 includes 3 parts. Each has a different strategic objective, but shares the same primary endpoint of safety and efficacy as measured by absolute change among function. 
Slide 8 of the webcast outlines some of the studies' key features. Part A is focused on helping patients and Part B will enroll F508del homozygous patients. Parts A and B of the study will evaluate triple combination dosing for 4 weeks, and we expect to have the data in the second half of 2017. The potential initiation of Phase III development will depend on these data and discussions with regulatory agencies. 
Part C is designed to generate 12 weeks safety and efficacy data for triple combination dosing in het min patients and will run largely in parallel with potential Phase III development and will evaluate the contribution of the individual components to the overall triple combination regimen.
Slide 9 of our webcast outlines the Phase II study of VX-152. This study includes 2 parts, the primary endpoint of safety and tolerability, but a key focus will also be looking at measures of efficacy, including absolute change in lung function and change in sweat chloride among others. Part A will enroll het min patients and Part B will enroll F508del homozygous patient. 
The VX-152 study will evaluate triple combination dosing for 2 weeks, and data are also expected in the second half of 2017 and are intended to support the potential initiation of a longer duration Phase IIb or registration program, pending data and discussions with regulatory agencies. 
Our Phase I studies in healthy volunteers and other preclinical studies provide support for advancing both VX-440 and VX-152 interface to development and having formed the designs of the Phase II studies we're announcing today. 
Based on Phase I learnings, we believe VX-440 may have a wider therapeutic window, and this is the reason that the VX-440 study will evaluate 4-week dosing from the outset. We also noted in our press release today a specific contraception requirement for females of childbearing potential seeking to enroll in the VX-440 study. This enrollment criterion is based on recent results from preclinical development toxicology studies. Based on laboratory findings from our Phase I study of VX-152, we're also excluding patients with a deficiency from the Phase II studies of VX-152 and also VX-440. 
G6PD deficiency and CF prevalence have limit geographic overlap and, therefore, the incidence of G6PD in the CF population is very low. We estimate this impacts less than 1% of all CF patients overall. 
I will just make a few comments on the in-vitro profile for VX-659, highlighted here on Slide 10. In our HPE assays, the use of a triple combination that contains VX-659 with tezacaftor and ivacaftor resulted in maximal efficacy that was greater than that seen with VX-440 or VX-152 in triple combination. Additionally, VX-659 is highly potent in-vitro, which makes it favorable for a combination with other molecules. 
The Phase I study of VX-659 will be very similar to those we conducted for VX-440 and VX-1523. Pending data from healthy volunteers, we plan to conduct the first evaluation of VX-659 in CF patients as part of the initial Phase I study. We expect to initiate Phase II development for VX-659 in the second half of 2017, pending data from the Phase I study. 
Stepping back from the trial designs, we believe we are in a strong position to define the clinical activity of 3 different next-generation correctors in patients and have data in 2017 that enhance the probability of success for our next-generation corrector program. 
The studies we are conducting with VX-440 and VX-152 could provide data sufficient to move to a pivotal development, accelerating our ability to deliver significant clinical benefits to even more patients than we treat today. I look forward to providing updates on our triple combination regimens as they progress. Before I hand the call over to Ian, did want to mention one additional clinical milestone we expect to achieve before the end of this year. Data from a Phase III efficacy study to support approval for ORKAMBI in children ages 6 to 11 in Europe is expected in the fourth quarter. Pending data from this study, we plan to submit an MAA variation in the EU in the first half of 2017. 
With that, I'll hand the call over to Ian."

As you've heard tonight, we continue to make significant progress across our business. 
In my remarks today, I'll review our third quarter financial results, review our 2016 financial guidance and discuss our anticipated financial trajectory into 2017 and longer term. 
Financial results first. In the third quarter of 2016, we reported total net CF product revenues of approximately $410 million, growing 38% compared to the third quarter of last year as the number of patients being treated with our medicines significantly increased with the launch of ORKAMBI in July 2015.
Our third quarter non-GAAP operating expenses were $298 million, including R&D expense of $214 million and SG&A expense of $84 million. The increased expenses for the third quarter of 2016 compared to 2015 were primarily the result of increased costs related to the progression of our CF pipeline and increased investments in global commercial support for the launch of ORKAMBI. 
This quarter, we recorded a non-GAAP net profit of $40 million or $0.16 per diluted share compared to a non-GAAP net loss of $32 million or $0.13 per share for the third Quarter in 2015. This turnaround in profit was driven by significant increase in revenues compared to the prior year, which outpaced a smaller increase in non-GAAP operating expenses.
From balance sheet perspective, we ended the third quarter with a strong cash position of $1.1 billion. Additionally, earlier this month, we replaced our $300 million term loan with a credit agreement that will significantly lower our interest expense and increase our available credit up to $800 million, pending certain conditions. 
We will continue to build upon our strong financial position going forward.
Now let's turn to 2016 financial guidance. We are reiterating our 2016 ORKAMBI revenue guidance of $950 million to $990 million. And within this guidance, we expect ORKAMBI revenues to grow from the third quarter to the fourth quarter of 2016 as children's ages 6 through 11 initiate treatment in the U.S. As Stewart mentioned earlier, the initial signs of these patients initiating therapy are encouraging. And as we look into 2017, we see continued growth for ORKAMBI, primarily driven by gaining reimbursement approvals throughout Europe and continuing pediatric launch in the U.S. 
We continue to anticipate 2016 KALYDECO net revenues to be between $685 million and $705 million. As we look forward, into 2017, we do not expect significant revenue growth for KALYDECO. If KALYDECO were to be approved in residual function patients, that would be the only significant driver of growth for KALYDECO in 2017. 
For our operating expenses, we continue to expect our combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses to be between $1.18 billion and $1.23 billion for the full year. As we look forward to 2017, we anticipate modest growth in operating expenses to support the progression of our CF pipeline and the launch of ORKAMBI in new geographies. 
As we continue to increase the number of patients that we treat, we expect our revenues to grow significantly in the coming years, while operating expenses will only increase modestly. We are well on track to deliver our financial profile that is similar to our large-cap biotech peers, which includes high operating margins, sustainable earnings growth and significant cash generation.

Maybe just to hone in a little bit on your question about the therapeutic window. That really comes from both compounds are generally well tolerated in VX-152. We did see some GI symptoms, mostly nausea and vomiting, and, therefore, that's the basis for that comment.

And then secondly, I have a question on maybe Jeff on the Phase II protocols for these 2 molecules. Do you think as what we have seen with the KALYDECO in G551, patients and and F508del homozygous fibroid patients 2 weeks or even 4 weeks should be long enough to see a significant improvement in lung function, given that these patients have mutations?"

I was very clear on KALYDECO in my prepared remarks where KALYDECO is treating approximately 90% [ph] of eligible patients that has a very good persistence rate and compliance rate, and we'd anticipate that continuing on into next year. So as you see, the current quarterly run rate for KALYDECO, we see that continuing on in 2017. The market that's potentially increasing would be -- if we were able to gather residual function approval. And as Jeff Chodakewitz explained, we are currently in discussions with the regulatory authorities in the U.S. regarding that approval and that continues that discussion. Regarding ORKAMBI, it's still too early to say. We're very comfortable with the guidance we provided through the end of this year of $950 million to $990 million, and that does include that the recent pediatric approval. As we look to 2017, we'll probably thinking about how we give guidance around the U.S. market and maybe Germany as well because we do have the visibility and knowledge to those markets. In terms of the other international markets and how quickly the time they come on, we just need to give that in the next few months of whether we actually try to provide a bracket around that guidance. There is a certain unknown element, but I'm sure you can only appreciate with these discussions. And sometimes the discussions push out because you are actually holding out for a price that you believe is appropriate for the medicine. And so it's about us getting to the right spots.

The first real test with molecules is our human cells, both het min cells and homozygous cells from multiple donors.

We've also measured the number of other things in that assay like frequency and others, and we see the same kind of difference between 659 and 440. We've entered the molecules through a pretty rigorous screen with respect to PK, tox, coformula availability, really making sure that we're bringing drugs in the clinic as opposed to molecules. And we're done with most but not all of that for 659. We're recently with, so we feel very comfortable that we have a tox profile and a PK profile that we're confident and take the interface I studies, both in normal and in patients as well.

We expect to bring at least one of those forward into the clinic in the first half of next year and maybe more. And the reason for that again is that these molecules come in a number of different flavors, different potencies, different properties, and we want to bring multiple of them into humans as part of triple combinations to understand how to interact.

Vertex' strategy in cystic fibrosis is to treat as many people with CF as possible and to continue to enhance the clinical benefits for those treated by our medicines. Our long-term goal is to reduce the progressive and irreversible effects of CF by treating underlying cause of the disease. 
There are 3 key components to our strategy. First, to increase the number of eligible patients being treated with our approved medicines, mainly by obtaining reimbursement for ORKAMBI for more patients outside the U.S.; second, to further expand the labels for KALYDECO and ORKAMBI around the world; and third, to develop new combination regimens of CFTR modulators designed to enhance benefit for all patients. 
This evening, I'm pleased to report that we continue to make excellent progress on all of these fronts. Last month, the FDA approved ORKAMBI for the treatment of children with CF, ages 6 through 11, who have 2 copies of the F508del mutation. With this approval, approximately 29,000 patients worldwide are now eligible for our medicines. 
Today, we are treating approximately 9,000 of these 29,000 eligible patients. Moving forward, we remain focused on expanding access to ORKAMBI and KALYDECO for the many eligible patients who are still awaiting treatment, largely through obtaining reimbursement for ORKAMBI in Europe, Canada and Australia.
We are also continuing to make progress in our efforts to expand the labels for KALYDECO and ORKAMBI. In the U.S., we are focused on obtaining approval for KALYDECO in patients with residual function mutations. And in the EU, we expect data this quarter from our Phase III trial of ORKAMBI in children ages 6 through 11 who are homozygous for the F508del mutation. If successful, these would represent approximately 5,000 additional patients who may benefit from our approved medicines.
Beyond this important progress, our long-term goal is to treat all people with CF. During the last year, we have significantly advanced our CF pipeline, which now spans all phases of research and development. Today, we announced the planned initiation of 2 separate Phase II studies of our next-generation correctors, VX-440 and VX-152 in people with CF. And also a Phase I study of a third next-generation corrector, VX-659 as part of a triple combination.
These studies represent significant milestones in our efforts to treat as many people with CF as possible, and we'll provide the first safety and clinical efficacy data in patients, including het min patients for a triple combination regimen that includes a next-generation corrector. 
We expect to have data from the Phase II studies in the second half of 2017. Additionally, we look forward to obtaining Phase III data for the combination regimen of VX-661, which now carries the generic name tezacaftor and ivacaftor in the first half of 2017. 
As we entered the fourth quarter of 2016, Vertex is a global biotech company that has discovered and developed 2 breakthrough medicines for people with CF, while broadening our pipeline of future medicines. Our [ph] significant revenue growth and return to profitability over the past year, our metrics of the kind of company that we are becoming, a company that consistently creates transformative medicines for patients and deliver significant and sustained revenue and earnings growth for our shareholders.
With that, I'll hand the call over to Stuart to discuss the performance of our medicines."

Tonight, I will review the performance of ORKAMBI, our ongoing efforts to obtain reimbursement in Europe, the label expansion for children ages 6 through 11 in the United States and the outlook for KALYDECO. In the thi",726,"Thanks, Jeff, and hello, everyone. Tonight, I will review the performance of ORKAMBI, our ongoing efforts to obtain reimbursement in Europe, the label expansion for children ages 6 through 11 in the United States and the outlook for KALYDECO. 
In the third quarter, global sales of ORKAMBI were $234 million, comprised of U.S. sales of $211 million and ex U.S. sales of $23 million.
This quarter, sales in the U.S. declined compared to the second quarter of this year, largely due to a slowing in refills during the summer months of July and August. We have now seen the vast majority of these patients refill their prescriptions. The overall compliance and persistence rates we are observing remain as we outlined earlier in the year. 
During the quarter, patients in the U.S. continue to initiate treatment at a slower rate as we approach peak penetration in the U.S. for patients age 12 and over. As of the end of September, approximately 6,400 patients in the U.S. have initiated therapy on ORKAMBI.
Last month, we revised our 2016 ORKAMBI revenue guidance to be between $950 million and $990 million for the full year, and we are reiterating that guidance today. U.S. treatment trends were one reason for the revised guidance. And the other main driver was the ongoing launch in Germany, which has been slower than expected. 
As of September 30, approximately 500 of the 2,500 eligible patients have initiated treatment in Germany. We remain confident that we will treat the vast majority of eligible patients over time in Germany, but it will take longer than we had originally anticipated to reach that goal.
In contrast to Germany, we continue to see strong demand in France, where approximately 900 of the 1,500 eligible patients have initiated therapy through early access programs as of the end of September. I would note that we are not recognizing revenue for these patients in France until we achieve a formal reimbursement agreement.
Throughout Europe, reimbursement is progressing as anticipated. While there are unique aspects to each process, reimbursement typically falls into 3 phases: A clinical benefit assessment and economic evaluation and price negotiations. In several countries, benefit assessments and economic evaluations are complete. We are pleased that government payers across Europe recognize the severity of this disease and the broad clinical benefits of ORKAMBI. We have now entered the third phase of the reimbursement process, which includes price negotiations in many key countries. While the process takes time to complete, we believe that we will achieve broad reimbursement from key European and other government payers. We expect our first pricing agreement in a major European market to come in Germany this December. 
Pricing and reimbursement approvals for patients eligible for ORKAMBI outside of the U.S. are expected to drive significant revenue growth in 2017.
I will now turn to our recent sNDA approval for ORKAMBI announced last month. We were delighted the FDA approved ORKAMBI for the treatment of children ages 6 to 11 who have 2 copies of the F508del mutation. And since then, we have been working to get the medicine to the approximately 2,400 eligible patients as rapidly as possible. 
Interest in ORKAMBI for this age group has been very high, and our interactions with public and private payers have been productive. We expect broad coverage of ORKAMBI for this patient population as payers have already evaluated the product after approval last year in patients 12 years and older. Thanks to the commitment of health care providers at CF centers across the country. I am pleased to report the first children, ages 6 through 11, are already receiving ORKAMBI. We expect the launch to drive revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2016 and in 2017. 
Turning to KALYDECO. Net revenues for the product were $176 million in the third quarter. We are now treating the vast majority of currently eligible patients and, therefore, we expect this level of quarterly revenues to be maintained in the near term unless KALYDECO is approved in CF patients with residual function mutations. Today, there are approximately 29,000 people eligible for ORKAMBI or KALYDECO globally, yet we are only treating approximately 1/3 of these patients. Therefore, expanding access to both of our medicines for eligible patients around the world is our top priority. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff Chodakewitz."

Tonight, I'll review the significant progress we are making with our CF pipeline, and I'll start with the Phase III program of tezacaftor.

Tonight, I'll review the significant progress we are making with our CF pipeline, and I'll start with the Phase III program of tezacaftor. We believe the investigation or combination of tezacaftor and ivacaftor could play an important role in the treatment of people with CF. Enrollment is now complete in the Phase III study in F508del homozygous patients, and also in the study in people who have residual function mutations. 
Data from both studies are expected in the first half of 2017. The Phase III study in people with gating mutations is expected to complete enrollment in early 2017. Pending data from the Phase III program, we plan to submit an NDA in the U.S. for tezacaftor and ivacaftor in the second half of 2017. 
I'd like to turn now to the progression of our next-generation correctors and triple combination regimens. Our research and development strategy is to advance multiple compounds into development on the basis of our predictive preclinical assays and on Phase I safety studies, so we can choose the best combinations to evaluate in Phase III development. The advancement of VX-440 and VX-152 into Phase II and the selection of VX-659 for clinical development reflect this strategy. VX-440 and VX-152 will evaluate triple combination dosing for 4 weeks and 2 weeks, respectively, and we'll evaluate both het min and F508del homozygous patients. 
Data from both of these studies are expected in the second half of 2017. The Phase II study of VX-440 includes 3 parts. Each has a different strategic objective, but shares the same primary endpoint of safety and efficacy as measured by absolute change among function.
Slide 8 of the webcast outlines some of the studies' key features. Part A is focused on het min patients and Part B will enroll F508del homozygous patients. Parts A and B of the study will evaluate triple combination dosing for 4 weeks, and we expect to have the data in the second half of 2017. The potential initiation of Phase III development will depend on these data and discussions with regulatory agencies. 
Part C is designed to generate 12 weeks safety and efficacy data for triple combination dosing in het min patients and will run largely in parallel with potential Phase III development and will evaluate the contribution of the individual components to the overall triple combination regimen.
Slide 9 of our webcast outlines the Phase II study of VX-152. This study includes 2 parts. The primary endpoint of safety and tolerability, but a key focus will also be looking at measures of efficacy, including absolute change in lung function and change in sweat chloride among others. Part A will enroll het min patients and Part B will enroll F508del homozygous patients. 
The VX-152 study will evaluate triple combination dosing for 2 weeks, and data are also expected in the second half of 2017 and are intended to support the potential initiation of a longer duration Phase IIb or registration program, pending data and discussions with regulatory agencies. 
Our Phase I studies in healthy volunteers and other preclinical studies provide support for advancing both VX-440 and VX-152 into Phase II development and have informed the designs of the Phase II studies we're announcing today. 
Based on Phase I learnings, we believe VX-440 may have a wider therapeutic window, and this is the reason that the VX-440 study will evaluate 4-week dosing from the outset. We also noted in our press release today a specific contraception requirement for females of childbearing potential seeking to enroll in the VX-440 study. This enrollment criterion was based on recent results from preclinical development toxicology studies. Based on laboratory findings from our Phase I study of VX-152, we're also excluding patients with G6PD deficiency from the Phase II studies of VX-152 and also VX-440.
G6PD deficiency and CF prevalence have limit geographic overlap and, therefore, the incidence of G6PD in the CF population is very low. We estimate this impacts less than 1% of all CF patients overall. 
I will just make a few comments on the in-vitro profile for VX-659, highlighted here on Slide 10. In our HBE assays, the use of a triple combination that contains VX-659 with tezacaftor and ivacaftor resulted in maximal efficacy that was greater than that seen with VX-440 or VX-152 in triple combination. Additionally, VX-659 is highly potent in-vitro, which makes it favorable for a combination with other molecules.
The Phase I study of VX-659 will be very similar to those we conducted for VX-440 and VX-152. Pending data from healthy volunteers, we plan to conduct the first evaluation of VX-659 in CF patients as part of the initial Phase I study. We expect to initiate Phase II development for VX-659 in the second half of 2017, pending data from the Phase I study. 
Stepping back from the trial designs, we believe we are in a strong position to define the clinical activity of 3 different next-generation correctors in patients and have data in 2017 that enhance the probability of success for our next-generation corrector program.
The studies we are conducting with VX-440 and VX-152 could provide data sufficient to move to pivotal development, accelerating our ability to deliver significant clinical benefits to even more patients than we treat today. I look forward to providing updates on our triple combination regimens as they progress. 
Before I hand the call over to Ian, I did want to mention one additional clinical milestone we expect to achieve before the end of this year. Data from a Phase III efficacy study to support approval for ORKAMBI in children ages 6 to 11 in Europe is expected in the fourth quarter.

Good evening to everyone. As you've heard tonight, we continue to make significant progress across our business. In my remarks today, I'll review our third quarter financial results, review our 2016 financial guidance and discuss our antic",551,"Thanks, Jeff. Good evening to everyone. As you've heard tonight, we continue to make significant progress across our business. 
In my remarks today, I'll review our third quarter financial results, review our 2016 financial guidance and discuss our anticipated financial trajectory into 2017 and longer term.
Financial results first. In the third quarter of 2016, we reported total net CF product revenues of approximately $410 million, growing 38% compared to the third quarter of last year as the number of patients being treated with our medicines significantly increased with the launch of ORKAMBI in July 2015.
Our third quarter non-GAAP operating expenses were $298 million, including R&D expense of $214 million and SG&A expense of $84 million. The increased expenses for the third quarter of 2016 compared to 2015 were primarily the result of increased costs related to the progression of our CF pipeline and increased investment in global commercial support for the launch of ORKAMBI. 
This quarter, we recorded a non-GAAP net profit of $40 million or $0.16 per diluted share compared to a non-GAAP net loss of $32 million or $0.13 per share for the third quarter 2015. This turnaround to profit was driven by a significant increase in revenues compared to the prior year, which outpaced a smaller increase in non-GAAP operating expenses.
From a balance sheet perspective, we ended the third quarter with a strong cash position of $1.1 billion. Additionally, earlier this month, we replaced our $300 million term loan with a credit agreement that will significantly lower our interest expense and increase our available credit up to $800 million pending certain conditions. We will continue to build upon our strong financial position going forward.
Now let's turn to 2016 financial guidance. We are reiterating our 2016 ORKAMBI revenue guidance of $950 million to $990 million. And within this guidance, we expect ORKAMBI revenues to grow from the third quarter to the fourth quarter of 2016 as children's ages 6 through 11 initiate treatment in the U.S. As Stuart mentioned earlier, the initial signs of these patients initiating therapy are encouraging. And as we look into 2017, we see continued growth for ORKAMBI, primarily driven by gaining reimbursement approvals throughout Europe and continuing pediatric launch in the U.S. 
We continue to anticipate 2016 KALYDECO net revenues to be between $685 million and $705 million. As we look forward into 2017, we do not expect significant revenue growth for KALYDECO. If KALYDECO were to be approved in residual function patients, that would be the only significant driver of growth for KALYDECO in 2017.
For our operating expenses, we continue to expect our combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses to be between $1.18 billion and $1.23 billion for the full year. As we look forward to 2017, we anticipate modest growth in operating expenses to support the progression of our CF pipeline and the launch of ORKAMBI in new geographies.
As we continue to increase the number of patients that we treat, we expect our revenues to grow significantly in the coming years, while operating expenses will only increase modestly. We are well on track to deliver financial profile that is similar to many of our large-cap biotech peers, which includes high operating margins, sustainable earnings growth and significant cash generation.
I'll now open the line to questions."

We think that both compounds are going to go into their Phase II studies with doses that are both going to be well tolerated and efficacious, and I think that's very exciting. Maybe just to hone in a little bit on your question about therapeutic window. That really comes from both compounds being generally well tolerated. In VX-152, we did see some GI symptoms, mostly nausea and vomiting, and, therefore, that's the basis for that comment. So for VX-440, we're going right to 4-week studies and with the potential, therefore, to accelerate quickly into a Phase III. And then for 152, because of that, we are starting with Phase II studies and then can extend dosing from there."

We're making good progress with both public and commercial payers in terms of securing access and already have approval for about 50% of covered lives, which is, obviously, an important prerequisite to getting access to these younger patients. And so as a result of all that, we are expecting a similarly robust update for that, which we saw with ORKAMBI in the 12-plus population. And that's what's incorporates into our overall guidance."

By bringing 3 or 4 of these different correctors into Phase I and now in this case, Phase II studies, it increases the probability of success that will come up with the best regiments for each of the patient population. And while we can predict an awful lot from our preclinical study of cellular- assays, particularly quite well on the efficacy front. As a couple of folks noted before, there can be differences in potency and maximal efficacy and drug-like properties, and those are best seen, really, from these Phase I and Phase II trials, and we're learning a lot as we go about these different molecules. Would we ever take 2 molecules into Phase III development? It's absolutely possible just as you've seen with lumacaftor and 661, 2 first generation correctors because they may also have different protocols so -- profiles.

So let me talk about the 2 and the 4 weeks because we're actually going to have very similar end point in both.

We're also going to have sweat chloride being evaluated in both drugs, which will also be valuable. Ultimately, what we're going to do is use all the information. We actually also have a lot of work being done to actually understand from a modeling perspective, so that we can get the absolute most information out of our clinical trial. And so we're going to use all that information across both to make the best decisions, and we think that, that will contribute to both. I think in terms of the specifics of the doses, as you may see in the design, we're going to go into patients with a small cohort. That's really just to confirm that, that exposure is the same in patients as it is in healthy volunteers. We don't have any reason to think that it will be different, but we're going to do that just to be sure we're taking the right approach. And then we'll choose our doses from there to confirm for the rest of the trial."

There are certainly a lot of variables with Europe with the pediatric indication coming online in the U.S. So that would be helpful. And then Stuart, lastly, as you're negotiating price in Europe, could you give us a sense of how you're thinking about having a portfolio of CF combination?

I hoped I was very clear on KALYDECO in my prepared remarks where KALYDECO is treating approximately 90% of eligible patients that -- and has a very good persistence rate and compliance rate, and we'd anticipate that continuing on into next year. So as you see, the current quarterly run rate for KALYDECO, we see that continuing on in 2017, the mark of potentially increasing would be if we were able to gather residual function approval. And as Jeff Chodakewitz explained, we are currently in discussions with the regulatory authorities in the U.S. regarding that approval and that continues that discussion. Regarding ORKAMBI, it's a little too early to say. We're very comfortable with the guidance we've provided through the end of this year of $950 million to $990 million, and that does include the recent pediatric approval. As we look to 2017, we'll probably be thinking about how we give guidance around the U.S. market and maybe Germany as well because we do have visibility and knowledge to those markets. In terms of the other international markets, of how quickly and the time that they come on, we just need to give that some thought over the next few months of whether we actually try to provide a bracket around that guidance. There is a certain unknown element, but I'm sure you can only appreciate with these discussions. And sometimes the discussions push out because you are actually holding out for a price that you believe is appropriate for the medicine. And so it's about us getting to the right spot and rather than putting guidance around and be forced around guidance, we'll give it some consideration of how we put a bracket around that and we'll be back to you early in early 2017.

I think you've seen that we've adhered to those principles with ORKAMBI. And whilst we don't have formal pricing agreements in place across Europe yet, you have seen with the list prices of ORKAMBI where they are lower than they are for KALYDECO, which reflects the fact that, clearly, ORKAMBI is -- has a much wider eligible patient population despite the fact that, that medicine has two different components within it.

Maybe just to go back one step and remind you of how we look at these molecules and select them. The first real assay test for these molecules is our human HPE cells, both het min cells and homozygous cells from multiple donors. And as we showed you, I think in one of the slides today, 659 actually has efficacy as measured by chloride transport, which is maximal efficacy that's significantly higher than what we were seeing in 440 and 152, which were also quite high by themselves, by the way. We've also measured a number of other things in that assay like cilia beat frequency and others, and we see the same kind of difference between 659 and 440. We've entered the molecules through a pretty rigorous screen with respect to PK, tox, coformulability, really making sure that we're bringing drugs in the clinic as opposed to molecules. And we're done with most but not all of that for 659. We're certainly done with them now so we feel very comfortable that we have a tox profile and a PK profile that we're confident in taking into Phase I studies, both in normals and in patients this time as well. We have not done yet with the developmental studies in rabbits, and we don't have that data yet. And obviously, we don't have any human data, which is the final test of PK and safety and we'll only see that in the Phase I study. In addition, just as Ian mentioned, just -- we need to be clear with our expectations, we have a number of other next-gen correctors in our late preclinical pipeline. We expect to bring at least one of those forward into the clinic in the first half of next year and maybe more. And the reason for that, again, is that these molecules come in a number of different flavors, different potencies, different properties, and we want to bring multiple of them into humans as part of triple combinations to understand how they interact. I hope that gives you a flavor of where 659 fits and what we know and some things we don't yet know, but we'll know soon."

Let me answer both really good questions. Maybe I'll answer your second question first. Really, the portfolio approach is based upon the fact that while the molecules may bind to the same site, it may even have the same mechanism of action, there are obviously a number of other properties that are going to be really important in picking the best regimen. They include potency, because the more potent the molecule is, the easier it is to combine and to triple combination formulate. They include maximal efficacy, obviously, and we showed you the 659 as an example of its greater maximal efficacy. But they also include things like PK properties, tissue penetration, drug-drug interactions, all of those things. And so when you think about this portfolio, think about it not only in terms of mechanism of action and not only in terms of efficacy and potency, but think about it as how do we create the best triple regimen with one or more of these molecules going forward.

One of the things that I'm really been pleased with over the last 4 or 5 years is as we develop these molecules, we've learned an awful lot about how to take the development forward most quickly, most efficiently and then how to start to think about phase trials -- Phase III trials perhaps a little differently.

Vertex' strategy in cystic fibrosis is to treat as many people with CF as possible and to continue to enhance the clinical benefits for those treated by our medicines. Our long-term goal is to reduce the progressive and irreversible effects of CF by treating underlying cause of the disease. 
There are 3 key components to our strategy. First, to increase the number of eligible patients being treated with our approved medicines, mainly by obtaining reimbursement for ORKAMBI for more patients outside the U.S.; second, to further expand the labels for KALYDECO and ORKAMBI around the world; and third, to develop new combination regimens of CFTR modulators designed to enhance benefit for all patients. 
This evening, I'm pleased to report that we continue to make excellent progress on all of these fronts. Last month, the FDA approved ORKAMBI for the treatment of children with CF, ages 6 through 11, who have 2 copies of the F508del mutation. With this approval, approximately 29,000 patients worldwide are now eligible for our medicines. 
Today, we are treating approximately 9,000 of these 29,000 eligible patients. Moving forward, we remain focused on expanding access to ORKAMBI and KALYDECO for the many eligible patients who are still awaiting treatment, largely through obtaining reimbursement for ORKAMBI in Europe, Canada and Australia.
We are also continuing to make progress in our efforts to expand the labels for KALYDECO and ORKAMBI. In the U.S., we are focused on obtaining approval for KALYDECO in patients with residual function mutations. And in the EU, we expect data this quarter from our Phase III trial of ORKAMBI in children ages 6 through 11 who are homozygous for the F508del mutation. If successful, these would represent approximately 5,000 additional patients who may benefit from our approved medicines.
Beyond this important progress, our long-term goal is to treat all people with CF. During the last year, we have significantly advanced our CF pipeline, which now spans all phases of research and development. Today, we announced the planned initiation of 2 separate Phase II studies of our next-generation correctors, VX-440 and VX-152 in people with CF. And also a Phase I study of a third next-generation corrector, VX-659 as part of a triple combination.
These studies represent significant milestones in our efforts to treat as many people with CF as possible, and we'll provide the first safety and clinical efficacy data in patients, including het min patients for a triple combination regimen that includes a next-generation corrector. 
We expect to have data from the Phase II studies in the second half of 2017. Additionally, we look forward to obtaining Phase III data for the combination regimen of VX-661, which now carries the generic name tezacaftor and ivacaftor in the first half of 2017. 
As we enter the fourth quarter of 2016, Vertex is a global biotech company that has discovered and developed 2 breakthrough medicines for people with CF, while broadening our pipeline of future medicines. Our significant revenue growth and return to profitability over the past year, our metrics of the kind of company that we are becoming, a company that consistently creates transformative medicines for patients and deliver significant and sustained revenue and earnings growth for our shareholders.
With that, I'll hand the call over to Stuart to discuss the performance of our medicines."
36235,404123072,1060935,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2016",2016-10-25,"Earnings Calls","Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Jeff, and hello, everyone. Tonight, I will review the performance of ORKAMBI, our ongoing efforts to obtain reimbursement in Europe, the label expansion for children ages 6 through 11 in the United States and the outlook for KALYDECO. In the thi",726,"Thanks, Jeff, and hello, everyone. Tonight, I will review the performance of ORKAMBI, our ongoing efforts to obtain reimbursement in Europe, the label expansion for children ages 6 through 11 in the United States and the outlook for KALYDECO. 
In the third quarter, global sales of ORKAMBI were $234 million, comprised of U.S. sales of $211 million and ex U.S. sales of $23 million.
This quarter, sales in the U.S. declined compared to the second quarter of this year, largely due to a slowing in refills during the summer months of July and August. We have now seen the vast majority of these patients refill their prescriptions. The overall compliance and persistence rates we are observing remain as we outlined earlier in the year. 
During the quarter, patients in the U.S. continue to initiate treatment at a slower rate as we approach peak penetration in the U.S. for patients age 12 and over. As of the end of September, approximately 6,400 patients in the U.S. have initiated therapy on ORKAMBI.
Last month, we revised our 2016 ORKAMBI revenue guidance to be between $950 million and $990 million for the full year, and we are reiterating that guidance today. U.S. treatment trends were one reason for the revised guidance. And the other main driver was the ongoing launch in Germany, which has been slower than expected. 
As of September 30, approximately 500 of the 2,500 eligible patients have initiated treatment in Germany. We remain confident that we will treat the vast majority of eligible patients over time in Germany, but it will take longer than we had originally anticipated to reach that goal.
In contrast to Germany, we continue to see strong demand in France, where approximately 900 of the 1,500 eligible patients have initiated therapy through early access programs as of the end of September. I would note that we are not recognizing revenue for these patients in France until we achieve a formal reimbursement agreement.
Throughout Europe, reimbursement is progressing as anticipated. While there are unique aspects to each process, reimbursement typically falls into 3 phases: A clinical benefit assessment and economic evaluation and price negotiations. In several countries, benefit assessments and economic evaluations are complete. We are pleased that government payers across Europe recognize the severity of this disease and the broad clinical benefits of ORKAMBI. We have now entered the third phase of the reimbursement process, which includes price negotiations in many key countries. While the process takes time to complete, we believe that we will achieve broad reimbursement from key European and other government payers. We expect our first pricing agreement in a major European market to come in Germany this December. 
Pricing and reimbursement approvals for patients eligible for ORKAMBI outside of the U.S. are expected to drive significant revenue growth in 2017.
I will now turn to our recent sNDA approval for ORKAMBI announced last month. We were delighted the FDA approved ORKAMBI for the treatment of children ages 6 to 11 who have 2 copies of the F508del mutation. And since then, we have been working to get the medicine to the approximately 2,400 eligible patients as rapidly as possible. 
Interest in ORKAMBI for this age group has been very high, and our interactions with public and private payers have been productive. We expect broad coverage of ORKAMBI for this patient population as payers have already evaluated the product after approval last year in patients 12 years and older. Thanks to the commitment of health care providers at CF centers across the country. I am pleased to report the first children, ages 6 through 11, are already receiving ORKAMBI. We expect the launch to drive revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2016 and in 2017. 
Turning to KALYDECO. Net revenues for the product were $176 million in the third quarter. We are now treating the vast majority of currently eligible patients and, therefore, we expect this level of quarterly revenues to be maintained in the near term unless KALYDECO is approved in CF patients with residual function mutations. Today, there are approximately 29,000 people eligible for ORKAMBI or KALYDECO globally, yet we are only treating approximately 1/3 of these patients. Therefore, expanding access to both of our medicines for eligible patients around the world is our top priority. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff Chodakewitz."

Tonight, I'll review the significant progress we are making with our CF pipeline, and I'll start with the Phase III program of tezacaftor. We believe the investigational combination of tezacaftor and ivacaftor could play an important role in the treatment of people with CF. Enrollment is now complete in the Phase III study in F508del homozygous patients, and also in the study in people who have residual function mutations. 
Data from both studies are expected in the first half of 2017. The Phase III study in people with gating mutations is expected to complete enrollment in early 2017. Pending data from the Phase III program, we plan to submit an NDA in the U.S. for tezacaftor and ivacaftor in the second half of 2017. 
I'd like to turn now to the progression of our next-generation correctors and triple combination regimens. Our research and development strategy is to advance multiple compounds into development on the basis of our predictive preclinical assays and on Phase I safety studies, so we can choose the best combinations to evaluate in Phase III development. The advancement of VX-440 and VX-152 into Phase II and the selection of VX-659 for clinical development reflect this strategy. VX-440 and VX-152 will evaluate triple combination dosing for 4 weeks and 2 weeks, respectively, and we'll evaluate both het min and F508del homozygous patients. 
Data from both of these studies are expected in the second half of 2017. The Phase II study of VX-440 includes 3 parts. Each has a different strategic objective, but shares the same primary endpoints of safety and efficacy as measured by absolute change among function.
Slide 8 of the webcast outlines some of the studies' key features. Part A is focused on het min patients, and Part B will enroll F508del homozygous patients. Parts A and B of the study will evaluate triple combination dosing for 4 weeks, and we expect to have the data in the second half of 2017. The potential initiation of Phase III development will depend on these data and discussions with regulatory agencies. 
Part C is designed to generate 12 weeks safety and efficacy data for triple combination dosing in het min patients and will run largely in parallel with potential Phase III development and will evaluate the contribution of the individual components to the overall triple combination regimen.
Slide 9 of our webcast outlines the Phase II study of VX-152. This study includes 2 parts. The primary endpoint of safety and tolerability, but a key focus will also be looking at measures of efficacy, including absolute change in lung function and change in sweat chloride among others. Part A will enroll het min patients, and Part B will enroll F508del homozygous patients. 
The VX-152 study will evaluate triple combination dosing for 2 weeks, and data are also expected in the second half of 2017 and are intended to support the potential initiation of a longer duration Phase IIb or registration program, pending data and discussions with regulatory agencies. 
Our Phase I studies in healthy volunteers and other preclinical studies provide support for advancing both VX-440 and VX-152 into Phase II development and have informed the designs of the Phase II studies we're announcing today. 
Based on Phase I learnings, we believe VX-440 may have a wider therapeutic window, and this is the reason that the VX-440 study will evaluate 4-week dosing from the outset. We also noted in our press release today a specific contraception requirement for females of childbearing potential seeking to enroll in the VX-440 study. This enrollment criterion was based on recent results from preclinical development toxicology studies. Based on laboratory findings from our Phase I study of VX-152, we're also excluding patients with G6PD deficiency from the Phase II studies of VX-152 and also VX-440.
G6PD deficiency and CF prevalence have limit geographic overlap and, therefore, the incidence of G6PD in the CF population is very low. We estimate this impacts less than 1% of all CF patients overall. 
I will just make a few comments on the in-vitro profile for VX-659, highlighted here on Slide 10. In our HBE assays, the use of a triple combination that contains VX-659 with tezacaftor and ivacaftor resulted in maximal efficacy that was greater than that seen with VX-440 or VX-152 in triple combination. Additionally, VX-659 is highly potent in-vitro, which makes it favorable for a combination with other molecules.
The Phase I study of VX-659 will be very similar to those we conducted for VX-440 and VX-152. Pending data from healthy volunteers, we plan to conduct the first evaluation of VX-659 in CF patients as part of the initial Phase I study. We expect to initiate Phase II development for VX-659 in the second half of 2017, pending data from the Phase I study. 
Stepping back from the trial designs, we believe we are in a strong position to define the clinical activity of 3 different next-generation correctors in patients and have data in 2017 that enhance the probability of success for our next-generation corrector program.
The studies we are conducting with VX-440 and VX-152 could provide data sufficient to move to pivotal development, accelerating our ability to deliver significant clinical benefits to even more patients than we treat today. I look forward to providing updates on our triple combination regimens as they progress. 
Before I hand the call over to Ian, I did want to mention one additional clinical milestone we expect to achieve before the end of this year. Data from a Phase III efficacy study to support approval for ORKAMBI in children ages 6 to 11 in Europe is expected in the fourth quarter. Pending data from this study, we plan to submit an MAA variation in the EU in the first half of 2017.
With that, I'll hand the call over to Ian."

In my remarks today, I'll review our third quarter financial results, review our 2016 financial guidance and discuss our antic",552,"Thanks, Jeff. Good evening to everyone. As you've heard tonight, we continue to make significant progress across our business. 
In my remarks today, I'll review our third quarter financial results, review our 2016 financial guidance and discuss our anticipated financial trajectory into 2017 and longer term.
Financial results first. In the third quarter of 2016, we reported total net CF product revenues of approximately $410 million, growing 38% compared to the third quarter of last year as the number of patients being treated with our medicines significantly increased with the launch of ORKAMBI in July 2015.
Our third quarter non-GAAP operating expenses were $298 million, including R&D expense of $214 million and SG&A expense of $84 million. The increased expenses for the third quarter of 2016 compared to 2015 were primarily the result of increased costs related to the progression of our CF pipeline and increased investment in global commercial support for the launch of ORKAMBI. 
This quarter, we recorded a non-GAAP net profit of $40 million or $0.16 per diluted share compared to a non-GAAP net loss of $32 million or $0.13 per share for the third quarter 2015. This turnaround to profit was driven by a significant increase in revenues compared to the prior year, which outpaced a smaller increase in non-GAAP operating expenses.
From a balance sheet perspective, we ended the third quarter with a strong cash position of $1.1 billion. Additionally, earlier this month, we replaced our $300 million term loan with a credit agreement that will significantly lower our interest expense and increase our available credit up to $800 million pending certain conditions. We will continue to build upon our strong financial position going forward.
Now let's turn to 2016 financial guidance. We are reiterating our 2016 ORKAMBI revenue guidance of $950 million to $990 million. And within this guidance, we expect ORKAMBI revenues to grow from the third quarter to the fourth quarter of 2016 as children's ages 6 through 11 initiate treatment in the U.S. As Stuart mentioned earlier, the initial signs of these patients initiating therapy are encouraging. And as we look into 2017, we see continued growth for ORKAMBI, primarily driven by gaining reimbursement approvals throughout Europe and continuing pediatric launch in the U.S. 
We continue to anticipate 2016 KALYDECO net revenues to be between $685 million and $705 million. As we look forward into 2017, we do not expect significant revenue growth for KALYDECO. If KALYDECO were to be approved in residual function patients, that would be the only significant driver of growth for KALYDECO in 2017.
For our operating expenses, we continue to expect our combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses to be between $1.18 billion and $1.23 billion for the full year. As we look forward to 2017, we anticipate modest growth in operating expenses to support the progression of our CF pipeline and the launch of ORKAMBI in new geographies.
As we continue to increase the number of patients that we treat, we expect our revenues to grow significantly in the coming years, while operating expenses will only increase modestly. We are well on track to deliver a financial profile that is similar to many of our large-cap biotech peers, which includes high operating margins, sustainable earnings growth and significant cash generation.
I'll now open the line to questions."

We think that both compounds are going to go into their Phase II studies with doses that are both going to be well tolerated and efficacious, and I think that's very exciting. Maybe just to hone in a little bit on your question about therapeutic window. That really comes from both compounds being generally well tolerated. In VX-152, we did see some GI symptoms, mostly nausea and vomiting, and, therefore, that's the basis for that comment. So for VX-440, we're going right to 4-week studies and with the potential, therefore, to accelerate quickly into a Phase III. And then for 152, because of that, we are starting with Phase II studies and then can extend dosing from there."

And so as a result of all that, we are expecting a similarly robust uptake for that, which we saw with ORKAMBI in the 12-plus population. And that's what's incorporates into our overall guidance."

And while we can predict an awful lot from our preclinical study of cellular- assays, particularly quite well on the efficacy front. As a couple of folks noted before, there can be differences in potency and maximal efficacy and drug-like properties, and those are best seen, really, from these Phase I and Phase II trials, and we're learning a lot as we go about these different molecules.

I hoped I was very clear on KALYDECO, in my prepared remarks, where KALYDECO is treating approximately 90% of eligible patients that -- and it has a very good persistence rate and compliance rate, and we'd anticipate that continuing on into next year. So as you see, the current quarterly run rate for KALYDECO, we see that continuing on in 2017, the mark of that potentially increasing would be if we were able to gather residual function approval. And as Jeff Chodakewitz explained, we are currently in discussions with the regulatory authorities in the U.S. regarding that approval and that continues that discussion. Regarding ORKAMBI, it's a little too early to say. We're very comfortable with the guidance we've provided through the end of this year of $950 million to $990 million, and that does include the recent pediatric approval. As we look to 2017, we'll probably be thinking about how we give guidance around the U.S. market and maybe Germany as well because we do have visibility and knowledge to those markets. In terms of the other international markets, of how quickly and the time that they come on, we just need to give that some thought over the next few months of whether we actually try to provide a bracket around that guidance.

And sometimes the discussions push out because you are actually holding out for a price that you believe is appropriate for the medicine.

We've also measured a number of other things in that assay like cilia beat frequency and others, and we see the same kind of difference between 659 and 440.

And the reason for that, again, is that these molecules come in a number of different flavors, different potencies, different properties, and we want to bring multiple of them into humans as part of triple combinations to understand how they interact. I hope that gives you a flavor of where 659 fits and what we know and some things we don't yet know, but we'll know soon."

Both are really good questions. Maybe I'll answer your second question first. Really, the portfolio approach is based upon the fact that while the molecules may bind to the same site, it may even have the same mechanism of action, there are obviously a number of other properties that are going to be really important in picking the best regimen. They include potency, because the more potent the molecule is, the easier it is to combine into triple combination formulate. They include maximal efficacy, obviously, and we showed you the 659 as an example of its greater maximal efficacy. But they also include things like PK properties, tissue penetration, drug-drug interactions, all of those things. And so when you think about this portfolio, think about it not only in terms of mechanism of action and not only in terms of efficacy and potency, but think about it as how do we create the best triple regimen with one or more of these molecules going forward. Does that makes sense to you in terms of how we're thinking about it?"

And that's going to let us really design the best Phase III study, I think, here. One of the things that I'm really been pleased with over the last 4 or 5 years is as we develop these molecules, we've learned an awful lot about how to take the development forward most quickly, most efficiently and then how to start to think about phase trials -- Phase III trials perhaps a little differently. And so I do think you're seeing the results of that here as we sort of streamline these Phase II trials, do them in parallel as opposed to in theories as we've done them in the past. And then hopefully, based on the results, of course, launch into Phase III in a much broader fashion than we've done previously."

Vertex' strategy in cystic fibrosis is to treat as many people with CF as possible and to continue to enhance the clinical benefits for those treated by our medicines. Our long-term goal is to reduce the progressive and irreversible effects of CF by treating underlying cause of the disease. 
There are 3 key components to our strategy. First, to increase the number of eligible patients being treated with our approved medicines, mainly by obtaining reimbursement for ORKAMBI for more patients outside the U.S.; second, to further expand the labels for KALYDECO and ORKAMBI around the world; and third, to develop new combination regimens of CFTR modulators designed to enhance benefit for all patients. 
This evening, I'm pleased to report that we continue to make excellent progress on all of these fronts. Last month, the FDA approved ORKAMBI for the treatment of children with CF, ages 6 through 11, who have 2 copies of the F508del mutation. With this approval, approximately 29,000 patients worldwide are now eligible for our medicines. 
Today, we are treating approximately 9,000 of these 29,000 eligible patients. Moving forward, we remain focused on expanding access to ORKAMBI and KALYDECO for the many eligible patients who are still awaiting treatment, largely through obtaining reimbursement for ORKAMBI in Europe, Canada and Australia.
We are also continuing to make progress in our efforts to expand the labels for KALYDECO and ORKAMBI. In the U.S., we are focused on obtaining approval for KALYDECO in patients with residual function mutations. And in the EU, we expect data this quarter from our Phase III trial of ORKAMBI in children ages 6 through 11 who are homozygous for the F508del mutation. If successful, these would represent approximately 5,000 additional patients who may benefit from our approved medicines.
Beyond this important progress, our long-term goal is to treat all people with CF. During the last year, we have significantly advanced our CF pipeline, which now spans all phases of research and development. Today, we announced the planned initiation of 2 separate Phase II studies of our next-generation correctors, VX-440 and VX-152 in people with CF. And also a Phase I study of a third next-generation corrector, VX-659 as part of a triple combination.
These studies represent significant milestones in our efforts to treat as many people with CF as possible, and we'll provide the first safety and clinical efficacy data in patients, including het min patients for a triple combination regimen that includes a next-generation corrector. 
We expect to have data from the Phase II studies in the second half of 2017. Additionally, we look forward to obtaining Phase III data for the combination regimen of VX-661, which now carries the generic name tezacaftor and ivacaftor in the first half of 2017. 
As we enter the fourth quarter of 2016, Vertex is a global biotech company that has discovered and developed 2 breakthrough medicines for people with CF, while broadening our pipeline of future medicines. Our significant revenue growth and return to profitability over the past year, our metrics of the kind of company that we are becoming, a company that consistently creates transformative medicines for patients and deliver significant and sustained revenue and earnings growth for our shareholders.
With that, I'll hand the call over to Stuart to discuss the performance of our medicines."
36235,404123072,1061367,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2016",2016-10-25,"Earnings Calls","Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Jeff, and hello, everyone. Tonight, I will review the performance of ORKAMBI, our ongoing efforts to obtain reimbursement in Europe, the label expansion for children ages 6 through 11 in the United States and the outlook for KALYDECO. In the thi",726,"Thanks, Jeff, and hello, everyone. Tonight, I will review the performance of ORKAMBI, our ongoing efforts to obtain reimbursement in Europe, the label expansion for children ages 6 through 11 in the United States and the outlook for KALYDECO. 
In the third quarter, global sales of ORKAMBI were $234 million, comprised of U.S. sales of $211 million and ex U.S. sales of $23 million.
This quarter, sales in the U.S. declined compared to the second quarter of this year, largely due to a slowing in refills during the summer months of July and August. We have now seen the vast majority of these patients refill their prescriptions. The overall compliance and persistence rates we are observing remain as we outlined earlier in the year. 
During the quarter, patients in the U.S. continue to initiate treatment at a slower rate as we approach peak penetration in the U.S. for patients age 12 and over. As of the end of September, approximately 6,400 patients in the U.S. have initiated therapy on ORKAMBI.
Last month, we revised our 2016 ORKAMBI revenue guidance to be between $950 million and $990 million for the full year, and we are reiterating that guidance today. U.S. treatment trends were one reason for the revised guidance. And the other main driver was the ongoing launch in Germany, which has been slower than expected. 
As of September 30, approximately 500 of the 2,500 eligible patients have initiated treatment in Germany. We remain confident that we will treat the vast majority of eligible patients over time in Germany, but it will take longer than we had originally anticipated to reach that goal.
In contrast to Germany, we continue to see strong demand in France, where approximately 900 of the 1,500 eligible patients have initiated therapy through early access programs as of the end of September. I would note that we are not recognizing revenue for these patients in France until we achieve a formal reimbursement agreement.
Throughout Europe, reimbursement is progressing as anticipated. While there are unique aspects to each process, reimbursement typically falls into 3 phases: A clinical benefit assessment and economic evaluation and price negotiations. In several countries, benefit assessments and economic evaluations are complete. We are pleased that government payers across Europe recognize the severity of this disease and the broad clinical benefits of ORKAMBI. We have now entered the third phase of the reimbursement process, which includes price negotiations in many key countries. While the process takes time to complete, we believe that we will achieve broad reimbursement from key European and other government payers. We expect our first pricing agreement in a major European market to come in Germany this December. 
Pricing and reimbursement approvals for patients eligible for ORKAMBI outside of the U.S. are expected to drive significant revenue growth in 2017.
I will now turn to our recent sNDA approval for ORKAMBI announced last month. We were delighted the FDA approved ORKAMBI for the treatment of children ages 6 to 11 who have 2 copies of the F508del mutation. And since then, we have been working to get the medicine to the approximately 2,400 eligible patients as rapidly as possible. 
Interest in ORKAMBI for this age group has been very high, and our interactions with public and private payers have been productive. We expect broad coverage of ORKAMBI for this patient population as payers have already evaluated the product after approval last year in patients 12 years and older. Thanks to the commitment of health care providers at CF centers across the country. I am pleased to report the first children, ages 6 through 11, are already receiving ORKAMBI. We expect the launch to drive revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2016 and in 2017. 
Turning to KALYDECO. Net revenues for the product were $176 million in the third quarter. We are now treating the vast majority of currently eligible patients and, therefore, we expect this level of quarterly revenues to be maintained in the near term unless KALYDECO is approved in CF patients with residual function mutations. Today, there are approximately 29,000 people eligible for ORKAMBI or KALYDECO globally, yet we are only treating approximately 1/3 of these patients. Therefore, expanding access to both of our medicines for eligible patients around the world is our top priority. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff Chodakewitz."

Tonight, I'll review the significant progress we are making with our CF pipeline, and I'll start with the Phase III program of tezacaftor. We believe the investigational combination of tezacaftor and ivacaftor could play an important role",972,"Thanks, Stuart. Tonight, I'll review the significant progress we are making with our CF pipeline, and I'll start with the Phase III program of tezacaftor. We believe the investigational combination of tezacaftor and ivacaftor could play an important role in the treatment of people with CF. Enrollment is now complete in the Phase III study in F508del homozygous patients, and also in the study in people who have residual function mutations. 
Data from both studies are expected in the first half of 2017. The Phase III study in people with gating mutations is expected to complete enrollment in early 2017. Pending data from the Phase III program, we plan to submit an NDA in the U.S. for tezacaftor and ivacaftor in the second half of 2017. 
I'd like to turn now to the progression of our next-generation correctors and triple combination regimens. Our research and development strategy is to advance multiple compounds into development on the basis of our predictive preclinical assays and on Phase I safety studies, so we can choose the best combinations to evaluate in Phase III development. The advancement of VX-440 and VX-152 into Phase II and the selection of VX-659 for clinical development reflect this strategy. VX-440 and VX-152 will evaluate triple combination dosing for 4 weeks and 2 weeks, respectively, and we'll evaluate both het min and F508del homozygous patients. 
Data from both of these studies are expected in the second half of 2017. The Phase II study of VX-440 includes 3 parts. Each has a different strategic objective, but shares the same primary endpoints of safety and efficacy as measured by absolute change among function.
Slide 8 of the webcast outlines some of the studies' key features. Part A is focused on het min patients, and Part B will enroll F508del homozygous patients. Parts A and B of the study will evaluate triple combination dosing for 4 weeks, and we expect to have the data in the second half of 2017. The potential initiation of Phase III development will depend on these data and discussions with regulatory agencies. 
Part C is designed to generate 12 weeks safety and efficacy data for triple combination dosing in het min patients and will run largely in parallel with potential Phase III development and will evaluate the contribution of the individual components to the overall triple combination regimen.
Slide 9 of our webcast outlines the Phase II study of VX-152. This study includes 2 parts. The primary endpoint of safety and tolerability, but a key focus will also be looking at measures of efficacy, including absolute change in lung function and change in sweat chloride among others. Part A will enroll het min patients, and Part B will enroll F508del homozygous patients. 
The VX-152 study will evaluate triple combination dosing for 2 weeks, and data are also expected in the second half of 2017 and are intended to support the potential initiation of a longer duration Phase IIb or registration program, pending data and discussions with regulatory agencies. 
Our Phase I studies in healthy volunteers and other preclinical studies provide support for advancing both VX-440 and VX-152 into Phase II development and have informed the designs of the Phase II studies we're announcing today. 
Based on Phase I learnings, we believe VX-440 may have a wider therapeutic window, and this is the reason that the VX-440 study will evaluate 4-week dosing from the outset. We also noted in our press release today a specific contraception requirement for females of childbearing potential seeking to enroll in the VX-440 study. This enrollment criterion was based on recent results from preclinical development toxicology studies. Based on laboratory findings from our Phase I study of VX-152, we're also excluding patients with G6PD deficiency from the Phase II studies of VX-152 and also VX-440.
G6PD deficiency and CF prevalence have limit geographic overlap and, therefore, the incidence of G6PD in the CF population is very low. We estimate this impacts less than 1% of all CF patients overall. 
I will just make a few comments on the in-vitro profile for VX-659, highlighted here on Slide 10. In our HBE assays, the use of a triple combination that contains VX-659 with tezacaftor and ivacaftor resulted in maximal efficacy that was greater than that seen with VX-440 or VX-152 in triple combination. Additionally, VX-659 is highly potent in-vitro, which makes it favorable for a combination with other molecules.
The Phase I study of VX-659 will be very similar to those we conducted for VX-440 and VX-152. Pending data from healthy volunteers, we plan to conduct the first evaluation of VX-659 in CF patients as part of the initial Phase I study. We expect to initiate Phase II development for VX-659 in the second half of 2017, pending data from the Phase I study. 
Stepping back from the trial designs, we believe we are in a strong position to define the clinical activity of 3 different next-generation correctors in patients and have data in 2017 that enhance the probability of success for our next-generation corrector program.
The studies we are conducting with VX-440 and VX-152 could provide data sufficient to move to pivotal development, accelerating our ability to deliver significant clinical benefits to even more patients than we treat today. I look forward to providing updates on our triple combination regimens as they progress. 
Before I hand the call over to Ian, I did want to mention one additional clinical milestone we expect to achieve before the end of this year. Data from a Phase III efficacy study to support approval for ORKAMBI in children ages 6 to 11 in Europe is expected in the fourth quarter. Pending data from this study, we plan to submit an MAA variation in the EU in the first half of 2017.
With that, I'll hand the call over to Ian."
36235,404123072,1061367,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2016",2016-10-25,"Earnings Calls","Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Jeff. Good evening to everyone. As you've heard tonight, we continue to make significant progress across our business. In my remarks today, I'll review our third quarter financial results, review our 2016 financial guidance and discuss our antic",552,"Thanks, Jeff. Good evening to everyone. As you've heard tonight, we continue to make significant progress across our business. 
In my remarks today, I'll review our third quarter financial results, review our 2016 financial guidance and discuss our anticipated financial trajectory into 2017 and longer term.
Financial results first. In the third quarter of 2016, we reported total net CF product revenues of approximately $410 million, growing 38% compared to the third quarter of last year as the number of patients being treated with our medicines significantly increased with the launch of ORKAMBI in July 2015.
Our third quarter non-GAAP operating expenses were $298 million, including R&D expense of $214 million and SG&A expense of $84 million. The increased expenses for the third quarter of 2016 compared to 2015 were primarily the result of increased costs related to the progression of our CF pipeline and increased investment in global commercial support for the launch of ORKAMBI. 
This quarter, we recorded a non-GAAP net profit of $40 million or $0.16 per diluted share compared to a non-GAAP net loss of $32 million or $0.13 per share for the third quarter 2015. This turnaround to profit was driven by a significant increase in revenues compared to the prior year, which outpaced a smaller increase in non-GAAP operating expenses.
From a balance sheet perspective, we ended the third quarter with a strong cash position of $1.1 billion. Additionally, earlier this month, we replaced our $300 million term loan with a credit agreement that will significantly lower our interest expense and increase our available credit up to $800 million pending certain conditions. We will continue to build upon our strong financial position going forward.
Now let's turn to 2016 financial guidance. We are reiterating our 2016 ORKAMBI revenue guidance of $950 million to $990 million. And within this guidance, we expect ORKAMBI revenues to grow from the third quarter to the fourth quarter of 2016 as children's ages 6 through 11 initiate treatment in the U.S. As Stuart mentioned earlier, the initial signs of these patients initiating therapy are encouraging. And as we look into 2017, we see continued growth for ORKAMBI, primarily driven by gaining reimbursement approvals throughout Europe and continuing pediatric launch in the U.S. 
We continue to anticipate 2016 KALYDECO net revenues to be between $685 million and $705 million. As we look forward into 2017, we do not expect significant revenue growth for KALYDECO. If KALYDECO were to be approved in residual function patients, that would be the only significant driver of growth for KALYDECO in 2017.
For our operating expenses, we continue to expect our combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses to be between $1.18 billion and $1.23 billion for the full year. As we look forward to 2017, we anticipate modest growth in operating expenses to support the progression of our CF pipeline and the launch of ORKAMBI in new geographies.
As we continue to increase the number of patients that we treat, we expect our revenues to grow significantly in the coming years, while operating expenses will only increase modestly. We are well on track to deliver a financial profile that is similar to many of our large-cap biotech peers, which includes high operating margins, sustainable earnings growth and significant cash generation.
I'll now open the line to questions."

We think that both compounds are going to go into their Phase II studies with doses that are both going to be well tolerated and efficacious, and I think that's very exciting. Maybe just to hone in a little bit on your question about therapeutic window. That really comes from both compounds being generally well tolerated. In VX-152, we did see some GI symptoms, mostly nausea and vomiting, and, therefore, that's the basis for that comment. So for VX-440, we're going right to 4-week studies and with the potential, therefore, to accelerate quickly into a Phase III. And then for 152, because of that, we are starting with Phase II studies and then can extend dosing from there."

In general, we've been very pleased that payers across Europe have recognized the broad clinical benefits of ORKAMBI. Then there is an economic evaluation. And after that phase, you enter into the price negotiation. And so whilst each process is different in each different country, they tend to follow that same pattern and they are kind of proceeding as we anticipated. And I'd say the last thing is that, in addition to evaluating the clinical benefits from an economic perspective, they are concerned about the overall budget impact it might have for them in their individual country."

I hoped I was very clear on KALYDECO, in my prepared remarks, where KALYDECO is treating approximately 90% of eligible patients that -- and it has a very good persistence rate and compliance rate, and we'd anticipate that continuing on into next year. So as you see, the current quarterly run rate for KALYDECO, we see that continuing on in 2017, the mark of that potentially increasing would be if we were able to gather residual function approval. And as Jeff Chodakewitz explained, we are currently in discussions with the regulatory authorities in the U.S. regarding that approval and that continues that discussion. Regarding ORKAMBI, it's a little too early to say. We're very comfortable with the guidance we've provided through the end of this year of $950 million to $990 million, and that does include the recent pediatric approval. As we look to 2017, we'll probably be thinking about how we give guidance around the U.S. market and maybe Germany as well because we do have visibility and knowledge to those markets. In terms of the other international markets, of how quickly and the time that they come on, we just need to give that some thought over the next few months of whether we actually try to provide a bracket around that guidance. There is a certain unknown element, but I'm sure you can only appreciate with these discussions. And sometimes the discussions push out because you are actually holding out for a price that you believe is appropriate for the medicine. And so it's about us getting to the right spot and rather than putting guidance around it and be forced around guidance, we'll give it some consideration of how we put a bracket around that and we'll be back to you early in 2017.

Maybe just to go back one step and remind you of how we look at these molecules and select them. The first real acid test for these molecules is our human HBE cells, both het min cells and homozygous cells from multiple donors. And as we showed you, I think in one of the slides today, 659 actually has efficacy as measured by chloride transport, which is maximal efficacy that's significantly higher than what we were seeing in 440 and 152, which were also quite high by themselves, by the way. We've also measured a number of other things in that assay like cilia beat frequency and others, and we see the same kind of difference between 659 and 440. We've entered the molecules through a pretty rigorous screen with respect to PK, tox, coformulability, really making sure that we're bringing drugs in the clinic as opposed to molecules. And we're done with most but not all of that for 659. We're certainly done with them now so we feel very comfortable that we have a tox profile and a PK profile that we're confident in taking into Phase I studies, both in normals and in patients this time as well. We have not done yet with the developmental studies in rabbits, and we don't have that data yet. And obviously, we don't have any human data, which is the final test of PK and safety and we'll only see that in the Phase I study. In addition, just as Ian mentioned, just -- we need to be clear with our expectations, we have a number of other next-gen correctors in our late preclinical pipeline. We expect to bring at least one of those forward into the clinic in the first half of next year and maybe more. And the reason for that, again, is that these molecules come in a number of different flavors, different potencies, different properties, and we want to bring multiple of them into humans as part of triple combinations to understand how they interact. I hope that gives you a flavor of where 659 fits and what we know and some things we don't yet know, but we'll know soon."

They include maximal efficacy, obviously, and we showed you the 659 as an example of its greater maximal efficacy. But they also include things like PK properties, tissue penetration, drug-drug interactions, all of those things.

One of the things that I'm really been pleased with over the last 4 or 5 years is as we develop these molecules, we've learned an awful lot about how to take the development forward most quickly, most efficiently and then how to start to think about phase trials -- Phase III trials perhaps a little differently.

To me, you've outlined very well the portfolio strategy, why certainly you're moving forward with 440 and 659, but is the only reason for 152 the fact that it does not have teratogenicity?"

One, the 1a, as we go back to sort of a prior conversation, the intent of 1a is to go make the transition from healthy volunteers to patients. And be sure -- basically, the exposure is similar in the two groups. And since it could potentially go up or down, although we don't expect it to do either, that's why you wouldn't want to go in at a high dose and then have the exposure actually end up higher. That's why we always would start in that kind of situation with the low dose and then expand, which is the intent. In terms of your broader question about VX-152 and VX-440, I think it goes back to Jeff Leiden's comments, that we think both molecules will have the potential to be well-tolerated at doses that can deliver benefit to patients, including, excitingly, both homozygous patients and het min patients who don't have a treatment option. And that's why we're taking both forward and we'll continue to learn as we add other molecules to our portfolio."

Of course, in the end, all the time lines, particularly the Phase II studies, are going to be dependent on the rate of enrollment. But what we expect would be that for both VX-152 and VX-440, that we will be getting results, as we said, in the second half of '17. At that point, we will also have the Phase I results from VX-659. And as we've talked about that, given everything we've learned about the relationship from preclinical to exposure to benefit of patients, we think that we will be able to understand a lot about all 3 compounds as we're looking forward to make decisions at that point."

But if you would ask me just to put a sort of marker on the table, I think that 659 myself is about 6 months behind 152 and 440. So we're not going to be waiting, obviously, if we see positive results with 152 and 440 before taking those into Phase III to wait for 659, if that's really the question."
