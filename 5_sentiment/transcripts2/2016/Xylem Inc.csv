Over the course of 2015, we faced a dynamic economic environment on a macrolevel and in key end markets. I'm quite pleased with our teams performance as we remain focused on executing against our long term objectives. We responded effectively to changing conditions and ultimately closed out the year with another quarter of solid results. We delivered at or above our guidance on several key metrics. 
Organic revenue grew 2% in the quarter, resulting in 2% organic revenue growth for the full year as well. Adjusted earnings per share increased 3% to $0.60 in the quarter, excluding foreign exchange translation. This brought our full year adjusted earnings to $1.85 per share, a 5% increase year over year excluding foreign exchange translation and we delivered free cash flow conversion of 105% delivered by working capital improvement. Importantly, I'm encouraged by the fundamentals and underlying trends impacting our business today and in the years ahead.
External factors such a steadily increasing spend on Water Infrastructure, growing demand for intelligent monitoring and control systems and client related initiatives that require our water expertise and ingenuity all bode well for sustained profitable growth at Xylem.
As we continue to advance the key growth initiatives we laid during our Investor Day last year, namely stepping up our commercial leadership, driving accelerated growth in emerging markets and increasing our investment in R&D and innovation, I'm confident we are well positioned to deliver that growth.
That work will be complemented by our ongoing focus on continuous improvement and business simplication, which will be significant levers for long term value creation. Xylem has a balanced global portfolio that we expect will further benefit from a number of current and emerging trends. Here are couple of the examples. 
The perennial battle to increase spending on Water Infrastructure is gaining some traction here in the U.S. A number of efforts are underway to produce actionable plans to break through the historical barriers of financing, political risk and competing priorities. The urgency of the need is further punctuated by flashpoints such as the tragic situation of Michigan and the flooding events that continue to occur in various parts of the country. Xylem is actively engaged in several of these efforts, including those that are focused on unlocking private capital for infrastructure investment. 
In addition, on the heels on the Paris climate talks, governments around the world are developing action plans to achieve the carbon emission reduction they signed onto in that historic agreement. Given the that the management of water is a notable contributor to global carbon emissions, the water industry has substantial opportunity to contribute to emission reduction goals. 
In light of that, last quarter we issued a report titled Powering the Wastewater Renaissance. This study outlines how the adoption of the readily available wastewater management technologies can cut related emissions by nearly  half. The analysis further concludes that 95% of the electricity related emissions abatement can be achieved at negative or neutral cost, resulting in a win win scenario for our customers as well as the governing bodies that are seeking viable solutions to implement in the near term. 
We believe these activities are positive indicators for the continued recovery we see in the public utility market, which constitutes roughly 1/3 of our global business. Improving market conditions and our strong execution enabled us to gain market share in this end market as we generated 8% organic growth in the fourth quarter. This follows a solid performance in the third quarter when we delivered 5% year over year growth.
The industrial end market is also significant for Xylem. Similar to other companies in this space, we continued to experience the impact of some negative underlying market trends. For the full year, overall industrial was down 1% organically. This however, was largely driven by the steep declines in oil and gas, which was down 40% in 2015 with most of the impact sold in the second half of the year. 
To be clear, despite the fact that oil and gas represented a relatively small portion of our business, the combination of such a severe drop and its high profit margin resulted in a significant impact on our 2015 results. Specifically, oil and gas reduced our revenues by approximately 1%, compressed our operating margin by 40 basis points, and reduced our earnings per share by $0.12. 
Looking ahead, we expect those headwinds to continue at least until we begin to lap the initial declines we first experienced in the second quarter of last year. Then, we anticipate the headwind to moderate somewhat in the second half of the year. 
Overall, we anticipate challenging conditions in oil and gas to continue, but the impact should not be as severe as it was last year. In addition, we expect ongoing headwinds in the mining sector. Collectively, these 2 sectors now represent about 8% of our total revenue. We will continue to manage and ultimately optimize efficiency and performance through the inevitable economic cycles that occur within this end market.
Fortunately, Xylem is better positioned than many. Our industrial market exposure is more heavily weighted to the light industrial sector. In fact, that represents roughly 36% of our total revenue. The benefits of this sector mix are evident in our 2015 results. 
Excluding the severe impact of the oil and gas declines, the remainder of our industrial related business grew 2% for the full year. Driving this growth was the continued demand for industrial water applications such as pressure boosting equipment cooling and fire suppression. Critical nature of these products and services and maintaining operations creates more resilience in the light industrial sector, providing a counterweight to the cyclical volatility seen in heavy industrials. 
One final point, the leading position rehab in certain consumer demand driven applications such as beverage dispensing and marine in RV pump applications helped us deliver solid growth. With combined revenue of more than $120 million, these businesses grew 4% in 2015 and are well positioned to continue growing in 2016. 
From a regional perspective, we remained optimistic about the U.S. markets, particularly the public utility and commercial building sectors, which we'll address in more detail later on the call. Europe is stabilizing and we expect a more favorable outlook there. We had a strong presence in the public utility market in Europe and we're already seeing early signs of success with key product launches in the residential and commercial building sectors. 
The emerging markets present a more complex story. As all of you know, many of these markets are already showing signs of slower growth. After posting 9% organic growth during the first 9 months of the year, our business is in emerging markets grew 2% in the fourth quarter. There are a few dynamics at play here. 
First, the 2% organic growth compared with 14% organic growth in the prior year period. Underlying this delta is a pattern of choppy project deliveries that can easily cause distortions in quarterly year over year growth.
Second, our Applied Water segment declined 4% in the emerging markets in the quarter driven in part by the slowdown in China's industrial and commercial markets. However, given our business in China is more heavily weighted to the public utility end market, we do expect continued growth ahead albeit at a slower pace than in most recent years. 
Shifting gears now. As I've mentioned previously, we are still in the early chapters of a multiyear self help story that will enable us to drive margin expansion. Our continuous improvement initiatives, which include lean and global procurement, along with a sharper focus on driving business simplification, will result in significant operating margin improvement.
Today, G&A cost sit at 8.5% of revenue, down 120 basis points over the past 2 years, but still an opportunity. We will continue to attack these costs in 2016 and beyond as we execute the business simplification plan we laid out at Investor Day, targeting $60 million to $75 million of structural cost reduction over the next few years. Our expectation is to invest approximately $25 million in 2016 from which we anticipate realizing $8 million in savings in the second half of the year and $15 million on an annualized basis. We will touch on this in more detail later in the call.
We are driving productivity within the business so we can fund the necessary investments to achieve our longer term objectives. This includes increasing our R&D investments for future growth, the targeted investment in the Middle East, China and India we highlighted at our Investor Day and accelerating capital deployment on 2 fronts; returning capital to shareholders and acquisitions. 
Today, we announced a 10% increase in dividend and the acquisition of Tideland Corporation, our second acquisition in as many quarters. Let's turn to Slide 5 and I'll cover capital deployment and the Tideland acquisition in more detail.
With our strong cash flow generation and capital structure, we are well positioned to create more value for our shareholders. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 1.4 million shares for $50 million. For the full year, we repurchased 5.1 million shares for $175 million and we have about $430 million available under our authorized programs.
We also paid $25 million in dividends to shareholders in the quarter, bringing our full year total to $102 million, reflecting a 10% increase per share year over year.
Combined, this represents a 24% increase in return of capital to shareholders in 2015. Earlier this week, we completed our acquisition of Tideland, a leading producer of smart analytic solutions in the coastal and ocean management sectors. More specifically, the company integrate systems intelligence technologies with tools to enable a wide variety of marine and environmental monitoring capabilities to an array of customers. These offerings stood well with our existing analytics portfolio. We intend to further integrate analytics tools from our current portfolio into their systems, including a direct tie in with our recent fourth quarter acquisition, high pack[ph].
The result will be a broader range of systems intelligence solutions that we can provide to the coastal and ocean water sector. Growth in this area will continue to be driven by the customer's need to comply with increasing regulations for a variety of operations in this space.
The acquisitions of Tideland and high pack [ph]  Illustrate how we plan to bring together distinct products and services to build intelligent full systems capability and significantly expand the market we currently serve. 
With that, let me turn the call over to our Interim CFO, Shashank Patel, to walk you through the results and the company's financial position in more detail. Shashank?"

For the full year, revenue increased 2% on an organic basis consistent with the midpoint",2076,"Thanks, Patrick, and since you already covered some of these full year highlights, I'll make specific points and then dive further into our fourth quarter results. 
For the full year, revenue increased 2% on an organic basis consistent with the midpoint of our guidance at the beginning of last year. We saw solid growth in the public utility, commercial and residential markets, all up 4% organically. Industrial was down 1%, primarily due to the significant declines we saw in oil and gas over the second half of the year. Agriculture was down 8% as unfavorable weather maybe the severe flooding conditions in the southern U.S. wiped out this year season. As a reminder, higher culture represents 2% of our revenues. Regenerated strongest growth in the emerging markets posted 7% increase over the course of the year. China led the way here growing 14%. Worth noting is that our Water Infrastructure segment grew 17%, driving 80% of the overall growth as the local trend to invest in and improve water quality and wastewater treatment continued.
The U.S. and Western Europe markets grew each grew 1%.
In the U.S., growth accelerated over the course of the year and hit a high for the year in the fourth quarter whereas Europe was relatively stable throughout the year. Canada runs out our geographic performance. There are significant declines in oil and gas resulted in a 13% decline in revenue. 
As for margins, productivity actions and volume leverage more than offset material labor and overhead inflation and unfavorable mix. Excluding FX translation, gross margin expanded 40 basis points and led to a 30 basis point improvement in operating margins. Embedded in this operating margin performance is an investment in selling capabilities in key growth markets, partially offset by a reduction in G&A costs. We reported earnings per share this year of $1.85, an increase of 5% excluding the unfavorable $0.22 impact from foreign exchange translation.
Just a reminder that this 5% increase is on top of the 18% growth and record EPS in 2014, a solid indicator that we have sent Xylem on the right path to improve financial returns. Another similar indicator is our free cash flow performance. This year, we generated to $347 million, an increase of 17%. We also achieved a 105% conversion of net income.
We continue to make progress on reducing our working capital across the business. Strong focused execution, improve working capital as of a revenue 80 basis points, excluding the impact of foreign exchange translation, this improvement coupled with our commitment to accelerate capital deployment about us increase the return of capital to shareholders by 24% in 2015.
That includes our fourth consecutive dividend increase in many years and a record $175 million of share repurchases. 
Turning to Slide 7, I'll cover our fourth quarter performance.
During the fourth quarter, we booked orders of $913 million, up 1% organically. I'll cover our performance by segment in a few minutes. For now, I'll focus my commentary on our ending backlog. 
We ended 2016 with total backlog of $760 million. Excluding foreign exchange translation impact backlog is up about 4%. Of the total, roughly $575 million is due to ship in 2016 and $335 million is due to ship in the first quarter. Excluding the impact of FX translation, our current year backlog is down 2%. 
Jumping back to the fourth quarter results, we generated revenue of $994 million, down 5% versus the prior year, including a $70 million headwind from foreign exchange translation. On an organic basis, revenue was up 2%.
From an end market perspective, we saw a significant strength in both public utility and residential. Revenue from the public utility end market was up 8% with double digit growth in the U.S., Asia and the Middle East. Project deliveries on an improved U.S. market coupled with share gains drove our performance across these regions. Residential was up 10%, primarily driven by market strength and share gains in the U.S. where we have about 50% of our customer base. 
Commercial was flat for the quarter, but against a tough prior year comparison of 8% growth. The story within commercial remains the same. We continue to benefit from a steady recovery in growth within the U.S. institutional building sector. The industrial end market was down 2% due to the aforementioned oil and gas headwinds. Agriculture was down 12%.
Operating margin was flat at 14.7%, but up 20 basis points excluding the headwind from foreign exchange translation. Cost reductions including Lean Six Sigma, global procurement and business simplification savings offset inflation driving 140 basis point improvement in segment margins. 
Volume leverage on the 2% organic growth was more than offset by unfavorable mix. Wrapping up on the consolidated results, solid organic revenue growth and execution against our cost reduction initiatives resulted in EPS of $0.60, an increase of 3% before the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange translation. 
Now let me provide more detail for each of our reporting segments. Please turn to Slide 8.
Water Infrastructure recorded orders of $559 million, up 2% organically. A couple of business mix dynamics worth highlighting. First, treatment orders grew more than 20%, including a large $20 million project order in Saudi Arabia as well as an increase in both North American project activity and win rates.
Nearly offsetting order growth was the overall declining in our dewatering business, again, reflecting the oil and gas weakness. Our book to bill ratio was 0.89 in the quarter, the same as last year. 
Overall, we exited the quarter with backlog of $544 million, up 8% on an organic basis. Of this amount, approximately $430 million is due to ship in 2016 with $230 million shipping in the first quarter. This leaves us with longer term project backlog shippable in 2017 and beyond of $115 million. This is a 48% increase over what we have seen last year on an organic basis. While this is a relatively small portion of our revenue, it is a leading indicator of market health and trend stability and provide some confidence in our generally short cycle business. 
We reported revenue of $629 million, up 1% on an organic basis. Regionally, we saw growth led by the U.S. in emerging markets, up 4% and 5%, respectively. Western Europe grew a modest 1% and Canada declined 21% due to the impact of oil and gas weakness. 
I will further summarize our revenue performance as follows: transport application, which includes our water and wastewater pump dewatering business were up 2% overall. Public utility water and wastewater pump sales and services grew 11% during the quarter, demonstrating both healthy market conditions and the strength of our Flygt brand, which continues to increase at share position. We also saw a double digit growth in the public utility sector for our dewatering business, driven by a relatively large product delivery and to a lesser extent, disaster recovery services in the U.S. and U.K. 
And as we have addressed, the unfavorable impact of oil and gas dewatering applications were down nearly 40% in the quarter. Test applications finished the year with a strong, up 4% with particular strength in Europe, up 9% with growth driven by industrial lab applications and several wastewater facility projects in the Nordic countries. 
Additionally, our delivery of critical analytical instrumentation used in China's River Cleanup project drove local revenue growth 24%. Finally, treatment revenue was down 3% as we lapped a few large water project deliveries in Latin America partially offsetting these headwinds for growth in the Middle East.
We are reporting operating income for our Water Infrastructure segment of $110 million and a record quarterly operating margin of 17.5%. Performance was driven by the increase in cost reductions of $19 million driven by sourcing and Lean initiatives as well as $2 million in restructuring savings.
This increase was able to more than offset labor and material and overhead inflation as well as the unfavorable mix driven by lower dewatering rental volumes. 
Let's turn to Slide 9. Applied water recorded orders of $354 million, down 1% organically. As a reminder, this compares with 9% growth in the fourth quarter of 2014. Our book to bill ratio was 0.97 in the quarter, which is in the range we have seen over the last 4 years. 
Overall, we exited the quarter with backlog of $172 million. Of this amount, about $105 million is due to ship in the first quarter 2016, down approximately 14% on a constant currency basis, which we expect will make growth in the first quarter.
Applied water reported revenue of $365 million, up 3% on an organic basis. Regionally, we saw a strong growth in the developed markets with the U.S. and Western Europe up 5% and 4%, respectively. Emerging markets declined 4%. As expected, our biggest headwind came from China, which is down 18% after posting 16% growth over the first 9 months of the year.
I'll further summarize our revenue performance as follows: building services grew 3% as we continue to benefit from the U.S. institutional building market on the commercial side and market share gains in residential. Growth in the commercial building market was muted overall by weakness in China. Industrial water grew 5%, largely driven by project strength in the U.S. and modestly improving conditions in project shipments in Europe. 
Lastly, irrigation which represents less than 10% of applied water revenue declined 12%, driven by unfavorable weather conditions and the lapping of a strong quarter in 2014 when we delivered 25% growth. Operating margin declined 10 basis point year over year to 13.4%, including 20 basis points of headwind from foreign exchange translation. 
Material labor in overhead inflation and unfavorable mix were notable headwinds this quarter, partially offset by cost reductions.
Despite volume leverage on 3% organic growth, unfavorable mix associated with a single industrial project significantly impacted our margin performance this quarter. The applied water portion of this project was sold in a negative margin, however, the project margin for Xylem overall was positive and reflected in the Water Infrastructure segment. 
Now let's turn to Slide 10  to cover the company's full year performance by segment. Let me start first with a Water Infrastructure segment. Revenue was $2.2 billion, up 1% organically driven primarily by growth    growing strength in the public utility end market and the continued build out on water and wastewater infrastructure in emerging markets. We grew 1% in industrial, excluding the significant oil and gas headwind. Operating margin declined 10 basis points year over year to 14.2%.
While cost reductions more than offset inflation in the year, volume leverage on the 1% organic growth did not compensate for the unfavorable mix impact attributable to the significant decline in rental services to the oil and gas market. 
Moving onto the Applied Water segment. Revenue was $1.4  billion, up 3% organically due to strength in the U.S. commercial and residential markets as well as growth in industrial water applications despite facing significant oil and gas headwinds.
In commercial, 4% growth was driven by an improved U.S. institutional building market. Residential also grew 4%, a strong performance came from improvement in the home construction market and market share gains. Partially offsetting this growth was weakness in the agriculture end market, which is down 8% due to unfavorable weather conditions and the lapping of a strong prior year. 
Operating margin decreased 10 basis points year over year to 13.9% due to unfavorable foreign exchange relation impact. Excluding this impact, adjusted operating margin increased 20 basis points as cost reductions and volume leverage more than offset inflation and unfavorable mix. 
Please turn to Slide 11 and I will cover the company's financial position. Xylem maintains a strong cash position with a balance of $680 million at the end of December. We remain committed to our balanced capital deployment strategy, which is to maintain and grow the business while enhancing shareholder returns through dividends and share repurchases. 
During the fourth quarter, we paid $25 million in dividends and purchased $50 million in shares. We generated $165 million of free cash flow in the fourth quarter, largely reflecting improved working capital performance. Relative to the prior year our free cash flow performance improved by $44 million. 
Lastly, our return on invested capital decreased by 30 basis points to 10.6%, which is primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange translation. 
Now please turn to Slide 12 and I'll it back over to Patrick to cover our 2016 expectations."

As I said earlier, we believe we are well positioned to make significant progress against our top priorities in 2016 in order to drive long term profitable growth at Xylem. We're driving substantial changes at Xylem that strengthens our commercial capabilities taking specific actions to improve our customers experience at each touch point we have with them. This includes driving more expertise through industry verticals selling and simplifying our commercial processes. 
We have focused plans to accelerate growth in emerging markets, targeting increased investments of about $30 million in the Middle East, China and India. We plan to increase our R&D investment in 2016 by 30 to 50 basis points to advance innovation. And as we drive our continuous improvement work deepen into the organization, we expect our lean and global procurement initiatives to generate growth savings of $120 million, an increase of roughly 20% year over year. 
The growth rates I refer to on this slide all exclude the anticipated negative foreign exchange impacts. Looking at the year ahead, we expect to generate faster than market growth, delivering 2016 organic revenue growth of 2% to 4%. The recently completed acquisitions are expected to add an additional 1% of revenue growth.
Given that we expect stable conditions across roughly 90% of our portfolio, including growth across all geographic regions, we believe we're position to exceed market growth despite the ongoing headwinds from oil and gas and mining. Our adjusted operating margin is expected to growth in the range of 50 to 80 basis points overall despite roughly 20 basis points of margin dilution from the acquisitions of name in Thailand. This delusion is driven by purchase price accounting impacts such as noncash intangible amortization. Excluding these diluted impacts of acquisition, our operating margin is expected to expand by 70 to 100 basis points. We anticipate generating earnings per share of $1.95 to $2.05 which excludes restructuring and realignment of cost of about $25 million but this projection does include $0.04 of negative foreign currency translation impact. Excluding foreign exchange impact, EPS growth is expected to be in the range of 8% to 13%. Finally, we will continue to execute a disciplined approach to capital deployment, which is expected to result in free cash flow conversion greater than 100%. This also contemplates expected CapEx in the range of $120 million to $125 million. Please turn to Slide 13.
This slide outlines our expectations for 2016 organic revenue by end of market. Industrial, which represents 44% of total revenue is expected to be flat to up low single digits. This projection assumes low single digit growth in light industrial applications and double digit declines in oil and gas and mining applications. The public utility sector, which constitutes 33% of our total revenue, is expected to grow at a mid single digit rate. Here, we anticipate growth led by the U.S. and continued investment across emerging markets. We also expect market conditions in Europe to remain stable and at the U.K.'s multiyear 6 cycle of infrastructure investment, accelerates late in the half of the year. 
For the commercial market, we see growth in the mid single digit range. Our expectation is that growth in the U.S. institutional building market continues to be here and conditions in Europe modestly improved. Lastly, while we expect urbanization to drive growth in emerging markets such as the Middle East, we also anticipate weaker conditions in China. Residential should grow in the low to mid single digit range given by strength in the U.S. albeit at lower levels seen in 2015.
We also expect continued low single digit growth in Europe. Finally, agriculture would likely see a modest recovery from the significant weather events in 2015.

So anyway, a question I wanted to focus on first is if we should hear a bit more about this large shipment that you disclosed in the applied Water business because it sounds as though the orders and for applied in Water Infrastructure, which is good see that suggestion during cross selling, but the way the P&L gets tallied, applied ended up showing a negative margin. So kind of put this project into context, is this solution selling? Do you have other business like this? How do you net the 2 out, how does that project look?"

There's infrastructure that needs to be invested in. As you been following the water space for a long time, it's always difficult for any of us to predict the timing of when this will unlock some of the pent up demand that's out there. But I do believe that there will likely be increased regulatory scrutiny. I think that will also lead to some increase in backlog movement in various communities across the U.S. It always seems to happen slower than any of us think it should occur so it's difficult to predict kind of what time frame we think it will begin to free up.

One of the things that will benefit us in 2016, of course, is the impact in the U.K. of the infrastructure investment cycle there that you're all probably quite familiar with. That cycle was launched, I think, April 1 of this past year. It takes about 15 months or so for all the engineering and design and spec work to happen in the part of customers.

I'd say first of all, when you think about the nature of what the light industrial sector is, customers in that area are quite diverse.

Our volume there is not really like it would be in heavy industrial, it's not really tied to factory output. But it's rather more of an ongoing minimal operating costs. These are not large capital outlays that are requiring the part of our customers and so it doesn't tend to be big on the radar screen. Other than, again, they play arrow, these products play a role in helping them reduce their operating cost through energy efficiency. So we think we're pretty resilient.

Over the course of 2015, we faced a dynamic economic environment on a macrolevel and in key end markets.

Over the course of 2015, we faced a dynamic economic environment on a macrolevel and in key end markets. I'm quite pleased with our team's performance as we remain focused on executing against our long-term objectives. We responded effectively to changing conditions and ultimately closed out the year with another quarter of solid results. We delivered at or above our guidance on several key metrics. 
Organic revenue grew 2% in the quarter, resulting in 2% organic revenue growth for the full year as well. Adjusted earnings per share increased 3% to $0.60 in the quarter, excluding foreign exchange translation. This brought our full year adjusted earnings to $1.85 per share, a 5% increase year-over-year excluding foreign exchange translation, and we delivered free cash flow conversion of 105% driven by working capital improvement. Importantly, I am encouraged by the fundamentals and underlying trends impacting our business today and in the years ahead.
External factors such as steadily increasing spend on Water Infrastructure, growing demand for intelligent monitoring and control systems and climate-related initiatives that require our water expertise and ingenuity all bode well for sustained profitable growth at Xylem.
As we continue to advance the key growth initiatives we laid out during our Investor Day last year, namely stepping up our commercial leadership, driving accelerated growth in emerging markets and increasing our investment in R&D and innovation, I am confident we are well positioned to deliver that growth.
That work will be complemented by our ongoing focus on continuous improvement and business simplification, which will be significant levers for long-term value creation. Xylem has a balanced global portfolio that we expect will further benefit from a number of current and emerging trends. Here are couple of the examples. 
The perennial battle to increase spending on Water Infrastructure is gaining some traction here in the U.S. A number of efforts are underway to produce actionable plans to break through the historical barriers of financing, political risk and competing priorities. The urgency of the need is further punctuated by flashpoints such as the tragic situation in Flint, Michigan and the flooding events that continue to occur in various parts of the country. Xylem is actively engaged in several of these efforts, including those that are focused on unlocking private capital for infrastructure investment. 
In addition, on the heels on the Paris climate talks, governments around the world are developing action plans to achieve the carbon emission reduction they signed onto in that historic agreement. Given that the management of water is a notable contributor to global carbon emissions, the water industry has substantial opportunity to contribute to emission reduction goals. 
In light of that, last quarter we issued a report titled Powering the Wastewater Renaissance. This study outlines how the adoption of the readily available wastewater management technologies can cut related emissions by nearly half. The analysis further concludes that 95% of the electricity related emissions abatement can be achieved at negative or neutral cost, resulting in a win-win scenario for our customers as well as the governing bodies that are seeking viable solutions to implement in the near term. 
We believe these activities are positive indicators for the continued recovery we see in the public utility market, which constitutes roughly 1/3 of our global business. Improving market conditions and our strong execution enabled us to gain market share in this end market as we generated 8% organic growth in the fourth quarter. This follows a solid performance in the third quarter when we delivered 5% year-over-year growth.
The industrial end market is also significant for Xylem. Similar to other companies in this space, we continued to experience the impact of some negative underlying market trends. For the full year, overall industrial was down 1% organically. This, however, was largely driven by the steep declines in oil and gas, which was down 40% in 2015 with most of the impact felt in the second half of the year. 
To be clear, despite the fact that oil and gas represented a relatively small portion of our business, the combination of such a severe drop and its high profit margin resulted in a significant impact on our 2015 results. Specifically, oil and gas reduced our revenues by approximately 1%, compressed our operating margin by 40 basis points and reduced our earnings per share by $0.12. 
Looking ahead, we expect those headwinds to continue at least until we begin to lap the initial declines we first experienced in the second quarter of last year. Then, we anticipate the headwind to moderate somewhat in the second half of the year. 
Overall, we anticipate challenging conditions in oil and gas to continue, but the impact should not be as severe as it was last year. In addition, we expect ongoing headwinds in the mining sector. Collectively, these 2 sectors now represent about 8% of our total revenue. We will continue to manage and ultimately optimize efficiency and performance through the inevitable economic cycles that occur within this end market.
Fortunately, Xylem is better positioned than many. Our industrial market exposure is more heavily weighted to the light industrial sector. In fact, that represents roughly 36% of our total revenue. The benefits of this sector mix are evident in our 2015 results. 
Excluding the severe impact of the oil and gas declines, the remainder of our industrial-related business grew 2% for the full year. Driving this growth was the continued demand for industrial water applications such as pressure boosting equipment cooling and fire suppression. The critical nature of these products and services in maintaining operations creates more resilience in the light industrial sector, providing a counterweight to the cyclical volatility seen in heavy industrials. 
One final point, the leading position we have in certain consumer demand-driven applications, such as beverage dispensing and marine and RV pump applications, helped us deliver solid growth. With combined revenue of more than $120 million, these businesses grew 4% in 2015 and are well positioned to continue growing in 2016. 
From a regional perspective, we remained optimistic about the U.S. markets, particularly the public utility and commercial building sectors, which we'll address in more detail later on the call. Europe is stabilizing and we expect a more favorable outlook there. We had a strong presence in the public utility market in Europe and we're already seeing early signs of success with key product launches in the residential and commercial building sectors. 
The emerging markets present a more complex story. As all of you know, many of these markets are already showing signs of slower growth. After posting 9% organic growth during the first 9 months of the year, our businesses in emerging markets grew 2% in the fourth quarter. There are a few dynamics at play here. 
First, the 2% organic growth compared with 14% organic growth in the prior year period. Underlying this delta is a pattern of choppy project deliveries that can easily cause distortions in quarterly year-over-year growth.
Second, our Applied Water segment declined 4% in the emerging markets in the quarter, driven in part by the slowdown in China's industrial and commercial markets. However, given that our business in China is more heavily weighted to the public utility end market, we do expect continued growth ahead albeit at a slower pace than in most recent years. 
Shifting gears now. As I've mentioned previously, we are still in the early chapters of a multiyear self-help story that will enable us to drive margin expansion. Our continuous improvement initiatives, which include lean and global procurement, along with a sharper focus on driving business simplification, will result in significant operating margin improvement.
Today, G&A cost sit at 8.5% of revenue, down 120 basis points over the past 2 years, but still an opportunity. We will continue to attack these costs in 2016 and beyond as we execute the business simplification plan we laid out at Investor Day, targeting $60 million to $75 million of structural cost reductions over the next few years. Our expectation is to invest approximately $25 million in 2016 from which we anticipate realizing $8 million in savings in the second half of the year and $15 million on an annualized basis. We will touch on this in more detail later in the call.
We are driving productivity within the business so we can fund the necessary investments to achieve our longer-term objectives. This includes increasing our R&D investments for future growth, the targeted investments in the Middle East, China and India we highlighted at our Investor Day and accelerating capital deployment on 2 fronts: returning capital to shareholders and acquisitions. 
Today, we announced a 10% increase in dividend and the acquisition of Tideland Corporation, our second acquisition in as many quarters. 
Let's turn to Slide 5 and I'll cover capital deployment and the Tideland acquisition in more detail. With our strong cash flow generation and capital structure, we are well positioned to create more value for our shareholders. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 1.4 million shares for $50 million. For the full year, we repurchased 5.1 million shares for $175 million and we have about $430 million available under our authorized programs. 
We also paid $25 million in dividends to shareholders in the quarter, bringing our full year total to $102 million, reflecting a 10% increase per share year-over-year. Combined, this represents a 24% increase in return of capital to shareholders in 2015. Earlier this week, we completed our acquisition of Tideland, a leading producer of smart analytic solutions in the coastal and ocean management sectors. More specifically, the company integrate systems intelligence technologies with tools to enable a wide variety of marine and environmental monitoring capabilities to an array of customers. These offerings stood well with our existing analytics portfolio. We intend to further integrate analytics tools from our current portfolio into their systems, including a direct tie-in with our recent fourth quarter acquisition, HYPACK.
The result will be a broader range of systems intelligence solutions that we can provide to the coastal and ocean water sector. Growth in this area will continue to be driven by the customer's need to comply with increasing regulations for a variety of operations in this space.
The acquisitions of Tideland and HYPACK illustrate how we plan to bring together distinct products and services to build intelligent full systems capability and significantly expand the market we currently serve. 
With that, let me turn the call over to our Interim CFO, Shashank Patel, to walk you through the results and the company's financial position in more detail. Shashank?"

For the full year, revenue increased 2% on an organic basis, consistent with the midpoint",2079,"Thanks, Patrick, and since you already covered some of these full year highlights, I'll make specific points and then dive further into our fourth quarter results. 
For the full year, revenue increased 2% on an organic basis, consistent with the midpoint of our guidance at the beginning of last year. We saw solid growth in the public utility, commercial and residential markets, all up 4% organically. Industrial was down 1%, primarily due to the significant declines we saw in oil and gas over the second half of the year. Agriculture was down 8% as unfavorable weather, mainly the severe flooding conditions in the southern U.S., wiped out this year's season. As a reminder, agriculture represents 2% of our revenues. 
Regionally, we generated the strongest growth in the emerging markets, when we posted a 7% increase over the course of the year. China led the way here growing 14%. Worth noting is that our Water Infrastructure segment grew 17%, driving 80% of the overall growth as the local trend to invest in and improve water quality and wastewater treatment continued.
The U.S. and Western Europe markets grew -- each grew 1%. In the U.S., growth accelerated over the course of the year and hit a high for the year in the fourth quarter. Whereas, Europe was relatively stable throughout the year. Canada rounds out our geographic performance. Their significant decline in oil and gas resulted in a 13% decline in revenue. 
As for margins, productivity actions and volume leverage more than offset material labor and overhead inflation and unfavorable mix. Excluding FX translation, gross margin expanded 40 basis points and led to a 30-basis-point improvement in operating margins. Embedded in this operating margin performance is an investment in selling capabilities in key growth markets, partially offset by a reduction in G&A costs. We reported earnings per share this year of $1.85, an increase of 5% excluding the unfavorable $0.22 impact from foreign exchange translation.
Just a reminder that this 5% increase is on top of the 18% growth and record EPS in 2014, a solid indicator that we have set Xylem on the right path to improve financial returns. Another similar indicator is our free cash flow performance. This year, we generated $347 million, an increase of 17%. We also achieved a 105% conversion of net income.
We continue to make progress on reducing our working capital across the business. Strong focused execution, improve working capital as a percentage of revenue by 80 basis points, excluding the impact of foreign exchange translation. This improvement, coupled with our commitment to accelerate capital deployment, allowed us to increase the return of capital to shareholders by 24% in 2015. That includes our fourth consecutive dividend increase in as many years and a record $175 million of share repurchases. 
Turning to Slide 7, I'll cover our fourth quarter performance.
During the fourth quarter, we booked orders of $913 million, up 1% organically. I'll cover our performance by segment in a few minutes. For now, I'll focus my commentary on our ending backlog. 
We ended 2016 with total backlog of $716 million. Excluding foreign exchange translation impact, backlog is up about 4%. Of the total, roughly $575 million is due to ship in 2016 and about $335 million is due to ship in the first quarter. Excluding the impact of FX translation, our current year backlog is down 2%. 
Jumping back to the fourth quarter results, we generated revenue of $994 million, down 5% versus the prior year, including a $70 million headwind from foreign exchange translation. On an organic basis, revenue was up 2%.
From an end market perspective, we saw a significant strength in both public utility and residential. Revenue from the public utility end market was up 8% with double-digit growth in the U.S., Asia and the Middle East. Project deliveries on an improved U.S. market, coupled with share gains, drove our performance across these regions. Residential was up 10%, primarily driven by market strength and share gains in the U.S. where we have about 50% of our customer base. 
Commercial was flat for the quarter, but against a tough prior year comparison of 8% growth. The story within commercial remains the same, we continue to benefit from a steady recovery in growth within the U.S. institutional building sector. The industrial end market was down 2% due to the aforementioned oil and gas headwinds. Agriculture was down 12%.
Operating margin was flat at 14.7%, but up 20 basis points excluding the headwind from foreign exchange translation. Cost reductions, including Lean Six Sigma, global procurement and business simplification savings offset inflation, driving 140-basis-point improvement in segment margins. 
Volume leverage on the 2% organic growth was more than offset by unfavorable mix. Wrapping up on the consolidated results, solid organic revenue growth and execution against our cost-reduction initiatives resulted in EPS of $0.60, an increase of 3% before the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange translation. 
Now let me provide more detail for each of our reporting segments. Please turn to Slide 8.
Water Infrastructure recorded orders of $559 million, up 2% organically. A couple of business mix dynamics worth highlighting. First, treatment orders grew more than 20%, including a large $20 million project order in Saudi Arabia as well as an increase in both North American project activity and win rates.
Nearly offsetting order growth was the overall declining in our dewatering business, again, reflecting the oil and gas weakness. Our book-to-bill ratio was 0.89 in the quarter, the same as last year. 
Overall, we exited the quarter with backlog of $544 million, up 8% on an organic basis. Of this amount, approximately $430 million is due to ship in 2016 with $230 million shipping in the first quarter. This leaves us with longer-term project backlog shippable in 2017 and beyond of $115 million. This is a 48% increase over what we had seen last year on an organic basis. While this is a relatively small portion of our revenue, it is a leading indicator of market health and trend stability and provide some confidence in our generally short cycle business. 
We reported revenue of $629 million, up 1% on an organic basis. Regionally, we saw growth led by the U.S. in emerging markets, up 4% and 5%, respectively. Western Europe grew a modest 1% and Canada declined 21% due to the impact of oil and gas weakness. 
I will further summarize our revenue performance as follows: transport application, which includes our water and wastewater pump and dewatering business were up 2% overall. Public utility water and wastewater pump sales and services grew 11% during the quarter, demonstrating both healthy market conditions and the strength of our Flygt brand, which continues to increase at share position. We also saw a double-digit growth in the public utility sector for our dewatering business, driven by a relatively large product delivery and to a lesser extent, disaster recovery services in the U.S. and U.K.
And as we have addressed, the unfavorable impact of oil and gas dewatering applications were down nearly 40% in the quarter. Test applications finished the year with a strong, up 4% with particular strength in Europe, up 9% with growth driven by industrial lab applications and several wastewater facility projects in the Nordic countries. 
Additionally, our delivery of critical analytical instrumentation used in China's river cleanup project drove local revenue growth up by 24%. Finally, treatment revenue was down 3% as we lapped a few large water project deliveries in Latin America, partially offsetting these headwinds were growth in the Middle East.
We are reporting operating income for our Water Infrastructure segment of $110 million and a record quarterly operating margin of 17.5%. Performance was driven by the increase in cost reductions of $19 million, driven by sourcing and lean initiatives as well as $2 million in restructuring savings. This increase was able to more than offset labor and material and overhead inflation as well as the unfavorable mix driven by lower dewatering rental volumes. 
Let's turn to Slide 9. Applied water recorded orders of $354 million, down 1% organically. As a reminder, this compares with 9% growth in the fourth quarter of 2014. Our book-to-bill ratio was 0.97 in the quarter, which is in the range we had seen over the last 4 years. 
Overall, we exited the quarter with backlog of $172 million. Of this amount, about $105 million is due to ship in the first quarter of 2016, down approximately 14% on a constant-currency basis, which we expect will mute growth in the first quarter.
Applied Water reported revenue of $365 million, up 3% on an organic basis. Regionally, we saw a strong growth in the developed markets with the U.S. and Western Europe up 5% and 4%, respectively. Emerging markets declined 4%. As expected, our biggest headwind came from China, which is down 18% after posting 16% growth over the first 9 months of the year.
I'll further summarize our revenue performance as follows: building services grew 3% as we continue to benefit from the U.S. institutional building market on the commercial side and market share gains in residential. Growth in the commercial building market was muted overall by weakness in China. Industrial water grew 5%, largely driven by project strength in the U.S. and modestly improving conditions in project shipments in Europe. 
Lastly, irrigation which represents less than 10% of Applied Water revenue declined 12%, driven by unfavorable weather conditions and the lapping of a strong quarter in 2014 when we delivered 25% growth. Operating margin declined 10 basis points year-over-year to 13.4%, including 20 basis points of headwind from foreign exchange translation. 
Material labor in overhead inflation and unfavorable mix were notable headwinds this quarter, partially offset by cost reductions.
Despite volume leverage on 3% organic growth, unfavorable mix associated with a single industrial project significantly impacted our margin performance this quarter. The Applied Water portion of this project was sold at a negative margin. However, the project margin for Xylem overall was positive and reflected in the Water Infrastructure segment. 
Now let's turn to Slide 10  to cover the company's full year performance by segment. Let me start first with the Water Infrastructure segment. Revenue was $2.2 billion, up 1% organically driven primarily by growth strength -- growing strength in the public utility end market in the U.S. and the continued build-out of water and wastewater infrastructure in the emerging markets. We grew 1% in industrial, excluding the significant oil and gas headwind. Operating margin declined 10 basis points year-over-year to 14.2%.
While cost reductions more than offset inflation in the year, volume leverage on the 1% organic growth did not compensate for the unfavorable mix impact attributable to the significant decline in rental services to the oil and gas market. 
Moving on to the Applied Water segment. Revenue was $1.4  billion, up 3% organically due to strength in the U.S. commercial and residential markets as well as growth in industrial water applications despite facing significant oil and gas headwinds.
In commercial, 4% growth was driven by an improved U.S. institutional building market. Residential also grew 4%, a strong performance came from improvement in the home construction market and market share gains. Partially offsetting this growth was weakness in the agriculture end market, which is down 8% due to unfavorable weather conditions and the lapping of a strong prior year. 
Operating margin decreased 10 basis points year-over-year to 13.9% due to unfavorable foreign exchange relation impact. Excluding this impact, adjusted operating margin increased 20 basis points as cost reductions and volume leverage more than offset inflation and unfavorable mix. 
Please turn to Slide 11 and I will cover the company's financial position. Xylem maintains a strong cash position with a balance of $680 million at the end of December. We remain committed to our balanced capital deployment strategy, which is to maintain and grow the business while enhancing shareholder returns through dividends and share repurchases. 
During the fourth quarter, we paid $25 million in dividends and purchased $50 million in shares. We generated $165 million of free cash flow in the fourth quarter, largely reflecting improved working capital performance. Relative to the prior year our free cash flow performance improved by $44 million. 
Lastly, our return on investment -- invested capital decreased by 30 basis points to 10.6%, which is primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange translation. 
Now please turn to Slide 12 and I'll turn it back over to Patrick to cover our 2016 expectations."

As I said earlier, we believe we are well positioned to make significant progress against our top priorities in 2016 in order to drive long-term profitable growth at Xylem. We're driving substantial changes at Xylem to strengthen our commercial capabilities, taking specific actions to improve our customer's experience at each touch point we have with them. This includes driving more expertise through industry vertical selling and simplifying our commercial processes. 
We have focused plans to accelerate growth in emerging markets, targeting increased investment of about $30 million in the Middle East, China and India. We plan to increase our R&D investment in 2016 by 30 to 50 basis points to advance innovation. And as we drive our continuous improvement work deeper into the organization, we expect our lean and global procurement initiatives to generate growth savings of $120 million, an increase of roughly 20% year-over-year. 
The growth rates I refer to on this slide all exclude the anticipated negative foreign exchange impacts. Looking at the year ahead, we expect to generate faster-than-market growth, delivering 2016 organic revenue growth of 2% to 4%. The recently completed acquisitions are expected to add an additional 1% of revenue growth.
Given that we expect stable conditions across roughly 90% of our portfolio, including growth across all geographic regions, we believe we are positioned to exceed market growth despite the ongoing headwinds from oil and gas and mining. Our adjusted operating margin is expected to grow in the range of 50 to 80 basis points overall despite roughly 20 basis points of margin dilution from the acquisitions of HYPACK in Thailand. This dilution is driven by purchase price accounting impacts such as noncash intangible amortization. Excluding these diluted impacts of acquisitions, our operating margin is expected to expand by 70 to 100 basis points. We anticipate generating earnings per share of $1.95 to $2.05 which excludes restructuring and realignment of cost of about $25 million, but this projection does include $0.04 of negative foreign currency translation impact. Excluding foreign exchange impact, EPS growth is expected to be in the range of 8% to 13%. Finally, we will continue to execute a disciplined approach to capital deployment, which is expected to result in free cash flow conversion greater than 100%. This also contemplates expected CapEx in the range of $120 million to $125 million. Please turn to Slide 13.
This slide outlines our expectations for 2016 organic revenue by end of market. Industrial, which represents 44% of total revenue, is expected to be flat to up low single digits. This projection assumes low single-digit growth in light industrial applications and double-digit declines in oil and gas and mining applications. The public utility sector, which constitutes 33% of our total revenue, is expected to grow at a mid-single digit rate. Here, we anticipate growth led by the U.S. and continued investment across emerging markets. We also expect market conditions in Europe to remain stable and at the U.K.'s multiyear AMP6 cycle of infrastructure investment, accelerates late in the half of the year. 
For the commercial market, we see growth in the mid-single digit range. Our expectation is that growth in the U.S. institutional building market continues through the year and that conditions in Europe modestly improved. Lastly, while we expect urbanization to drive growth in emerging markets such as the Middle East, we also anticipate weaker conditions in China. Residential should grow in the low to mid-single-digit range, driven by strength in the U.S. albeit at lower levels seen in 2015.
We also expect continued low single-digit growth in Europe. Finally, agriculture would likely see a modest recovery from the significant weather events in 2015.

So hopefully, you still have some feel-good left for the rest of the quarters in 2016. So anyway, the question I wanted to focus on first is if we should be hearing a bit more about this large shipment that you disclosed in the Applied Water business because it sounds as though the order span of Applied and Water Infrastructure, which is good see. That suggests you're doing cross-selling, but the way the P&L gets tallied, Applied ended up showing a negative margin. So kind of put this project into context, is this solution selling? Do you have other business like this? And how do you -- if you net the 2 out, how does that project look?"

Well, thanks for the comments. Opening there, Deane as well. We appreciate it. On this project -- this is a project actually that had been in backlog for multiple years and there have been some delays in the customer job site in terms of ultimately delivering it. So it's been in backlog for more than a couple of years. The margin was net positive and attractive for us. I wouldn't say we have other projects like this that are out there. I mean, it was fine. It was an element of some solution-sell. It was a bundled offering for an LNG application, but again, it's a bit of a one-off. It's a large project and it's kind of spanned over a few quarters here in terms of shipping it out."

As you'll recall, we had similar situations albeit maybe different causes in Toledo not long before that and you've got a number of these floods -- flooding conditions that we see from a resilience standpoint. There's infrastructure that needs to be invested in. As you've been following the water space for a long time, it's always difficult for any of us to predict the timing of when this will unlock some of the pent-up demand that's out there. But I do believe that there will likely be increased regulatory scrutiny. I think that will also lead to some increase in backlog movement in various communities across the U.S. It always seems to happen slower than any of us think it should occur. And so it's difficult to predict kind of what time frame we think it will begin to free up. But I do think this will be a collection of flashpoints that begins moving forward."

One of the things that will benefit us in 2016, of course, is the impact in the U.K. of the AMP6 infrastructure investment cycle there that you're all probably quite familiar with.

I'd say first of all, when you think about the nature of what the light industrial sector is, customers in that area are quite diverse, but across the board, they are very much focused in on energy efficiency to reduce their operating costs. Our volume there is not really like it would be in heavy industries. It's not really tied to factory output, but it's rather more of an ongoing minimal operating cost. These are not large capital outlays that are requiring the part of our customers and so it doesn't tend to be big on the radar screen other than, again, they play a role. These products play a role in helping them reduce their operating cost through energy efficiency. So we think we're pretty resilient.

Over the course of 2015, we faced a dynamic economic environment on a macro level and in key end markets. I'm quite pleased with our team's performance as we remain focused on executing against our long-term objectives. We responded effectively to changing conditions and ultimately closed out the year with another quarter of solid results. We delivered at or above our guidance on several key metrics. 
Organic revenue grew 2% in the quarter, resulting in 2% organic revenue growth for the full year as well. Adjusted earnings per share increased 3% to $0.60 in the quarter, excluding foreign exchange translation. This brought our full year adjusted earnings to $1.85 per share, a 5% increase year-over-year excluding foreign exchange translation, and we delivered free cash flow conversion of 105% driven by working capital improvement. Importantly, I am encouraged by the fundamentals and underlying trends impacting our business today and in the years ahead.
External factors such as steadily increasing spend on Water Infrastructure, growing demand for intelligent monitoring and control systems and climate-related initiatives that require our water expertise and ingenuity all bode well for sustained profitable growth at Xylem.
As we continue to advance the key growth initiatives we laid out during our Investor Day last year, namely stepping up our commercial leadership, driving accelerated growth in emerging markets and increasing our investment in R&D and innovation, I am confident we are well positioned to deliver that growth.
That work will be complemented by our ongoing focus on continuous improvement and business simplification, which will be significant levers for long-term value creation. Xylem has a balanced global portfolio that we expect will further benefit from a number of current and emerging trends. Here are couple of the examples. 
The perennial battle to increase spending on Water Infrastructure is gaining some traction here in the U.S. A number of efforts are underway to produce actionable plans to break through the historical barriers of financing, political risk and competing priorities. The urgency of the need is further punctuated by flashpoints such as the tragic situation in Flint, Michigan and the flooding events that continue to occur in various parts of the country. Xylem is actively engaged in several of these efforts, including those that are focused on unlocking private capital for infrastructure investment. 
In addition, on the heels on the Paris climate talks, governments around the world are developing action plans to achieve the carbon emission reduction they signed onto in that historic agreement. Given that the management of water is a notable contributor to global carbon emissions, the water industry has substantial opportunity to contribute to emission reduction goals. 
In light of that, last quarter we issued a report titled Powering the Wastewater Renaissance. This study outlines how the adoption of the readily available wastewater management technologies can cut related emissions by nearly half. The analysis further concludes that 95% of the electricity related emissions abatement can be achieved at negative or neutral cost, resulting in a win-win scenario for our customers as well as the governing bodies that are seeking viable solutions to implement in the near term. 
We believe these activities are positive indicators for the continued recovery we see in the public utility market, which constitutes roughly 1/3 of our global business. Improving market conditions and our strong execution enabled us to gain market share in this end market as we generated 8% organic growth in the fourth quarter. This follows a solid performance in the third quarter when we delivered 5% year-over-year growth.
The industrial end market is also significant for Xylem. Similar to other companies in this space, we continued to experience the impact of some negative underlying market trends. For the full year, overall industrial was down 1% organically. This, however, was largely driven by the steep declines in oil and gas, which was down 40% in 2015 with most of the impact felt in the second half of the year. 
To be clear, despite the fact that oil and gas represented a relatively small portion of our business, the combination of such a severe drop and its high profit margin resulted in a significant impact on our 2015 results. Specifically, oil and gas reduced our revenues by approximately 1%, compressed our operating margin by 40 basis points and reduced our earnings per share by $0.12. 
Looking ahead, we expect those headwinds to continue at least until we begin to lap the initial declines we first experienced in the second quarter of last year. Then, we anticipate the headwind to moderate somewhat in the second half of the year. 
Overall, we anticipate challenging conditions in oil and gas to continue, but the impact should not be as severe as it was last year. In addition, we expect ongoing headwinds in the mining sector. Collectively, these 2 sectors now represent about 8% of our total revenue. We will continue to manage and ultimately optimize efficiency and performance through the inevitable economic cycles that occur within this end market.
Fortunately, Xylem is better positioned than many. Our industrial market exposure is more heavily weighted to the light industrial sector. In fact, that represents roughly 36% of our total revenue. The benefits of this sector mix are evident in our 2015 results. 
Excluding the severe impact of the oil and gas declines, the remainder of our industrial-related business grew 2% for the full year. Driving this growth was the continued demand for industrial water applications such as pressure boosting, equipment cooling and fire suppression. The critical nature of these products and services in maintaining operations creates more resilience in the light industrial sector, providing a counterweight to the cyclical volatility seen in heavy industrials. 
One final point, the leading position we have in certain consumer demand-driven applications, such as beverage dispensing and marine and RV pump applications, helped us deliver solid growth. With combined revenue of more than $120 million, these businesses grew 4% in 2015 and are well positioned to continue growing in 2016. 
From a regional perspective, we remained optimistic about the U.S. markets, particularly the public utility and commercial building sectors, which we'll address in more detail later on the call. Europe is stabilizing and we expect a more favorable outlook there. We had a strong presence in the public utility market in Europe and we're already seeing early signs of success with key product launches in the residential and commercial building sectors. 
The emerging markets present a more complex story. As all of you know, many of these markets are already showing signs of slower growth. After posting 9% organic growth during the first 9 months of the year, our businesses in emerging markets grew 2% in the fourth quarter. There are a few dynamics at play here. 
First, the 2% organic growth compared with 14% organic growth in the prior year period. Underlying this delta is a pattern of choppy project deliveries that can easily cause distortions in quarterly year-over-year growth.
Second, our Applied Water segment declined 4% in the emerging markets in the quarter, driven in part by the slowdown in China's industrial and commercial markets. However, given that our business in China is more heavily weighted to the public utility end market, we do expect continued growth ahead albeit at a slower pace than in most recent years. 
Shifting gears now. As I've mentioned previously, we are still in the early chapters of a multiyear self-help story that will enable us to drive margin expansion. Our continuous improvement initiatives, which include lean and global procurement, along with a sharper focus on driving business simplification, will result in significant operating margin improvement.
Today, G&A cost sit at 8.5% of revenue, down 120 basis points over the past 2 years, but still an opportunity. We will continue to attack these costs in 2016 and beyond as we execute the business simplification plan we laid out at Investor Day, targeting $60 million to $75 million of structural cost reductions over the next few years. Our expectation is to invest approximately $25 million in 2016 from which we anticipate realizing $8 million in savings in the second half of the year and $15 million on an annualized basis. We will touch on this in more detail later in the call.
We are driving productivity within the business so we can fund the necessary investments to achieve our longer-term objectives. This includes increasing our R&D investments for future growth, the targeted investments in the Middle East, China and India we highlighted at our Investor Day and accelerating capital deployment on 2 fronts: returning capital to shareholders and acquisitions. 
Today, we announced a 10% increase in dividend and the acquisition of Tideland Corporation, our second acquisition in as many quarters. 
Let's turn to Slide 5 and I'll cover capital deployment and the Tideland acquisition in more detail. With our strong cash flow generation and capital structure, we are well positioned to create more value for our shareholders. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 1.4 million shares for $50 million. For the full year, we repurchased 5.1 million shares for $175 million and we have about $430 million available under our authorized programs. 
We also paid $25 million in dividends to shareholders in the quarter, bringing our full year total to $102 million, reflecting a 10% increase per share year-over-year. Combined, this represents a 24% increase in return of capital to shareholders in 2015. Earlier this week, we completed our acquisition of Tideland, a leading producer of smart analytic solutions in the coastal and ocean management sectors. More specifically, the company integrate systems intelligence technologies with tools to enable a wide variety of marine and environmental monitoring capabilities to an array of customers. These offerings stood well with our existing analytics portfolio. We intend to further integrate analytics tools from our current portfolio into their systems, including a direct tie-in with our recent fourth quarter acquisition, HYPACK.
The result will be a broader range of systems intelligence solutions that we can provide to the coastal and ocean water sector. Growth in this area will continue to be driven by the customer's need to comply with increasing regulations for a variety of operations in this space.
The acquisitions of Tideland and HYPACK illustrate how we plan to bring together distinct products and services to build intelligent full systems capability and significantly expand the market we currently serve. 
With that, let me turn the call over to our Interim CFO, Shashank Patel, to walk you through the results and the company's financial position in more detail. Shashank?"

For the full year, revenue increased 2% on an organic basis, consistent with the midpoint",2082,"Thanks, Patrick, and since you already covered some of these full year highlights, I'll make specific points and then dive further into our fourth quarter results. 
For the full year, revenue increased 2% on an organic basis, consistent with the midpoint of our guidance at the beginning of last year. We saw solid growth in the public utility, commercial and residential markets, all up 4% organically. Industrial was down 1%, primarily due to the significant declines we saw in oil and gas over the second half of the year. Agriculture was down 8% as unfavorable weather, mainly the severe flooding conditions in the southern U.S., wiped out this year's season. As a reminder, agriculture represents 2% of our revenues. 
Regionally, we generated the strongest growth in the emerging markets, when we posted a 7% increase over the course of the year. China led the way here growing 14%. Worth noting is that our Water Infrastructure segment grew 17%, driving 80% of the overall growth as the local trend to invest in and improve water quality and wastewater treatment continued.
The U.S. and Western Europe markets grew -- each grew 1%. In the U.S., growth accelerated over the course of the year and hit a high for the year in the fourth quarter. Whereas, Europe was relatively stable throughout the year. Canada rounds out our geographic performance. Their significant decline in oil and gas resulted in a 13% decline in revenue. 
As for margins, productivity actions and volume leverage more than offset material labor and overhead inflation and unfavorable mix. Excluding FX translation, gross margin expanded 40 basis points and led to a 30-basis-point improvement in operating margins. Embedded in this operating margin performance is an investment in selling capabilities in key growth markets, partially offset by a reduction in G&A costs. We reported earnings per share this year of $1.85, an increase of 5% excluding the unfavorable $0.22 impact from foreign exchange translation.
Just a reminder that this 5% increase is on top of the 18% growth and record EPS in 2014, a solid indicator that we have set Xylem on the right path to improve financial returns. Another similar indicator is our free cash flow performance. This year, we generated $347 million, an increase of 17%. We also achieved a 105% conversion of net income.
We continue to make progress on reducing our working capital across the business. Strong focused execution, improve working capital as a percentage of revenue by 80 basis points, excluding the impact of foreign exchange translation. This improvement, coupled with our commitment to accelerate capital deployment, allowed us to increase the return of capital to shareholders by 24% in 2015. That includes our fourth consecutive dividend increase in as many years and a record $175 million of share repurchases. 
Turning to Slide 7, I'll cover our fourth quarter performance.
During the fourth quarter, we booked orders of $913 million, up 1% organically. I'll cover our performance by segment in a few minutes. For now, I'll focus my commentary on our ending backlog. 
We entered 2016 with total backlog of $716 million. Excluding foreign exchange translation impact, backlog is up about 4%. Of the total, roughly $575 million is due to ship in 2016 and about $335 million is due to ship in the first quarter. Excluding the impact of FX translation, our current year backlog is down 2%. 
Jumping back to the fourth quarter results, we generated revenue of $994 million, down 5% versus the prior year, including a $70 million headwind from foreign exchange translation. On an organic basis, revenue was up 2%.
From an end market perspective, we saw a significant strength in both public utility and residential. Revenue from the public utility end market was up 8% with double-digit growth in the U.S., Asia and the Middle East. Project deliveries and an improved U.S. market, coupled with share gains, drove our performance across these regions. Residential was up 10%, primarily driven by market strength and share gains in the U.S. where we have about 50% of our customer base. 
Commercial was flat for the quarter, but against a tough prior year comparison of 8% growth. The story within commercial remains the same, we continue to benefit from a steady recovery in growth within the U.S. institutional building sector. The industrial end market was down 2% due to the aforementioned oil and gas headwinds. Agriculture was down 12%.
Operating margin was flat at 14.7%, but up 20 basis points excluding the headwind from foreign exchange translation. Cost reductions, including Lean Six Sigma, global procurement and business simplification savings offset inflation, driving 140-basis-point improvement in segment margins. 
Volume leverage on the 2% organic growth was more than offset by unfavorable mix. Wrapping up on the consolidated results, solid organic revenue growth and execution against our cost-reduction initiatives resulted in EPS of $0.60, an increase of 3% before the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange translation. 
Now let me provide more detail for each of our reporting segments. Please turn to Slide 8.
Water Infrastructure recorded orders of $559 million, up 2% organically. A couple of business mix dynamics worth highlighting. First, treatment orders grew more than 20%, including a large $13 million project order in Saudi Arabia as well as an increase in both North American project activity and win rates.
Nearly offsetting order growth was the overall declining in our dewatering business, again, reflecting the oil and gas weakness. Our book-to-bill ratio was 0.89 in the quarter, the same as last year. 
Overall, we exited the quarter with backlog of $544 million, up 8% on an organic basis. Of this amount, approximately $430 million is due to ship in 2016 with $230 million shipping in the first quarter. This leaves us with longer-term project backlog shippable in 2017 and beyond of $115 million. This is a 48% increase over what we had seen last year on an organic basis. While this is a relatively small portion of our revenue, it is a leading indicator of market health and trend stability and provide some confidence in our generally short cycle business. 
We reported revenue of $629 million, up 1% on an organic basis. Regionally, we saw growth led by the U.S. and emerging markets, up 4% and 5%, respectively. Western Europe grew a modest 1% and Canada declined 21% due to the impact of oil and gas weakness. 
I will further summarize our revenue performance as follows: transport application, which includes our water and wastewater pump and dewatering business were up 2% overall. Public utility water and wastewater pump sales and services grew 11% during the quarter, demonstrating both healthy market conditions and the strength of our Flygt brand, which continues to increase its share position. We also saw a double-digit growth in the public utility sector for our dewatering business, driven by a relatively large product delivery and to a lesser extent, disaster recovery services in the U.S. and U.K.
And as we have addressed, the unfavorable impact of oil and gas dewatering applications were down nearly 40% in the quarter. Test applications finished the year with a strong, up 4% with particular strength in Europe, up 9% with growth driven by industrial lab applications and several wastewater facility projects in the Nordic countries. 
Additionally, our delivery of critical analytical instrumentation used in China's river cleanup project drove local revenue growth up by 24%. Finally, treatment revenue was down 3% as we lapped a few large water project deliveries in Latin America, partially offsetting these headwinds were growth in the Middle East.
We are reporting operating income for our Water Infrastructure segment of $110 million and a record quarterly operating margin of 17.5%. Performance was driven by the increase in cost reductions of $19 million, driven by sourcing and lean initiatives as well as $2 million in restructuring savings. This increase was able to more than offset labor and material and overhead inflation as well as the unfavorable mix driven by lower dewatering rental volumes. 
Let's turn to Slide 9. Applied water recorded orders of $354 million, down 1% organically. As a reminder, this compares with 9% growth in the fourth quarter of 2014. Our book-to-bill ratio was 0.97 in the quarter, which is in the range we had seen over the last 4 years. 
Overall, we exited the quarter with backlog of $172 million. Of this amount, about $105 million is due to ship in the first quarter of 2016, down approximately 14% on a constant-currency basis, which we expect will mute growth in the first quarter.
Applied Water reported revenue of $365 million, up 3% on an organic basis. Regionally, we saw a strong growth in the developed markets with the U.S. and Western Europe up 5% and 4%, respectively. Emerging markets declined 4%. As expected, our biggest headwind came from China, which is down 18% after posting 16% growth over the first 9 months of the year.
I'll further summarize our revenue performance as follows: building services grew 3% as we continue to benefit from the U.S. institutional building market on the commercial side and market share gains in residential. Growth in the commercial building market was muted overall by weakness in China. Industrial water grew 5%, largely driven by project strength in the U.S. and modestly improving conditions in project shipments in Europe. 
Lastly, irrigation which represents less than 10% of Applied Water revenue declined 12%, driven by unfavorable weather conditions and the lapping of a strong quarter in 2014 when we delivered 25% growth. Operating margin declined 10 basis points year-over-year to 13.4%, including 20 basis points of headwind from foreign exchange translation. 
Material, labor and overhead inflation and unfavorable mix were notable headwinds this quarter, partially offset by cost reductions.
Despite volume leverage on an average on 3% organic growth, unfavorable mix associated with a single industrial project significantly impacted our margin performance this quarter. The Applied Water portion of this project was sold at a negative margin. However, the project margin for Xylem overall was positive and reflected in the Water Infrastructure segment. 
Now let's turn to Slide 10  to cover the company's full year performance by segment. Let me start first with the Water Infrastructure segment. Revenue was $2.2 billion, up 1% organically driven primarily by growth strength -- growing strength in the public utility end market in the U.S. and the continued build-out of water and wastewater infrastructure in the emerging markets. We grew 1% in industrial, excluding the significant oil and gas headwind. Operating margin declined 10 basis points year-over-year to 14.2%.
While cost reductions more than offset inflation in the year, volume leverage on the 1% organic growth did not compensate for the unfavorable mix impact attributable to the significant decline in rental services to the oil and gas market. 
Moving on to the Applied Water segment. Revenue was $1.4  billion, up 3% organically due to strength in the U.S. commercial and residential markets as well as growth in industrial water applications despite facing significant oil and gas headwinds.
In commercial, 4% growth was driven by an improved U.S. institutional building market. Residential also grew 4%, a strong performance came from improvement in the home construction market and market share gains. Partially offsetting this growth was weakness in the agriculture end market, which is down 8% due to unfavorable weather conditions and the lapping of a strong prior year. 
Operating margin decreased 10 basis points year-over-year to 13.9% due to unfavorable foreign exchange translation impact. Excluding this impact, adjusted operating margin increased 20 basis points as cost reductions and volume leverage more than offset inflation and unfavorable mix. 
Please turn to Slide 11 and I will cover the company's financial position. Xylem maintains a strong cash position with a balance of $680 million at the end of December. We remain committed to our balanced capital deployment strategy, which is to maintain and grow the business while enhancing shareholder returns through dividends and share repurchases. 
During the fourth quarter, we paid $25 million in dividends and purchased $50 million in shares. We generated $165 million of free cash flow in the fourth quarter, largely reflecting improved working capital performance. Relative to the prior year our free cash flow performance improved by $44 million. 
Lastly, our return on investment -- invested capital decreased by 30 basis points to 10.6%, which is primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange translation. 
Now please turn to Slide 12 and I'll turn it back over to Patrick to cover our 2016 expectations."

As I said earlier, we believe we are well positioned to make significant progress against our top priorities in 2016 in order to drive long-term profitable growth at Xylem. We're driving substantial changes at Xylem to strengthen our commercial capabilities, taking specific actions to improve our customer's experience at each touch point we have with them. This includes driving more expertise through industry vertical selling and simplifying our commercial processes. 
We have focused plans to accelerate growth in emerging markets, targeting increased investment of about $30 million in the Middle East, China and India. We plan to increase our R&D investment in 2016 by 30 to 50 basis points to advance innovation. And as we drive our continuous improvement work deeper into the organization, we expect our lean and global procurement initiatives to generate gross savings of $120 million, an increase of roughly 20% year-over-year. 
The growth rates I refer to on this slide all exclude the anticipated negative foreign exchange impacts. Looking at the year ahead, we expect to generate faster-than-market growth, delivering 2016 organic revenue growth of 2% to 4%. The recently completed acquisitions are expected to add an additional 1% of revenue growth.
Given that we expect stable conditions across roughly 90% of our portfolio, including growth across all geographic regions, we believe we are positioned to exceed market growth despite the ongoing headwinds from oil and gas and mining. Our adjusted operating margin is expected to grow in the range of 50 to 80 basis points overall despite roughly 20 basis points of margin dilution from the acquisitions of HYPACK in Thailand. This dilution is driven by purchase price accounting impacts such as noncash intangible amortization. Excluding these diluted impacts of acquisitions, our operating margin is expected to expand by 70 to 100 basis points. We anticipate generating earnings per share of $1.95 to $2.05 which excludes restructuring and realignment cost of about $25 million, but this projection does include $0.04 of negative foreign currency translation impact. Excluding foreign exchange impact, EPS growth is expected to be in the range of 8% to 13%. Finally, we will continue to execute a disciplined approach to capital deployment, which is expected to result in free cash flow conversion greater than 100%. This also contemplates expected CapEx in the range of $120 million to $125 million. Please turn to Slide 13.
This slide outlines our expectations for 2016 organic revenue by end of market. Industrial, which represents 44% of total revenue, is expected to be flat to up low single digits. This projection assumes low single-digit growth in light industrial applications and double-digit declines in oil and gas and mining applications. The public utility sector, which constitutes 33% of our total revenue, is expected to grow at a mid-single digit rate. Here, we anticipate growth led by the U.S. and continued investment across emerging markets. We also expect market conditions in Europe to remain stable and that the U.K.'s multiyear AMP6 cycle of infrastructure investment, accelerates late in the half of the year. 
For the commercial market, we see growth in the mid-single digit range. Our expectation is that growth in the U.S. institutional building market continues through the year and that conditions in Europe modestly improved. Lastly, while we expect urbanization to drive growth in emerging markets such as the Middle East, we also anticipate weaker conditions in China. Residential should grow in the low to mid-single-digit range, driven by strength in the U.S. albeit at lower levels than seen in 2015.
We also expect continued low single-digit growth in Europe. Finally, agriculture would likely see a modest recovery from the significant weather events in 2015.

So we had a strong finish in 2015 as we face some challenging conditions. Again, I want to thank our team for their performance as their focused execution against our strategic priorities helped us to deliver on the commitments we set forth at the beginning of 2015. I am confident in their ability and commitment to deliver against our organic growth targets and margin expansion opportunities. 
Xylem is in a very strong financial position and we will continue to drive our balanced and accelerated capital deployment plans. I am very encouraged as I look ahead to 2016 and beyond. No doubt, there are challenges in the near term, but I am confident that  our team will continue to execute with operational discipline to drive our success. That commitment and focus will provide the foundation for future growth for Xylem and our shareholders. 
With that, operator, we're ready to open the line for questions."

So hopefully, you still have some feel-good left for the rest of the quarters in 2016. So anyway, the question I wanted to focus on first is if we should be hearing a bit more about this large shipment that you disclosed in the Applied Water business because it sounds as though the order spanned both Applied and Water Infrastructure, which is good see. That suggests you're doing cross-selling, but the way the P&L gets tallied, Applied ended up showing a negative margin. So kind of put this project into context, is this solution selling? Do you have other business like this? And how do you -- if you net the 2 out, how does that project look?"

Well, thanks for the comments. Opening there, Deane as well. We appreciate it. On this project -- this is a project actually that had been in backlog for multiple years and there have been some delays in the customer job site in terms of ultimately delivering it. So it's been in backlog for more than a couple of years. The margin was net positive and attractive for us. I wouldn't say we have other projects like this that are out there. I mean, it was fine. It was an element of some solution-sell. It was a bundled offering for an LNG application, but again, it's a bit of a one-off. It's a large project and it's kind of spanned over a few quarters here in terms of shipping it out."

As you'll recall, we had similar situations albeit maybe different causes in Toledo not long before that and you've got a number of these floods -- flooding conditions that we see from a resilience standpoint. There's infrastructure that needs to be invested in. As you've been following the water space for a long time, it's always difficult for any of us to predict the timing of when this will unlock some of the pent-up demand that's out there. But I do believe that there will likely be increased regulatory scrutiny. I think that will also lead to some increase in backlog movement in various communities across the U.S. It always seems to happen slower than any of us think it should occur. And so it's difficult to predict kind of what time frame we think it will begin to free up. But I do think this will be a collection of flashpoints that begins moving forward."

I'd say first of all, when you think about the nature of what the light industrial sector is, customers in that area are quite diverse, but across the board, they are very much focused in on energy efficiency to reduce their operating costs. Our volume there is not really like it would be in heavy industries. It's not really tied to factory output, but it's rather more of an ongoing minimal operating cost. These are not large capital outlays that are requiring the part of our customers and so it doesn't tend to be big on their radar screen other than, again, they play a role. These products play a role in helping them reduce their operating cost through energy efficiency. So we think we're pretty resilient.

Over the course of 2015, we faced a dynamic economic environment on a macro level and in key end markets. I'm quite pleased with our team's performance as we remain focused on executing against our long-term obj",1763,"Thanks, Phil, and good morning, everyone. 
Over the course of 2015, we faced a dynamic economic environment on a macro level and in key end markets. I'm quite pleased with our team's performance as we remain focused on executing against our long-term objectives. We responded effectively to changing conditions and ultimately closed out the year with another quarter of solid results. We delivered at or above our guidance on several key metrics. 
Organic revenue grew 2% in the quarter, resulting in 2% organic revenue growth for the full year as well. Adjusted earnings per share increased 3% to $0.60 in the quarter, excluding foreign exchange translation. This brought our full year adjusted earnings to $1.85 per share, a 5% increase year-over-year excluding foreign exchange translation, and we delivered free cash flow conversion of 105% driven by working capital improvement. Importantly, I am encouraged by the fundamentals and underlying trends impacting our business today and in the years ahead.
External factors such as steadily increasing spend on Water Infrastructure, growing demand for intelligent monitoring and control systems and climate-related initiatives that require our water expertise and ingenuity all bode well for sustained profitable growth at Xylem.
As we continue to advance the key growth initiatives we laid out during our Investor Day last year, namely stepping up our commercial leadership, driving accelerated growth in emerging markets and increasing our investment in R&D and innovation, I am confident we are well positioned to deliver that growth.
That work will be complemented by our ongoing focus on continuous improvement and business simplification, which will be significant levers for long-term value creation. Xylem has a balanced global portfolio that we expect will further benefit from a number of current and emerging trends. Here are couple of the examples. 
The perennial battle to increase spending on Water Infrastructure is gaining some traction here in the U.S. A number of efforts are underway to produce actionable plans to break through the historical barriers of financing, political risk and competing priorities. The urgency of the need is further punctuated by flashpoints such as the tragic situation in Flint, Michigan and the flooding events that continue to occur in various parts of the country. Xylem is actively engaged in several of these efforts, including those that are focused on unlocking private capital for infrastructure investment. 
In addition, on the heels on the Paris climate talks, governments around the world are developing action plans to achieve the carbon emission reduction they signed onto in that historic agreement. Given that the management of water is a notable contributor to global carbon emissions, the water industry has substantial opportunity to contribute to emission reduction goals. 
In light of that, last quarter we issued a report titled Powering the Wastewater Renaissance. This study outlines how the adoption of the readily available wastewater management technologies can cut related emissions by nearly half. The analysis further concludes that 95% of the electricity related emissions abatement can be achieved at negative or neutral cost, resulting in a win-win scenario for our customers as well as the governing bodies that are seeking viable solutions to implement in the near term. 
We believe these activities are positive indicators for the continued recovery we see in the public utility market, which constitutes roughly 1/3 of our global business. Improving market conditions and our strong execution enabled us to gain market share in this end market as we generated 8% organic growth in the fourth quarter. This follows a solid performance in the third quarter when we delivered 5% year-over-year growth.
The industrial end market is also significant for Xylem. Similar to other companies in this space, we continued to experience the impact of some negative underlying market trends. For the full year, overall industrial was down 1% organically. This, however, was largely driven by the steep declines in oil and gas, which was down 40% in 2015 with most of the impact felt in the second half of the year. 
To be clear, despite the fact that oil and gas represented a relatively small portion of our business, the combination of such a severe drop and its high profit margin resulted in a significant impact on our 2015 results. Specifically, oil and gas reduced our revenues by approximately 1%, compressed our operating margin by 40 basis points and reduced our earnings per share by $0.12. 
Looking ahead, we expect those headwinds to continue at least until we begin to lap the initial declines we first experienced in the second quarter of last year. Then, we anticipate the headwind to moderate somewhat in the second half of the year. 
Overall, we anticipate challenging conditions in oil and gas to continue, but the impact should not be as severe as it was last year. In addition, we expect ongoing headwinds in the mining sector. Collectively, these 2 sectors now represent about 8% of our total revenue. We will continue to manage and ultimately optimize efficiency and performance through the inevitable economic cycles that occur within this end market.
Fortunately, Xylem is better positioned than many. Our industrial market exposure is more heavily weighted to the light industrial sector. In fact, that represents roughly 36% of our total revenue. The benefits of this sector mix are evident in our 2015 results. 
Excluding the severe impact of the oil and gas declines, the remainder of our industrial-related business grew 2% for the full year. Driving this growth was the continued demand for industrial water applications such as pressure boosting, equipment cooling and fire suppression. The critical nature of these products and services in maintaining operations creates more resilience in the light industrial sector, providing a counterweight to the cyclical volatility seen in heavy industrials. 
One final point, the leading position we have in certain consumer demand-driven applications, such as beverage dispensing and marine and RV pump applications, helped us deliver solid growth. With combined revenue of more than $120 million, these businesses grew 4% in 2015 and are well positioned to continue growing in 2016. 
From a regional perspective, we remained optimistic about the U.S. markets, particularly the public utility and commercial building sectors, which we'll address in more detail later on the call. Europe is stabilizing and we expect a more favorable outlook there. We had a strong presence in the public utility market in Europe and we're already seeing early signs of success with key product launches in the residential and commercial building sectors. 
The emerging markets present a more complex story. As all of you know, many of these markets are already showing signs of slower growth. After posting 9% organic growth during the first 9 months of the year, our businesses in emerging markets grew 2% in the fourth quarter. There are a few dynamics at play here. 
First, the 2% organic growth compared with 14% organic growth in the prior year period. Underlying this delta is a pattern of choppy project deliveries that can easily cause distortions in quarterly year-over-year growth.
Second, our Applied Water segment declined 4% in the emerging markets in the quarter, driven in part by the slowdown in China's industrial and commercial markets. However, given that our business in China is more heavily weighted to the public utility end market, we do expect continued growth ahead albeit at a slower pace than in most recent years. 
Shifting gears now. As I've mentioned previously, we are still in the early chapters of a multiyear self-help story that will enable us to drive margin expansion. Our continuous improvement initiatives, which include lean and global procurement, along with a sharper focus on driving business simplification, will result in significant operating margin improvement.
Today, G&A cost sit at 8.5% of revenue, down 120 basis points over the past 2 years, but still an opportunity. We will continue to attack these costs in 2016 and beyond as we execute the business simplification plan we laid out at Investor Day, targeting $60 million to $75 million of structural cost reductions over the next few years. Our expectation is to invest approximately $25 million in 2016 from which we anticipate realizing $8 million in savings in the second half of the year and $15 million on an annualized basis. We will touch on this in more detail later in the call.
We are driving productivity within the business so we can fund the necessary investments to achieve our longer-term objectives. This includes increasing our R&D investments for future growth, the targeted investments in the Middle East, China and India we highlighted at our Investor Day and accelerating capital deployment on 2 fronts: returning capital to shareholders and acquisitions. 
Today, we announced a 10% increase in dividend and the acquisition of Tideland Corporation, our second acquisition in as many quarters. 
Let's turn to Slide 5 and I'll cover capital deployment and the Tideland acquisition in more detail. With our strong cash flow generation and capital structure, we are well positioned to create more value for our shareholders. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 1.4 million shares for $50 million. For the full year, we repurchased 5.1 million shares for $175 million and we have about $430 million available under our authorized programs. 
We also paid $25 million in dividends to shareholders in the quarter, bringing our full year total to $102 million, reflecting a 10% increase per share year-over-year. Combined, this represents a 24% increase in return of capital to shareholders in 2015. Earlier this week, we completed our acquisition of Tideland, a leading producer of smart analytic solutions in the coastal and ocean management sectors. More specifically, the company integrate systems intelligence technologies with tools to enable a wide variety of marine and environmental monitoring capabilities to an array of customers. These offerings stood well with our existing analytics portfolio. We intend to further integrate analytics tools from our current portfolio into their systems, including a direct tie-in with our recent fourth quarter acquisition, HYPACK.
The result will be a broader range of systems intelligence solutions that we can provide to the coastal and ocean water sector. Growth in this area will continue to be driven by the customer's need to comply with increasing regulations for a variety of operations in this space.
The acquisitions of Tideland and HYPACK illustrate how we plan to bring together distinct products and services to build intelligent full systems capability and significantly expand the market we currently serve. 
With that, let me turn the call over to our Interim CFO, Shashank Patel, to walk you through the results and the company's financial position in more detail. Shashank?"

For the full year, revenue increased 2% on an organic basis, consistent with the midpoint",2079,"Thanks, Patrick, and since you already covered some of these full year highlights, I'll make specific points and then dive further into our fourth quarter results. 
For the full year, revenue increased 2% on an organic basis, consistent with the midpoint of our guidance at the beginning of last year. We saw solid growth in the public utility, commercial and residential markets, all up 4% organically. Industrial was down 1%, primarily due to the significant declines we saw in oil and gas over the second half of the year. Agriculture was down 8% as unfavorable weather, mainly the severe flooding conditions in the southern U.S., wiped out this year's season. As a reminder, agriculture represents 2% of our revenues. 
Regionally, we generated the strongest growth in the emerging markets, when we posted a 7% increase over the course of the year. China led the way here growing 14%. Worth noting is that our Water Infrastructure segment grew 17%, driving 80% of the overall growth as the local trend to invest in and improve water quality and wastewater treatment continued.
The U.S. and Western Europe markets grew -- each grew 1%. In the U.S., growth accelerated over the course of the year and hit a high for the year in the fourth quarter. Whereas, Europe was relatively stable throughout the year. Canada rounds out our geographic performance. Their significant decline in oil and gas resulted in a 13% decline in revenue. 
As for margins, productivity actions and volume leverage more than offset material labor and overhead inflation and unfavorable mix. Excluding FX translation, gross margin expanded 40 basis points and led to a 30-basis-point improvement in operating margins. Embedded in this operating margin performance is an investment in selling capabilities in key growth markets, partially offset by a reduction in G&A costs. We reported earnings per share this year of $1.85, an increase of 5% excluding the unfavorable $0.22 impact from foreign exchange translation.
Just a reminder that this 5% increase is on top of the 18% growth and record EPS in 2014, a solid indicator that we have set Xylem on the right path to improve financial returns. Another similar indicator is our free cash flow performance. This year, we generated $347 million, an increase of 17%. We also achieved a 105% conversion of net income.
We continue to make progress on reducing our working capital across the business. Strong focused execution, improve working capital as a percentage of revenue by 80 basis points, excluding the impact of foreign exchange translation. This improvement, coupled with our commitment to accelerate capital deployment, allowed us to increase the return of capital to shareholders by 24% in 2015. That includes our fourth consecutive dividend increase in as many years and a record $175 million of share repurchases. 
Turning to Slide 7, I'll cover our fourth quarter performance.
During the fourth quarter, we booked orders of $913 million, up 1% organically. I'll cover our performance by segment in a few minutes. For now, I'll focus my commentary on our ending backlog. 
We entered 2016 with total backlog of $716 million. Excluding foreign exchange translation impact, backlog is up about 4%. Of the total, roughly $575 million is due to ship in 2016 and about $335 million is due to ship in the first quarter. Excluding the impact of FX translation, our current year backlog is down 2%. 
Jumping back to the fourth quarter results, we generated revenue of $994 million, down 5% versus the prior year, including a $70 million headwind from foreign exchange translation. On an organic basis, revenue was up 2%.
From an end market perspective, we saw a significant strength in both public utility and residential. Revenue from the public utility end market was up 8% with double-digit growth in the U.S., Asia and the Middle East. Project deliveries and an improved U.S. market, coupled with share gains, drove our performance across these regions. Residential was up 10%, primarily driven by market strength and share gains in the U.S. where we have about 50% of our customer base. 
Commercial was flat for the quarter, but against a tough prior year comparison of 8% growth. The story within commercial remains the same, we continue to benefit from a steady recovery in growth within the U.S. institutional building sector. The industrial end market was down 2% due to the aforementioned oil and gas headwinds. Agriculture was down 12%.
Operating margin was flat at 14.7%, but up 20 basis points excluding the headwind from foreign exchange translation. Cost reductions, including Lean Six Sigma, global procurement and business simplification savings offset inflation, driving 140-basis-point improvement in segment margins. 
Volume leverage on the 2% organic growth was more than offset by unfavorable mix. Wrapping up on the consolidated results, solid organic revenue growth and execution against our cost-reduction initiatives resulted in EPS of $0.60, an increase of 3% before the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange translation. 
Now let me provide more detail for each of our reporting segments. Please turn to Slide 8.
Water Infrastructure recorded orders of $559 million, up 2% organically. A couple of business mix dynamics worth highlighting. First, treatment orders grew more than 20%, including a large $13 million project order in Saudi Arabia as well as an increase in both North American project activity and win rates.
Nearly offsetting order growth was the overall declining in our dewatering business, again, reflecting the oil and gas weakness. Our book-to-bill ratio was 0.89 in the quarter, the same as last year. 
Overall, we exited the quarter with backlog of $544 million, up 8% on an organic basis. Of this amount, approximately $430 million is due to ship in 2016 with $230 million shipping in the first quarter. This leaves us with longer-term project backlog shippable in 2017 and beyond of $115 million. This is a 48% increase over what we had seen last year on an organic basis. While this is a relatively small portion of our revenue, it is a leading indicator of market health and trend stability and provide some confidence in our generally short cycle business. 
We reported revenue of $629 million, up 1% on an organic basis. Regionally, we saw growth led by the U.S. and emerging markets, up 4% and 5%, respectively. Western Europe grew a modest 1% and Canada declined 21% due to the impact of oil and gas weakness. 
I will further summarize our revenue performance as follows: transport application, which includes our water and wastewater pump and dewatering business were up 2% overall. Public utility water and wastewater pump sales and services grew 11% during the quarter, demonstrating both healthy market conditions and the strength of our Flygt brand, which continues to increase its share position. We also saw a double-digit growth in the public utility sector for our dewatering business, driven by a relatively large product delivery and to a lesser extent, disaster recovery services in the U.S. and U.K.
And as we have addressed, the unfavorable impact of oil and gas dewatering applications were down nearly 40% in the quarter. Test applications finished the year with a strong, up 4% with particular strength in Europe, up 9% with growth driven by industrial lab applications and several wastewater facility projects in the Nordic countries. 
Additionally, our delivery of critical analytical instrumentation used in China's river cleanup project drove local revenue growth up by 24%. Finally, treatment revenue was down 3% as we lapped a few large water project deliveries in Latin America, partially offsetting these headwinds were growth in the Middle East.
We are reporting operating income for our Water Infrastructure segment of $110 million and a record quarterly operating margin of 17.5%. Performance was driven by the increase in cost reductions of $19 million, driven by sourcing and lean initiatives as well as $2 million in restructuring savings. This increase was able to more than offset labor and material and overhead inflation as well as the unfavorable mix driven by lower dewatering rental volumes. 
Let's turn to Slide 9. Applied water recorded orders of $354 million, down 1% organically. As a reminder, this compares with 9% growth in the fourth quarter of 2014. Our book-to-bill ratio was 0.97 in the quarter, which is in the range we had seen over the last 4 years. 
Overall, we exited the quarter with backlog of $172 million. Of this amount, about $105 million is due to ship in the first quarter of 2016, down approximately 14% on a constant-currency basis, which we expect will mute growth in the first quarter.
Applied Water reported revenue of $365 million, up 3% on an organic basis. Regionally, we saw a strong growth in the developed markets with the U.S. and Western Europe up 5% and 4%, respectively. Emerging markets declined 4%. As expected, our biggest headwind came from China, which is down 18% after posting 16% growth over the first 9 months of the year.
I'll further summarize our revenue performance as follows: building services grew 3% as we continue to benefit from the U.S. institutional building market on the commercial side and market share gains in residential. Growth in the commercial building market was muted overall by weakness in China. Industrial water grew 5%, largely driven by project strength in the U.S. and modestly improving conditions in project shipments in Europe. 
Lastly, irrigation which represents less than 10% of Applied Water revenue declined 12%, driven by unfavorable weather conditions and the lapping of a strong quarter in 2014 when we delivered 25% growth. Operating margin declined 10 basis points year-over-year to 13.4%, including 20 basis points of headwind from foreign exchange translation. 
Material, labor and overhead inflation and unfavorable mix were notable headwinds this quarter, partially offset by cost reductions.
Despite volume leverage on 3% organic growth, unfavorable mix associated with a single industrial project significantly impacted our margin performance this quarter. The Applied Water portion of this project was sold at a negative margin. However, the project margin for Xylem overall was positive and reflected in the Water Infrastructure segment. 
Now let's turn to Slide 10  to cover the company's full year performance by segment. Let me start first with the Water Infrastructure segment. Revenue was $2.2 billion, up 1% organically driven primarily by growth strength -- growing strength in the public utility end market in the U.S. and the continued build-out of water and wastewater infrastructure in the emerging markets. We grew 1% in industrial, excluding the significant oil and gas headwind. Operating margin declined 10 basis points year-over-year to 14.2%.
While cost reductions more than offset inflation in the year, volume leverage on the 1% organic growth did not compensate for the unfavorable mix impact attributable to the significant decline in rental services to the oil and gas market. 
Moving on to the Applied Water segment. Revenue was $1.4  billion, up 3% organically due to strength in the U.S. commercial and residential markets as well as growth in industrial water applications despite facing significant oil and gas headwinds.
In commercial, 4% growth was driven by an improved U.S. institutional building market. Residential also grew 4%, a strong performance came from improvement in the home construction market and market share gains. Partially offsetting this growth was weakness in the agriculture end market, which is down 8% due to unfavorable weather conditions and the lapping of a strong prior year. 
Operating margin decreased 10 basis points year-over-year to 13.9% due to unfavorable foreign exchange translation impact. Excluding this impact, adjusted operating margin increased 20 basis points as cost reductions and volume leverage more than offset inflation and unfavorable mix. 
Please turn to Slide 11 and I will cover the company's financial position. Xylem maintains a strong cash position with a balance of $680 million at the end of December. We remain committed to our balanced capital deployment strategy, which is to maintain and grow the business while enhancing shareholder returns through dividends and share repurchases. 
During the fourth quarter, we paid $25 million in dividends and purchased $50 million in shares. We generated $165 million of free cash flow in the fourth quarter, largely reflecting improved working capital performance. Relative to the prior year our free cash flow performance improved by $44 million. 
Lastly, our return on investment -- invested capital decreased by 30 basis points to 10.6%, which is primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange translation. 
Now please turn to Slide 12 and I'll turn it back over to Patrick to cover our 2016 expectations."

As I said earlier, we believe we are well positioned to make significant progress against our top priorities in 2016 in order to drive long-term profitable growth at Xylem. We're driving substantial changes at Xylem to strengthen our commercial capabilities, taking specific actions to improve our customer's experience at each touch point we have with them. This includes driving more expertise through industry vertical selling and simplifying our commercial processes. 
We have focused plans to accelerate growth in emerging markets, targeting increased investment of about $30 million in the Middle East, China and India. We plan to increase our R&D investment in 2016 by 30 to 50 basis points to advance innovation. And as we drive our continuous improvement work deeper into the organization, we expect our lean and global procurement initiatives to generate gross savings of $120 million, an increase of roughly 20% year-over-year. 
The growth rates I refer to on this slide all exclude the anticipated negative foreign exchange impacts. Looking at the year ahead, we expect to generate faster-than-market growth, delivering 2016 organic revenue growth of 2% to 4%. The recently completed acquisitions are expected to add an additional 1% of revenue growth.
Given that we expect stable conditions across roughly 90% of our portfolio, including growth across all geographic regions, we believe we are positioned to exceed market growth despite the ongoing headwinds from oil and gas and mining. Our adjusted operating margin is expected to grow in the range of 50 to 80 basis points overall despite roughly 20 basis points of margin dilution from the acquisitions of HYPACK in Thailand. This dilution is driven by purchase price accounting impacts such as noncash intangible amortization. Excluding these diluted impacts of acquisitions, our operating margin is expected to expand by 70 to 100 basis points. We anticipate generating earnings per share of $1.95 to $2.05 which excludes restructuring and realignment cost of about $25 million, but this projection does include $0.04 of negative foreign currency translation impact. Excluding foreign exchange impact, EPS growth is expected to be in the range of 8% to 13%. Finally, we will continue to execute a disciplined approach to capital deployment, which is expected to result in free cash flow conversion greater than 100%. This also contemplates expected CapEx in the range of $120 million to $125 million. Please turn to Slide 13.
This slide outlines our expectations for 2016 organic revenue by end of market. Industrial, which represents 44% of total revenue, is expected to be flat to up low single digits. This projection assumes low single-digit growth in light industrial applications and double-digit declines in oil and gas and mining applications. The public utility sector, which constitutes 33% of our total revenue, is expected to grow at a mid-single digit rate. Here, we anticipate growth led by the U.S. and continued investment across emerging markets. We also expect market conditions in Europe to remain stable and that the U.K.'s multiyear AMP6 cycle of infrastructure investment, accelerates late in the half of the year. 
For the commercial market, we see growth in the mid-single digit range. Our expectation is that growth in the U.S. institutional building market continues through the year and that conditions in Europe modestly improved. Lastly, while we expect urbanization to drive growth in emerging markets such as the Middle East, we also anticipate weaker conditions in China. Residential should grow in the low to mid-single-digit range, driven by strength in the U.S. albeit at lower levels than seen in 2015.
We also expect continued low single-digit growth in Europe. Finally, agriculture would likely see a modest recovery from the significant weather events in 2015.

As for the first quarter of 2016, we expect 2% organic growth coupled with approximately 1% growth from acquisition. Foreign exchange translation is anticipated to be a 4% headwind. As for operating margin, we anticipate it to be flat year-over-year as the oil and gas and mining headwinds will continue to offset volume leverage and cost savings. Our expectations also assume a modest level of increased investment for our growth initiatives.
We are assuming that both global procurement and lean savings accelerate through the year whereby we realize about $20 million on gross savings in the first quarter and expect to deliver about $120 million for the full year. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Patrick for closing comments. Please turn to Slide 15."

Again, I want to thank our team for their performance as their focused execution against our strategic priorities helped us to deliver on the commitments we set forth at the beginning of 2015. I am confident in their ability and commitment to deliver against our organic growth targets and margin expansion opportunities. 
Xylem is in a very strong financial position and we will continue to drive our balanced and accelerated capital deployment plans. I am very encouraged as I look ahead to 2016 and beyond. No doubt, there are challenges in the near term, but I am confident that  our team will continue to execute with operational discipline to drive our success. That commitment and focus will provide the foundation for future growth for Xylem and our shareholders.

So hopefully, you still have some feel-good left for the rest of the quarters in 2016. So anyway, the question I wanted to focus on first is if we should be hearing a bit more about this large shipment that you disclosed in the Applied Water business because it sounds as though the order spanned both Applied and Water Infrastructure, which is good see. That suggests you're doing cross-selling, but the way the P&L gets tallied, Applied ended up showing a negative margin. So kind of put this project into context, is this solution selling? Do you have other business like this? And how do you -- if you net the 2 out, how does that project look?"

So it's been in backlog for more than a couple of years. The margin was net positive and attractive for us. I wouldn't say we have other projects like this that are out there. I mean, it was fine. It was an element of some solution-sell. It was a bundled offering for an LNG application, but again, it's a bit of a one-off.

There's infrastructure that needs to be invested in. As you've been following the water space for a long time, it's always difficult for any of us to predict the timing of when this will unlock some of the pent-up demand that's out there. But I do believe that there will likely be increased regulatory scrutiny. I think that will also lead to some increase in backlog movement in various communities across the U.S. It always seems to happen slower than any of us think it should occur.

Our volume there is not really like it would be in heavy industries. It's not really tied to factory output, but it's rather more of an ongoing minimal operating cost. These are not large capital outlays that are requiring the part of our customers and so it doesn't tend to be big on their radar screen other than, again, they play a role. These products play a role in helping them reduce their operating cost through energy efficiency. So we think we're pretty resilient.

Before I begin, I want to welcome our new CFO, Mark Borkowski to Xylem. Mark brings more than 30 years of diverse financial and operational experience, and importantly, he had a significant experience in leading transformational change across operating models and product portfolio changes, M&A activity and capital market transactions, all to create substantial shareholder value. He's been here just over a month, but he's already hit the ground running, visiting the field and working closely with our senior leadership team to gain a better understanding of the business and our plans for future growth. 
I know some of you already know Mark, but for those who don't, I'm sure over the coming months, we'll find opportunities for you to get to meet him. 
I'd also like to take this opportunity to thank Shashank Patel who's here with us this morning for his outstanding work as our interim CFO over the past 7 months. Shashank is an incredibly effective executive who brought his financial acumen and deep knowledge of Xylem's businesses to bear to create a seamless transition into important CFO role. He's been instrumental in bringing Mark up to speed and look forward to continuing to work with him as he takes on a new role here at Xylem. 
Now let's move on to our first quarter results. We had a solid start in 2016, which positions us well to deliver on our full year commitments. The benefits of our diversified product portfolio and end market exposure helped us deliver 4% organic growth. 
Our top line growth exceeded our expectations with strong execution by our teams helping to drive share gains in key regions. But I do want to acknowledge that we benefited from some project shifting from Q2 into Q1 as well as weather conditions that were favorable to the public utility market. I'll come back to that in a few minutes. 
A significant driver of our growth was the continued momentum we saw in key end markets, mainly public utility, is where growth was seen across all key regions. The U.S. was particularly strong, up 22% year-over-year. The rising trend line on the break and 6 side of the business continues and the milder winter provided an opportunity for public utilities to accelerate some needed repairs and maintenance. 
As I've mentioned previously, this area of the business has been suppressed for the last few years as municipalities have deferred activities due to budget constraints, but we are seeing some change in  priorities, and these smaller projects are being with greater frequency. 
In addition, as I just mentioned, one of the contributing factors to our top line growth in the quarter was the shift of treatment projects in the second quarter into the first. 
Given the treatment project installations, generally deliver lower incremental margins relative to other parts of our business, this shift didn't have a significant impact on the bottom line. 
On a macro level, mixed economic conditions do persist, but we remain focused on our growth objectives. 
We are seeing stable market conditions in the U.S. and the early signs of improvement in Europe. And while we've seen a significant slowdown in some emerging markets, we still generated 2% growth across these regions. 
India and the Middle East were particular standouts in the quarter, generating 90% and 10% growth, respectively. That growth was partially offset by a significant year-over-year decline in China, which reflects both soft market conditions in certain sectors as well as the variability in project work. 
That said, China's performance was in line with our expectations. 
Based on what we're seeing in terms of quarter-to-quarter sequential order trends, we believe the local market may be stabilizing. 
Importantly, we remain confident in the China market. Water Infrastructure is a top priority of the government, something that was reaffirmed in the State Council's latest action plan released in April, and we see a robust pipeline of project activity. 
So as we began to lap the steep declines we faced in commercial and industrial sectors, which became more pronounced in the fourth quarter of 2015, we will be well positioned to further accelerate our growth performance. Net-net, we are expecting China to deliver results of flat to low single-digit growth for the full year. 
Organic order bookings in the quarter were flat versus last year, but this result reflects the variation of the timing that occurred with major project work. 
For example, if we adjusted for just 2 of the major order one in Q1 of last year, year-over-year orders would have shown a 3% increase. 
Our adjusted operating margin in the quarter expanded to 10.9%, up 40 basis points excluding the impact of our recent acquisition to HYPACK and Tideland. 
Given our strong top line growth and ongoing cost reduction actions, we have accelerated some investments in our growth initiatives. 
Let me provide a brief update on the strategic priorities that we laid out at our Investor Day last fall. First, enhancing commercial leadership. As we continue to shift our center of gravity close our customers, we were engaged in a number of activities to improve the customer experience and expand our channel reach, which, ultimately, will increase our opportunities to generate more growth. We're investing in additional capability building around a common set of tools and processes across our commercial teams. 
Our second priority is to grow in emerging markets. And as I just mentioned, we are making good progress. 
In the Middle East, you'll recall that we are opening our new facility in Dubai in order to localize manufacturing and assembly of some of our products beginning with our Applied Water portfolio. This expansion will enable us to better serve our growing customer base in the region by bringing the supply chain closer to them, and we expect to be operational later this summer. 
We're also encouraged by the momentum we see in India, where we have a relatively smaller, but growing presence. We are moving forward with our plants for localized product design to be more responsive to the needs of this market. 
In the area strengthening innovation and technology, we are starting to build good momentum. We have already began to invest in several areas and expect to increase our 2016's [ph] full year R&D spending by 50 basis points to more than 3% of revenue. 
Our core areas of focus are smart technologies, systems intelligence and advanced treatment and industrial services. We expect these investments to drive not only top line growth, but also to improve the gross margin profile of our business. 
Coming up, we are looking forward to a significant new product introduction in our Water Infrastructure segment later this month. 
Our next priority continues improvement includes global procurement and a sharper focus on driving business simplification. We expect these efforts to generate significant cost savings and operating margin improvement this year and over the next several years. 
As I've discussed before, we are instilling a productivity for growth mindset throughout business so we can fund the necessary investments to achieve our longer-term value creation objectives. 
In the first quarter, we achieved $22 million in cost savings through continuous improvement, global procurement and business simplification initiatives, and we are on track to reach our full year goal. I am pleased to the momentum our teams are building in this area and would highlight that we expect to achieve another consecutive year of record savings in 2016. 
Our final strategic priority is to cultivate leadership and talent development. On the leadership front, with the addition of Mark as our CFO, I now have my senior team in place and working together toward our common goals. We have also launched the Xylem learning Center, a global platform for training and knowledge management throughout the organization as well as 2 concentrated of development programs for high-performing managers and leaders. 
Shifting back to our results. At the bottom line, we generated adjusted earnings per share of $0.35 in the quarter, an increase of 9% year-over-year, excluding the impact of acquisitions. Also, a strong focus on our working capital performance drove 130 basis points improvement as a percentage of revenue and an increase of $23 million in operating cash flow. These efforts position us well to deliver another year free cash flow conversion in excess of 100% of net income. 
Finally, as we announced this morning, we are raising our full year earnings guidance to $1.98 to $2.08. We will cover this in more detail later in the call, but let me give you some perspective. 
Our guidance increased today reflect the incremental interest savings from the refinancing of a portion of our long-term debt. There is no change in our expectations regarding the performance of our core business. 
We expect stable conditions across roughly 90% [ph] of our portfolio and we anticipate generating growth across all key regions. 
Given that, we believe we're positioned to exceed market growth rates. 
We are certainly off to a good start for the year, delivering solid top line growth and executing well across our businesses. But we're 1 quarter into the year and we recognize that we are still operating in a mixed macro environment. 
One last point. We could potentially recognize some favorability benefit from foreign exchange movements if rates hold over the balance of the year. However, we believe it's too early to make those types of changes, so we have not changed our underlying foreign exchange assumptions in providing today's earnings update. 
Mark will give some additional color on our FX sensitivity later in the call. 
Now with that, I'll turn it over to Mark for more details in the quarter."

We generated revenue of $847 million in the quarter, up $10 million from the prior year despite FX headwind of $27 million. Recent acquisitions added $6 million to the top line in the quarter. Organic rev",1506,"Thanks, Patrick. Now please turn to Slide 4. 
We generated revenue of $847 million in the quarter, up $10 million from the prior year despite FX headwind of $27 million. 
Recent acquisitions added $6 million to the top line in the quarter. 
Organic revenue increased $31 million or 4%, which exceeded our expectations and was largely driven by the 12% increase in the global public utility market. 
Looking at the rest of our end markets. Our industrial vertical was flat as expected. 
Commercial was up 5%, but residential was down 5%. 
Sales to our ag customers were down 1%. 
From a regional perspective, we generated growth in each of our key regions, with Western Europe up 5%, the U.S. up 4% and emerging markets growing at 2%. 
Operating margin increased 10 basis points to 10.9% for the quarter. 
Excluding the impact of acquisitions, margins increased by 40 basis points year-over-year. 
Strong execution and cost reductions enabled us to fund the strategic investments we need to further accelerate profitable growth. 
Let me provide a little more detail on our margin expansion. Continuous improvement, global procurement and business simplification initiatives reduced our costs by $22 million in the quarter, resulting in 260 basis points of margin improvement. 
Our operating margin increased 100 basis points due to volume leverage, modest price realization and favorable mix. 
Partially offsetting these items were cost inflation of 190 basis points and strategic investments of 130 basis points. These investments included increased R&D spend to fund new product development, expansion of our organization selling and continuous improvement capabilities and the localization of assembly and production in attractive, faster growth regions. 
Earnings per share of $0.35 grew 6% year-over-year, but were up 9%, excluding the acquisitions of HYPACK and Tideland, which were up $0.01 dilutive in the first quarter, as expected due to the seasonality of these businesses. 
These acquisitions are tracking to plan and are expected to be earnings neutral for the full year 2016 and accretive to earnings in 2017. 
One final item. We have excluded from adjusted earnings a net tax benefit of $14 [ph] million during the quarter, which is primarily the result of closing out a prior year tax audit. 
Now let me cover each of our reporting segments. Please turn to Slide 5. Water Infrastructure recorded orders of $534 million, down 2% organically, as we lap to prior year quarter that included 2 large project wins, totaling approximately $25 million. Excluding these unusually large orders from last year, orders would've been up 3%. 
We exited the quarter with total backlog of $580 [ph] million, about the same as last year on an organic basis. Of this total, we expect to ship approximately 75% over the next 3 quarters. This is up 3% organically year-over-year and relatively consistent with our sales outlook for the segment. 
Revenue of $514 [ph] million represents 6% increase year-over-year on an organic basis. 
Acquisitions added an additional $6 million to the top line, but foreign exchange was a [ph] $21 million headwind. 
Now let me provide you with some color on this quarter's performance. We generated 12% growth in the global public utility market. This increase reflects the continued market recovery we've seen over the past few quarters as well as milder winter weather, which enabled municipalities to accelerate maintenance activities. 
Additionally, strong execution and the timing of a few treatment project deliveries also contributed to better-than-expected performance. 
In the U.S., where our public utility business grew 22%, our teams performed very well, driving share gains in the water and wastewater pump market. We also saw benefits from our investment in sales capability as demonstrated by an increase in mixer and mixer aftermarket sales. 
Strength in Western Europe came from the early stages of the U.K. public utility AMP6 cycle. 
Emerging market results were favorable despite mixed market conditions. Our overall growth was driven by a large custom pump project in India and continued investment in water and wastewater infrastructure in the Middle East. 
Finally, our industrial end market was flat as low single-digit growth in the general, industrial and construction markets was muted by the negative impact of the oil and gas in mining sectors. 
Operating margin increased 150 basis points from 10.6% to 12.1%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, operating margin increased 200 basis points, driven by volume leverage, favorable mix, modest price realization and cost reductions, partially offset by increases in cost inflation and increased strategic growth investments. 
Please turn to Slide 6. Applied Water recorded orders of $354 million, up 2% organically over the prior year period. 
We entered the second quarter with total backlog of $197 million, down 5% on an organic basis, primarily due to the delivery of a large project in the fourth quarter of 2015. Of that total, approximately $105 million is expected to shift within the second quarter. 
Applied Water segment revenue was $333 million, up 1% organically from the prior year. 
Highlights of our revenue performance include the following: commercial and industrial market strength drove 5% growth in Western Europe. Here, we're seeing the continued traction from energy efficient product launches and our investment in building a regional sales capabilities. 
In the U.S., commercial was up 3%, driven by continued strength in the institutional building sector. We also saw a 3% growth in residential, but with an unfavorable mix in demand within our product offerings. 
Here, as a result of a relatively warm winter, demand for our higher-margin hot-water circulators declined while demand for lower margin well pumps increased. 
The segment's U.S. industrial revenue declined 7%. This primarily reflects lower demand for specialty pump applications serving the food and beverage and Marine sectors and drove the overall 1% decline in the U.S. 
Segment revenue was down 3% in our emerging markets, due primarily to the anticipated slowdown in the commercial and industrial end markets in China. 
Sequentially, we've seen modest improvement in orders in China, thanks in part to what we believe were stabilizing end market conditions as well as strong addition by our local team. 
Partially offsetting the year-over-year decline in China was double-digit growth in Eastern Europe and the Middle East, again, driven by the strategic growth investment that we're making to build our sales capabilities in these regions. 
Segment operating margin declined 130 basis points from 13.9% to 12.6% year-over-year. 
Cost reductions drove a 270 basis point improvement, more than offsetting inflation and the impact of unfavorable residential mix in the quarter. 
However, increased spend on strategic growth investments reduced margins by 180 basis points. These investments for funding the localization of product assembly in the Middle East and include higher investments in innovation and technology for new product development. 
Looking at the full year 2016, we continue to expect segment margins in the range of 30 to 50 basis points. 
To summarize this quarter's performance, we delivered modest top line growth as we manage the near-term slowdown in tough year-over-year comparisons in China as well as sluggish U.S. industrial market conditions. 
At the same time, we remain focused on delivering productivity gains to fund our growth investments. 
Now let's turn to Slide 7, we'll cover the company's cash flow and financial position. 
The first thing you'll likely notice on our balance sheet is our unusually large cash position of $1.2 billion at the end of the quarter. This reflects the proceeds from our very successful European debt issuance in March, which we used to redeem our 3.55% senior notes on April 11. 
Our net debt to net capital ratio is healthy at 24% and our commercial paper and revolving credit facilities remain in place and unutilized. This underscores our financial strength and flexibility. 
In that regard, we remain committed to a balanced capital deployment strategy, which is to profitably grow the business through organic investments and M&A while enhancing shareholder returns through dividends and opportunistic share repurchases. 
During the first quarter, we invested $37 million for capital expenditures, much of this for growth projects. We acquired Tideland for $70 [ph] million and we returned $28 million to our shareholders through dividends. 
The first quarter included a 10% increase in dividends per share, marking the fifth consecutive year that we've increased our dividend. 
Historically, our first quarter free cash flow generation is seasonally low and impacted by the timing of annual incentive payments as well as lower sales leverage. 
Free cash flow was $4 million in the quarter, representing a modest improvement from the prior year. 
Year-over-year free cash flow benefited from a $23 million reduction in working capital, largely offset by the timing of additional interests in tax payments in the quarter. 
We continue to expect to deliver at least 100% cash conversion this year. 
It's worth highlighting that we improve working capital as a percentage of revenue by 130 basis points in the quarter excluding the impact of acquisitions. The improvement was driven by better inventory management and receivables collections. 
Please move to Slide 8 and I'll turn the call back over to Patrick to cover our 2016 guidance. Patrick?"

First, the growth rates I refer to on this slide all exclude the anticipated negative foreign exchange impacts that we discussed in our last earnings call. Second, and more importantly, as I said in my opening remarks, there is no change in the outlook for the performance of our core business. We continue to expect to generate faster the market growth, delivering organic revenue growth of 2% to 4%. 
While I'll cover specific details by end market on the next slide, let me highlight that we continue to expect stable conditions across roughly 90% of our portfolio, including growth across all key geographies. 
Additionally, we expect acquisitions will provide an additional 1% of revenue growth. 
Our adjusted operating margin is still expected to grow in the range of 50 to 80 basis points overall, with roughly 20 basis points of margin dilution from the acquisitions of HYPACK and Tideland. 
Excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions, our operating margin is expected to expand by 70 to 100 basis points. This expansion will be realized after the impact of investments we are making to accelerate profitable growth. 
As I mentioned earlier, we continue to drive our continuous improvement work deeper into the organization with very good results. We expect our lean and global procurement initiatives to generate full year growth savings of $120 million, an increase of roughly 20% year-over-year. 
We're raising our earnings per share guidance to $1.98 to $2.08 to reflect the interest savings from our debt refinancing. This range excludes restructuring and realignment cost of about $25 million, but this projection does include $0.04 of negative foreign currency translation impact. 
Excluding this impact, EPS growth is now expected to be in the range of 9% to 15%. We will continue to execute a disciplined approach to capital deployment, which is expected to result in free cash flow conversion greater than 100% after investing $120 million to $130 million in CapEx. 
Finally, we currently anticipate returning a minimum of $150 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
Now please turn to Slide 9. Let me summarize our updated full year performance by end market and highlight a few changes since our previous outlook in February. 
Beginning with industrial, which represents 44% of total revenue. We continue to expect this market to be flat to up low single digits. Our projection assumes that low single-digit growth in general industrial will be partially offset by headwinds in the mining and oil and gas sector. 
While first quarter performance in mining, which represent approximately 5% of total revenue was generally in line with our expectations, we continue to closely monitor market trends. 
Oil and gas, which now represents less than 3% of total revenue, is forecasted to decline to the first half of this year before we lap last year's second half of nearly 40% decline. 
Public utility, which represents 33% of our total revenue, is now anticipated to grow at a mid-to high single-digit rate. Here, we've raised our outlook following a strong first quarter start and with the expectation of continued momentum in the U.S. 
We also see encouraging signs for improved European market conditions, including strong contributions from the AMP6 cycle in the U.K. And in the emerging markets, we expect to see continued project growth. 
For the commercial end market, no change to our expectation of a mid-single-digit range growth. We see solid contributions from both the U.S. and Europe and double-digit growth in the Middle East. 
The relatively warmer winter led to a slow start to the year for residential heating applications and tougher macro conditions in Australia. As a result, we now expect the residential market to be flat year-over-year. 
And finally, our smaller sector, agriculture, we anticipate will be up low single digits for the year. 
Please turn to Slide 10 and Mark will provide some calendarization insight for the rest of the year."

For the second quarter of 2016, we expect total revenue of approximately $920 million, flat versus the prior year. This includes organic growth of approximately $20 million or 2%, revenue from our acquisitions of approximately $10 million",305,"Thanks, Patrick. For the second quarter of 2016, we expect total revenue of approximately $920 million, flat versus the prior year. This includes organic growth of approximately $20 million or 2%, revenue from our acquisitions of approximately $10 million and approximately $30 million of headwind from foreign exchange translation. 
We anticipate operating income to be up modestly year-over-year with operating margins of [ph] 40 to 60 basis points as volume leverage and cost reductions more than offset inflation, growth investments and unfavorable mix. 
Looking out to the second half of the year, we anticipate year-over-year organic growth of approximately 3%, with acquisitions adding just over $30 million and FX headwind of nearly $45 million. 
Operating margins in the second half are expected to increase in the range of 80 to 130 basis points year-over-year. This improvement reflects volume leverage in the net incremental savings from restructuring and continuous improvement cost actions in excess of increased R&D and growth investments. 
Relative to the first half of the year, we also anticipate favorable mix given that will lap oil and gas headwinds as we exit the second quarter. 
To wrap up, let me make a few points about the foreign exchange assumptions in our full year guidance. As Patrick mentioned earlier, we have not reflected any potential benefit from foreign exchange variability in our updated outlook. We do not see any significant benefit in the first quarter and it's too early to update any full year assumptions at this point in the year given the volatility of currencies. 
Having said that, we have provided a table in the appendix that outlines the potential full year impact to those assumptions, which is $0.01 of EPS per quarter based on exchange rates late last week. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Patrick for closing comments. Patrick?"

We're making measurable progress on our strategic priorities, particularly in the area of continuous improvement, accelerating our investments in innovation and technology and investing in faster growth markets. We've made good strides in improving our working capital performance, which will lead to another year of strong free cash flow conversion.

So just under a point of top line growth and I'd say probably a little less than 1/3 of that was the actual impact of the weather, albeit at high margin given the impact that it had on our government business. To the second part of your question, we certainly see the weather patterns that are happening here as an opportunity both in the immediate term, but there is a systemic move here as you see happening. And so we certainly have deployed our reasons on the ground not only tactically but strategically. Part of the things we've been doing there is leveraging what we're doing in the deployment of salesforce.com and making sure that our teams not just in government, but also in the fight side of the business are sharing leads and making sure that we're maximizing the opportunity there."

That definitely has informed our priorities both in terms of organic investment in R&D and the innovation technology roadmap that JR new innovation technology officer and R&D teams are really focused on. But at the same time, it's also informing our M&A pipeline. Certainly, the acquisitions of HYPACK and Tideland were a demonstration of that. And we see a very rich pipeline further opportunities to be able to do that. You know that we set out some pretty ambitious goals at Investor Day on where we can take our Vitality Index in terms of revenue generated from new offerings over the last 5 years.

So the other, let's call it 36% [ph] of our revenue, we really refer to that is more light industrial, and that's been up 3% and are expected to continue. It is heavily tied to GDP in the U.S. It's overrated to the U.S. It is a broad slot of exposure ranging from food and beverage department to chemicals to Marine to a wide variety of car washes. It's a wide variety of areas that I think about that business is in that it's historically been very, very steady. We're not tied to capital spend. We're not tied to industrial output. As long as people's operations are up and running, they're going to burn through these small pumps that we sell them. And so it's a good study business. That is that we typically see there is in there can be adjustment in inventory stock. We saw a little bit of that last year. But again, expect that business to be pretty stable here in that low single-digit range for 2016. On the industrial treatment business, only about 25% of our treatment business today is sold into industrial. we're heavily weighted towards muni and wastewater and that is a business that tend to be lower margin for us. Hence, discussion around it shifting even more of our way towards the industrial sector where entire technology more regulations, deeper pockets of people willing to spend based on life cycle cost. And so it is an area of focus for us, both as it relates to our own internal R&D efforts and the pipeline there. Again, those are -- tend to be slower to come to fruition, but we're working on those right now as we speak. And as we mentioned before, it is an area of focus for us in terms of M&A down the path."

Before I begin, I want to welcome our new CFO, Mark Rajkowski to Xylem. Mark brings more than 30 years of diverse financial and operational experience. And importantly, he had a significant experience in leading transformational change across operating models and product portfolio changes, M&A activity and capital market transactions, all to create substantial shareholder value. He's been here just over a month, but he's already hit the ground running, visiting the field and working closely with our senior leadership team to gain a better understanding of the business and our plans for future growth. I know some of you already know Mark. But for those who don't, I'm sure over the coming months, we'll find opportunities for you to get to meet him. 
I'd also like to take this opportunity to thank Shashank Patel, who's here with us this morning for his outstanding work as our interim CFO over the past 7 months. Shashank is an incredibly effective executive, who brought his financial acumen and deep knowledge of Xylem's businesses to bear to create a seamless transition in this important CFO role. He has been instrumental in bringing Mark up to speed. And I look forward to continuing to work with him as he takes on a new role here at Xylem. 
Now let's move on to our first quarter results. We had a solid start to 2016, which positions us well to deliver on our full year commitments. The benefits of our diversified product portfolio and end market exposure helped us deliver 4% organic growth. Our top line growth exceeded our expectations with strong execution by our teams helping to drive share gains in key regions. But I do want to acknowledge that we benefited from some projects shifting from Q2 into Q1 as well as weather conditions that were favorable to the public utility market. I'll come back to that in a few minutes. 
A significant driver of our growth was the continued momentum we saw in key end markets, mainly public utilities, where growth was seen across all key regions. The U.S. was particularly strong, up 22% year-over-year. The rising trend line on the break and fix side of the business continues and the milder winter provided an opportunity for public utilities to accelerate some needed repairs and maintenance. As I've mentioned previously, this area of the business has been suppressed for the last few years as municipalities have deferred activities due to budget constraints. But we are seeing some change in priorities. And these smaller projects are being green-lit with greater frequency. 
In addition, as I've just mentioned, one of the contributing factors to our top line growth in the quarter was the shift of treatment projects in the second quarter into the first. Given that treatment project installations generally deliver lower incremental margins relative to other parts of our business, this shift didn't have a significant impact on the bottom line. On a macro level, mixed economic conditions do persist, but we remain focused on our growth objectives. 
We are seeing stable market conditions in the U.S. and the early signs of improvement in Europe. And while we've seen a significant slowdown in some emerging markets, we still generated 2% growth across these regions. India and the Middle East were particular standouts in the quarter, generating 90% and 10% growth, respectively. That growth was partially offset by a significant year-over-year decline in China, which reflects both soft market conditions in certain sectors as well as the variability in project work. 
That said, China's performance was in line with our expectations. Based on what we're seeing in terms of quarter-to-quarter sequential order trends, we believe the local market may be stabilizing. Importantly, we remain confident in the China market. Water Infrastructure is a top priority of the government, something that was reaffirmed in the State Council's latest action plan released in April. And we see a robust pipeline of project activity. So as we begin to lap the steep declines we faced in commercial and industrial sectors, which became more pronounced in the fourth quarter of 2015, we will be well positioned to further accelerate our growth performance. Net-net, we are expecting China to deliver results of flat to low single-digit growth for the full year. 
Organic order bookings in the quarter were flat versus last year. But this result reflects the variation of timing that occurred with major project work. For example, if we adjusted for just 2 of the major orders won in Q1 of last year, year-over-year orders would have shown a 3% increase. Our adjusted operating margin in the quarter expanded to 10.9%, up 40 basis points excluding the impact of our recent acquisitions of HYPACK and Tideland. Given our strong top line growth and ongoing cost reduction actions, we have accelerated some investments in our growth initiatives. 
Let me provide a brief update on the strategic priorities that we laid out at our Investor Day last fall. First, enhancing commercial leadership. As we continue to shift our center of gravity close our customers, we were engaged in a number of activities to improve the customer experience and expand our channel reach, which ultimately will increase our opportunities to generate more growth. We're investing in additional capability-building around a common set of tools and processes across our commercial teams. 
Our second priority is to grow in emerging markets. And as I've just mentioned, we are making good progress. In the Middle East, you'll recall that we are opening our new facility in Dubai in order to localize manufacturing and assembly of some of our products, beginning with our Applied Water portfolio. This expansion will enable us to better serve our growing customer base in the region by bringing the supply chain closer to them. And we expect to be operational later this summer. We are also encouraged by the momentum we see in India, where we have a relatively smaller but growing presence. We are moving forward with our plans for localized product designs to be more responsive to the needs of this market. 
In the area of strengthening innovation and technology, we are starting to build good momentum. We have already begun to invest in several areas and expect to increase our 2016 full year R&D spending by 50 basis points to more than 3% of revenue. Our core areas of focus are smart technologies, systems intelligence and advanced treatment and industrial services. We expect these investments to drive not only top line growth but also to improve the gross margin profile of our business. Coming up, we are looking forward to a significant new product introduction in our Water Infrastructure segment later this month. 
Our next priority, continuous improvement, includes lean, global procurement and a sharper focus on driving business simplification. We expect these efforts to generate significant cost savings and operating margin improvement this year and over the next several years. As I've discussed before, we are instilling a productivity for growth mindset throughout the business, so we can fund the necessary investments to achieve our longer-term value creation objectives. In the first quarter, we achieved $22 million in cost savings through continuous improvement, global procurement and business simplification initiatives. And we are on track to reach our full year goal. I am pleased with the momentum our teams are building in this area and would highlight that we expect to achieve another consecutive year of record savings in 2016. 
Our final strategic priority is to cultivate leadership and talent development. On the leadership front, with the addition of Mark as our CFO, I now have my senior team in place and working together toward our common goals. We have also launched the Xylem Learning Center, a global platform for training and knowledge management throughout the organization, as well as 2 concentrated of development programs for high-performing managers and leaders. 
Shifting back to our results. At the bottom line, we generated adjusted earnings per share of $0.35 in the quarter, an increase of 9% year-over-year, excluding the impact of acquisitions. Also a strong focus on our working capital performance drove 130 basis point improvement as a percentage of revenue and an increase of $23 million in operating cash flow. These efforts position us well to deliver another year of free cash flow conversion in excess of 100% of net income. Finally, as we announced this morning, we are raising our full year earnings guidance to $1.98 to $2.08. We will cover this in more detail later in the call, but let me give you some perspective. 
Our guidance increase today reflects the incremental interest savings from the refinancing of a portion of our long-term debt. There is no change in our expectations regarding the performance of our core business. We expect stable conditions across roughly 90% of our portfolio and we anticipate generating growth across all key regions. Given that, we believe we're positioned to exceed market growth rates. We are certainly off to a good start for the year, delivering solid top line growth and executing well across our businesses. But we're 1 quarter into the year and we recognize that we are still operating in a mixed macro environment. 
One last point. We could potentially recognize some favorability benefit from foreign exchange movements if rates hold over the balance of the year. However, we believe it's too early to make those types of changes, so we have not changed our underlying foreign exchange assumptions in providing today's earnings update. Mark will give some additional color on our FX sensitivity later in the call. 
Now with that, I'll turn it over to Mark for more details in the quarter."
118218449,321421350,970743,"Xylem Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 03, 2016",2016-05-03,"Earnings Calls","Xylem Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Patrick. Now please turn to Slide 4. We generated revenue of $847 million in the quarter, up $10 million from the prior year despite FX headwind of $27 million. Recent acquisitions added $6 million to the top line in the quarter. Organic revenue i",1498,"Thanks, Patrick. Now please turn to Slide 4. We generated revenue of $847 million in the quarter, up $10 million from the prior year despite FX headwind of $27 million. Recent acquisitions added $6 million to the top line in the quarter. Organic revenue increased $31 million or 4%, which exceeded our expectations and was largely driven by the 12% increase in the global public utility market. 
Looking at the rest of our end markets. Our industrial vertical was flat as expected. Commercial was up 5%, but residential was down 5%. Sales to our ag customers were down 1%. From a regional perspective, we generated growth in each of our key regions with Western Europe up 5%, the U.S. up 4% and emerging markets growing at 2%. Operating margin increased 10 basis points to 10.9% for the quarter. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, margins increased by 40 basis points year-over-year. Strong execution and cost reductions enabled us to fund the strategic investments we need to further accelerate profitable growth. 
Let me provide a little more detail on our margin expansion. Continuous improvement, global procurement and business simplification initiatives reduced our costs by $22 million in the quarter, resulting in 260 basis points of margin improvement. Our operating margin increased 100 basis points due to volume leverage, modest price realization and favorable mix. Partially offsetting these items were cost inflation of 190 basis points and strategic investments of 130 basis points. These investments included increased R&D spend to fund new product development, expansion of our organization's selling and continuous improvement capabilities and the localization of assembly and production in attractive, faster-growth regions. 
Earnings per share of $0.35 grew 6% year-over-year but were up 9%, excluding the acquisitions of HYPACK and Tideland, which were $0.01 dilutive in the first quarter as expected due to the seasonality of these businesses. These acquisitions are tracking to plan and are expected to be earnings-neutral for the full year 2016 and accretive to earnings in 2017. One final item, we have excluded from adjusted earnings a net tax benefit of $14 million during the quarter, which is primarily the result of closing out our prior year tax audit. 
Now let me cover each of our reporting segments. Please turn to Slide 5. Water Infrastructure recorded orders of $534 million, down 2% organically, as we lapped the prior year quarter that included 2 large project wins, totaling approximately $25 million. Excluding these unusually large orders from last year, orders would have been up 3%. We exited the quarter with total backlog of $580 million, about the same as last year on an organic basis. Of this total, we expect to ship approximately 75% over the next 3 quarters. This is up 3% organically year-over-year and relatively consistent with our sales outlook for the segment. Revenue of $514 million represents a 6% increase year-over-year on an organic basis. Acquisitions added an additional $6 million to the top line, but foreign exchange was a $21 million headwind. 
Now let me provide you with some color on this quarter's performance. We generated 12% growth in the global public utility market. This increase reflects the continued market recovery we've seen over the past few quarters as well as milder winter weather, which enabled municipalities to accelerate maintenance activities. Additionally, strong execution and the timing of a few treatment project deliveries also contributed to better-than-expected performance. 
In the U.S., where our public utility business grew 22%, our teams performed very well, driving share gains in the water and wastewater pump market. We also saw benefits from our investment in sales capability as demonstrated by an increase in mixer and mixer aftermarket sales. Strength in Western Europe came from the early stages of the U.K. public utility AMP6 cycle. 
Emerging market results were favorable despite mixed market conditions. Our overall growth was driven by a large custom pump project in India and continued investment in water and wastewater infrastructure in the Middle East. Finally, our industrial end market was flat as low single-digit growth in the general industrial and construction markets was muted by the negative impact of the oil and gas and mining sectors. 
Operating margin increased 150 basis points from 10.6% to 12.1%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, operating margin increased 200 basis points, driven by volume leverage, favorable mix, modest price realization and cost reductions, partially offset by increases in cost inflation and increased strategic growth investments. 
Please turn to Slide 6. Applied Water recorded orders of $354 million, up 2% organically over the prior year period. We entered the second quarter with total backlog of $197 million, down 5% on an organic basis, primarily due to the delivery of a large project in the fourth quarter of 2015. Of that total, approximately $105 million is expected to ship within the second quarter. 
Applied Water segment revenue was $333 million, up 1% organically from the prior year. Highlights of our revenue performance include the following. Commercial and industrial market strength drove 5% growth in Western Europe. Here, we're seeing the continued traction from energy-efficient product launches and our investment in building our regional sales capabilities. 
In the U.S., commercial was up 3%, driven by continued strength in the institutional building sector. We also saw a 3% growth in residential but with an unfavorable mix in demand within our product offerings. Here, as a result of a relatively warm winter, demand for our higher-margin hot water circulators declined while demand for lower-margin well pumps increased. 
The segment's U.S. industrial revenue declined 7%. This primarily reflects lower demand for specialty pump applications serving the food and beverage and marine sectors and drove the overall 1% decline in the U.S. Segment revenue was down 3% in our emerging markets due primarily to the anticipated slowdown in the commercial and industrial end markets in China. 
Sequentially, we've seen modest improvement in orders in China, thanks in part to what we believe were stabilizing end market conditions as well as strong execution by our local team. Partially offsetting the year-over-year decline in China was double-digit growth in Eastern Europe and the Middle East, again driven by the strategic growth investment that we're making to build our sales capabilities in these regions. 
Segment operating margin declined 130 basis points from 13.9% to 12.6% year-over-year. Cost reductions drove a 270 basis point improvement, more than offsetting inflation and the impact of unfavorable residential mix in the quarter. However, increased spend on strategic growth investments reduced margins by 180 basis points. These investments are funding the localization of product assembly in the Middle East and include higher investments in innovation and technology for new product development. Looking at the full year 2016, we continue to expect segment margins in the range of 30 to 50 basis points. 
To summarize this quarter's performance, we delivered modest top line growth as we managed the near-term slowdown and tough year-over-year comparisons in China as well as sluggish U.S. industrial market conditions. At the same time, we remain focused on delivering productivity gains to fund our growth investments. 
Now let's turn to Slide 7, where I'll cover the company's cash flow and financial position. The first thing you'll likely notice on our balance sheet is our unusually large cash position of $1.2 billion at the end of the quarter. This reflects the proceeds from our very successful European debt issuance in March, which we used to redeem our 3.55% senior notes on April 11. 
Our net debt-to-net capital ratio is healthy at 24% and our commercial paper and revolving credit facilities remain in place and unutilized. This underscores our financial strength and flexibility. In that regard, we remain committed to a balanced capital deployment strategy, which is to profitably grow the business through organic investments and M&A while enhancing shareholder returns through dividends and opportunistic share repurchases. 
During the first quarter, we invested $37 million for capital expenditures, much of this for growth projects. We acquired Tideland for $70 million and we returned $28 million to our shareholders through dividends. The first quarter included a 10% increase in dividends per share, marking the fifth consecutive year that we've increased our dividend. 
Historically, our first quarter free cash flow generation is seasonally low and impacted by the timing of annual incentive payments as well as lower sales leverage. Free cash flow was $4 million in the quarter, representing a modest improvement from the prior year. Year-over-year, free cash flow benefited from a $23 million reduction in working capital, largely offset by the timing of additional interests in tax payments in the quarter. We continue to expect to deliver at least 100% cash conversion this year. 
It's worth highlighting that we improved working capital as a percentage of revenue by 130 basis points in the quarter, excluding the impact of acquisitions. The improvement was driven by better inventory management and receivables collections. 
Please move to Slide 8, and I'll turn the call back over to Patrick to cover our 2016 guidance. Patrick?"

First, the growth rates I refer to on this slide all exclude the anticipated negative foreign exchange impact that we discussed in our last earnings call. Second and more importantly, as I said in my open",658,"Thanks, Mark. I'll begin by making 2 quick points. First, the growth rates I refer to on this slide all exclude the anticipated negative foreign exchange impact that we discussed in our last earnings call. Second and more importantly, as I said in my opening remarks, there is no change in the outlook for the performance of our core business. We continue to expect to generate faster than market growth, delivering organic revenue growth up 2% to 4%. While I'll cover specific details by end market on the next slide, let me highlight that we continue to expect stable conditions across roughly 90% of our portfolio, including growth across all key geographies. Additionally, we expect acquisitions will provide an additional 1% of revenue growth. 
Our adjusted operating margin is still expected to grow in the range of 50 to 80 basis points overall with roughly 20 basis points of margin dilution from the acquisitions of HYPACK and Tideland. Excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions, our operating margin is expected to expand by 70 to 100 basis points. This expansion will be realized after the impact of investments we are making to accelerate profitable growth. As I mentioned earlier, we continue to drive our continuous improvement work deeper into the organization with very good results. We expect our lean and global procurement initiatives to generate full year growth savings of $120 million, an increase of roughly 20% year-over-year. 
We're raising our earnings per share guidance to $1.98 to $2.08 to reflect the interest savings from our debt refinancing. This range excludes restructuring and realignment cost of about $25 million. But this projection does include $0.04 of negative foreign currency translation impact. Excluding this impact, EPS growth is now expected to be in the range of 9% to 15%. We will continue to execute a disciplined approach to capital deployment, which is expected to result in free cash flow conversion greater than 100% after investing $120 million to $130 million in CapEx. Finally, we currently anticipate returning a minimum of $150 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
Now please turn to Slide 9. Let me summarize our updated full year performance by end market and highlight a few changes since our previous outlook in February. Beginning with industrial, which represents 44% of total revenue, we continue to expect this market to be flat to up low single digits. Our projection assumes that low single-digit growth in general industrial will be partially offset by headwinds in the mining and oil and gas sector. While first quarter performance in mining, which represents approximately 5% of total revenue was generally in line with our expectations, we continue to closely monitor market trends. Oil and gas, which now represents less than 3% of total revenue, is forecasted to decline through the first half of this year before we lap last year's second half of nearly 40% declines. 
Public utility, which represents 33% of our total revenue, is now anticipated to grow at a mid- to high single-digit rate. Here, we've raised our outlook following a strong first quarter start and with the expectation of continued momentum in the U.S. We also see encouraging signs for improved European market conditions, including strong contributions from the AMP6 cycle in the U.K. And in the emerging markets, we expect to see continued project growth. 
For the commercial end market, no change to our expectation of mid-single-digit range growth. We see solid contributions from both the U.S. and Europe and double-digit growth in the Middle East. The relatively warmer winter led to a slow start to the year for residential heating applications and tougher macro conditions in Australia. As a result, we now expect the residential market to be flat year-over-year. And finally, our smaller sector, agriculture, we anticipate, will be up low single digits for the year. 
Please turn to Slide 10, and Mark will provide some calendarization insight for the rest of the year."

For the second quarter of 2016, we expect total revenue of approximately $920 million, flat versus the prior year. This includes organic growth of approximately $20 million or 2%, revenue from our acquisitions of approximately $10 million",304,"Thanks, Patrick. For the second quarter of 2016, we expect total revenue of approximately $920 million, flat versus the prior year. This includes organic growth of approximately $20 million or 2%, revenue from our acquisitions of approximately $10 million and approximately $30 million of headwind from foreign exchange translation. We anticipate operating income to be up modestly year-over-year with operating margins up 40 to 60 basis points as volume leverage and cost reductions more than offset inflation, growth investments and unfavorable mix.  
Looking out to the second half of the year. We anticipate year-over-year organic growth of approximately 3% with acquisitions adding just over $30 million and FX headwind of nearly $45 million. Operating margins in the second half are expected to increase in the range of 80 to 130 basis points year-over-year. This improvement reflects volume leverage in the net incremental savings from restructuring and continuous improvement cost actions in excess of increased R&D and growth investments. Relative to the first half of the year, we also anticipate favorable mix, given that we'll lap oil and gas headwinds as we exit the second quarter. 
To wrap up, let me make a few points about the foreign exchange assumptions in our full year guidance. As Patrick mentioned earlier, we have not reflected any potential benefit from foreign exchange variability in our updated outlook. We do not see any significant benefit in the first quarter and it's too early to update any full year assumptions at this point in the year, given the volatility of currencies. Having said that, we have provided a table in the appendix that outlines the potential full year impact to those assumptions, which is $0.01 of EPS per quarter based on exchange rates late last week. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Patrick for closing comments. Patrick?"

That definitely has informed our priorities both in terms of organic investment in R&D and the innovation technology roadmap that Jay, our new innovation technology officer, and our R&D teams are really focused on. But at the same time, it's also informing our M&A pipeline. Certainly, the acquisitions of HYPACK and Tideland were a demonstration of that. And we see a very rich pipeline of further opportunities to be able to do that. You know that we set out some pretty ambitious goals at Investor Day on where we can take our Vitality Index in terms of revenue generated from new offerings over the last 5 years. And so we're expecting for several hundred basis points of improvement and expansion on that over the next 4 to 5 years."

So certainly, given the oil and gas and mining exposure that our dewatering team has been facing there, that was big body blow for us last year and really provided a headwind for -- against all the other great margin expansion efforts that we were doing. The team within that business did a fantastic job of at least holding their margins flat despite a significant dropoff last year in revenue. And I think we are confident that as that business rebounds -- hard to make a call as to when oil and gas and mining might rebound. But certainly, as that business laps that and begin to get some additional top line growth, we would expect to see quite sizable incremental margins fall through, given the number of the cost actions the team took last year to manage the bottom. And that certainly would be an accretive impact for Water Infrastructure."

So in that 44% of overall industrial revenue for us, 8% of that is tied to oil and gas and mining. So the other, let's call it, 36% of our total revenue, we really refer to that as more light industrial. And that's been up 3% and are expected that to continue. It is heavily tied to GDP in the U.S. It's overweighted to the U.S. It is a broad swath of exposure, ranging from food and beverage to pharma to chemicals to marine to a wide variety, car washes. It's a wide variety of areas, that I think about that business is in that it's historically been very, very steady. We're not tied to capital spend. We're not tied to industrial output. As long as people's operations are up and running, they're going to burn through these small pumps that we sell them. And so it's a good, steady business. The tweaks that we typically see there is when there can be adjustments in inventory or stock. We saw a little bit of that last year. But again, expect that business to be pretty stable here in that low single-digit range for 2016. On the industrial treatment business, only about 25% of our treatment business today is sold into industrial. We're heavily weighted towards muni and wastewater. And that is a business that tends to be lower margin for us. Hence, the discussion around shifting even more of our weight towards the industrial sector, where it's higher technology, more regulations, deeper pockets, people willing to spend based on life cycle costs. And so it is an area of focus for us both as it relates to our own internal R&D efforts and the pipeline there. Again, those are -- tend to be slower to come to fruition. But we're working on those right now as we speak. And as we mentioned before, it is an area of focus for us in terms of M&A down the path."

And as we mentioned in the prepared comments, Applied Water will more than recover that and expand margins for the full year. So it really is the timing of the investment that hit in the quarter.

So that is an area of the business that we have prioritized in terms of focusing our teams, our org structure, et cetera, to make sure that we get at that, to make sure that we win more than our fair share of that aftermarket service business. On reuse, reuse continues to be a very attractive spot for us in our treatment business. Obviously, the flashpoints in California and other areas that are now looking at reuse as a truly viable alternative, whether it be desal or other forms of treatment.

Before I begin, I want to welcome our new CFO, Mark Rajkowski to Xylem. Mark brings more than 30 years of diverse financial and operational experience. And importantly, he had a significant experience in leading transformational change across operating models and product portfolio changes, M&A activity and capital market transactions, all to create substantial shareholder value. He's been here just over a month, but he's already hit the ground running, visiting the field and working closely with our senior leadership team to gain a better understanding of the business and our plans for future growth. I know some of you already know Mark. But for those who don't, I'm sure over the coming months, we'll find opportunities for you to get to meet him. 
I'd also like to take this opportunity to thank Shashank Patel, who's here with us this morning, for his outstanding work as our interim CFO over the past 7 months. Shashank is an incredibly effective executive, who brought his financial acumen and deep knowledge of Xylem's businesses to bear to create a seamless transition in this important CFO role. He has been instrumental in bringing Mark up to speed. And I look forward to continuing to work with him as he takes on a new role here at Xylem. 
Now let's move on to our first quarter results. We had a solid start to 2016, which positions us well to deliver on our full year commitments. The benefits of our diversified product portfolio and end-market exposure helped us deliver 4% organic growth. Our top line growth exceeded our expectations, with strong execution by our teams helping to drive share gains in key regions. But I do want to acknowledge that we benefited from some projects shifting from Q2 into Q1 as well as weather conditions that were favorable to the public utility market. I'll come back to that in a few minutes. 
A significant driver of our growth was the continued momentum we saw in key end markets, mainly public utilities, where growth was seen across all key regions. The U.S. was particularly strong, up 22% year-over-year. The rising trend line on the break and fix side of the business continues, and the milder winter provided an opportunity for public utilities to accelerate some needed repairs and maintenance. As I've mentioned previously, this area of the business has been suppressed for the last few years as municipalities have deferred activities due to budget constraints. But we are seeing some change in priorities. And these smaller projects are being green-lit with greater frequency. 
In addition, as I've just mentioned, one of the contributing factors to our top line growth in the quarter was the shift of treatment projects in the second quarter into the first. Given that treatment project installations generally deliver lower incremental margins relative to other parts of our business, this shift didn't have a significant impact on the bottom line. On a macro level, mixed economic conditions do persist, but we remain focused on our growth objectives. 
We are seeing stable market conditions in the U.S. and the early signs of improvement in Europe. And while we've seen a significant slowdown in some emerging markets, we still generated 2% growth across these regions. India and the Middle East were particular standouts in the quarter, generating 90% and 10% growth, respectively. That growth was partially offset by a significant year-over-year decline in China, which reflects both soft market conditions in certain sectors as well as the variability in project work. 
That said, China's performance was in line with our expectations. Based on what we're seeing in terms of quarter-to-quarter sequential order trends, we believe the local market may be stabilizing. Importantly, we remain confident in the China market. Water Infrastructure is a top priority of the government, something that was reaffirmed in the State Council's latest action plan released in April. And we see a robust pipeline of project activity. So as we begin to lap the steep declines we faced in commercial and industrial sectors, which became more pronounced in the fourth quarter of 2015, we will be well positioned to further accelerate our growth performance. Net-net, we are expecting China to deliver results of flat to low single-digit growth for the full year. 
Organic order bookings in the quarter were flat versus last year. But this result reflects the variation of timing that occurred with major project work. For example, if we adjusted for just 2 of the major orders won in Q1 of last year, year-over-year orders would have shown a 3% increase. Our adjusted operating margin in the quarter expanded to 10.9%, up 40 basis points excluding the impact of our recent acquisitions of HYPACK and Tideland. Given our strong top line growth and ongoing cost reduction actions, we have accelerated some investments in our growth initiatives. 
Let me provide a brief update on the strategic priorities that we laid out at our Investor Day last fall. First, enhancing commercial leadership. As we continue to shift our center of gravity close to our customers, we were engaged in a number of activities to improve the customer experience and expand our channel reach, which ultimately will increase our opportunities to generate more growth. We're investing in additional capability-building around a common set of tools and processes across our commercial teams. 
Our second priority is to grow in emerging markets. And as I've just mentioned, we are making good progress. In the Middle East, you'll recall that we are opening a new facility in Dubai in order to localize manufacturing and assembly of some of our products, beginning with our Applied Water portfolio. This expansion will enable us to better serve our growing customer base in the region by bringing the supply chain closer to them. And we expect to be operational later this summer. We are also encouraged by the momentum we see in India, where we have a relatively smaller but growing presence. We are moving forward with our plans for localized product designs to be more responsive to the needs of this market. 
In the area of strengthening innovation and technology, we are starting to build good momentum. We have already begun to invest in several areas and expect to increase our 2016 full year R&D spending by 50 basis points to more than 3% of revenue. Our core areas of focus are smart technologies, systems intelligence and advanced treatment and industrial services. We expect these investments to drive not only top line growth but also to improve the gross margin profile of our business. Coming up, we are looking forward to a significant new product introduction in our Water Infrastructure segment later this month. 
Our next priority, continuous improvement, includes lean, global procurement and a sharper focus on driving business simplification. We expect these efforts to generate significant cost savings and operating margin improvement this year and over the next several years. As I've discussed before, we are instilling a productivity-for-growth mindset throughout the business, so we can fund the necessary investments to achieve our longer-term value creation objectives. In the first quarter, we achieved $22 million in cost savings through continuous improvement, global procurement and business simplification initiatives. And we are on track to reach our full year goal. I am pleased with the momentum our teams are building in this area and would highlight that we expect to achieve another consecutive year of record savings in 2016. 
Our final strategic priority is to cultivate leadership and talent development. On the leadership front, with the addition of Mark as our CFO, I now have my senior team in place and working together toward our common goals. We have also launched the Xylem Learning Center, a global platform for training and knowledge management throughout the organization, as well as 2 concentrated development programs for high-performing managers and leaders. 
Shifting back to our results. At the bottom line, we generated adjusted earnings per share of $0.35 in the quarter, an increase of 9% year-over-year, excluding the impact of acquisitions. Also a strong focus on our working capital performance drove 130 basis point improvement as a percentage of revenue and an increase of $23 million in operating cash flow. These efforts position us well to deliver another year of free cash flow conversion in excess of 100% of net income. Finally, as we announced this morning, we are raising our full year earnings guidance to $1.98 to $2.08. We will cover this in more detail later in the call, but let me give you some perspective. 
Our guidance increase today reflects the incremental interest savings from the refinancing of a portion of our long-term debt. There is no change in our expectations regarding the performance of our core business. We expect stable conditions across roughly 90% of our portfolio and we anticipate generating growth across all key regions. Given that, we believe we're positioned to exceed market growth rates. We are certainly off to a good start for the year, delivering solid top line growth and executing well across our businesses. But we're 1 quarter into the year and we recognize that we are still operating in a mixed macro environment. 
One last point. We could potentially recognize some favorability benefit from foreign exchange movements if rates hold over the balance of the year. However, we believe it's too early to make those types of changes, so we have not changed our underlying foreign exchange assumptions in providing today's earnings update. Mark will give some additional color on our FX sensitivity later in the call. 
Now with that, I'll turn it over to Mark for more details in the quarter."
118218449,321421350,970855,"Xylem Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 03, 2016",2016-05-03,"Earnings Calls","Xylem Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Patrick. Now please turn to Slide 4. We generated revenue of $847 million in the quarter, up $10 million from the prior year despite FX headwind of $27 million. Recent acquisitions added $6 million to the top line in the quarter. Organic revenue i",1497,"Thanks, Patrick. Now please turn to Slide 4. We generated revenue of $847 million in the quarter, up $10 million from the prior year despite FX headwind of $27 million. Recent acquisitions added $6 million to the top line in the quarter. Organic revenue increased $31 million or 4%, which exceeded our expectations and was largely driven by the 12% increase in the global public utility market. 
Looking at the rest of our end markets. Our industrial vertical was flat as expected. Commercial was up 5%, but residential was down 5%. Sales to our ag customers were down 1%. From a regional perspective, we generated growth in each of our key regions with Western Europe up 5%, the U.S. up 4% and emerging markets growing at 2%. Operating margin increased 10 basis points to 10.9% for the quarter. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, margins increased by 40 basis points year-over-year. Strong execution and cost reductions enabled us to fund the strategic investments we need to further accelerate profitable growth. 
Let me provide a little more detail on our margin expansion. Continuous improvement, global procurement and business simplification initiatives reduced our costs by $22 million in the quarter, resulting in 260 basis points of margin improvement. Our operating margin increased 100 basis points due to volume leverage, modest price realization and favorable mix. Partially offsetting these items were cost inflation of 190 basis points and strategic investments of 130 basis points. These investments included increased R&D spend to fund new product development, expansion of our organization's selling and continuous improvement capabilities and the localization of assembly and production in attractive, faster-growth regions. 
Earnings per share of $0.35 grew 6% year-over-year, but were up 9% excluding the acquisitions of HYPACK and Tideland, which were $0.01 dilutive in the first quarter as expected due to the seasonality of these businesses. These acquisitions are tracking to plan and are expected to be earnings-neutral for the full year 2016 and accretive to earnings in 2017. One final item, we have excluded from adjusted earnings a net tax benefit of $14 million during the quarter, which is primarily the result of closing out our prior year tax audit. 
Now let me cover each of our reporting segments. Please turn to Slide 5. Water Infrastructure recorded orders of $534 million, down 2% organically, as we lapped the prior year quarter that included 2 large project wins, totaling approximately $25 million. Excluding these unusually large orders from last year, orders would have been up 3%. We exited the quarter with total backlog of $580 million, about the same as last year on an organic basis. Of this total, we expect to ship approximately 75% over the next 3 quarters. This is up 3% organically year-over-year and relatively consistent with our sales outlook for the segment. Revenue of $514 million represents a 6% increase year-over-year on an organic basis. Acquisitions added an additional $6 million to the top line, but foreign exchange was a $21 million headwind. 
Now let me provide you with some color on this quarter's performance. We generated 12% growth in the global public utility market. This increase reflects the continued market recovery we've seen over the past few quarters as well as milder winter weather, which enabled municipalities to accelerate maintenance activities. Additionally, strong execution and the timing of a few treatment project deliveries also contributed to better-than-expected performance. 
In the U.S., where our public utility business grew 22%, our teams performed very well, driving share gains in the water and wastewater pump market. We also saw benefits from our investment in sales capability as demonstrated by an increase in mixer and mixer aftermarket sales. Strength in Western Europe came from the early stages of the U.K. public utility AMP6 cycle. 
Emerging market results were favorable despite mixed market conditions. Our overall growth was driven by a large custom pump project in India and continued investment in water and wastewater infrastructure in the Middle East. Finally, our industrial end market was flat as low single-digit growth in the general industrial and construction markets was muted by the negative impact of the oil and gas and mining sectors. 
Operating margin increased 150 basis points from 10.6% to 12.1%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, operating margin increased 200 basis points, driven by volume leverage, favorable mix, modest price realization and cost reductions, partially offset by increases in cost inflation and increased strategic growth investments. 
Please turn to Slide 6. Applied Water recorded orders of $354 million, up 2% organically over the prior year period. We entered the second quarter with total backlog of $197 million, down 5% on an organic basis, primarily due to the delivery of a large project in the fourth quarter of 2015. Of that total, approximately $105 million is expected to ship within the second quarter. 
Applied Water segment revenue was $333 million, up 1% organically from the prior year. Highlights of our revenue performance include the following. Commercial and industrial market strength drove 5% growth in Western Europe. Here, we're seeing the continued traction from energy-efficient product launches and our investment in building our regional sales capabilities. 
In the U.S., commercial was up 3%, driven by continued strength in the institutional building sector. We also saw a 3% growth in residential but with an unfavorable mix in demand within our product offerings. Here, as a result of a relatively warm winter, demand for our higher-margin hot water circulators declined while demand for lower-margin well pumps increased. 
The segment's U.S. industrial revenue declined 7%. This primarily reflects lower demand for specialty pump applications serving the food and beverage and marine sectors, and drove the overall 1% decline in the U.S. Segment revenue was down 3% in our emerging markets due primarily to the anticipated slowdown in the commercial and industrial end markets in China. 
Sequentially, we've seen modest improvement in orders in China, thanks in part to what we believe are stabilizing end-market conditions as well as strong execution by our local team. Partially offsetting the year-over-year decline in China was double-digit growth in Eastern Europe and the Middle East, again driven by the strategic growth investment that we're making to build our sales capabilities in these regions. 
Segment operating margin declined 130 basis points from 13.9% to 12.6% year-over-year. Cost reductions drove a 270 basis point improvement, more than offsetting inflation and the impact of unfavorable residential mix in the quarter. However, increased spend on strategic growth investments reduced margins by 180 basis points. These investments are funding the localization of product assembly in the Middle East and include higher investments in innovation and technology for new product development. Looking at the full year 2016, we continue to expect segment margins in the range of 30 to 50 basis points. 
To summarize this quarter's performance, we delivered modest top line growth as we managed the near-term slowdown and tough year-over-year comparisons in China as well as sluggish U.S. industrial market conditions. At the same time, we remain focused on delivering productivity gains to fund our growth investments. 
Now let's turn to Slide 7, where I'll cover the company's cash flow and financial position. The first thing you'll likely notice on our balance sheet is our unusually large cash position of $1.2 billion at the end of the quarter. This reflects the proceeds from our very successful European debt issuance in March, which we used to redeem our 3.55% senior notes on April 11. 
Our net debt-to-net capital ratio is healthy at 24% and our commercial paper and revolving credit facilities remain in place and unutilized. This underscores our financial strength and flexibility. In that regard, we remain committed to a balanced capital deployment strategy, which is to profitably grow the business through organic investments and M&A while enhancing shareholder returns through dividends and opportunistic share repurchases. 
During the first quarter, we invested $37 million for capital expenditures, much of this for growth projects. We acquired Tideland for $70 million and we returned $28 million to our shareholders through dividends. The first quarter included a 10% increase in dividends per share, marking the fifth consecutive year that we've increased our dividend. 
Historically, our first quarter free cash flow generation is seasonally low and impacted by the timing of annual incentive payments as well as lower sales leverage. Free cash flow was $4 million in the quarter, representing a modest improvement from the prior year. Year-over-year, free cash flow benefited from a $23 million reduction in working capital, largely offset by the timing of additional interest and tax payments in the quarter. We continue to expect to deliver at least 100% cash conversion this year. 
It's worth highlighting that we improved working capital as a percentage of revenue by 130 basis points in the quarter, excluding the impact of acquisitions. The improvement was driven by better inventory management and receivables collections. 
Please move to Slide 8, and I'll turn the call back over to Patrick to cover our 2016 guidance. Patrick?"

Second and more importantly, as I said in my open",656,"Thanks, Mark. I'll begin by making 2 quick points. First, the growth rates I refer to on this slide all exclude the anticipated negative foreign exchange impact that we discussed in our last earnings call. Second and more importantly, as I said in my opening remarks, there is no change in the outlook for the performance of our core business. We continue to expect to generate faster-than-market growth, delivering organic revenue growth of 2% to 4%. While I'll cover specific details by end market on the next slide, let me highlight that we continue to expect stable conditions across roughly 90% of our portfolio, including growth across all key geographies. Additionally, we expect acquisitions will provide an additional 1% of revenue growth. 
Our adjusted operating margin is still expected to grow in the range of 50 to 80 basis points overall, with roughly 20 basis points of margin dilution from the acquisitions of HYPACK and Tideland. Excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions, our operating margin is expected to expand by 70 to 100 basis points. This expansion will be realized after the impact of investments we are making to accelerate profitable growth. As I mentioned earlier, we continue to drive our continuous improvement work deeper into the organization with very good results. We expect our lean and global procurement initiatives to generate full year gross savings of $120 million, an increase of roughly 20% year-over-year. 
We're raising our earnings per share guidance to $1.98 to $2.08 to reflect the interest savings from our debt refinancing. This range excludes restructuring and realignment cost of about $25 million, but this projection does include $0.04 of negative foreign currency translation impact. Excluding this impact, EPS growth is now expected to be in the range of 9% to 15%. We will continue to execute a disciplined approach to capital deployment, which is expected to result in free cash flow conversion greater than 100% after investing $120 million to $130 million in CapEx. Finally, we currently anticipate returning a minimum of $150 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
Now please turn to Slide 9. Let me summarize our updated full year performance by end market and highlight a few changes since our previous outlook in February. Beginning with industrial, which represents 44% of total revenue, we continue to expect this market to be flat to up low single digits. Our projection assumes that low single-digit growth in general industrial will be partially offset by headwinds in the mining and oil and gas sectors. While first quarter performance in mining, which represents approximately 5% of total revenue, was generally in line with our expectations, we continue to closely monitor market trends. Oil and gas, which now represents less than 3% of total revenue, is forecasted to decline through the first half of this year before we lap last year's second half of nearly 40% declines. 
Public utility, which represents 33% of our total revenue, is now anticipated to grow at a mid- to high single-digit rate. Here, we've raised our outlook following a strong first quarter start and with the expectation of continued momentum in the U.S. We also see encouraging signs for improved European market conditions, including strong contributions from the AMP6 cycle in the U.K. And in the emerging markets, we expect to see continued project growth. 
For the commercial end market, no change to our expectation of mid-single-digit range growth. We see solid contributions from both the U.S. and Europe and double-digit growth in the Middle East. The relatively warmer winter led to a slow start to the year for residential heating applications and tougher macro conditions in Australia. As a result, we now expect the residential market to be flat year-over-year. And finally, our smallest sector, agriculture, we anticipate will be up low single digits for the year. 
Please turn to Slide 10, and Mark will provide some calendarization insight for the rest of the year."

For the second quarter of 2016, we expect total revenue of approximately $920 million, flat versus the prior year. This includes organic growth of approximately $20 million or 2%, revenue from our acquisitions of approximately $10 million and approximately $30 million of headwind from foreign exchange translation. We anticipate operating income to be up modestly year-over-year with operating margins up 40 to 60 basis points as volume leverage and cost reductions more than offset inflation, growth investments and unfavorable mix.  
Looking out to the second half of the year. We anticipate year-over-year organic growth of approximately 3% with acquisitions adding just over $30 million and FX headwind of nearly $45 million. Operating margins in the second half are expected to increase in the range of 80 to 130 basis points year-over-year. This improvement reflects volume leverage and the net incremental savings from restructuring and continuous improvement cost actions in excess of increased R&D and growth investments. Relative to the first half of the year, we also anticipate favorable mix, given that we'll lap oil and gas headwinds as we exit the second quarter. 
To wrap up, let me make a few points about the foreign exchange assumptions in our full year guidance. As Patrick mentioned earlier, we have not reflected any potential benefit from foreign exchange variability in our updated outlook. We do not see any significant benefit in the first quarter and it's too early to update any full year assumptions at this point in the year, given the volatility of currencies. Having said that, we have provided a table in the appendix that outlines the potential full year impact to those assumptions, which is $0.01 of EPS per quarter based on exchange rates late last week. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Patrick for closing comments. Patrick?"

But at the same time, it's also informing our M&A pipeline. Certainly, the acquisitions of HYPACK and Tideland were a demonstration of that. And we see a very rich pipeline of further opportunities to be able to do that. You know that we set out some pretty ambitious goals at Investor Day on where we can take our Vitality Index in terms of revenue generated from new offerings over the last 5 years. And so we're expecting for several hundred basis points of improvement and expansion in that over the next 4 to 5 years."

But certainly, as that business laps that and begins to get some additional top line growth, we would expect to see quite sizable incremental margins fall through, given the number of the cost actions the team took last year to manage the bottom. And that certainly would be an accretive impact for Water Infrastructure."

So in that 44% of overall industrial revenue for us, 8% of that is tied to oil and gas and mining. So the other, let's call it, 36% of our total revenue, we really refer to that as more light industrial. And that's been up 3% and are expecting that to continue. It is heavily tied to GDP in the U.S. It's overweighted to the U.S. It is a broad swath of exposure, ranging from food and beverage to pharma, to chemicals, to marine, to a wide variety -- car washes. It's a wide variety of areas. The nice thing about that business is that it's historically been very, very steady. We're not tied to capital spend. We're not tied to industrial output. As long as people's operations are up and running, they're going to burn through these small pumps that we sell them. And so it's a good, steady business. The tweaks that we typically see there is when there can be adjustments in inventory or stock. We saw a little bit of that last year. But again, expect that business to be pretty stable here in that low single-digit range for 2016. On the industrial treatment business, only about 25% of our treatment business today is sold into industrial. We're heavily weighted towards muni and wastewater, and that is a business that tends to be lower margin for us. Hence, the discussion around shifting even more of our weight towards the industrial sector, where it's higher technology, more regulations, deeper pockets, people willing to spend based on life cycle costs. And so it is an area of focus for us both as it relates to our own internal R&D efforts and the pipeline there. Again, those are -- tend to be slower to come to fruition. But we're working on those right now as we speak. And as we mentioned before, it is an area of focus for us in terms of M&A down the path."

And as we mentioned in the prepared comments, Applied Water will more than recover that and expand margins for the full year. So it really is the timing of the investment that hit in the quarter.

So that is an area of the business that we have prioritized in terms of focusing our teams, our org structure, et cetera, to make sure that we get at that, to make sure that we win more than our fair share of that aftermarket service business. On reuse, reuse continues to be a very attractive spot for us in our treatment business. Obviously, the flashpoints in California and other areas that are now looking at reuse as a truly viable alternative, whether it be desal or other forms of treatment, it well positions us to play in that sector.

I'd also like to take this opportunity to thank Shashank Patel, who's here with us this morning, for his outstanding work as our interim CFO over the past 7 months. Shashank is an incredibly effective executive, who brought his financial acumen and deep knowledge of Xylem's businesses to bear to create a seamless transition in this important CFO role. He has been instrumental in bringing Mark up to speed. And I look forward to continuing to work with him as he takes on a new role here at Xylem. 
Now let's move on to our first quarter results. We had a solid start to 2016, which positions us well to deliver on our full year commitments. The benefits of our diversified product portfolio and end market exposure helped us deliver 4% organic growth. Our top line growth exceeded our expectations, with strong execution by our teams helping to drive share gains in key regions. But I do want to acknowledge that we benefited from some projects shifting from Q2 into Q1 as well as weather conditions that were favorable to the public utility market. I'll come back to that in a few minutes. 
A significant driver of our growth was the continued momentum we saw in key end markets, mainly public utilities, where growth was seen across all key regions. The U.S. was particularly strong, up 22% year-over-year. The rising trend line on the break and fix side of the business continues, and the milder winter provided an opportunity for public utilities to accelerate some needed repairs and maintenance. As I've mentioned previously, this area of the business has been suppressed for the last few years as municipalities have deferred activities due to budget constraints. But we are seeing some change in priorities. And these smaller projects are being green-lit with greater frequency. 
In addition, as I've just mentioned, one of the contributing factors to our top line growth in the quarter was the shift of treatment projects in the second quarter into the first. Given that treatment project installations generally deliver lower incremental margins relative to other parts of our business, this shift didn't have a significant impact on the bottom line. On a macro level, mixed economic conditions do persist, but we remain focused on our growth objectives. 
We are seeing stable market conditions in the U.S. and the early signs of improvement in Europe. And while we've seen a significant slowdown in some emerging markets, we still generated 2% growth across these regions. India and the Middle East were particular standouts in the quarter, generating 90% and 10% growth, respectively. That growth was partially offset by a significant year-over-year decline in China, which reflects both soft market conditions in certain sectors as well as the variability in project work. 
That said, China's performance was in line with our expectations. Based on what we're seeing in terms of quarter-to-quarter sequential order trends, we believe the local market may be stabilizing. Importantly, we remain confident in the China market. Water Infrastructure is a top priority of the government, something that was reaffirmed in the State Council's latest action plan released in April. And we see a robust pipeline of project activity. So as we begin to lap the steep declines we faced in commercial and industrial sectors, which became more pronounced in the fourth quarter of 2015, we will be well positioned to further accelerate our growth performance. Net-net, we are expecting China to deliver results of flat to low single-digit growth for the full year. 
Organic order bookings in the quarter were flat versus last year. But this result reflects the variation of timing that occurred with major project work. For example, if we adjusted for just 2 of the major orders won in Q1 of last year, year-over-year orders would have shown a 3% increase. Our adjusted operating margin in the quarter expanded to 10.9%, up 40 basis points excluding the impact of our recent acquisitions of HYPACK and Tideland. Given our strong top line growth and ongoing cost reduction actions, we have accelerated some investments in our growth initiatives. 
Let me provide a brief update on the strategic priorities that we laid out at our Investor Day last fall. First, enhancing commercial leadership. As we continue to shift our center of gravity close to our customers, we were engaged in a number of activities to improve the customer experience and expand our channel reach, which ultimately will increase our opportunities to generate more growth. We're investing in additional capability-building around a common set of tools and processes across our commercial teams. 
Our second priority is to grow in emerging markets. And as I've just mentioned, we are making good progress. In the Middle East, you'll recall that we are opening a new facility in Dubai in order to localize manufacturing and assembly of some of our products, beginning with our Applied Water portfolio. This expansion will enable us to better serve our growing customer base in the region by bringing the supply chain closer to them. And we expect to be operational later this summer. We are also encouraged by the momentum we see in India, where we have a relatively smaller but growing presence. We are moving forward with our plans for localized product designs to be more responsive to the needs of this market. 
In the area of strengthening innovation and technology, we are starting to build good momentum. We have already begun to invest in several areas and expect to increase our 2016 full year R&D spending by 50 basis points to more than 3% of revenue. Our core areas of focus are smart technologies, systems intelligence and advanced treatment and industrial services. We expect these investments to drive not only top line growth but also to improve the gross margin profile of our business. Coming up, we are looking forward to a significant new product introduction in our Water Infrastructure segment later this month. 
Our next priority, continuous improvement, includes lean, global procurement and a sharper focus on driving business simplification. We expect these efforts to generate significant cost savings and operating margin improvement this year and over the next several years. As I've discussed before, we are instilling a productivity for growth mindset throughout the business, so we can fund the necessary investments to achieve our longer-term value creation objectives. In the first quarter, we achieved $22 million in cost savings through continuous improvement, global procurement and business simplification initiatives. And we are on track to reach our full year goal. I am pleased with the momentum our teams are building in this area and would highlight that we expect to achieve another consecutive year of record savings in 2016. 
Our final strategic priority is to cultivate leadership and talent development. On the leadership front, with the addition of Mark as our CFO, I now have my senior team in place and working together toward our common goals. We have also launched the Xylem Learning Center, a global platform for training and knowledge management throughout the organization, as well as 2 concentrated development programs for high-performing managers and leaders. 
Shifting back to our results. At the bottom line, we generated adjusted earnings per share of $0.35 in the quarter, an increase of 9% year-over-year, excluding the impact of acquisitions. Also a strong focus on our working capital performance drove 130 basis point improvement as a percentage of revenue and an increase of $23 million in operating cash flow. These efforts position us well to deliver another year of free cash flow conversion in excess of 100% of net income. Finally, as we announced this morning, we are raising our full year earnings guidance to $1.98 to $2.08. We will cover this in more detail later in the call, but let me give you some perspective. 
Our guidance increase today reflects the incremental interest savings from the refinancing of a portion of our long-term debt. There is no change in our expectations regarding the performance of our core business. We expect stable conditions across roughly 90% of our portfolio and we anticipate generating growth across all key regions. Given that, we believe we're positioned to exceed market growth rates. We are certainly off to a good start for the year, delivering solid top line growth and executing well across our businesses. But we're 1 quarter into the year and we recognize that we are still operating in a mixed macro environment. 
One last point. We could potentially recognize some favorability benefit from foreign exchange movements if rates hold over the balance of the year. However, we believe it's too early to make those types of changes, so we have not changed our underlying foreign exchange assumptions in providing today's earnings update. Mark will give some additional color on our FX sensitivity later in the call. 
Now with that, I'll turn it over to Mark for more details in the quarter."

Organic revenue i",1498,"Thanks, Patrick. Now please turn to Slide 4. We generated revenue of $847 million in the quarter, up $10 million from the prior year despite FX headwind of $27 million. Recent acquisitions added $6 million to the top line in the quarter. Organic revenue increased $31 million or 4%, which exceeded our expectations and was largely driven by the 12% increase in the global public utility market. 
Looking at the rest of our end markets. Our industrial vertical was flat as expected. Commercial was up 5%, but residential was down 5%. Sales to our ag customers were down 1%. From a regional perspective, we generated growth in each of our key regions with Western Europe up 5%, the U.S. up 4% and emerging markets growing at 2%. Operating margin increased 10 basis points to 10.9% for the quarter. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, margins increased by 40 basis points year-over-year. Strong execution and cost reductions enabled us to fund the strategic investments we need to further accelerate profitable growth. 
Let me provide a little more detail on our margin expansion. Continuous improvement, global procurement and business simplification initiatives reduced our costs by $22 million in the quarter, resulting in 260 basis points of margin improvement. Our operating margin increased 100 basis points due to volume leverage, modest price realization and favorable mix. Partially offsetting these items were cost inflation of 190 basis points and strategic investments of 130 basis points. These investments included increased R&D spend to fund new product development, expansion of our organization's selling and continuous improvement capabilities and the localization of assembly and production in attractive, faster-growth regions. 
Earnings per share of $0.35 grew 6% year-over-year, but were up 9% excluding the acquisitions of HYPACK and Tideland, which were $0.01 dilutive in the first quarter as expected due to the seasonality of these businesses. These acquisitions are tracking to plan and are expected to be earnings-neutral for the full year 2016 and accretive to earnings in 2017. One final item, we have excluded from adjusted earnings a net tax benefit of $14 million during the quarter, which is primarily the result of closing out our prior year tax audit. 
Now let me cover each of our reporting segments. Please turn to Slide 5. Water Infrastructure recorded orders of $534 million, down 2% organically, as we lapped the prior year quarter that included 2 large project wins, totaling approximately $25 million. Excluding these unusually large orders from last year, orders would have been up 3%. We exited the quarter with total backlog of $580 million, about the same as last year on an organic basis. Of this total, we expect to ship approximately 75% over the next 3 quarters. This is up 3% organically year-over-year and relatively consistent with our sales outlook for the segment. Revenue of $514 million represents a 6% increase year-over-year on an organic basis. Acquisitions added an additional $6 million to the top line, but foreign exchange was a $21 million headwind. 
Now let me provide you with some color on this quarter's performance. We generated 12% growth in the global public utility market. This increase reflects the continued market recovery we've seen over the past few quarters as well as milder winter weather, which enabled municipalities to accelerate maintenance activities. Additionally, strong execution and the timing of a few treatment project deliveries also contributed to better-than-expected performance. 
In the U.S., where our public utility business grew 22%, our teams performed very well, driving share gains in the water and wastewater pump market. We also saw benefits from our investment in sales capability as demonstrated by an increase in mixer and mixer aftermarket sales. Strength in Western Europe came from the early stages of the U.K. public utility AMP6 cycle. 
Emerging market results were favorable despite mixed market conditions. Our overall growth was driven by a large custom pump project in India and continued investment in water and wastewater infrastructure in the Middle East. Finally, our industrial end market was flat as low single-digit growth in the general industrial and construction markets was muted by the negative impact of the oil and gas and mining sectors. 
Operating margin increased 150 basis points from 10.6% to 12.1%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, operating margin increased 200 basis points, driven by volume leverage, favorable mix, modest price realization and cost reductions, partially offset by increases in cost inflation and increased strategic growth investments. 
Please turn to Slide 6. Applied Water recorded orders of $354 million, up 2% organically over the prior year period. We entered the second quarter with total backlog of $197 million, down 5% on an organic basis, primarily due to the delivery of a large project in the fourth quarter of 2015. Of that total, approximately $105 million is expected to ship within the second quarter. 
Applied Water segment revenue was $333 million, up 1% organically from the prior year. Highlights of our revenue performance include the following. Commercial and industrial market strength drove 5% growth in Western Europe. Here, we're seeing the continued traction from energy-efficient product launches and our investment in building our regional sales capabilities. 
In the U.S., commercial was up 3%, driven by continued strength in the institutional building sector. We also saw a 3% growth in residential but with an unfavorable mix in demand within our product offerings. Here, as a result of a relatively warm winter, demand for our higher-margin hot water circulators declined while demand for lower-margin well pumps increased. 
The segment's U.S. industrial revenue declined 7%. This primarily reflects lower demand for specialty pump applications serving the food and beverage and marine sectors, and drove the overall 1% decline in the U.S. Segment revenue was down 3% in our emerging markets due primarily to the anticipated slowdown in the commercial and industrial end markets in China. 
Sequentially, we've seen modest improvement in orders in China, thanks in part to what we believe are stabilizing end market conditions as well as strong execution by our local team. Partially offsetting the year-over-year decline in China was double-digit growth in Eastern Europe and the Middle East, again driven by the strategic growth investment that we're making to build our sales capabilities in these regions. 
Segment operating margin declined 130 basis points from 13.9% to 12.6% year-over-year. Cost reductions drove a 270 basis point improvement, more than offsetting inflation and the impact of unfavorable residential mix in the quarter. However, increased spend on strategic growth investments reduced margins by 180 basis points. These investments are funding the localization of product assembly in the Middle East and include higher investments in innovation and technology for new product development. Looking at the full year 2016, we continue to expect segment margins in the range of 30 to 50 basis points. 
To summarize this quarter's performance, we delivered modest top line growth as we managed the near-term slowdown and tough year-over-year comparisons in China as well as sluggish U.S. industrial market conditions. At the same time, we remain focused on delivering productivity gains to fund our growth investments. 
Now let's turn to Slide 7, where I'll cover the company's cash flow and financial position. The first thing you'll likely notice on our balance sheet is our unusually large cash position of $1.2 billion at the end of the quarter. This reflects the proceeds from our very successful European debt issuance in March, which we used to redeem our 3.55% senior notes on April 11. 
Our net debt-to-net capital ratio is healthy at 24% and our commercial paper and revolving credit facilities remain in place and unutilized. This underscores our financial strength and flexibility. In that regard, we remain committed to a balanced capital deployment strategy, which is to profitably grow the business through organic investments and M&A while enhancing shareholder returns through dividends and opportunistic share repurchases. 
During the first quarter, we invested $37 million for capital expenditures, much of this for growth projects. We acquired Tideland for $70 million and we returned $28 million to our shareholders through dividends. The first quarter included a 10% increase in dividends per share, marking the fifth consecutive year that we've increased our dividend. 
Historically, our first quarter free cash flow generation is seasonally low and impacted by the timing of annual incentive payments as well as lower sales leverage. Free cash flow was $4 million in the quarter, representing a modest improvement from the prior year. Year-over-year, free cash flow benefited from a $23 million reduction in working capital, largely offset by the timing of additional interest and tax payments in the quarter. We continue to expect to deliver at least 100% cash conversion this year. 
It's worth highlighting that we improved working capital as a percentage of revenue by 130 basis points in the quarter, excluding the impact of acquisitions. The improvement was driven by better inventory management and receivables collections. 
Please move to Slide 8, and I'll turn the call back over to Patrick to cover our 2016 guidance. Patrick?"

First, the growth rates I refer to on this slide all exclude the anticipated negative foreign exchange impact that we discussed in our last earnings call. Second and more importantly, as I said in my opening remarks, there is no change in the outlook for the performance of our core business. We continue to expect to generate faster-than-market growth, delivering organic revenue growth of 2% to 4%. While I'll cover specific details by end market on the next slide, let me highlight that we continue to expect stable conditions across roughly 90% of our portfolio, including growth across all key geographies. Additionally, we expect acquisitions will provide an additional 1% of revenue growth. 
Our adjusted operating margin is still expected to grow in the range of 50 to 80 basis points overall, with roughly 20 basis points of margin dilution from the acquisitions of HYPACK and Tideland. Excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions, our operating margin is expected to expand by 70 to 100 basis points. This expansion will be realized after the impact of investments we are making to accelerate profitable growth. As I mentioned earlier, we continue to drive our continuous improvement work deeper into the organization with very good results. We expect our lean and global procurement initiatives to generate full year gross savings of $120 million, an increase of roughly 20% year-over-year. 
We're raising our earnings per share guidance to $1.98 to $2.08 to reflect the interest savings from our debt refinancing. This range excludes restructuring and realignment cost of about $25 million, but this projection does include $0.04 of negative foreign currency translation impact. Excluding this impact, EPS growth is now expected to be in the range of 9% to 15%. We will continue to execute a disciplined approach to capital deployment, which is expected to result in free cash flow conversion greater than 100% after investing $120 million to $130 million in CapEx. Finally, we currently anticipate returning a minimum of $150 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
Now please turn to Slide 9. Let me summarize our updated full year performance by end market and highlight a few changes since our previous outlook in February. Beginning with industrial, which represents 44% of total revenue, we continue to expect this market to be flat to up low single digits. Our projection assumes that low single-digit growth in general industrial will be partially offset by headwinds in the mining and oil and gas sectors. While first quarter performance in mining, which represents approximately 5% of total revenue, was generally in line with our expectations, we continue to closely monitor market trends. Oil and gas, which now represents less than 3% of total revenue, is forecasted to decline through the first half of this year before we lap last year's second half of nearly 40% declines. 
Public utility, which represents 33% of our total revenue, is now anticipated to grow at a mid- to high single-digit rate. Here, we've raised our outlook following a strong first quarter start and with the expectation of continued momentum in the U.S. We also see encouraging signs for improved European market conditions, including strong contributions from the AMP6 cycle in the U.K. And in the emerging markets, we expect to see continued project growth. 
For the commercial end market, no change to our expectation of mid-single-digit range growth. We see solid contributions from both the U.S. and Europe and double-digit growth in the Middle East. The relatively warmer winter led to a slow start to the year for residential heating applications and tougher macro conditions in Australia. As a result, we now expect the residential market to be flat year-over-year. And finally, our smallest sector, agriculture, we anticipate will be up low single digits for the year. 
Please turn to Slide 10, and Mark will provide some calendarization insight for the rest of the year."

For the second quarter of 2016, we expect total revenue of approximately $920 million, flat versus the prior year. This includes organic growth of approximately $20 million or 2%, revenue from our acquisitions of approximately $10 million and approximately $30 million of headwind from foreign exchange translation. We anticipate operating income to be up modestly year-over-year with operating margins up 40 to 60 basis points as volume leverage and cost reductions more than offset inflation, growth investments and unfavorable mix. 
Looking out to the second half of the year. We anticipate year-over-year organic growth of approximately 3% with acquisitions adding just over $30 million and FX headwind of nearly $45 million. Operating margins in the second half are expected to increase in the range of 80 to 130 basis points year-over-year. This improvement reflects volume leverage and the net incremental savings from restructuring and continuous improvement cost actions in excess of increased R&D and growth investments. Relative to the first half of the year, we also anticipate favorable mix, given that we'll lap oil and gas headwinds as we exit the second quarter. 
To wrap up, let me make a few points about the foreign exchange assumptions in our full year guidance. As Patrick mentioned earlier, we have not reflected any potential benefit from foreign exchange variability in our updated outlook. We do not see any significant benefit in the first quarter and it's too early to update any full year assumptions at this point in the year, given the volatility of currencies. Having said that, we have provided a table in the appendix that outlines the potential full year impact to those assumptions, which is $0.01 of EPS per quarter based on exchange rates late last week. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Patrick for closing comments. Patrick?"

So that would be the color I would give you is that we've been very much focused on being accretive. We've got good line of sight on where they are. We're rating and pacing them. And you'll continue to see us break those out as we go forward. I don't know, Mark, if you want to add any color?"

I know that people can look at orders within Applied Water. That's not a big backlog business. And so it really is heavily skewed towards book and ship business. And so again, we feel positive. Again, we're keeping our expectations in check here. We're in the early stages of a public utility recovery. And hopefully, we're seeing things stabilize in the emerging markets.

So in that 44% of overall industrial revenue for us, 8% of that is tied to oil and gas and mining. So the other, let's call it, 36% of our total revenue, we really refer to that as more light industrial. And that's been up 3% and are expecting that to continue. It is heavily tied to GDP in the U.S. It's overweighted to the U.S. It is a broad swath of exposure, ranging from food and beverage to pharma, to chemicals, to marine, to a wide variety -- car washes. It's a wide variety of areas. The nice thing about that business is that it's historically been very, very steady. We're not tied to capital spend. We're not tied to industrial output. As long as people's operations are up and running, they're going to burn through these small pumps that we sell them. And so it's a good, steady business. The tweaks that we typically see there is when there can be adjustments in inventory or stock. We saw a little bit of that last year. But again, expect that business to be pretty stable here in that low single-digit range for 2016. On the industrial treatment business, only about 25% of our treatment business today is sold into industrial. We're heavily weighted towards muni and wastewater, and that is a business that tends to be lower margin for us. Hence, the discussion around shifting even more of our weight towards the industrial sector, where it's higher technology, more regulations, deeper pockets, people willing to spend based on life cycle costs. And so it is an area of focus for us both as it relates to our own internal R&D efforts and the pipeline there. Again, those are -- tend to be slower to come to fruition. But we're working on those right now as we speak. And as we mentioned before, it is an area of focus for us in terms of M&A down the path."

And as we mentioned in the prepared comments, Applied Water will more than recover that and expand margins for the full year. So it really is the timing of the investment that hit in the quarter.

Thanks for joining us to review our second quarter performance. Overall I'm pleased with the results we delivered in the first half of the year.

Overall I'm pleased with the results we delivered in the first half of the year. Our ongoing focus on enhancing our commercial leadership is continuing to yield faster market growth as well as share gains in key regions. Our teams continue to capitalize on a very strong public utility market, which is not showing any signs of slowing down. This is helping to offset weakness in certain areas of the industrial sector, namely oil and gas and mining. We're also making significant progress on our continuous improvement and business simplification initiatives, which is driving margin expansion and earnings growth. We have been and will remain keenly focused on the factors we can control, namely: Enhancing our customer-centric selling approach; leveraging our broad portfolio of solutions and channel partners; improving our working capital efficiency; and optimizing key aspects of our operations. This strategy is enabling us to capture more than our fair share of growth in certain key verticals and optimize our performance in those markets where conditions are mixed. All of these efforts have positioned us well to deliver on our full year commitments and we believe we are on track to meet our longer-term objectives as well. 
We expect many of the macro trends, including the mixed market conditions that existed in the first half of 2016, to continue through the end of the year. This includes some volatility in the timing of major project awards, which slipped out in the second quarter, even as the underlying market conditions in public utility remained strong. This is not an unusual circumstance. And importantly, we continue to cultivate a growing bidding pipeline. 
Having closed out the first half of 2016 with 3% organic growth, we are confident in our ability to deliver a similar result in the second half of the year. So we are narrowing our full year revenue growth guidance to reflect both our first half results and the timing of orders. As a result, we are tightening our projection of 2% to 4% organic growth to between 2% to 3%. We are pleased that our margin expansion and expect that progress to continue even as we invest for future growth. For the full year, we're increasing the upper end of our operating margin target. We now expect to deliver a full year operating margin in the range of 13.4% to 13.8%. Finally, we're narrowing the range of our full year EPS guidance while maintaining the midpoint. We now expect to deliver adjusted EPS of $2 to $2.06. I'll come back to the details behind this change in a few minutes. 
Please turn to Slide 5. Our top line organic growth in the quarter was 2% and consistent with our expectations. This excludes 1 point of growth from acquisitions. The strong growth in public utilities helped to mitigate the softness in the industrial and residential end markets. Looking at our end markets, growth in public utility remains robust. Globally, we grew 15% in this sector in the second quarter with contributions across all major regions, and the U.S. delivering a 22% increase for the second consecutive quarter. And as I just mentioned, our teams continue to report strong bidding pipelines and steady demand. 
Our industrial business continues to be negatively impacted by the weak oil and gas sector as well as mining, though it's worth noting that we are now seeing sequential improvement. And the commercial end market, which was up 2% in the quarter was a mixed bag. Our business in Europe is strong, driven by new products introduced over the past couple of years as well as the investments we've made in strengthening our sales channels there. 
The U.S. commercial building market is stabilizing, but after 7 consecutive quarters of growth we were down in the second quarter. Regionally, Western Europe led the way, delivering 7% growth in the second quarter. The U.S. market was flat despite the strong performance in public utilities. And looking at our emerging market regions, the results were mixed, though Overall we delivered 1% growth in the quarter. China continues to be soft, down 11% year-over-year as we had expected. We saw sequential improvement there and investment in infrastructure remained steady. In addition, we continue to capitalize on other growth opportunities across the Asia region. 
Our Middle East business is solid and growing, up 10% in the quarter. Finally, India continues to thrive as we continue to deliver on a major infrastructure project. Our team also shipped its first custom pump export order from India to Germany, an important milestone for this business. We had a very robust pipeline in India and anticipate some significant project wins that we hope to communicate in the coming weeks and months. 
Coming back to Europe for a moment, I did want to make a few comments about Brexit. Like most companies, we are assessing both near and long-term impacts from this decision, but it's very early in the process. To provide some perspective, the U.K. represents approximately 6% of Xylem's total revenue, with about 70% of that in our Water Infrastructure segment. This customer base is predominantly water utilities, which are inherently more resilient to economic volatility because of the country's 5-year Water Infrastructure investment plan known as the AMP6. Right now, the U.K. is in its sixth 5-year AMP cycle and we do not anticipate any significant changes. Our Applied Water applications, which generate about 30% of our revenues in the country are tied to more economically sensitive markets, including residential, commercial and industrial and therefore are more vulnerable to economic headwinds. Overall, we aren't drawing any definitive conclusions at this point, but we do not foresee the Brexit decision resulting in a significant impact in the immediate term in the markets we serve in the U.K. or more broadly across Europe. 
Back to our results. Organic order bookings in the quarter were weaker than expected. This primarily reflects project timing fluctuations and a tough year-over-year comparison. In robust environments such as the U.S., we have experienced some delays between the time we received commitments and when we received the actual order. This is due to E&C firms juggling a growing portfolio of a larger, more complex projects, which can cause some delays in the process. This is not an unprecedented dynamic as we've seen from previous periods of significant market recovery and this is a high-quality problem. 
Despite this variability driven by timing, we continue to cultivate a growing project pipeline. As I already mentioned, we're seeing consistently strong design and bidding activity in the U.S. Water Utilities sector. 
Our treatment business, which we consider to be a bellwether for the long-term health of the water utility business has a steadily expanding project funnel. In the second quarter, we saw year-over-year growth of approximately 15% with quarterly sequential improvement as well. This growth was driven primarily by increased bidding activity in China and India. There are also signs of potential growth acceleration in parts of Europe and a growing project pipeline in our emerging markets regions. 
I am particularly pleased with the progress our teams have made in the first half of the year on driving productivity. Our initiatives around continuous improvement and business simplification have already and will continue to create significant value for Xylem. In the quarter, operating margin expanded 100 basis points to 13%, with volume leverage and favorable mix driving 70 basis points of improvement. Price was neutral overall for the quarter. Collectively, global procurement, Lean and 6 Sigma activities and restructuring savings reduced our cost by $30 million in the quarter, resulting in a 320 basis points of margin improvement. Partially offsetting these savings were cost inflation of 170 basis points and the funding of our strategic growth initiative of 90 basis points. 
Our growth initiatives included increased new product R&D spend, investment in our selling and continuous improvement capabilities and localization of assembly and production in attractive, faster growth regions. 
A couple of points  on our continuous improvement efforts. In addition to the dollars saved on our Lean and 6 Sigma initiatives, we are changing processes and eliminating barriers to productivity. In the first half of the year, we completed 80 events that are generating measurable improvements. While some focus on internal processes, others target improvements in how we engage with our customers. These initiatives are creating sustainable change that will continue to pay dividends down the road. 
Our global procurement group has really hit its stride and is well on its way to meeting our full year goals. The result will be another year of record savings from procurement. We've launched our new e-sourcing tool, which resulted in more than 15% average savings in the first  2 online options. In addition to going after direct spend opportunities, we are increasingly looking at our indirect spin categories as well. As I've said before, this productivity for growth mindset is enabling us to fund important initiatives for our medium and long-term growth while continuing to expand our operating margins. 
One other point. We are seeing positive benefits from the restructuring actions we've already taken this year. 
Shifting back to our results. At the bottom line, we generated adjusted earnings per share of $0.48 in the quarter, an increase of 12% year-over-year. We continue to generate solid cash flow. The year-over-year decline in the quarter reflect increased investments in growth initiatives, but we are well on our way to a second consecutive year of free cash flow conversion north of 100% of net income. Our sharp focus on improving capital performance continued. In the quarter, we generated 100 basis points year-over-year improvement, excluding the impact of foreign exchange translation and acquisitions. 
Now I'll turn it over to Mark for more details in the quarter and then I'll come back to our outlook for the year."

Please turn to Slide 6 and I'll provide additional details on our reporting segments. Water Infrastructure recorded orders of $562 million, down 4% organically. As Patrick mentioned earlier, we had a challenging year-over-year comparison",809,"Thanks, Patrick. Please turn to Slide 6 and I'll provide additional details on our reporting segments. Water Infrastructure recorded orders of $562 million, down 4% organically. As Patrick mentioned earlier, we had a challenging year-over-year comparison to last year's second quarter when we had 2 major projects that totaled $18 million. Excluding the impact of those projects, our orders would have been roughly flat year-over-year. We exited the quarter with total backlog of $546 million. 
Given the strength of the project pipeline that our teams are working and our solid win rate, we believe this year-over-year decline is due primarily to project timing. Worth noting is that in addition to a growing project pipeline, we did see a modest increase in our weekly order rates in June. Revenue of $566 million represents a 3% increase year-over-year on an organic basis. Acquisitions added an additional $11 million to the top line while foreign exchange was an $11 million headwind. We generated 15% growth in the global public utility market with double-digit gains across most of our businesses. 
In the U.S., our public utility business matched its strong Q1 performance with 22% growth in the second quarter. Our teams are executing very well, driving share gains in healthy water and wastewater market. 
Western Europe grew 4% driven by broad public utility growth over most of the region, including solid increases in the U.K. due to the AMP6 cycle. There was also strength in the Nordics, France and Germany partially offset by decline in Southern Europe. 
Emerging market results were favorable, up 4% despite mixed market conditions. Our overall growth was driven by large custom projects in India and Laos coupled with strength in treatment from infrastructure investments in the Middle East. 
Finally, expected weakness in oil and gas and mining markets coupled with a softer-than-expected industrial CapEx environment drove mid-single-digit declines in our industrial vertical. 
Operating margin increased 150 basis points to 14% as volume leverage, cost reductions and modest price realization more than offset cost inflation and increased strategic growth investments. 
Please turn to Slide 7. Applied Water recorded orders of $361 million, up 1% organically over the prior period and enter the quarter with total backlog of $180 [ph] million. In this segment, we saw a modest improvement in our weekly order rates over the course of this past quarter. Revenue was $366 million, flat organically versus the prior year. 
In Western Europe, revenue increased 14% as industrial water in commercial building applications both delivered double-digit growth in the quarter. Here, we continue to see benefits from energy-efficient product launches and our investment in building a regional sales capabilities. 
In the U.S., residential was down 5%, primarily reflecting softer market conditions, including lower demand for well pumps in the West, which benefited last year from severe drought conditions. This segment's U.S. industrial revenue declined 4%, reflecting softer general industrial, marine and food and beverage demand. The most significant portion of this decline was attributable to weakness in regions more directly tied to the oil and gas market. 
Segment revenue was down 5% in our emerging markets, primarily due to the as expected 11% decline in China driven by softer demand in the commercial and industrial end markets. On a sequential basis, our performance in China continues to improve. Segment operating margin increased 40 basis points to 14.8% year-over-year. 
Cost reductions drove a 380 basis point improvement, more than offsetting 160 basis points of cost inflation, 110 basis points from strategic growth investments as well as unfavorable mix. The year-over-year increased investments relate to the funding -- the localization of product assembly in the Middle East and higher investments in new product development. 
Now let's turn to Slide 8 to cover the company's cash flow and financial position. We closed the quarter with a cash balance of $586 million. Our net debt to net capital ratio is healthy at 23% and our revolving credit facility remains in place and unutilized. This underscores our financial strength and capacity for capital deployment. In that regard, we continue to pursue and execute on opportunities to profitably grow the business through organic investments in M&A while also enhancing shareholder returns through dividends and opportunistic share repurchases. 
During the second quarter, we invested $25 million for capital expenditures and we returned $28 million to our shareholders through dividends. Free cash flow was $59 million, a modest decline from the prior year reflecting increased year-over-year spending on growth CapEx. We continue to expect to deliver at least 100% cash conversion this year. 
It's worth highlighting that we improved working capital as a percentage of revenue by 100 basis points in the quarter, excluding the impact of acquisitions I nforeign exchange. The improvement was driven by better inventory management and receivables collections. 
Please turn to Slide 9 and Patrick will cover the update to our 2016 outlook."
118218449,321421453,1021159,"Xylem Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2016",2016-08-02,"Earnings Calls","Xylem Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mark. We continue to expect to generate revenues of approximately $3.7 billion for the full year, including 1% growth from acquisitions and foreign exchange headwind of approximately 2%. As I mentioned earlier, we are narrowing our organic growth",603,"Thanks, Mark. We continue to expect to generate revenues of approximately $3.7 billion for the full year, including 1% growth from acquisitions and foreign exchange headwind of approximately 2%. As I mentioned earlier, we are narrowing our organic growth expectations. We now anticipate full year organic growth in the range of 2% to 3%. Again, this reflects timing variability as project awards have shifted from the first half to the second in a very strong public utility market. 
Following the strong execution and productivity delivered by our team in the first half of the year, we are increasing the upper end of our operating margin guidance 10 basis points. We now expect our full year operating margin to be in the range of 13.4% to 13.8% for the year. As I reviewed earlier, we have narrowed our EPS guidance range to $2 to $2.06 to reflect a couple of items. First, we are reducing our foreign exchange translation headwind impact by $0.02, about $0.01 from the first half and another cent in the second half; and second, this narrowing also reflects the adjustment to the top end of our revenue growth and margin expansion guidance ranges. There is no change to our free cash flow conversion guidance. 
please turn to Slide 10 and I'll walk you through the update of our end market assumptions for 2016. Beginning with public utility, at 33% of total revenue. Through the first half, we generated organic revenue growth of 13%, but expect our second half organic performance to moderate. This expectation reflects continued strong market conditions, but we do face tougher year-over-year comps. Some of you may recall that we delivered double-digit growth in the U.S. in the second half of last year. With that said, we expect second half 2016 revenue to be up mid-single digits. And as a result, our full year expectation is in the high single-digit range. This outlook is improved relative to our previous expectations and reflects the positive performance realized today and momentum heading into the back half. Our industrial end market, which represents 44% of total revenues and includes a wide range of industries, from general light industrials to the heavier sectors. Full year organic revenue growth is now expected to be flat, which is slightly lower than we previously anticipated. Here, we see double-digit declines in the oil and gas and mining sectors, offsetting modest growth in general and light industrial applications. 
While industrial overall was down 3% in the first half, we do expect our performance to improve over the balance of the year, primarily reflecting easier second half comps as we lap more significant prior headwinds in the oil and gas market. 
Moving to commercial. We are maintaining our full year mid-single-digit growth outlook. This reflects first half organic revenue growth of 3% and modest improvement in the back half. That improvement is supported by solid underlying market conditions in the U.S. and continued growth in Europe driven by strong market demand. In addition, we expect weak conditions in China to begin to stabilize and then improve in the latter part of the year. 
In our smallest 2 end markets, residential and agriculture, we project full year revenue to be down mid-single digits. Both of these sectors have experienced challenging market conditions in the first half of the year due in part to lower demand for well pumps as drought conditions moderated in the Western U.S. We expect those to continue in the second half. 
Now please turn to Slide 11 and Mark will walk you through more of the details in the second half outlook. Mark?"

I'd like to spend a minute calibrating everyone around what we expect our revenue and operating income profile to be over the balance of 2016. 
First, shippable backlog. Of the total $725 million in backlog, $525 million is shippable in the second half of this year and the remaining $200 million is expected to ship in 2017. Third quarter shippable backlog is approximately $365 million, which is down 2% organically versus the prior year. This represents approximately 40% of our expected third quarter sales. 
While we still have a lot of book and ship business to secure and deliver in the quarter, we believe that we have solid momentum in the public utility sector as well as stable outlooks across most of our key regions. In addition, our teams have stepped up their execution in our delivery more quickly to our customers. Organically, we anticipate second half revenue to increase in the range of 2% to 3%. We see the second half revenue profile similar to past years, down 3% sequentially in the third quarter before ramping up in the fourth quarter. This reflects the impact of seasonality in Europe in July and August. We expect operating income performance in the second half to improve sequentially. This will be driven by volume, improved mix and a continued ramp-up of savings from our productivity initiatives. In the third quarter, we anticipate margin expansion of approximately 50 to 100 basis points year-over-year. 
Finally, we expect full year corporate expense of approximately $50 [ph] million. With that, please turn to Slide 12 and I'll hand the call back over to Patrick for some closing comments. Patrick?"

And I've seen this in the past both in this market as well as even the energy sectors when projects begin to heat up, which is not the case right now in that sector. But what you see is you've got constraints on a number of the ENC firms, the construction firms, tight labor markets. Obviously some level of wage inflation there, we did this projects, they put in there their budgetary quotes. The quote sometimes come in higher than what the municipalities were thinking at that point in time. They push it back. They redo it again. And although we've already been committed the project in the order from a customer into the contractor, they can't effect the place the order on us until they actually have that on hand. It's typically in my experience takes a couple of quarters for this to work through the system. It's hard to predict. But again, it is not unprecedented. And as I said it is high-quality problem to have. And those rebids don't have an impact on our pricing or our margin structure. Really it's a matter of timing of when the projects actually flows through. When I talk about the size of the pipeline, the total pipeline that we're talking about really are treatment projects, and those are the leading indicators for us. And that total pipeline is about $2.6 billion. And that pipeline is up 15% from a year ago. And so it does give us pretty good visibility into what '17 could look like, again, setting aside any ongoing shift out of the timing of some of these projects. But overall, it's actually a very encouraging sign to see this level of healthy bidding and tension in this system being."

And then mining, we're calling to be down a further 10% in the second half of the year. Again, in the case of mining, it's not tied to output.

It wouldn't obviously have meaningful impact in the market until sometime next year. So right now for us, it's a wait-and-see approach. On the idea of a PIII partnerships, we do see a growing level of discussion and interest in that concept.

Thanks for joining us to review our second quarter performance. Overall, I'm pleased with the results we delivered in the first half of the year.

Overall, I'm pleased with the results we delivered in the first half of the year. Our ongoing focus on enhancing our commercial leadership is continuing to yield faster than market growth as well as share gains in key regions.
Our teams continue to capitalize on a very strong public utility market, which is not showing any signs of slowing down. This is helping to offset weakness in certain areas of the industrial sector, namely oil and gas and mining. We're also making significant progress on our continuous improvement and business simplification initiatives, which is driving margin expansion and earnings growth.
We have been and will remain keenly focused on the factors we can control, namely: enhancing our customer-centric selling approach, leveraging our broad portfolio of solutions and channel partners, improving our working capital efficiency and optimizing key aspects of our operations. This strategy is enabling us to capture more than our fair share of growth in certain key verticals and optimize our performance in those markets where conditions are mixed. All of these efforts have positioned us well to deliver on our full year commitments, and we believe we are on track to meet our longer-term objectives as well.
We expect many of the macro trends, including the mixed market conditions that existed in the first half of 2016, to continue through the end of the year. This includes some volatility in the timing of major project awards, which slipped out of the second quarter, even as the underlying market conditions in public utility remain strong. This is not an unusual circumstance. And importantly, we continue to cultivate a growing bidding pipeline.
Having closed out the first half of 2016 with 3% organic growth, we are confident in our ability to deliver a similar result in the second half of the year. So we are narrowing our full year revenue growth guidance to reflect both our first half results and the timing of orders. As a result, we are tightening our projection of 2% to 4% organic growth to between 2% to 3%.
We are pleased that our margin expansion and expect that progress to continue even as we invest for future growth. For the full year, we're increasing the upper end of our operating margin target. We now expect to deliver a full year operating margin in the range of 13.4% to 13.8%. Finally, we're narrowing the range of our full year EPS guidance while maintaining the midpoint. We now expect to deliver adjusted EPS of $2 to $2.06. I'll come back to the details behind this change in a few minutes.
Please turn to Slide 5. Our top line organic growth in the quarter was 2% and consistent with our expectations. This excludes 1 point of growth from acquisitions. The strong growth in public utility helped to mitigate the softness in the industrial and residential end markets.
Looking at our end markets, growth in public utility remains robust. Globally, we grew 15% in this sector in the second quarter with contributions across all major regions, and the U.S. delivering a 22% increase for the second consecutive quarter. And as I just mentioned, our teams continue to report strong bidding pipelines and steady demand.
Our industrial business continues to be negatively impacted by the weak oil and gas sector as well as mining, though it's worth noting that we are now seeing sequential improvement. And the commercial end market, which was up 2% in the quarter, was a mixed bag. Our business in Europe is strong, driven by new products introduced over the past couple of years as well as the investments we've made in strengthening our sales channels there.
The U.S. commercial building market is stabilizing. But after 7 consecutive quarters of growth, we were down in the second quarter. Regionally, Western Europe led the way, delivering 7% growth in the second quarter. The U.S. market was flat despite the strong performance in public utility. And looking at our emerging market regions, the results were mixed, though overall, we delivered 1% growth in the quarter. China continued to be soft, down 11% year-over-year as we had expected. We saw sequential improvement there and investment in infrastructure remains steady. In addition, we continue to capitalize on other growth opportunities across the Asia region.
Our Middle East business is solid and growing, up 10% in the quarter. Finally, India continues to thrive as we continue to deliver on a major infrastructure project. Our team also shipped its first custom pump export order from India to Germany, an important milestone for this business. We had a very robust pipeline in India and anticipate some significant project wins that we hope to communicate in the coming weeks and months.
Coming back to Europe for a moment. I did want to make a few comments about Brexit. Like most companies, we are assessing both near and long-term impacts from this decision, but it's very early in the process. To provide some perspective, the U.K. represents approximately 6% of Xylem's total revenue, with about 70% of that in our Water Infrastructure segment. This customer base is predominantly water utilities, which are inherently more resilient to economic volatility because of the country's 5-year water infrastructure investment plan known as the AMP cycle. Right now, the U.K. is in its sixth 5-year AMP cycle, and we do not anticipate any significant changes.
Our Applied Water applications, which generate about 30% of our revenues in the country, are tied to more economically sensitive markets, including residential, commercial and industrial and therefore, are more vulnerable to economic headwinds. Overall, we aren't drawing any definitive conclusions at this point, but we do not foresee the Brexit decision resulting in a significant impact in the immediate term on the markets we serve in the U.K. or more broadly, across Europe.
Back to our results. Organic order bookings in the quarter were weaker than expected. This primarily reflects project timing fluctuations and a tough year-over-year comparison. In robust environments such as the U.S., we have experienced some delays between the time we received commitments and when we received the actual order. This is due to E&C firms juggling a growing portfolio of a larger, more complex projects, which can cause some delays in the process. This is not an unprecedented dynamic as we've seen from previous periods of significant market recovery, and this is a high-quality problem.
Despite this variability driven by timing, we continue to cultivate a growing project pipeline. As I already mentioned, we're seeing consistently strong design and bidding activity in the U.S. Water Utilities sector.
Our treatment business, which we consider to be a bellwether for the long-term health of the Water Utility business, has a steadily expanding project funnel. In the second quarter, we saw year-over-year growth of approximately 15% with quarterly sequential improvement as well. This growth was driven primarily by increased bidding activity in China and India. There are also signs of potential growth acceleration in parts of Europe and a growing project pipeline in our emerging market regions.
I am particularly pleased with the progress our teams have made in the first half of the year on driving productivity. Our initiatives around continuous improvement and business simplification have already and will continue to create significant value for Xylem. In the quarter, operating margin expanded 100 basis points to 13%, with volume leverage and favorable mix driving 70 basis points of improvement.
Price was neutral overall for the quarter. Collectively, global procurement, Lean and Six Sigma activities and restructuring savings reduced our cost by $30 million in the quarter, resulting in 320 basis points of margin improvement. Partially offsetting these savings were cost inflation of 170 basis points and the funding of our strategic growth initiatives of 90 basis points.
Our growth initiatives included increased new product R&D spend, investment in our selling and continuous improvement capabilities and localization of assembly and production in attractive, faster growth regions.
A couple of points on our continuous improvement efforts. In addition to the dollars saved through our Lean and Six Sigma initiatives, we are changing processes and eliminating barriers to productivity. In the first half of the year, we completed 80 kinds of events that are generating measurable improvements. While some focus on internal processes, others target improvements in how we engage with our customers. These initiatives are creating sustainable change that will continue to pay dividends down the road.
Our global procurement group has really hit its stride and is well on its way to meeting our full year goals. The result will be another year of record savings from procurement. We've launched our new e-sourcing tool, which resulted in more than 15% average savings in the first 2 online auctions. In addition to going after direct spend opportunities, we are increasingly looking at our indirect spend categories as well. As I've said before, this productivity for growth mindset is enabling us to fund important initiatives for our medium and long-term growth while continuing to expand our operating margins. One other point. We are seeing positive benefits from the restructuring actions we've already taken this year.
Shifting back to our results. At the bottom line, we generated adjusted earnings per share of $0.48 in the quarter, an increase of 12% year-over-year. We continue to generate solid cash flow. The year-over-year decline in the quarter reflect increased investments in growth initiatives, but we are well on our way to a second consecutive year of free cash flow conversion north of 100% of net income.
Our sharp focus on improving capital performance continued. In the quarter, we generated 100 basis points year-over-year improvement, excluding the impact of foreign exchange translation and acquisitions.
Now I'll turn it over to Mark for more details in the quarter, and then I'll come back to our outlook for the year."

Please turn to Slide 6, and I'll provide additional details on our reporting segments. Water Infrastructure recorded orders of $562 million, down 4% organically. As Patrick mentioned earlier, we had a challenging year-over-year comparison",809,"Thanks, Patrick. Please turn to Slide 6, and I'll provide additional details on our reporting segments. Water Infrastructure recorded orders of $562 million, down 4% organically. As Patrick mentioned earlier, we had a challenging year-over-year comparison to last year's second quarter when we had 2 major projects that totaled $18 million. Excluding the impact of those projects, our orders would have been roughly flat year-over-year. We exited the quarter with total backlog of $546 million.
Given the strength of the project pipeline that our teams are working and our solid win rate, we believe this year-over-year decline is due primarily to project timing. Worth noting is that in addition to a growing project pipeline, we did see a modest increase in our weekly order rates in June.
Revenue of $566 million represents a 3% increase year-over-year on an organic basis. Acquisitions added an additional $11 million to the top line, while foreign exchange was an $11 million headwind. We generated 15% growth in the global public utility market with double-digit gains across most of our businesses.
In the U.S., our public utility business matched its strong Q1 performance with 22% growth in the second quarter. Our teams are executing very well, driving share gains in the healthy water and wastewater market.
Western Europe grew 4%, driven by broad public utility growth over most of the region, including solid increases in the U.K. due to the AMP6 cycle. There was also strength in the Nordics, France and Germany, partially offset by decline in Southern Europe.
Emerging market results were favorable, up 4% despite mixed market conditions. Our overall growth was driven by large custom projects in India and Laos, coupled with strength in treatment from infrastructure investments in the Middle East.
Finally, expected weakness in oil and gas and mining markets, coupled with a softer-than-expected industrial CapEx environment, drove mid-single-digit declines in our industrial vertical.
Operating margin increased 150 basis points to 14% as volume leverage, cost reductions and modest price realization more than offset cost inflation and increased strategic growth investments.
Please turn to Slide 7. Applied Water recorded orders of $361 million, up 1% organically over the prior period and entered the third quarter with total backlog of $180 million. In this segment, we saw a modest improvement in our weekly order rates over the course of this past quarter. Revenue was $366 million, flat organically versus the prior year.
In Western Europe, revenue increased 14% as industrial water and commercial building applications both delivered double-digit growth in the quarter. Here, we continue to see benefits from energy-efficient product launches and our investment in building our regional sales capabilities.
In the U.S., residential was down 5%, primarily reflecting softer market conditions, including lower demand for well pumps in the West, which benefited last year from severe drought conditions. This segment's U.S. industrial revenue declined 4%, reflecting softer general industrial, marine and food and beverage demand. The most significant portion of this decline was attributable to weakness in regions more directly tied to the oil and gas market.
Segment revenue was down 5% in our emerging markets, primarily due to the as-expected 11% decline in China, driven by softer demand in the commercial and industrial end markets. On a sequential basis, our performance in China continues to improve. Segment operating margin increased 40 basis points to 14.8% year-over-year.
Cost reductions drove a 380 basis point improvement, more than offsetting 160 basis points of cost inflation, 110 basis points from strategic growth investments as well as unfavorable mix. The year-over-year increased investments relate to the funding -- the localization of product assembly in the Middle East and higher investments in new product development.
Now let's turn to Slide 8 to cover the company's cash flow and financial position. We closed the quarter with a cash balance of $586 million. Our net debt to net capital ratio is healthy at 23%, and our revolving credit facility remains in place and unutilized. This underscores our financial strength and capacity for capital deployment. In that regard, we continue to pursue and execute on opportunities to profitably grow the business through organic investments in M&A while also enhancing shareholder returns through dividends and opportunistic share repurchases.
During the second quarter, we invested $25 million for capital expenditures, and we returned $28 million to our shareholders through dividends. Free cash flow was $59 million, a modest decline from the prior year, reflecting increased year-over-year spending on growth CapEx. We continue to expect to deliver at least 100% cash conversion this year.
It's worth highlighting that we improved working capital as a percentage of revenue by 100 basis points in the quarter, excluding the impact of acquisitions in foreign exchange. The improvement was driven by better inventory management and receivable collections.
Please turn to Slide 9, and Patrick will cover the update to our 2016 outlook."
118218449,321421453,1021453,"Xylem Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2016",2016-08-02,"Earnings Calls","Xylem Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mark. We continue to expect to generate revenues of approximately $3.7 billion for the full year, including 1% growth from acquisitions and foreign exchange headwind of approximately 2%. As I mentioned earlier, we are narrowing our organic growth",606,"Thanks, Mark. We continue to expect to generate revenues of approximately $3.7 billion for the full year, including 1% growth from acquisitions and foreign exchange headwind of approximately 2%. As I mentioned earlier, we are narrowing our organic growth expectations. We now anticipate full year organic growth in the range of 2% to 3%. Again, this reflects timing variability as project awards have shifted from the first half to the second in a very strong public utility market.
Following the strong execution and productivity delivered by our team in the first half of the year, we are increasing the upper end of our operating margin guidance 10 basis points. We now expect our full year operating margin to be in the range of 13.4% to 13.8% for the year. As I reviewed earlier, we have narrowed our EPS guidance range to $2 to $2.06 to reflect a couple of items. First, we are reducing our foreign exchange translation headwind impact by $0.02, about $0.01 from the first half and another $0.01 in the second half; and second, this narrowing also reflects the adjustment to the top end of our revenue growth and margin expansion guidance ranges. There is no change to our free cash flow conversion guidance.
Please turn to Slide 10, and I'll walk you through the update to our end market assumptions for 2016, beginning with public utility at 33% of total revenue. Through the first half, we generated organic revenue growth of 13% but expect our second half organic performance to moderate. This expectation reflects continued strong market conditions, but we do face tougher year-over-year comps.
Some of you may recall that we delivered double-digit growth in the U.S. in the second half of last year. With that said, we expect second half 2016 revenue to be up mid-single digits. And as a result, our full year expectation is in the high single-digit range. This outlook is improved relative to our previous expectations and reflects the positive performance realized to date and momentum heading into the back half.
Our industrial end market, which represents 44% of total revenues and includes a wide range of industries, from general light industrials to the heavier sectors. Full year organic revenue growth is now expected to be flat, which is slightly lower than we previously anticipated. Here, we see double-digit declines in the oil and gas and mining sectors, offsetting modest growth in general and light industrial applications.
While industrial overall was down 3% in the first half, we do expect our performance to improve over the balance of the year, primarily reflecting easier second half comps as we lap more significant prior year headwinds in the oil and gas market.
Moving to commercial. We are maintaining our full year mid-single-digit growth outlook. This reflects first half organic revenue growth of 3% and modest improvement in the back half. That improvement is supported by solid underlying market conditions in the U.S. and continued growth in Europe, driven by new product demand. In addition, we expect the weak conditions in China to begin to stabilize and then improve in the latter part of the year.
In our smallest 2 end markets, residential and agriculture, we project full year revenue to be down mid-single digits. Both of these sectors have experienced challenging market conditions in the first half of the year due in part to lower demand for well pumps as drought conditions moderated in the Western U.S. We expect those to continue in the second half.
Now please turn to Slide 11, and Mark will walk you through more of the details on the second half outlook. Mark?"

I'd like to spend a minute calibrating everyone around what we expect our revenue and operating income profile to be over the balance of 2016.
First, shippable backlog. Of the total $725 million in backlog, $525 million is shippable in the second half of this year and the remaining $200 million is expected to ship in 2017. Third quarter shippable backlog is approximately $365 million, which is down 2% organically versus the prior year. This represents approximately 40% of our expected third quarter sales.
While we still have a lot of book and ship business to secure and deliver in the quarter, we believe that we have solid momentum in the public utility sector as well as stable outlooks across most of our key regions. In addition, our teams have stepped up their execution and are delivering more quickly to our customers. Organically, we anticipate second half revenue to increase in the range of 2% to 3%.
We see the second half revenue profile similar to past years, down 3% sequentially in the third quarter before ramping up in the fourth quarter. This reflects the impact of seasonality in Europe in July and August. We expect operating income performance in the second half to improve sequentially. This will be driven by volume, improved mix and a continued ramp-up of savings from our productivity initiatives.
In the third quarter, we anticipate margin expansion of approximately 50 to 100 basis points year-over-year. Finally, we expect full year corporate expense of approximately $50 million.

Finally, we remain committed to driving a disciplined capital deployment strategy and continue to improve our working capital performance, both important contributors to our growth.

And I've seen this in the past, both in this market as well as even the energy sectors when projects begin to heat up, which is obviously not the case right now in that sector. But what you see [ph] is you've got constraints on a number of the E&C firms, the construction firms, tight labor market, obviously some level of wage inflation there, they did these projects, they put in there their budgetary quotes. The quote sometimes come in higher than what the municipalities were actually thinking at that point in time. They push it back. They rebid again. And although we've already been committed, the project and the order from a customer into the contractor, they can't effectively [ph] place the order on us until they actually have that in hand. It typically, from my experience, takes a couple of quarters for this to work through the system. It's hard to predict. But again, it's not unprecedented. And as I said, it is a high-quality problem to have. And those rebids on the quotes don't have an impact on our pricing or our margin structure. Really, it's just a matter of the timing of when the project actually flows through. When I take -- when I talk about the size of the pipeline, the total pipeline that we're talking about really are treatment projects, and those are the leading indicators for us. And that total pipeline is about $2.6 billion, and that pipeline is up 15% from a year ago. And so it does give us pretty good visibility into what '17 could look like, again, setting aside any ongoing shift out of the timing of some of these projects. But overall, it's actually a very encouraging sign to see this level of healthy bidding and tension in this system beam. [ph]"

But secondly, one of the benefits you have when you have a large share position like we do, especially on the submersible wastewater pump side of the market, by definition, as you see an increase in level of repair and maintenance and kind of break and fix business, the person with the larger share just benefit disproportionately there in terms of growth because of our install base that is being repaired and replaced.

So we obviously play in a highly fragmented industry, including some attractive adjacencies. As I mentioned at our Investor Day late last September, we continue to believe that M&A is going to be a significant accelerator of our growth over time as the right opportunities come forward. We do have a strong and attractive pipeline. And we're very focused on opportunities that are higher up the technology curve, really focused on key -- 4 key areas: smart water infrastructure, advanced treatment, industrial water services and then of course, opportunities to defend our core businesses where necessary. I'd say, naturally, we don't control the timing of the opportunities. It takes 2 to tango. And we strive to be disciplined in our evaluation and our pursuit of any potential deals, both from a financial and a strategic perspective. As you know, we did complete 2 small acquisitions fourth quarter of '15 and first quarter of this year. And as we sit here today, we feel we have a strong balance sheet to support transactions of larger size and scale."

I can't name the customer on it because we're not allowed to. That was a $12 million job. It was a global project shop worked on by, well, a lot of different contractors and vendors. That was also a pretty unique order that we got, that we delivered later in the year. And so those are really the drivers in the Water Infrastructure, muni side of things. We would have seen flat order growth last year in Q2 overall for Water Infrastructure, but these would've driven, if you would, 4%, 5% orders growth in the municipal side of the Water Infrastructure order book last year. That would have been offset by the beginning of headwinds that we started to see in the oil and gas business, predominantly in our dewatering business in Q2 of last year. So that was offset there."

Thanks for joining us to review our second quarter performance. Overall, I'm pleased with the results we delivered in the first half of the year.

Overall, I'm pleased with the results we delivered in the first half of the year. Our ongoing focus on enhancing our commercial leadership is continuing to yield faster than market growth as well as share gains in key regions.
Our teams continue to capitalize on a very strong public utility market, which is not showing any signs of slowing down. This is helping to offset weakness in certain areas of the industrial sector, namely oil and gas and mining. We're also making significant progress on our continuous improvement and business simplification initiatives, which is driving margin expansion and earnings growth.
We have been and will remain keenly focused on the factors we can control, namely: enhancing our customer-centric selling approach, leveraging our broad portfolio of solutions and channel partners, improving our working capital efficiency and optimizing key aspects of our operations. This strategy is enabling us to capture more than our fair share of growth in certain key verticals and optimize our performance in those markets where conditions are mixed. All of these efforts have positioned us well to deliver on our full year commitments, and we believe we are on track to meet our longer-term objectives as well.
We expect many of the macro trends, including the mixed market conditions that existed in the first half of 2016, to continue through the end of the year. This includes some volatility in the timing of major project awards, which slipped out of the second quarter, even as the underlying market conditions in public utility remain strong. This is not an unusual circumstance. And importantly, we continue to cultivate a growing bidding pipeline.
Having closed out the first half of 2016 with 3% organic growth, we are confident in our ability to deliver a similar result in the second half of the year. So we are narrowing our full year revenue growth guidance to reflect both our first half results and the timing of orders. As a result, we are tightening our projection of 2% to 4% organic growth to between 2% to 3%.
We are pleased with our margin expansion and expect that progress to continue even as we invest for future growth. For the full year, we're increasing the upper end of our operating margin target. We now expect to deliver a full year operating margin in the range of 13.4% to 13.8%. Finally, we're narrowing the range of our full year EPS guidance while maintaining the midpoint. We now expect to deliver adjusted EPS of $2 to $2.06. I'll come back to the details behind this change in a few minutes.
Please turn to Slide 5. Our top line organic growth in the quarter was 2% and consistent with our expectations. This excludes 1 point of growth from acquisitions. The strong growth in public utilities helped to mitigate the softness in the industrial and residential end markets.
Looking at our end markets, growth in public utility remains robust. Globally, we grew 15% in this sector in the second quarter with contributions across all major regions, and the U.S. delivering a 22% increase for the second consecutive quarter. And as I just mentioned, our teams continue to report strong bidding pipelines and steady demand.
Our industrial business continues to be negatively impacted by the weak oil and gas sector as well as mining, though it's worth noting that we are now seeing sequential improvement. And the commercial end market, which was up 2% in the quarter, was a mixed bag. Our business in Europe is strong, driven by new products introduced over the past couple of years as well as the investments we've made in strengthening our sales channels there.
The U.S. commercial building market is stabilizing. But after 7 consecutive quarters of growth, we were down in the second quarter. Regionally, Western Europe led the way, delivering 7% growth in the second quarter. The U.S. market was flat despite the strong performance in public utility. And looking at our emerging market regions, the results were mixed, though overall, we delivered 1% growth in the quarter. China continued to be soft, down 11% year-over-year as we had expected. We saw sequential improvement there and investment in infrastructure remains steady. In addition, we continue to capitalize on other growth opportunities across the Asia region.
Our Middle East business is solid and growing, up 10% in the quarter. Finally, India continues to thrive as we continue to deliver on a major infrastructure project. Our team also shipped its first custom pump export order from India to Germany, an important milestone for this business. We had a very robust pipeline in India and anticipate some significant project wins that we hope to communicate in the coming weeks and months.
Coming back to Europe for a moment. I did want to make a few comments about Brexit. Like most companies, we are assessing both near and long-term impacts from this decision, but it's very early in the process. To provide some perspective, the U.K. represents approximately 6% of Xylem's total revenue, with about 70% of that in our Water Infrastructure segment. This customer base is predominantly water utilities, which are inherently more resilient to economic volatility because of the country's 5-year water infrastructure investment plan known as the AMP cycle. Right now, the U.K. is in its sixth 5-year AMP cycle, and we do not anticipate any significant changes.
Our Applied Water applications, which generate about 30% of our revenues in the country, are tied to more economically sensitive markets, including residential, commercial and industrial and therefore, are more vulnerable to economic headwinds. Overall, we aren't drawing any definitive conclusions at this point, but we do not foresee the Brexit decision resulting in a significant impact in the immediate term on the markets we serve in the U.K. or more broadly, across Europe.
Back to our results. Organic order bookings in the quarter were weaker than expected. This primarily reflects project timing fluctuations and a tough year-over-year comparison. In robust environments such as the U.S., we have experienced some delays between the time we received commitments and when we received the actual order. This is due to E&C firms juggling a growing portfolio of a larger, more complex projects, which can cause some delays in the process. This is not an unprecedented dynamic as we've seen from previous periods of significant market recovery, and this is a high-quality problem.
Despite this variability driven by timing, we continue to cultivate a growing project pipeline. As I already mentioned, we're seeing consistently strong design and bidding activity in the U.S. Water Utilities sector.
Our treatment business, which we consider to be a bellwether for the long-term health of the Water Utility business, has a steadily expanding project funnel. In the second quarter, we saw year-over-year growth of approximately 15% with quarterly sequential improvement as well. This growth was driven primarily by increased bidding activity in China and India. There are also signs of potential growth acceleration in parts of Europe and a growing project pipeline in our emerging market regions.
I am particularly pleased with the progress our teams have made in the first half of the year on driving productivity. Our initiatives around continuous improvement and business simplification have already and will continue to create significant value for Xylem. In the quarter, operating margin expanded 100 basis points to 13%, with volume leverage and favorable mix driving 70 basis points of improvement.
Price was neutral overall for the quarter. Collectively, global procurement, Lean and Six Sigma activities and restructuring savings reduced our cost by $30 million in the quarter, resulting in 320 basis points of margin improvement. Partially offsetting these savings were cost inflation of 170 basis points and the funding of our strategic growth initiatives of 90 basis points.
Our growth initiatives included increased new product R&D spend, investment in our selling and continuous improvement capabilities and localization of assembly and production in attractive, faster growth regions.
A couple of points on our continuous improvement efforts. In addition to the dollars saved through our Lean and Six Sigma initiatives, we are changing processes and eliminating barriers to productivity. In the first half of the year, we completed 80 kinds of [ph] events that are generating measurable improvements. While some focus on internal processes, others target improvements in how we engage with our customers. These initiatives are creating sustainable change that will continue to pay dividends down the road.
Our global procurement group has really hit its stride and is well on its way to meeting our full year goals. The result will be another year of record savings from procurement. We've launched our new e-sourcing tool, which resulted in more than 15% average savings in the first 2 online auctions. In addition to going after direct spend opportunities, we are increasingly looking at our indirect spend categories as well. As I've said before, this productivity for growth mindset is enabling us to fund important initiatives for our medium and long-term growth while continuing to expand our operating margins. One other point. We are seeing positive benefits from the restructuring actions we've already taken this year.
Shifting back to our results. At the bottom line, we generated adjusted earnings per share of $0.48 in the quarter, an increase of 12% year-over-year. We continue to generate solid cash flow. The year-over-year decline in the quarter reflect increased investments in growth initiatives, but we are well on our way to a second consecutive year of free cash flow conversion north of 100% of net income.
Our sharp focus on improving capital performance continued. In the quarter, we generated 100 basis points year-over-year improvement, excluding the impact of foreign exchange translation and acquisitions.
Now I'll turn it over to Mark for more details in the quarter, and then I'll come back to our outlook for the year."

Please turn to Slide 6, and I'll provide additional details on our reporting segments. Water Infrastructure recorded orders of $562 million, down 4% organically. As Patrick mentioned earlier, we had a challenging year-over-year comparison",809,"Thanks, Patrick. Please turn to Slide 6, and I'll provide additional details on our reporting segments. Water Infrastructure recorded orders of $562 million, down 4% organically. As Patrick mentioned earlier, we had a challenging year-over-year comparison to last year's second quarter when we had 2 major projects that totaled $18 million. Excluding the impact of those projects, our orders would have been roughly flat year-over-year. We exited the quarter with total backlog of $546 million.
Given the strength of the project pipeline that our teams are working and our solid win rate, we believe this year-over-year decline is due primarily to project timing. Worth noting is that in addition to a growing project pipeline, we do see a modest increase in our weekly order rates in June.
Revenue of $566 million represents a 3% increase year-over-year on an organic basis. Acquisitions added an additional $11 million to the top line, while foreign exchange was an $11 million headwind. We generated 15% growth in the global public utility market with double-digit gains across most of our businesses.
In the U.S., our public utility business matched its strong Q1 performance with 22% growth in the second quarter. Our teams are executing very well, driving share gains in the healthy water and wastewater market.
Western Europe grew 4%, driven by broad public utility growth over most of the region, including solid increases in the U.K. due to the AMP6 cycle. There was also strength in the Nordics, France and Germany, partially offset by decline in Southern Europe.
Emerging market results were favorable, up 4% despite mixed market conditions. Our overall growth was driven by large custom projects in India and Laos, coupled with strength in treatment from infrastructure investments in the Middle East.
Finally, expected weakness in oil and gas and mining markets, coupled with a softer-than-expected industrial CapEx environment, drove mid-single-digit declines in our industrial vertical.
Operating margin increased 150 basis points to 14% as volume leverage, cost reductions and modest price realization more than offset cost inflation and increased strategic growth investments.
Please turn to Slide 7. Applied Water recorded orders of $361 million, up 1% organically over the prior period and entered the third quarter with total backlog of $180 million. In this segment, we saw a modest improvement in our weekly order rates over the course of this past quarter. Revenue was $366 million, flat organically versus the prior year.
In Western Europe, revenue increased 14% as industrial water and commercial building applications both delivered double-digit growth in the quarter. Here, we continue to see benefits from energy-efficient product launches and our investment in building our regional sales capabilities.
In the U.S., residential was down 5%, primarily reflecting softer market conditions, including lower demand for well pumps in the West, which benefited last year from severe drought conditions. This segment's U.S. industrial revenue declined 4%, reflecting softer general industrial, marine and food and beverage demand. The most significant portion of this decline was attributable to weakness in regions more directly tied to the oil and gas market.
Segment revenue was down 5% in our emerging markets, primarily due to the as-expected 11% decline in China, driven by softer demand in the commercial and industrial end markets. On a sequential basis, our performance in China continues to improve. Segment operating margin increased 40 basis points to 14.8% year-over-year.
Cost reductions drove a 380 basis point improvement, more than offsetting 160 basis points of cost inflation, 110 basis points from strategic growth investments as well as unfavorable mix. The year-over-year increased investments relate to the funding -- the localization of product assembly in the Middle East and higher investments in new product development.
Now let's turn to Slide 8 to cover the company's cash flow and financial position. We closed the quarter with a cash balance of $586 million. Our net debt to net capital ratio is healthy at 23%, and our revolving credit facility remains in place and unutilized. This underscores our financial strength and capacity for capital deployment. In that regard, we continue to pursue and execute on opportunities to profitably grow the business through organic investments in M&A while also enhancing shareholder returns through dividends and opportunistic share repurchases.
During the second quarter, we invested $25 million for capital expenditures, and we returned $28 million to our shareholders through dividends. Free cash flow was $59 million, a modest decline from the prior year, reflecting increased year-over-year spending on growth CapEx. We continue to expect to deliver at least 100% cash conversion this year.
It's worth highlighting that we improved working capital as a percentage of revenue by 100 basis points in the quarter, excluding the impact of acquisitions in foreign exchange. The improvement was driven by better inventory management and receivable collections.
Please turn to Slide 9, and Patrick will cover the update to our 2016 outlook."
118218449,321421453,1021634,"Xylem Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2016",2016-08-02,"Earnings Calls","Xylem Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mark. We continue to expect to generate revenues of approximately $3.7 billion for the full year, including 1% growth from acquisitions and foreign exchange headwind of approximately 2%. As I mentioned earlier, we are narrowing our organic growth",606,"Thanks, Mark. We continue to expect to generate revenues of approximately $3.7 billion for the full year, including 1% growth from acquisitions and foreign exchange headwind of approximately 2%. As I mentioned earlier, we are narrowing our organic growth expectations. We now anticipate full year organic growth in the range of 2% to 3%. Again, this reflects timing variability as project awards have shifted from the first half to the second in a very strong public utility market.
Following the strong execution and productivity delivered by our team in the first half of the year, we are increasing the upper end of our operating margin guidance 10 basis points. We now expect our full year operating margin to be in the range of 13.4% to 13.8% for the year. As I reviewed earlier, we have narrowed our EPS guidance range to $2 to $2.06 to reflect a couple of items. First, we are reducing our foreign exchange translation headwind impact by $0.02, about $0.01 from the first half and another $0.01 in the second half; and second, this narrowing also reflects the adjustment to the top end of our revenue growth and margin expansion guidance ranges. There is no change to our free cash flow conversion guidance.
Please turn to Slide 10, and I'll walk you through the update to our end market assumptions for 2016. Beginning with public utility at 33% of total revenue, through the first half, we generated organic revenue growth of 13% but expect our second half organic performance to moderate. This expectation reflects continued strong market conditions, but we do face tougher year-over-year comps.
Some of you may recall that we delivered double-digit growth in the U.S. in the second half of last year. With that said, we expect second half 2016 revenue to be up mid-single digits. And as a result, our full year expectation is in the high single-digit range. This outlook is improved relative to our previous expectations and reflects the positive performance realized to date and momentum heading into the back half.
Our industrial end market, which represents 44% of total revenues and includes a wide range of industries, from general light industrials to the heavier sectors. Full year organic revenue growth is now expected to be flat, which is slightly lower than we previously anticipated. Here, we see double-digit declines in the oil and gas and mining sectors, offsetting modest growth in general and light industrial applications.
While industrial overall was down 3% in the first half, we do expect our performance to improve over the balance of the year, primarily reflecting easier second half comps as we lap more significant prior year headwinds in the oil and gas market.
Moving to commercial. We are maintaining our full year mid-single-digit growth outlook. This reflects first half organic revenue growth of 3% and modest improvement in the back half. That improvement is supported by solid underlying market conditions in the U.S. and continued growth in Europe, driven by new product demand. In addition, we expect the weak conditions in China to begin to stabilize and then improve in the latter part of the year.
In our smallest 2 end markets, residential and agriculture, we project full year revenue to be down mid-single digits. Both of these sectors have experienced challenging market conditions in the first half of the year due in part to lower demand for well pumps as drought conditions moderated in the Western U.S. We expect those to continue in the second half.
Now please turn to Slide 11, and Mark will walk you through more of the details on the second half outlook. Mark?"

I'd like to spend a minute calibrating everyone around what we expect our revenue and operating income profile to be over the balance of 2016.
First, shippable backlog. Of the total $725 million in backlog, $525 million is shippable in the second half of this year and the remaining $200 million is expected to ship in 2017. Third quarter shippable backlog is approximately $365 million, which is down 2% organically versus the prior year. This represents approximately 40% of our expected third quarter sales.
While we still have a lot of book and ship business to secure and deliver in the quarter, we believe that we have solid momentum in the public utility sector as well as stable outlooks across most of our key regions. In addition, our teams have stepped up their execution and are delivering more quickly to our customers. Organically, we anticipate second half revenue to increase in the range of 2% to 3%.
We see a second half revenue profile similar to past years, down 3% sequentially in the third quarter before ramping up in the fourth quarter. This reflects the impact of seasonality in Europe in July and August. We expect operating income performance in the second half to improve sequentially. This will be driven by volume, improved mix and a continued ramp-up of savings from our productivity initiatives.
In the third quarter, we anticipate margin expansion of approximately 50 to 100 basis points year-over-year. Finally, we expect full year corporate expense of approximately $50 million.
With that, please turn to Slide 12, and I'll hand the call back over to Patrick for some closing comments. Patrick?"

And I've seen this in the past, both in this market as well as even the energy sectors when projects begin to heat up, which is obviously not the case right now in that sector. But what you see is you've got constraints on a number of the E&C firms, the construction firms, tight labor market, obviously some level of wage inflation there, they bid these projects, they put in their budgetary quotes. The quote sometimes come in higher than what the municipalities were actually thinking at that point in time. They push it back. They rebid again. And although we've already been committed the project and the order from a customer into the contractor, they can't officially place the order on us until they actually have that in hand. It typically, from my experience, takes a couple of quarters for this to work through the system. It's hard to predict. But again, it's not unprecedented. And as I said, it is a high-quality problem to have. And those rebids on the quotes don't have an impact on our pricing or our margin structure. Really, it's just a matter of the timing of when the project actually flows through. When I take -- when I talk about the size of the pipeline, the total pipeline that we're talking about really are treatment projects, and those are the leading indicators for us. And that total pipeline is about $2.6 billion, and that pipeline is up 15% from a year ago. And so it does give us pretty good visibility into what '17 could look like, again, setting aside any ongoing shift out of the timing of some of these projects. But overall, it's actually a very encouraging sign to see this level of healthy bidding and tension in this system beam."

But secondly, one of the benefits you have when you have a large share position like we do, especially on the submersible wastewater pump side of the market, by definition, as you see an increase in level of repair and maintenance and kind of break and fix business, the person with the larger share does benefit disproportionately there in terms of growth because of our install base that is being repaired and replaced.

We've got a whole rating system, like many companies do, on a project-by-project basis. So we got very good visibility there. I would say that when you look at our guidance for the second half of the year, the scenario by which we would deliver the lower end of that 2% to 3% would be if, in fact, there were some projects that were shifted out of Q4 into Q1. Again, we don't -- we aren't calling that. We don't see that. But we thought it would be prudent to at least build that in to the lower end of the top line growth range."

And it's been that way year after year, so no real change there. The 8% of our industrial, which is tied to oil and gas and mining, 3% of that is oil and gas, 5% of that is mining. Oil and gas is basically going to be -- is going to be basically flattish in the second half of the year to maybe down low single digits that we're calling, depending upon the 2% to 3% range. And then mining, we're calling to be down a further 10% in the second half of the year. Again, in the case of mining, it's not tied to output. As long as the mine is up and running, it needs to be kept dry. This really is a reflection of some continued shuttering and mothballing of mining sites around the world. And so that we don't have a lot of good visibility, I'd say, beyond a quarter out because obviously, we're not there with our customers to know exactly what their decision is site by site.

It wouldn't obviously have meaningful impacts in the market until sometime next year. So right now, for us, it's a wait-and-see approach. On the idea of P3 partnerships, we do see a growing level of discussion and interest in that concept.

A couple of things that are driving that for us. We've had some really -- so first of all, we're serving the public utility market and the commercial building sector. And so we're a little bit immune from the commodity prices of oil and gas. The Middle East is building out basic rudimentary wastewater infrastructure at this point in time. And we continue to see healthy commercial building growth there as well. And then also the fact that we are completing our grand opening of our new manufacturing facility, dedicated salespeople on the street and localization of R&D there later this year. And so we don't have a lot of that baked in from a growth standpoint because it's not done yet. But that gives us opportunity here to take share of the market."

Thanks for joining us to review our second quarter performance. Overall, I'm pleased with the results we delivered in the first half of the year.

Overall, I'm pleased with the results we delivered in the first half of the year. Our ongoing focus on enhancing our commercial leadership is continuing to yield faster than market growth as well as share gains in key regions.
Our teams continue to capitalize on a very strong public utility market, which is not showing any signs of slowing down. This is helping to offset weakness in certain areas of the industrial sector, namely oil and gas and mining. We're also making significant progress on our continuous improvement and business simplification initiatives, which is driving margin expansion and earnings growth.
We have been and will remain keenly focused on the factors we can control, namely: enhancing our customer-centric selling approach, leveraging our broad portfolio of solutions and channel partners, improving our working capital efficiency and optimizing key aspects of our operations. This strategy is enabling us to capture more than our fair share of growth in certain key verticals and optimize our performance in those markets where conditions are mixed. All of these efforts have positioned us well to deliver on our full year commitments, and we believe we are on track to meet our longer-term objectives as well.
We expect many of the macro trends, including the mixed market conditions that existed in the first half of 2016, to continue through the end of the year. This includes some volatility in the timing of major project awards, which slipped out of the second quarter, even as the underlying market conditions in public utility remain strong. This is not an unusual circumstance. And importantly, we continue to cultivate a growing bidding pipeline.
Having closed out the first half of 2016 with 3% organic growth, we are confident in our ability to deliver a similar result in the second half of the year. So we are narrowing our full year revenue growth guidance to reflect both our first half results and the timing of orders. As a result, we are tightening our projection of 2% to 4% organic growth to between 2% to 3%.
We are pleased with our margin expansion and expect that progress to continue even as we invest for future growth. For the full year, we're increasing the upper end of our operating margin target. We now expect to deliver a full year operating margin in the range of 13.4% to 13.8%. Finally, we're narrowing the range of our full year EPS guidance while maintaining the midpoint. We now expect to deliver adjusted EPS of $2 to $2.06. I'll come back to the details behind this change in a few minutes.
Please turn to Slide 5. Our top line organic growth in the quarter was 2% and consistent with our expectations. This excludes 1 point of growth from acquisitions. The strong growth in public utilities helped to mitigate the softness in the industrial and residential end markets.
Looking at our end markets, growth in public utility remains robust. Globally, we grew 15% in this sector in the second quarter with contributions across all major regions, and the U.S. delivering a 22% increase for the second consecutive quarter. And as I just mentioned, our teams continue to report strong bidding pipelines and steady demand.
Our industrial business continues to be negatively impacted by the weak oil and gas sector as well as mining, though it's worth noting that we are now seeing sequential improvement. And the commercial end market, which was up 2% in the quarter, was a mixed bag. Our business in Europe is strong, driven by new products introduced over the past couple of years as well as the investments we've made in strengthening our sales channels there.
The U.S. commercial building market is stabilizing. But after 7 consecutive quarters of growth, we were down in the second quarter. Regionally, Western Europe led the way, delivering 7% growth in the second quarter. The U.S. market was flat despite the strong performance in public utility. And looking at our emerging market regions, the results were mixed, though overall, we delivered 1% growth in the quarter. China continued to be soft, down 11% year-over-year as we had expected. We saw sequential improvement there and investment in infrastructure remains steady. In addition, we continue to capitalize on other growth opportunities across the Asia region.
Our Middle East business is solid and growing, up 10% in the quarter. Finally, India continues to thrive as we continue to deliver on a major infrastructure project. Our team also shipped its first custom pump export order from India to Germany, an important milestone for this business. We had a very robust pipeline in India and anticipate some significant project wins that we hope to communicate in the coming weeks and months.
Coming back to Europe for a moment. I did want to make a few comments about Brexit. Like most companies, we are assessing both near and long-term impacts from this decision, but it's very early in the process. To provide some perspective, the U.K. represents approximately 6% of Xylem's total revenue, with about 70% of that in our Water Infrastructure segment. This customer base is predominantly water utilities, which are inherently more resilient to economic volatility because of the country's 5-year water infrastructure investment plan known as the AMP cycle. Right now, the U.K. is in its sixth 5-year AMP cycle, and we do not anticipate any significant changes.
Our Applied Water applications, which generate about 30% of our revenues in the country, are tied to more economically sensitive markets, including residential, commercial and industrial and therefore, are more vulnerable to economic headwinds. Overall, we aren't drawing any definitive conclusions at this point, but we do not foresee the Brexit decision resulting in a significant impact in the immediate term on the markets we serve in the U.K. or more broadly, across Europe.
Back to our results. Organic order bookings in the quarter were weaker than expected. This primarily reflects project timing fluctuations and a tough year-over-year comparison. In robust environments such as the U.S., we have experienced some delays between the time we received commitments and when we received the actual order. This is due to E&C firms juggling a growing portfolio of a larger, more complex projects, which can cause some delays in the process. This is not an unprecedented dynamic as we've seen from previous periods of significant market recovery, and this is a high-quality problem.
Despite this variability driven by timing, we continue to cultivate a growing project pipeline. As I already mentioned, we're seeing consistently strong design and bidding activity in the U.S. Water Utilities sector.
Our treatment business, which we consider to be a bellwether for the long-term health of the Water Utility business, has a steadily expanding project funnel. In the second quarter, we saw year-over-year growth of approximately 15% with quarterly sequential improvement as well. This growth was driven primarily by increased bidding activity in China and India. There are also signs of potential growth acceleration in parts of Europe and a growing project pipeline in our emerging market regions.
I am particularly pleased with the progress our teams have made in the first half of the year on driving productivity. Our initiatives around continuous improvement and business simplification have already and will continue to create significant value for Xylem. In the quarter, operating margin expanded 100 basis points to 13%, with volume leverage and favorable mix driving 70 basis points of improvement.
Price was neutral overall for the quarter. Collectively, global procurement, Lean and Six Sigma activities and restructuring savings reduced our cost by $30 million in the quarter, resulting in 320 basis points of margin improvement. Partially offsetting these savings were cost inflation of 170 basis points and the funding of our strategic growth initiatives of 90 basis points.
Our growth initiatives included increased new product R&D spend, investment in our selling and continuous improvement capabilities and localization of assembly and production in attractive, faster growth regions.
A couple of points on our continuous improvement efforts. In addition to the dollars saved through our Lean and Six Sigma initiatives, we are changing processes and eliminating barriers to productivity. In the first half of the year, we completed 80 kinds of [ph] events that are generating measurable improvements. While some focus on internal processes, others target improvements in how we engage with our customers. These initiatives are creating sustainable change that will continue to pay dividends down the road.
Our global procurement group has really hit its stride and is well on its way to meeting our full year goals. The result will be another year of record savings from procurement. We've launched our new e-sourcing tool, which resulted in more than 15% average savings in the first 2 online auctions. In addition to going after direct spend opportunities, we are increasingly looking at our indirect spend categories as well. As I've said before, this productivity for growth mindset is enabling us to fund important initiatives for our medium and long-term growth while continuing to expand our operating margins. One other point. We are seeing positive benefits from the restructuring actions we've already taken this year.
Shifting back to our results. At the bottom line, we generated adjusted earnings per share of $0.48 in the quarter, an increase of 12% year-over-year. We continue to generate solid cash flow. The year-over-year decline in the quarter reflect increased investments in growth initiatives, but we are well on our way to a second consecutive year of free cash flow conversion north of 100% of net income.
Our sharp focus on improving capital performance continued. In the quarter, we generated 100 basis points year-over-year improvement, excluding the impact of foreign exchange translation and acquisitions.
Now I'll turn it over to Mark for more details in the quarter, and then I'll come back to our outlook for the year."
118218449,321421453,1022424,"Xylem Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2016",2016-08-02,"Earnings Calls","Xylem Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Patrick. Please turn to Slide 6, and I'll provide additional details on our reporting segments. Water Infrastructure recorded orders of $562 million, down 4% organically. As Patrick mentioned earlier, we had a challenging year-over-year comparison",809,"Thanks, Patrick. Please turn to Slide 6, and I'll provide additional details on our reporting segments. Water Infrastructure recorded orders of $562 million, down 4% organically. As Patrick mentioned earlier, we had a challenging year-over-year comparison to last year's second quarter when we had 2 major projects that totaled $18 million. Excluding the impact of those projects, our orders would have been roughly flat year-over-year. We exited the quarter with total backlog of $546 million.
Given the strength of the project pipeline that our teams are working and our solid win rate, we believe this year-over-year decline is due primarily to project timing. Worth noting is that in addition to a growing project pipeline, we do see a modest increase in our weekly order rates in June.
Revenue of $566 million represents a 3% increase year-over-year on an organic basis. Acquisitions added an additional $11 million to the top line, while foreign exchange was an $11 million headwind. We generated 15% growth in the global public utility market with double-digit gains across most of our businesses.
In the U.S., our public utility business matched its strong Q1 performance with 22% growth in the second quarter. Our teams are executing very well, driving share gains in the healthy water and wastewater market.
Western Europe grew 4%, driven by broad public utility growth over most of the region, including solid increases in the U.K. due to the AMP6 cycle. There was also strength in the Nordics, France and Germany, partially offset by decline in Southern Europe.
Emerging market results were favorable, up 4% despite mixed market conditions. Our overall growth was driven by large custom projects in India and Laos, coupled with strength in treatment from infrastructure investments in the Middle East.
Finally, expected weakness in oil and gas and mining markets, coupled with a softer-than-expected industrial CapEx environment, drove mid-single-digit declines in our industrial vertical.
Operating margin increased 150 basis points to 14% as volume leverage, cost reductions and modest price realization more than offset cost inflation and increased strategic growth investments.
Please turn to Slide 7. Applied Water recorded orders of $361 million, up 1% organically over the prior period and entered the third quarter with total backlog of $180 million. In this segment, we saw a modest improvement in our weekly order rates over the course of this past quarter. Revenue was $366 million, flat organically versus the prior year.
In Western Europe, revenue increased 14% as industrial water and commercial building applications both delivered double-digit growth in the quarter. Here, we continue to see benefits from energy-efficient product launches and our investment in building our regional sales capabilities.
In the U.S., residential was down 5%, primarily reflecting softer market conditions, including lower demand for well pumps in the West, which benefited last year from severe drought conditions. This segment's U.S. industrial revenue declined 4%, reflecting softer general industrial, marine and food and beverage demand. The most significant portion of this decline was attributable to weakness in regions more directly tied to the oil and gas market.
Segment revenue was down 5% in our emerging markets, primarily due to the as-expected 11% decline in China, driven by softer demand in the commercial and industrial end markets. On a sequential basis, our performance in China continues to improve. Segment operating margin increased 40 basis points to 14.8% year-over-year.
Cost reductions drove a 380 basis point improvement, more than offsetting 160 basis points of cost inflation, 110 basis points from strategic growth investments as well as unfavorable mix. The year-over-year increased investments relate to the funding -- the localization of product assembly in the Middle East and higher investments in new product development.
Now let's turn to Slide 8 to cover the company's cash flow and financial position. We closed the quarter with a cash balance of $586 million. Our net debt to net capital ratio is healthy at 23%, and our revolving credit facility remains in place and unutilized. This underscores our financial strength and capacity for capital deployment. In that regard, we continue to pursue and execute on opportunities to profitably grow the business through organic investments in M&A while also enhancing shareholder returns through dividends and opportunistic share repurchases.
During the second quarter, we invested $25 million for capital expenditures, and we returned $28 million to our shareholders through dividends. Free cash flow was $59 million, a modest decline from the prior year, reflecting increased year-over-year spending on growth CapEx. We continue to expect to deliver at least 100% cash conversion this year.
It's worth highlighting that we improved working capital as a percentage of revenue by 100 basis points in the quarter, excluding the impact of acquisitions in foreign exchange. The improvement was driven by better inventory management and receivable collections.
Please turn to Slide 9, and Patrick will cover the update to our 2016 outlook."
118218449,321421453,1022424,"Xylem Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2016",2016-08-02,"Earnings Calls","Xylem Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mark. We continue to expect to generate revenues of approximately $3.7 billion for the full year, including 1% growth from acquisitions and foreign exchange headwind of approximately 2%. As I mentioned earlier, we are narrowing our organic growth",606,"Thanks, Mark. We continue to expect to generate revenues of approximately $3.7 billion for the full year, including 1% growth from acquisitions and foreign exchange headwind of approximately 2%. As I mentioned earlier, we are narrowing our organic growth expectations. We now anticipate full year organic growth in the range of 2% to 3%. Again, this reflects timing variability as project awards have shifted from the first half to the second in a very strong public utility market.
Following the strong execution and productivity delivered by our team in the first half of the year, we are increasing the upper end of our operating margin guidance 10 basis points. We now expect our full year operating margin to be in the range of 13.4% to 13.8% for the year. As I reviewed earlier, we have narrowed our EPS guidance range to $2 to $2.06 to reflect a couple of items. First, we are reducing our foreign exchange translation headwind impact by $0.02, about $0.01 from the first half and another $0.01 in the second half; and second, this narrowing also reflects the adjustment to the top end of our revenue growth and margin expansion guidance ranges. There is no change to our free cash flow conversion guidance.
Please turn to Slide 10, and I'll walk you through the update to our end market assumptions for 2016. Beginning with public utility at 33% of total revenue, through the first half, we generated organic revenue growth of 13% but expect our second half organic performance to moderate. This expectation reflects continued strong market conditions, but we do face tougher year-over-year comps.
Some of you may recall that we delivered double-digit growth in the U.S. in the second half of last year. With that said, we expect second half 2016 revenue to be up mid-single digits. And as a result, our full year expectation is in the high single-digit range. This outlook is improved relative to our previous expectations and reflects the positive performance realized to date and momentum heading into the back half.
Our industrial end market, which represents 44% of total revenues and includes a wide range of industries, from general light industrials to the heavier sectors. Full year organic revenue growth is now expected to be flat, which is slightly lower than we previously anticipated. Here, we see double-digit declines in the oil and gas and mining sectors, offsetting modest growth in general and light industrial applications.
While industrial overall was down 3% in the first half, we do expect our performance to improve over the balance of the year, primarily reflecting easier second half comps as we lap more significant prior year headwinds in the oil and gas market.
Moving to commercial. We are maintaining our full year mid-single-digit growth outlook. This reflects first half organic revenue growth of 3% and modest improvement in the back half. That improvement is supported by solid underlying market conditions in the U.S. and continued growth in Europe, driven by new product demand. In addition, we expect the weak conditions in China to begin to stabilize and then improve in the latter part of the year.
In our smallest 2 end markets, residential and agriculture, we project full year revenue to be down mid-single digits. Both of these sectors have experienced challenging market conditions in the first half of the year due in part to lower demand for well pumps as drought conditions moderated in the Western U.S. We expect those to continue in the second half.
Now please turn to Slide 11, and Mark will walk you through more of the details on the second half outlook. Mark?"

I'd like to spend a minute calibrating everyone around what we expect our revenue and operating income profile to be over the balance of 2016.
First, shippable backlog. Of the total $725 million in backlog, $525 million is shippable in the second half of this year and the remaining $200 million is expected to ship in 2017. Third quarter shippable backlog is approximately $365 million, which is down 2% organically versus the prior year. This represents approximately 40% of our expected third quarter sales.
While we still have a lot of book and ship business to secure and deliver in the quarter, we believe that we have solid momentum in the public utility sector as well as stable outlooks across most of our key regions. In addition, our teams have stepped up their execution and are delivering more quickly to our customers. Organically, we anticipate second half revenue to increase in the range of 2% to 3%.
We see a second half revenue profile similar to past years, down 3% sequentially in the third quarter before ramping up in the fourth quarter. This reflects the impact of seasonality in Europe in July and August. We expect operating income performance in the second half to improve sequentially. This will be driven by volume, improved mix and a continued ramp-up of savings from our productivity initiatives.
In the third quarter, we anticipate margin expansion of approximately 50 to 100 basis points year-over-year. Finally, we expect full year corporate expense of approximately $50 million.
With that, please turn to Slide 12, and I'll hand the call back over to Patrick for some closing comments. Patrick?"

And I've seen this in the past, both in this market as well as even the energy sectors when projects begin to heat up, which is obviously not the case right now in that sector. But what you see is you've got constraints on a number of the E&C firms, the construction firms, tight labor market, obviously some level of wage inflation there, they bid these projects, they put in their budgetary quotes. The quote sometimes come in higher than what the municipalities were actually thinking at that point in time. They push it back. They rebid again. And although we've already been committed the project and the order from a customer into the contractor, they can't officially place the order on us until they actually have that in hand. It typically, from my experience, takes a couple of quarters for this to work through the system. It's hard to predict. But again, it's not unprecedented. And as I said, it is a high-quality problem to have. And those rebids on the quotes don't have an impact on our pricing or our margin structure. Really, it's just a matter of the timing of when the project actually flows through. When I take -- when I talk about the size of the pipeline, the total pipeline that we're talking about really are treatment projects, and those are the leading indicators for us. And that total pipeline is about $2.6 billion, and that pipeline is up 15% from a year ago. And so it does give us pretty good visibility into what '17 could look like, again, setting aside any ongoing shift out of the timing of some of these projects.

One, there have been some products that we've launched that are entering the market and are being extremely well received, and we'll have more to talk about on that front in future calls here. But secondly, one of the benefits you have when you have a large share position like we do, especially on the submersible wastewater pump side of the market, by definition, as you see an increase in level of repair and maintenance and kind of break and fix business, the person with the larger share does benefit disproportionately there in terms of growth because of our install base that is being repaired and replaced. And these customers, as you well know, we almost always replace in kind. And so we're certainly benefiting from that as well. That's also helped our mix because that's a higher margin business for us relative to the initial OEM install."

Oil and gas is basically going to be -- is going to be basically flattish in the second half of the year to maybe down low single digits that we're calling, depending upon the 2% to 3% range. And then mining, we're calling to be down a further 10% in the second half of the year. Again, in the case of mining, it's not tied to output. As long as the mine is up and running, it needs to be kept dry. This really is a reflection of some continued shuttering and mothballing of mining sites around the world.

I can't name the customer on it because we're not allowed to. That was a $12 million job. It was a global project shop worked on by, well, a lot of different contractors and vendors. That was also a pretty unique order that we got, that we delivered later in the year. And so those are really the drivers in the Water Infrastructure, muni side of things. We would have seen flat order growth last year in Q2 overall for Water Infrastructure, but these would've driven, if you would, 4%, 5% orders growth in the municipal side of the Water Infrastructure order book last year. That would have been offset by the beginning of headwinds that we started to see in the oil and gas business, predominantly in our dewatering business in Q2 of last year. So that was the offset there."

Thanks for joining us to discuss our third quarter performance. Today marks a significant new chapter for Xylem. Yesterday, October 31, was the fifth anniversary of Xylem's spinning out of ITT and embarking on its journey as a new company. We've evolved since that day and made substantial progress, creating significant value for our shareholders. So today, on the first day of our sixth year, we began as a larger, stronger and more focused enterprise. We have a clear long-term strategy that we laid out last year at Investor Day, one of which is Xylem becomes the definitive market leader and a leading provider of advanced technologies and integrated solutions across the water sector to drive long-term growth, margin expansion and value creation.
We know where we want to take this company and we're making meaningful progress in executing those plans. I'm pleased with what our team has accomplished but I know we're still in the early innings. This morning, we announced we have successfully completed our acquisition of Sensus, a global leader in smart meters, network technologies and advanced data analytics. As I explained in August, this business is squarely aligned with our strategy of becoming a leading provider of systems-intelligent solutions to our customers, which we laid out at our Investor Day last year.
Their portfolio includes the type of advanced technologies that are fueling the transition of the water sector to smart infrastructure. The transaction closing process was smooth with no unexpected hurdles in the various regulatory reviews. Our highly successful debt offering, it was 10x oversubscribed, was a sign of great confidence in Xylem and in this transaction. Our teams did a great job all around in bringing this deal to a prompt close. Now we're focused on accelerating the integration process so we can realize the full value of this combination. I'll come back to the integration in a few moments. 
We had another announcement today and I'm speaking of our acquisition of Visenti, which we completed in October as well. Visenti, based in Singapore, has developed a suite of products and services that focus on increasing the productivity of water distribution networks. They primarily target the perennial challenge of leak detection, pressure management and water quality monitoring in the distribution network. While small, this company's solutions are complementary to both the Xylem and Sensus portfolio. We know them well. We entered into a strategic partnership in 2012, at the request of the Singapore Public Utility Board. The Public Utilities Board, which is widely recognized as the definitive thought leader in the water space, asked us to partner with them to pilot a comprehensive solution to monitor the drinking water network throughout Singapore, which was highly successful. Now that they are part of Xylem, with the global support and infrastructure we bring to the table, we will help them scale their business. I'll have more comments on the Visenti business in a few moments as well.
Now let's review our third quarter results. Our teams, once again, delivered a solid performance in a very mixed economic environment. While organic revenue was flat year-over-year, strong execution and accelerated productivity initiatives helped drive 90 basis points of margin expansion and 10% earnings growth. Orders in the quarter increased 1% year-over-year and were up 2% sequentially, boosted by some large new orders in emerging markets. Overall, we had expected the oil and gas sector trajectory to begin to level off, but to our disappointment, the declines continued and we now expect that trend to extend at least into next year. This continues to impact our dewatering business as well as portions of our analytics portfolio. This prolonged weakness is having a disproportionate impact on regions that are highly dependent on commodities as a source of funding for other industries, such as the Middle East. We saw this play out in our results this quarter as the major project work there dropped off significantly.
On the positive side, the opening of our new factory in Dubai last month will enable us to be a more active participant in the book-and-bill business because we now can meet the quick lead times required by customers.
Let me address some other market conditions. We are operating in certain end markets that are experiencing growth. Public utilities is our best example at the moment and we are aggressively going after the business and in many regions, capturing share. And with the addition of Sensus, we are increasing our exposure to this sector with a broader portfolio of solutions and enhancing our leadership position in one of the faster-growing, higher-margin areas of the industry. 
In the quarter, we delivered 10% growth in the global public utility sector and that momentum is continuing. The U.S. continues to be the hottest market in the space, and there, we generated a 25% increase over last year's performance of 7% growth. This growth reflects the realization of pent-up demand in this space, but I also want to acknowledge the tremendous effort of our teams. They are taking nothing for granted and that is evident in their performance in capturing share. 
The industrial segment, which represents our largest end market, is a different story. This sector continues to be a challenge and we are closely monitoring a mixed macro environment. We realize that we cannot control market conditions, however, we are taking steps to mitigate some of the impact.  We're evaluating conditions by subsector and by region so we can optimize our cost basis and ensure that we are well positioned when market conditions begin to improve.
Moving to our emerging markets. Overall, our revenue was down 4% in the quarter, driven primarily by decline in the Middle East. One of the bright spots was China, where we generated growth in our infrastructure business. Additionally, our team is building backlog there, with sequential improvement of 19%, primarily in the Water Infrastructure business. They delivered a significant win in the quarter of $13 million for our Wedeco ozone systems that will be used in 2 pulp and paper plants. This will be the first ozone bleaching application in this sector in China and opens the door to new potential business with a far more environmentally friendly and sustainable solution than was previously used. This is driven in part by China's increasing regulations for more sustainable practices and industrial operations. Another noteworthy region is India. There, we continued to deliver on the $39 million custom pump job that we won last year in the third quarter. This installation will be used for the world's largest lift irrigation system, which will bring water to farms, serving thousands of rural villages. As we noted when we announced the win, this major project is providing a sound foundation for other similar projects in power and irrigation.
This past quarter, we won a $37 million contract for a pumping station that will be part of a $1 billion mega lift irrigation project in the Telangana region in Southern India. This project will shift substantially over the course of 2017. Once again, this success was the result of strong collaboration between our local team in India and our Flygt custom pump team in the U.S. They customized the design to meet the customer's exact specifications and ensure that the complex solution can be sourced completely with local supply.
Now as we've done all year, our focus on cost controls and increasing productivity remain steadfast. In the third quarter, we delivered $35 million in gross cost reductions, which brings our year-to-date total to $87 million. Our global procurement group continues to lever Xylem's scale to deliver sustainable savings across multiple categories. These actions helped to mitigate some of the impact of the challenging market conditions we faced.
In keeping with our productivity for growth mindset, these savings also funded strategic investments for growth. Additionally, we are accelerating targeted restructuring actions that will deliver incremental savings in the fourth quarter and greater savings in 2017. These results position us well to easily surpass our full year goal for cost savings and productivity improvements.
Finally, at the bottom line, we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $0.54 in the quarter, a 10% increase over last year's result.
We also generated $121 million in free cash flow, resulting in a 166% conversion rate. Now please turn to Slide 5, and I'll update you on the status of our acquisition integration.
We're thrilled to now have Sensus as part of a larger Xylem. Sensus is a complementary partner that significantly broadens our offerings with the type of systems-intelligent solutions that move our portfolio up the technology curve. This instantly increases the value we can bring to customers with solutions that target some of their most urgent challenges. The need to increase energy efficiency, improve life cycle costs and extract actionable insights from data to optimize their operations, these are all high on the priority list of customer needs that we are now better equipped to meet.
Together, we will strengthen our industry leadership position, particularly as we expand into new markets, leveraging Xylem's global reach and the strong customer relationships cultivated by both companies. With the deal closed, we are focused on executing our integration smoothly and efficiently so we can realize the full value of the combinations. Our teams have already been collaborating for several weeks and now that work will accelerate.
Today, Sensus will operate as an independent business unit and will be reported as a new segment. Randy Bays, who's been serving as President of Sensus, will continue to lead the business reporting to me. We will be thoughtful and deliberate as we enable greater collaboration across our sales teams, ensuring that we capture new opportunities while not disrupting the existing business. 
On the R&D side, our teams will immediately collaborate to identify areas where work can be combined or aligned to accelerate progress and fuel the substantial revenue synergies we expect to deliver. The Sensus business is increasing our exposure to more attractive end markets such as public utility through the fast-growing smart metering sector. In the last 2 quarters, Sensus delivered top line growth of more than 10%. This gives us even greater confidence in the 6% to 7% compounded revenue growth rate that we projected through 2020 when we announced the deal back in August.
With 2 months remaining in the calendar year, we expect Sensus to add about $0.01 to our full year adjusted EPS. In 2017, their contribution is expected to increase our earnings by at least 5% or approximately $0.10 to $0.12 of earnings per share.
We are still early in the process of evaluating the full range of possible synergies but we remain confident in our ability to deliver cost savings of at least $50 million and revenue synergies in excess of $100 million by 2020, which we communicated when we announced the deal.
With the Visenti, we have a business that is highly complementary to both Xylem and Sensus' offerings. In fact, the company was in Sensus' own acquisition pipeline. Visenti operates in a $2 billion market of asset management solutions, which is growing in the high single-digit rate. One of the specific challenges that Visenti's technical solutions address is what's known as non-revenue water. This term refers to treated drinking water that is lost through leaks, theft or other causes. Globally, roughly 30% of treated drinking water is lost every year. Said another way, for a public utility that is 30% of their product just dripping away. As utilities and communities focus their resources on improving the resiliency of their infrastructure, this is an urgent insolvable challenge that we are now well positioned to help them address.
Furthermore, the addition of Visenti's highly expert data scientists, along with Sensus' capabilities in this area, will further accelerate our overall R&D work across Xylem in the area of systems intelligence. This is yet another compelling demonstration of how M&A can serve as a proxy for R&D. This was an attractive deal at $8 million plus earn-out opportunities. Given its relative size, we currently expect it to be neutral to both 2016 and 2017 results.
Now I'll turn it over to Mark for more details in the quarter, and then I'll come back to our final outlook for the year."

We generated 1 point of growth from acquisitions, which was offset by currency impacts. We had another quarter of strong growth in public utilities, which helped mitigate increasing softness in the industrial end markets. 
Looking at our end markets in more detail. The outstanding growth we have seen in public utility continued for the fifth consecutive quarter.  Globally, we grew at 10% in this sector during the third quarter, reflecting our leadership position in ongoing strong execution in which we are capturing share and delivering value to our customers.  Revenues also grew 2% in both commercial and residential building services in the quarter.
Offsetting the growth in these end markets was a 7% decline in our industrial markets, including softer-than-expected revenues in our dewatering and Analytics businesses. I'll cover these challenges further in my overview of our segment performance.
Regionally, Western Europe grew 3% in the third quarter with modest growth across most of our businesses and end markets. The U.S. market was up 1%, as strong performance in public utilities was largely offset by weakness in the industrial markets. Our emerging market results were mixed. Overall, we saw a 4% decline in the quarter, which included a tough prior year comparison of 9% growth.
Our Middle East business declined 28% during the quarter, reflecting both the timing of large prior year project deliveries as well as a further slowdown in the region. China was down 4% year-over-year and in line with our expectations. We're encouraged by the quarter's sequential improvement in revenues and orders as well as positive year-over-year growth in our Water Infrastructure segment, reflecting what we believe is a slow but steady recovery in this market. 
India was a bright spot, delivering strong growth, up 67%, driven primarily by our continued execution on the large custom pump project that Patrick mentioned. 
Shifting gears, our teams did an outstanding job expanding operating margin by 90 basis points to 14.6%. Our initiatives around continuous improvement and business simplification continue to create significant value for the company.
In the quarter, global procurement, Lean Six Sigma activities and restructuring savings reduced our cost by $35 million, resulting in 390 basis points of margin improvement. This included $4 million in savings from the restructuring actions we executed earlier this year. These savings more than offset 180 basis points of cost inflation and funded 90 basis points of strategic investments. Given the ongoing weak demand we're facing in the industrial end market, we're accelerating actions to mitigate the near-term impact and position the business for further margin expansion as conditions improve.
Acquisitions negatively impacted operating margins by 20 basis points in the quarter, reflecting in part noncash monetization costs associated with purchase accounting.
Given the challenges we face during the quarter in our industrial markets, very pleased with our team's performance in delevering adjusted earnings per share of $0.54, an increase of 10% year-over-year. Please turn to Slide 7, and I'll provide additional details on our reporting segments.
Water Infrastructure recorded orders of $604 million, up 2% organically year-over-year. This growth was primarily driven by the $13 million treatment order which Patrick highlighted earlier. It also includes the $37 million custom pump order in India, which offset a similar large project award last year. 
We exited the quarter with total backlog of $598 million, down approximately 5% year-over-year but improving quarter sequentially by 10%. It's worth noting that our treatment project funnel continues to grow, up 22% from this time last year.  This trend gives us confidence that the municipal market will remain a source of growth for the foreseeable future. 
Revenues of $554 million represent a 1% increase year-over-year on an organic basis.
Acquisitions added an additional $8 million to the top line while foreign exchange was a $14 million headwind. 
In the U.S., the segment grew 6% overall. Our public utility business grew 25%, surpassing a very strong first half growth rate of 22%. This growth was partially offset by significant challenges in our dewatering business, including double-digit declines directly tied to the oil and gas market and a 15% reduction in equipment sales to distributors for reducing their investments in fleet inventory.
Western Europe grew 2% overall, driven by another solid quarter in the U.K. where our teams drove 14% growth, capturing opportunities as we continue through the AMP6 cycle. This growth was partially offset by the lapping of project deliveries across Europe as well as lower public utility demand in France.
Emerging markets declined by 6% overall, driven by substantial slowing in the Middle East and Latin American markets. These challenges were partially offset by a significant positive contribution from India, with revenues up more than 80%. And China returned to growth in the quarter, posting a 3% increase, a positive trend that we expect will continue.
The prolonged decline in oil and gas prices is significantly impacting the level of government and industrial spend in the Middle East, where revenues for the segment were down 42%. 
Revenues in Latin America were down 16% in the quarter, reflecting the lapping of prior year projects in our dewatering and Analytics businesses, and to a lesser extent, still challenging market conditions in the mining sector. 
Operating margin increased 50 basis points to 15.9% as productivity initiatives offset cost inflation and unfavorable mix as well as funding increased strategic growth investments.
Our productivity programs drove 380 basis points of margin expansion, reflecting a 100 basis point quarter sequential acceleration in year-over-year savings from these actions. 
Inflation was a 180 basis point headwind, and we had 70 basis points of unfavorable mix, largely driven by the declines in our higher-margin dewatering and analytics products. Acquisitions were also a 40 basis point drag on margin in the quarter. 
Applied Water booked orders of $342 million in the quarter, flat organically over the prior year. This segment entered the fourth quarter with total backlog of $177 million, most of which is expected to ship in the fourth quarter. Revenues were $343 million, down 1% organically versus the prior year. In Western Europe, revenue increased 4% with strong growth in the commercial building services and residential markets. Here, we continue to benefit from energy-efficient product launches and our enhanced regional sales capabilities. 
Segment revenue was up 1% in our emerging markets, primarily due to 7% growth in Latin America, which more than offset sales declines in the Middle East.
In the U.S., revenues were down 4% in the quarter. This was primarily driven by the segment's industrial revenues, which declined 9%, primarily reflecting continued weakness in oil and gas, and to a lesser extent, light industrial, attributable to lower O&M demand in food and beverage and decreased stocking levels by marine distributors.
Delays in the release of projects in the U.S. commercial building sector drove lower year-over-year revenues but were partially offset by growth in residential groundwater applications. Segment operating margin increased 180 basis points to 15.5% year-over-year.
Cost reductions drove an impressive 410 basis point margin improvement, representing a 30 basis point quarter sequential acceleration in year-over-year cost savings. This more than offset 170 basis points of cost inflation and 90 basis points from strategic growth investments, which included the localization of product assembly in the Middle East.
Now let's turn to Slide 9 to cover the company's cash flow and financial position. We closed the quarter with a cash balance of $659 million. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, and in connection with the Sensus and Visenti acquisitions, we utilized approximately $400 million of European cash to close these transactions. We also issued $900 million of long-term U.S. notes, which were split into 2 tranches. The first tranche was for $500 million with a 10-year maturity and a 3 1/4% interest rate. The second tranche was for $400 million, a 30-year maturity and a 4.375% interest rate. As Patrick indicated, we were 10x oversubscribed, reflecting investor support for the deal and our company's strong financial profile. To complete the deal financing, we placed $200 million of short-term European debt and $200 million of commercial paper, which we expect to repay over the next 12 to 18 months.
Lastly, I'd like to highlight that we continue to maintain our investment-grade credit rating, which will require that we focus our capital deployment on debt repayment over the next 12 to 18 months.
Now back to a few more cash items for the quarter. During the third quarter, we invested $28 million for capital expenditures and also returned $28 million to our shareholders through dividends. Free cash flow in the quarter was $121 million, a 4% increase from the prior year. Free cash flow conversion was 166% in the quarter, and we expect to deliver at least 100% cash conversion this year.
We also improved working capital as a percentage of revenue by 40 basis points in the quarter, excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign exchange. 
Now please turn to Slide 10, and Patrick will cover the update to our 2016 outlook."

We're updating our full year revenue guidance and now expect to generate revenue of approximately $3.8 billion for the full year. This reflects a few changes. First, we are lowering our full year organic growth expectation from what was prev",627,"Thanks, Mark. We're updating our full year revenue guidance and now expect to generate revenue of approximately $3.8 billion for the full year. This reflects a few changes. First, we are lowering our full year organic growth expectation from what was previously a 2% to 3% range to 1.5% to reflect both our third quarter performance and changes to certain end market assumptions, which I'll cover in more detail in the next slide. This reduction includes nearly a full point decline due to weaker conditions in the Middle East. 
Secondly, we are updating our top line guidance to reflect greater-than-expected foreign exchange headwind. Lastly, we are incorporating the expected contribution from the Sensus acquisition. This includes $140 million revenue that we expect this business to generate in November and December. 
Along with the transactions we announced early this year, we now expect acquisitions to add approximately 5% of revenue growth to our full year 2016 performance.
Following another quarter of strong execution and productivity delivered by our team and anticipated contributions in the fourth quarter, we are forecasting full year operating margin of 13.4%, including 50 basis points of dilution attributable to acquisitions. Excluding the acquisition dilution, our operating margin is expected to increase 100 basis points over the prior year.
As I mentioned earlier, we are maintaining our previous EPS midpoint of $2.03, while narrowing our EPS guidance range of $2.02 to $2.04. Our new guidance reflects the net impact of the Sensus acquisition offset by $0.01 of unfavorable foreign exchange translation, in addition to other volume and cost-savings adjustments. Mark will provide more color on these impacts in a few minutes. 
Now please turn to Slide 11, and I'll walk you through the update to our end market assumptions for 2016.
Beginning with public utility at 33% total revenue before the impact of Sensus is added to the portfolio. Over the first 3 quarters, we generated very strong organic revenue growth, up 12% year-over-year. Looking ahead, we expect growth to moderate, particularly as we lap our very strong fourth quarter performance of last year when we grew 8%. We expect continued momentum in this market to generate a mid- to high single-digit increase in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
As a result of our performance to date and fourth quarter expectations, we now anticipate public utility growth in the high single to low double-digit range, which is higher than our previous guidance. Our industrial end market, which represents 44% of total revenues, full year organic revenue is expected to be down mid-single digits, weaker than we previously anticipated. We now expect declines in the oil and gas sector to continue at least into next year.
Moving to commercial. After first half growth of 3%, we delivered a 2% increase in the third quarter. Our teams continued to see relatively healthy levels of design and quoting activity which could provide for some incremental growth in 2017, however, in the immediate term, based on actual order input rates, we believe that growth will remain in the flat to low single-digit range. Now this global outlook includes some geographic differences. For example, we expect a more stable growth environment in the U.S. institutional market and continued growth across most European geographies. China should benefit from the lapping of lower prior-year comparisons. The Middle East, however, is expected to face more challenging market conditions. 
In residential, we now project full year revenue to be down low single digits. Agriculture would likely be down mid-single-digits. Now while these sectors experienced challenging market conditions in the first half of the year, we did see some slight improvement in the third quarter. 
Now please turn to Slide 12, and Mark will walk you through more of the details on the outlook. Mark?"
118218449,321421504,1068066,"Xylem Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2016",2016-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Xylem Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Patrick. Before, I cover the outlook, I'd like to spend a couple of minutes highlighting the benefits of our continuous improvement and business simplification programs, including the improvements we're making to the experience our customers and c",747,"Thanks, Patrick. Before, I cover the outlook, I'd like to spend a couple of minutes highlighting the benefits of our continuous improvement and business simplification programs, including the improvements we're making to the experience our customers and channel partners have when doing business with Xylem.
Our ability to operate our business in a more aligned fashion, with improved processes and by leveraging our global scale, is a significant opportunity for us at Xylem. For example, our centralized global procurement organization was formed less than 2 years ago and today, is delivering savings and improved supply quality in terms at significantly higher level of performance. After posting record savings of $64 million last year, the team is well on its way to delivering $80 million in 2016, representing a 25% year-over-year improvement. 
Procurement savings had provided 200 basis points of operating margin expansion over the first 3 quarters, and are expected to drive nearly 260 basis points in the fourth quarter of this year. 
Lean and Six Sigma are also gaining traction this year as we build more capability throughout the organization. This will be a significant value creation tool for years to come. As for this year, we anticipate completing more than 100 kaizen events which will provide approximately $35 million in full year savings. 
We anticipate an acceleration in savings from these activities as we close out the year given the increased velocity of our kaizen events as well as the leverage from higher fourth quarter volumes.  Beyond cost savings, this program is meaningfully improving the speed and service performance with our customers. For example, year-to-date, our on-time delivery has improved by 400 basis points while also enabling us to reduce customer lead times.
We also expect to see an increase in cost savings attributable to our business simplification activities. 
During the third quarter, we realized $4 million in restructuring cost savings, bringing our year-to-date total to $9 million.  As a result of recent actions, we now anticipate $7 million of cost savings in the fourth quarter, nearly double the benefit from the programs executed earlier this year. These actions will help us mitigate some of the nearer term demand weakness we are anticipating in our industrial markets and will provide additional run rate benefits in 2017. 
In summary, our focus on continuous improvement and business simplification has provided substantial benefits to date. These actions will enable us to continue to deliver margin expansion while also positioning us more competitively with our customers.
Please turn to Slide 13. As shown on this slide, we're maintaining the midpoint of our full year EPS guidance at $2.03 per share, while narrowing the range to $2.02 to $2.04 per share. While there was no change to the midpoint of our full year guidance, there are a number of factors which will be impacting our 4Q. Relative to prior guidance, we are reflecting that, that impact of our revised revenue outlook, including $0.01 unfavorable impact from recent foreign-exchange fluctuations. 
At the operating margin level, we expect higher productivity gains and incremental cost savings to provide 30 basis points of margin expansion and $0.05 of EPS benefit. We expect Sensus revenues to be $140 million for the 2 months ending December 31. We also expect Sensus' operating income to be $0.04 accretive to fourth quarter earnings, including our preliminary estimate of $0.03 of non-cash amortization costs for intangibles which has a dilutive impact on Xylem's overall operating margins.  We will provide an update to the expected impact from non-cash intangible amortization on our next call, after we complete the initial purchase price valuation for the opening balance sheet.
Finally, fourth quarter interest expense will increase $8 million or $0.03 per share, reflecting higher borrowings to fund the acquisition. 
Please turn to Slide 4, where I'll briefly summarize our key fourth quarter assumptions. Organic revenue growth is expected to be flat to up 1% for the fourth quarter, with water infrastructure anticipated to grow in the range of 1% to 2% and Applied Water expected to be flat to 1%. As I mentioned, Sensus is expected to add approximately $140 million of revenues in the quarter. 
Operating margin is expected to range between 14.6% and 14.9%, including 130 basis points of dilution from this year's acquisition, which is primarily due to non-cash amortization of intangibles. And earnings are expected to range between $0.65 and $0.67 per share.
With that, I'll hand the call back over to Patrick for some closing comments. Patrick?"

You can imagine what the reference point is on a global scale. When you've got Singapore PUV as incubator to drive business. So Visenti has already diversified away, they've got a number of other customers in other geographies, and quite frankly, have more requested our services than they have the resources to do right now, which is really a part of the backdrop for our partnership and acquisition of them. But there, they've got a couple of different software development capabilities that are able to, not only gather the data from inside the pipe using ultrasound techniques and other opportunities, but it's also their data science and data analytics capability as they model that data that's coming back, and their ability to do that 24/7, irrespective of what the weather is, is another opportunity that they leverage. They are unique and we do believe that there's an opportunity here to take us well beyond some of the emerging markets. We're actually going to plan, it's a good time for me to say, we're actually planning to do and Investor Day, Dean, and very early Q2, down in Raleigh-Durham, and we will be sure to have the team from Visenti there as well, to be able to showcase that technology along with what we're getting here with Sensus."

Yes, I mean, we're obviously very pleased with what the team has continued to do there, and as we said earlier, the funnel, the big pipeline continues to grow very nicely. I mean, that's up 22% versus the same time a year ago. So I think one of the drivers is that we are getting better visibility into the market as to the project funnel and pipeline, and we're improving our win rates. And part of that is I think the impact of us being able to leverage this integration of our commercial teams, looking across the entire public utility offering. So a lot of that lead generation is helping us in a number of geographies across the board. Secondly, I think  as we mentioned before, given our substantial market share leadership position in that space, we stand to benefit disproportionately in a rising tide environment. And so we get a lot more looks, I think, than many of our competitors do. And that's really driven as much by our large installed base. And so as the munis are investing in refurbishment of their existing infrastructure, it's highly unusual that they would swap out or switch out an entire pump network, and so we get the disproportionate benefit of that replacement work. And the same on the aftermarket service repair side. We've seen continued record levels of break and fix business especially here in North America, that continues to benefit us. And then lastly, we're in the early stages of some really exciting new product rollouts. We launched a new product called Consertor, which is really not in these numbers but gives us great confidence about market share capture as we head into 2017 as well."

And of course, what happened in Middle East so suddenly in Saudi was the second surprise for us. And those 2 together, caused us well more than 1 point of organic revenue growth in the quarter which is where we messed. So yes, there's certainly idled assets that are our there, that oil and gas customers are using, as well as mining. But it's also the impact, Nathan, of again, just in mothballing and idling of either mines or fracking sites. And so those 2 things together were the impact. But what we really saw in the quarter was our indirect channel, the distributors pulling back on their CapEx spend, so dramatically down 15% [ph] in the quarter. That caught us a bit by surprise as well and we're trying to model that into our Q4 outlook and just trying to get a feel for what that looked like for '17. This might be a good opportunity to that point, Nathan, for me to perhaps share a little bit of the framework of how we're thinking about 2017. And if I start with the end markets, based on what we see today, we expect these mixed market conditions to continue into 2017. And again, that includes a really robust public utility sector but it will be against some tough comparisons given what our full year growth is the this year. But we would still consider that to be very, very attractive. We would also expect a sluggish environment to continue in industrial, for the reasons that I just articulated here, perhaps that's conservative but we're trying to be conservative here. I'd say, at this point, it would be hard to see organic growth for our historical Xylem businesses, i.e, x Sensus beyond low single-digits but we're obviously going to learn a lot more as we go through Q4. We're not going to be watching what order trends closely, particularly in the Middle East in industrial. We're clearly taking actions to manage costs as we've done throughout this year but I'd probably wrap up the '17 with what we do know. We know that we're going to get significant contributions to revenue from Sensus, which given its recent performance, should itself grow at least 6% to 7% which is in line with the long-term CAGR that we laid out back in August when we announced the deal. What we also know is that the bottom line, we expect to get $0.10 to $0.12 of EPS accretion from Sensus, now that's net of purchase accounting impacts. And then lastly, we expect our margin expansion pace to continue. Again, if you exclude the non-cash acquisition impacts from the first of accounting, and you think about procurement, Lean Six Sigma and business simplification benefits, so expect to that margin expansion rate and pace to continue. And we also know that we're going to get $0.07 to $0.08 of carryover savings from restructuring that we've already taken this year that will flow into next year. So, hopefully, to those listen, that gives you a little bit of a framework for how we are at least thinking initially about '17."

The real impact for us in the quarter. And I was just over there for our brand opening of our manufacturing facility and met with a number of our channel partners as well as with our customers in Saudi. And for those of you that are following the news there, you know that they're going through some serious budget constraints right now. And the common theme across pretty much all sectors, is the common kind of down 20%, 30% the quarter. I'm not sure what this, what the kind of symmetry in there between that and what he saw. But for example, if the Saudi government just about a month ago, announced that they are doing across the board 20% reduction in all government employees' salary immediately, and that's being driven by some of those funding constraints. And so we saw that pull back in the quarter. We're being told that it will come back and that it's temporary. But right now, and so we see improvement in our order book there over the course of fourth quarter, we're trying to take a prudent view here on what kind of a drag that might have on our overall industrial growth."

We wouldn't say it's getting worse, it's really just flatlined. And as we get into the end of this year, we'll lap that comparison and we'll be talking about net positive growth for China all in."

But I would say, as we mentioned back in the call in August, we're very confident that we're going to get at least $50 million in costs synergies. And as I said in the last call, I'd be disappointed if we didn't have more than $100 million of revenue synergies over that timeframe as well through 2020. The areas that are really the biggest opportunity for us on the cost side, big opportunities in the areas of procurement. And so, whether it be overlapping in supplier base, but also using some of the tools that we put to use here at Xylem the last couple of years, we expect the same kind of progress and momentum to be there on a combined Visenti and Sensus. There are also areas of opportunity in some of our back-office functions and G&A support functions on a global scale. On the revenue side, it really is going to be focused, I would say, if anything, in our synergy planning teams, I don't want to sound like the happy talking CEO here, but there were more revenue synergies opportunities. And you could check a stick out. The key was that they're longer lead time, some of them. They're going to require R&D and engineering support from Sensus. And so we're going to make sure that we're disciplined and balance on how we think about those things. But they are really predominantly, Chip, in areas such as, one, we got a number of customers today, where they already owned Sensus' FlexNet and data analytics solutions but they 're only applied today to the cleaner side of the network. And we have opportunities to now connect our devices on the wastewater side to be able to provide similar solution to the customer for their challenges on wastewater. Second is they've got a number of big international projects that are out there that they're bidding on, that in some cases, are with customers that are already customers of ours today, that we, hopefully, are going to be able to help them leverage in some way. And third, we think there's opportunities to also levered their data analytics capabilities across multiple parts of the Xylem portfolio to bring in some of that Software-as-a-Service opportunity across our existing business. So these are longer lead times but we are very excited, both Xylem and Sensus about the opportunity here."

Thanks for joining us to discuss our third quarter performance. Today marks a significant new chapter for Xylem. Yesterday, October 31, was the fifth anniversary of Xylem's spinning out of ITT and embarking on its",2054,"Thanks, Phil, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us to discuss our third quarter performance. Today marks a significant new chapter for Xylem. Yesterday, October 31, was the fifth anniversary of Xylem's spinning out of ITT and embarking on its journey as a new company. We've evolved since that day and made substantial progress, creating significant value for our shareholders. So today, on the first day of our sixth year, we began as a larger, stronger and more focused enterprise. We have a clear long-term strategy that we laid out last year at Investor Day, one of which is Xylem becomes the definitive market leader and a leading provider of advanced technologies and integrated solutions across the water sector to drive long-term growth, margin expansion and value creation.
We know where we want to take this company and we're making meaningful progress in executing those plans. I'm pleased with what our team has accomplished but I know we're still in the early innings. This morning, we announced we have successfully completed our acquisition of Sensus, a global leader in smart meters, network technologies and advanced data analytics. As I explained in August, this business is squarely aligned with our strategy of becoming a leading provider of systems-intelligent solutions to our customers, which we laid out at our Investor Day last year.
Their portfolio includes the type of advanced technologies that are fueling the transition of the water sector to smart infrastructure. The transaction closing process was smooth with no unexpected hurdles in the various regulatory reviews. Our highly successful debt offering, it was 10x oversubscribed, was a sign of great confidence in Xylem and in this transaction. Our teams did a great job all around in bringing this deal to a prompt close. Now we're focused on accelerating the integration process so we can realize the full value of this combination. I'll come back to the integration in a few moments. 
We had another announcement today and I'm speaking of our acquisition of Visenti, which we completed in October as well. Visenti, based in Singapore, has developed a suite of products and services that focus on increasing the productivity of water distribution networks. They primarily target the perennial challenge of leak detection, pressure management and water quality monitoring in the distribution network. While small, this company's solutions are complementary to both the Xylem and Sensus portfolio. We know them well. We entered into a strategic partnership in 2012, at the request of the Singapore Public Utility Board. The Public Utilities Board, which is widely recognized as the definitive thought leader in the water space, asked us to partner with them to pilot a comprehensive solution to monitor the drinking water network throughout Singapore, which was highly successful. Now that they are part of Xylem, with the global support and infrastructure we bring to the table, we will help them scale their business. I'll have more comments on the Visenti business in a few moments as well.
Now let's review our third quarter results. Our teams, once again, delivered a solid performance in a very mixed economic environment. While organic revenue was flat year-over-year, strong execution and accelerated productivity initiatives helped drive 90 basis points of margin expansion and 10% earnings growth. Orders in the quarter increased 1% year-over-year and were up 2% sequentially, boosted by some large new orders in emerging markets. Overall, we had expected the oil and gas sector trajectory to begin to level off, but to our disappointment, the declines continued and we now expect that trend to extend at least into next year. This continues to impact our dewatering business as well as portions of our Analytics portfolio. This prolonged weakness is having a disproportionate impact on regions that are highly dependent on commodities as a source of funding for other industries, such as the Middle East. We saw this play out in our results this quarter as the major project work there dropped off significantly.
On the positive side, the opening of our new factory in Dubai last month will enable us to be a more active participant in the book-and-bill business because we now can meet the quick lead times required by customers.
Let me address some other market conditions. We are operating in certain end markets that are experiencing growth. Public utilities is our best example at the moment and we are aggressively going after the business and in many regions, capturing share. And with the addition of Sensus, we are increasing our exposure to this sector with a broader portfolio of solutions and enhancing our leadership position in one of the faster-growing, higher-margin areas of the industry. 
In the quarter, we delivered 10% growth in the global public utility sector and that momentum is continuing. The U.S. continues to be the hottest market in the space, and there, we generated a 25% increase over last year's performance of 7% growth. This growth reflects the realization of pent-up demand in this space, but I also want to acknowledge the tremendous effort of our teams. They are taking nothing for granted and that is evident in their performance in capturing share. 
The industrial segment, which represents our largest end market, is a different story. This sector continues to be a challenge and we are closely monitoring a mixed macro environment. We realize that we cannot control market conditions, however, we are taking steps to mitigate some of the impact.  We're evaluating conditions by subsector and by region so we can optimize our cost basis and ensure that we are well positioned when market conditions begin to improve.
Moving to our emerging markets. Overall, our revenue was down 4% in the quarter, driven primarily by decline in the Middle East. One of the bright spots was China, where we generated growth in our infrastructure business. Additionally, our team is building backlog there, with sequential improvement of 19%, primarily in the Water Infrastructure business. They delivered a significant win in the quarter of $13 million for our Wedeco ozone systems that will be used in 2 pulp and paper plants. This will be the first ozone bleaching application in this sector in China and opens the door to new potential business with a far more environmentally friendly and sustainable solution than was previously used. This is driven in part by China's increasing regulations for more sustainable practices and industrial operations. Another noteworthy region is India. There, we continued to deliver on the $39 million custom pump job that we won last year in the third quarter. This installation will be used for the world's largest lift irrigation system, which will bring water to farms, serving thousands of rural villages. As we noted when we announced the win, this major project is providing a sound foundation for other similar projects in power and irrigation.
This past quarter, we won a $37 million contract for a pumping station that will be part of a $1 billion mega lift irrigation project in the Telangana region in Southern India. This project will shift substantially over the course of 2017. Once again, this success was the result of strong collaboration between our local team in India and our Flygt custom pump team in the U.S. They customized the design to meet the customer's exact specifications and ensure that the complex solution can be sourced completely with local supply.
Now as we've done all year, our focus on cost controls and increasing productivity remain steadfast. In the third quarter, we delivered $35 million in gross cost reductions, which brings our year-to-date total to $87 million. Our global procurement group continues to lever Xylem's scale to deliver sustainable savings across multiple categories. These actions helped to mitigate some of the impact of the challenging market conditions we faced.
In keeping with our productivity for growth mindset, these savings also funded strategic investments for growth. Additionally, we are accelerating targeted restructuring actions that will deliver incremental savings in the fourth quarter and greater savings in 2017. These results position us well to easily surpass our full year goal for cost savings and productivity improvements.
Finally, at the bottom line, we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $0.54 in the quarter, a 10% increase over last year's result.
We also generated $121 million in free cash flow, resulting in a 166% conversion rate. Now please turn to Slide 5, and I'll update you on the status of our acquisition integration.
We're thrilled to now have Sensus as part of a larger Xylem. Sensus is a complementary partner that significantly broadens our offerings with the type of systems-intelligent solutions that move our portfolio up the technology curve. This instantly increases the value we can bring to customers with solutions that target some of their most urgent challenges. The need to increase energy efficiency, improve life cycle costs and extract actionable insights from data to optimize their operations, these are all high on the priority list of customer needs that we are now better equipped to meet.
Together, we will strengthen our industry leadership position, particularly as we expand into new markets, leveraging Xylem's global reach and the strong customer relationships cultivated by both companies. With the deal closed, we are focused on executing our integration smoothly and efficiently so we can realize the full value of the combinations. Our teams have already been collaborating for several weeks and now that work will accelerate.
Today, Sensus will operate as an independent business unit and will be reported as a new segment. Randy Bays, who's been serving as President of Sensus, will continue to lead the business reporting to me. We will be thoughtful and deliberate as we enable greater collaboration across our sales teams, ensuring that we capture new opportunities while not disrupting the existing business. 
On the R&D side, our teams will immediately collaborate to identify areas where work can be combined or aligned to accelerate progress and fuel the substantial revenue synergies we expect to deliver. The Sensus business is increasing our exposure to more attractive end markets such as public utility through the fast-growing smart metering sector. In the last 2 quarters, Sensus delivered top line growth of more than 10%. This gives us even greater confidence in the 6% to 7% compounded revenue growth rate that we projected through 2020 when we announced the deal back in August.
With 2 months remaining in the calendar year, we expect Sensus to add about $0.01 to our full year adjusted EPS. In 2017, their contribution is expected to increase our earnings by at least 5% or approximately $0.10 to $0.12 of earnings per share.
We are still early in the process of evaluating the full range of possible synergies but we remain confident in our ability to deliver cost savings of at least $50 million and revenue synergies in excess of $100 million by 2020, which we communicated when we announced the deal.
With the Visenti, we have a business that is highly complementary to both Xylem and Sensus' offerings. In fact, the company was in Sensus' own acquisition pipeline. Visenti operates in a $2 billion market of asset management solutions, which is growing in the high single-digit rate. One of the specific challenges that Visenti's technical solutions address is what's known as non-revenue water. This term refers to treated drinking water that is lost through leaks, theft or other causes. Globally, roughly 30% of treated drinking water is lost every year. Said another way, for a public utility that is 30% of their product just dripping away. As utilities and communities focus their resources on improving the resiliency of their infrastructure, this is an urgent insolvable challenge that we are now well positioned to help them address.
Furthermore, the addition of Visenti's highly expert data scientists, along with Sensus' capabilities in this area, will further accelerate our overall R&D work across Xylem in the area of systems intelligence. This is yet another compelling demonstration of how M&A can serve as a proxy for R&D. This was an attractive deal at $8 million plus earn-out opportunities. Given its relative size, we currently expect it to be neutral to both 2016 and 2017 results.
Now I'll turn it over to Mark for more details in the quarter, and then I'll come back to our final outlook for the year."

We generated 1 point of growth from acquisitions, which was offset by currency impacts.

We generated 1 point of growth from acquisitions, which was offset by currency impacts. We had another quarter of strong growth in public utilities, which helped mitigate increasing softness in the industrial end markets. 
Looking at our end markets in more detail. The outstanding growth we have seen in public utility continued for the fifth consecutive quarter.  Globally, we grew at 10% in this sector during the third quarter, reflecting our leadership position in ongoing strong execution in which we are capturing share and delivering value to our customers.  Revenues also grew 2% in both commercial and residential building services in the quarter.
Offsetting the growth in these end markets was a 7% decline in our industrial markets, including softer-than-expected revenues in our dewatering and Analytics businesses. I'll cover these challenges further in my overview of our segment performance.
Regionally, Western Europe grew 3% in the third quarter with modest growth across most of our businesses and end markets. The U.S. market was up 1%, as strong performance in public utilities was largely offset by weakness in the industrial markets. Our emerging market results were mixed. Overall, we saw a 4% decline in the quarter, which included a tough prior year comparison of 9% growth.
Our Middle East business declined 28% during the quarter, reflecting both the timing of large prior year project deliveries as well as a further slowdown in the region. China was down 4% year-over-year and in line with our expectations. We're encouraged by the quarter's sequential improvement in revenues and orders as well as positive year-over-year growth in our Water Infrastructure segment, reflecting what we believe is a slow but steady recovery in this market. 
India was a bright spot, delivering strong growth, up 67%, driven primarily by our continued execution on the large custom pump project that Patrick mentioned. 
Shifting gears, our teams did an outstanding job expanding operating margin by 90 basis points to 14.6%. Our initiatives around continuous improvement and business simplification continue to create significant value for the company.
In the quarter, global procurement, Lean and Six Sigma activities and restructuring savings reduced our cost by $35 million, resulting in 390 basis points of margin improvement. This included $4 million in savings from the restructuring actions we executed earlier this year. These savings more than offset 180 basis points of cost inflation and funded 90 basis points of strategic investments. Given the ongoing weak demand we're facing in the industrial end market, we're accelerating actions to mitigate the near-term impact and position the business for further margin expansion as conditions improve.
Acquisitions negatively impacted operating margins by 20 basis points in the quarter, reflecting in part noncash monetization costs associated with purchase accounting.
Given the challenges we face during the quarter in our industrial markets, very pleased with our team's performance in delevering adjusted earnings per share of $0.54, an increase of 10% year-over-year. Please turn to Slide 7, and I'll provide additional details on our reporting segments.
Water Infrastructure recorded orders of $604 million, up 2% organically year-over-year. This growth was primarily driven by the $13 million treatment order which Patrick highlighted earlier. It also includes the $37 million custom pump order in India, which offset a similar large project award last year. 
We exited the quarter with total backlog of $598 million, down approximately 5% year-over-year but improving quarter sequentially by 10%. It's worth noting that our treatment project funnel continues to grow, up 22% from this time last year.  This trend gives us confidence that the municipal market will remain a source of growth for the foreseeable future. 
Revenues of $554 million represent a 1% increase year-over-year on an organic basis.
Acquisitions added an additional $8 million to the top line while foreign exchange was a $14 million headwind. 
In the U.S., the segment grew 6% overall. Our public utility business grew 25%, surpassing a very strong first half growth rate of 22%. This growth was partially offset by significant challenges in our dewatering business, including double-digit declines directly tied to the oil and gas market and a 15% reduction in equipment sales to distributors for reducing their investments in fleet inventory.
Western Europe grew 2% overall, driven by another solid quarter in the U.K. where our teams drove 14% growth, capturing opportunities as we continue through the AMP6 cycle. This growth was partially offset by the lapping of project deliveries across Europe as well as lower public utility demand in France.
Emerging markets declined by 6% overall, driven by substantial slowing in the Middle East and Latin American markets. These challenges were partially offset by a significant positive contribution from India, with revenues up more than 80%. And China returned to growth in the quarter, posting a 3% increase, a positive trend that we expect will continue.
The prolonged decline in oil and gas prices is significantly impacting the level of government and industrial spend in the Middle East, where revenues for the segment were down 42%. 
Revenues in Latin America were down 16% in the quarter, reflecting the lapping of prior year projects in our dewatering and Analytics businesses, and to a lesser extent, still challenging market conditions in the mining sector. 
Operating margin increased 50 basis points to 15.9% as productivity initiatives offset cost inflation and unfavorable mix as well as funding increased strategic growth investments.
Our productivity programs drove 380 basis points of margin expansion, reflecting a 100 basis point quarter sequential acceleration in year-over-year savings from these actions. 
Inflation was a 180 basis point headwind, and we had 70 basis points of unfavorable mix, largely driven by the declines in our higher-margin dewatering and analytics products. Acquisitions were also a 40 basis point drag on margin in the quarter. 
Applied Water booked orders of $342 million in the quarter, flat organically over the prior year. This segment entered the fourth quarter with total backlog of $177 million, most of which is expected to ship in the fourth quarter. Revenues were $343 million, down 1% organically versus the prior year. In Western Europe, revenue increased 4% with strong growth in the commercial building services and residential markets. Here, we continue to benefit from energy-efficient product launches and our enhanced regional sales capabilities. 
Segment revenue was up 1% in our emerging markets, primarily due to 7% growth in Latin America, which more than offset sales declines in the Middle East.
In the U.S., revenues were down 4% in the quarter. This was primarily driven by the segment's industrial revenues, which declined 9%, primarily reflecting continued weakness in oil and gas, and to a lesser extent, light industrial, attributable to lower O&M demand in food and beverage and decreased stocking levels by marine distributors.
Delays in the release of projects in the U.S. commercial building sector drove lower year-over-year revenues but were partially offset by growth in residential groundwater applications. Segment operating margin increased 180 basis points to 15.5% year-over-year.
Cost reductions drove an impressive 410 basis point margin improvement, representing a 30 basis point quarter sequential acceleration in year-over-year cost savings. This more than offset 170 basis points of cost inflation and 90 basis points from strategic growth investments, which included the localization of product assembly in the Middle East.
Now let's turn to Slide 9 to cover the company's cash flow and financial position. We closed the quarter with a cash balance of $659 million. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, and in connection with the Sensus and Visenti acquisitions, we utilized approximately $400 million of European cash to close these transactions. We also issued $900 million of long-term U.S. notes, which were split into 2 tranches. The first tranche was for $500 million with a 10-year maturity and a 3 1/4% interest rate. The second tranche was for $400 million, a 30-year maturity and a 4.375% interest rate. As Patrick indicated, we were 10x oversubscribed, reflecting investor support for the deal and our company's strong financial profile. To complete the deal financing, we placed $200 million of short-term European debt and $200 million of commercial paper, which we expect to repay over the next 12 to 18 months.
Lastly, I'd like to highlight that we continue to maintain our investment-grade credit rating, which will require that we focus our capital deployment on debt repayment over the next 12 to 18 months.
Now back to a few more cash items for the quarter. During the third quarter, we invested $28 million for capital expenditures and also returned $28 million to our shareholders through dividends. Free cash flow in the quarter was $121 million, a 4% increase from the prior year. Free cash flow conversion was 166% in the quarter, and we expect to deliver at least 100% cash conversion this year.
We also improved working capital as a percentage of revenue by 40 basis points in the quarter, excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign exchange. 
Now please turn to Slide 10, and Patrick will cover the update to our 2016 outlook."

We're updating our full year revenue guidance and now expect to generate revenue of approximately $3.8 billion for the full year. This reflects a few changes. First, we are lowering our full year organic growth expectation from what was previously a 2% to 3% range to 1.5% to reflect both our third quarter performance and changes to certain end market assumptions, which I'll cover in more detail in the next slide. This reduction includes nearly a full point decline due to weaker conditions in the Middle East. 
Secondly, we are updating our top line guidance to reflect greater-than-expected foreign exchange headwind. Lastly, we are incorporating the expected contribution from the Sensus acquisition. This includes $140 million revenue that we expect this business to generate in November and December. 
Along with the transactions we announced early this year, we now expect acquisitions to add approximately 5% of revenue growth to our full year 2016 performance.
Following another quarter of strong execution and productivity delivered by our team and anticipated contributions in the fourth quarter, we are forecasting full year operating margin of 13.4%, including 50 basis points of dilution attributable to acquisitions. Excluding the acquisition dilution, our operating margin is expected to increase 100 basis points over the prior year.
As I mentioned earlier, we are maintaining our previous EPS midpoint of $2.03, while narrowing our EPS guidance range of $2.02 to $2.04. Our new guidance reflects the net impact of the Sensus acquisition offset by $0.01 of unfavorable foreign exchange translation, in addition to other volume and cost-savings adjustments. Mark will provide more color on these impacts in a few minutes. 
Now please turn to Slide 11, and I'll walk you through the update to our end market assumptions for 2016.
Beginning with public utility at 33% total revenue before the impact of Sensus is added to the portfolio. Over the first 3 quarters, we generated very strong organic revenue growth, up 12% year-over-year. Looking ahead, we expect growth to moderate, particularly as we lap our very strong fourth quarter performance of last year when we grew 8%. We expect continued momentum in this market to generate a mid- to high single-digit increase in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
As a result of our performance to date and fourth quarter expectations, we now anticipate public utility growth in the high single to low double-digit range, which is higher than our previous guidance. Our industrial end market, which represents 44% of total revenues, full year organic revenue is expected to be down mid-single digits, weaker than we previously anticipated. We now expect declines in the oil and gas sector to continue at least into next year.
Moving to commercial. After first half growth of 3%, we delivered a 2% increase in the third quarter. Our teams continue to see relatively healthy levels of design and quoting activity, which could provide for some incremental growth in 2017. However, in the immediate term, based on actual order input rates, we believe that growth will remain in the flat to low single-digit range. Now this global outlook includes some geographic differences. For example, we expect a more stable growth environment in the U.S. institutional market and continued growth across most European geographies. China should benefit from the lapping of lower prior year comparisons. The Middle East, however, is expected to face more challenging market conditions. 
In residential, we now project full year revenue to be down low single digits. Agriculture will likely be down mid-single digits. Now while these sectors experienced challenging market conditions in the first half of the year, we did see some slight improvement in the third quarter. 
Now please turn to Slide 12, and Mark will walk you through more of the details on the outlook. Mark?"

Before I cover the outlook, I'd like to spend a couple of minutes highlighting the benefits of our continuous improvement and business simplification programs, including the improvements we're making to the experience our customers and ch",749,"Thanks, Patrick. Before I cover the outlook, I'd like to spend a couple of minutes highlighting the benefits of our continuous improvement and business simplification programs, including the improvements we're making to the experience our customers and channel partners have when doing business with Xylem.
Our ability to operate our business in a more aligned fashion, with improved processes and by leveraging our global scale, is a significant opportunity for us at Xylem. For example, our centralized global procurement organization was formed less than 2 years ago and today is delivering savings, an improved supplier quality and terms at a significantly higher level of performance. After posting record savings of $64 million last year, the team is well on its way to delivering $80 million in 2016, representing a 25% year-over-year improvement. 
Procurement savings have provided 200 basis points of operating margin expansion over the first 3 quarters and are expected to drive nearly 260 basis points in the fourth quarter of this year. 
Lean and Six Sigma are also gaining traction this year as we build more capability throughout the organization. This will be a significant value creation tool for years to come. As for this year, we anticipate completing more than 100 Kaizen events, which will provide approximately $35 million in full year savings. 
We anticipate an acceleration in savings from these activities as we close out the year, given the increased velocity of our Kaizen events as well as the leverage from higher fourth quarter volumes.  Beyond cost savings, this program is meaningfully improving the speed and service performance with our customers. For example, year-to-date, our on-time delivery has improved by 400 basis points while also enabling us to reduce customer lead times.
We also expect to see an increase in cost savings attributable to our business simplification activities. 
During the third quarter, we realized $4 million in restructuring cost savings, bringing our year-to-date total to $9 million. As a result of recent actions, we now anticipate $7 million of cost savings in the fourth quarter, nearly double the benefit from the programs executed earlier this year. These actions will help us mitigate some of the nearer-term demand weakness we are anticipating in our industrial markets and will provide additional run rate benefits in 2017. 
In summary, our focus on continuous improvement and business simplification has provided substantial benefits to date. These actions will enable us to continue to deliver margin expansion while also positioning us more competitively with our customers.
Please turn to Slide 13. As shown on this slide, we're maintaining the midpoint of our full year EPS guidance at $2.03 per share, while narrowing the range to $2.02 to $2.04 per share. While there was no change to the midpoint of our full year guidance, there are a number of factors which will be impacting our 4Q. Relative to prior guidance, we are reflecting the net impact of our revised revenue outlook, including $0.01 unfavorable impact from recent foreign exchange fluctuations. 
At the operating margin level, we expect higher productivity gains and incremental cost savings to provide 30 basis points of margin expansion and $0.05 of EPS benefit. We expect Sensus revenues to be $140 million for the 2 months ending December 31. We also expect Sensus operating income to be $0.04 accretive to fourth quarter earnings, including our preliminary estimate of $0.03 of noncash amortization cost for intangibles, which has a dilutive impact on Xylem's overall operating margins. We will provide an update to the expected impact from noncash intangible amortization on our next call after we complete the initial purchase price valuation for the opening balance sheet.
Finally, fourth quarter interest expense will increase $8 million or $0.03 per share, reflecting higher borrowings to fund the acquisition. 
Please turn to Slide 14, where I'll briefly summarize our key fourth quarter assumptions. Organic revenue growth is expected to be flat to up 1% for the fourth quarter, with Water Infrastructure anticipated to grow in the range of 1% to 2% and Applied Water expected to be flat to down 1%. As I mentioned, Sensus is expected to add approximately $140 million of revenues in the quarter. 
Operating margin is expected to range between 14.6% and 14.9%, including 130 basis points of dilution from this year's acquisitions, which is primarily due to noncash amortization of intangibles. And earnings are expected to range between $0.65 and $0.67 per share.
With that, I'll hand the call back over to Patrick for some closing comments. Patrick?"

And of course, what happened in Middle East so suddenly in Saudi was the second surprise for us. And those 2 together caused us well more than 1 point of organic revenue growth in the quarter, which is where we missed. So yes, there certainly are idled assets that are there that oil and gas customers are using as well as mining. But it's also the impact, Nathan, of again just a mothballing and idling of either mines and/or fracking sites. And so those 2 things together were the impact. But what we really saw in the quarter was our indirect channel, the distributors pulling back on their CapEx spend, so dramatically down 15% in the quarter. That caught us a bit by surprise as well and we're trying to model that into our Q4 outlook and just trying to get a feel for what that might look like for '17. This might be a good opportunity to that point, Nathan, for me to perhaps share a little bit of the framework of how we're thinking about 2017. And if I start with the end markets, based on what we see today, we expect these mixed market conditions to continue into 2017. And again, that includes a really robust public utility sector but it will be against some tougher comparisons, given what our full year growth is this year. But we would still consider that to be very, very attractive. We would also expect a sluggish environment to continue in industrial, for the reasons that I just articulated here. Perhaps that's conservative, but we're trying to be conservative here. I'd say, at this point, it would be hard to see organic growth for our historical Xylem businesses, i.e. x Sensus beyond low single digits, but we're obviously going to learn a lot more as we get through Q4. We're going to be watching order trends closely, particularly in the Middle East and industrial. We're clearly taking actions to manage costs as we've done throughout this year, but I'd probably wrap up the '17 with what we do know. We know that we're going to get significant contributions to revenue from Sensus, which, given its recent performance, should itself grow at least 6% to 7%, which is in line with the long-term CAGR that we laid out back in August when we announced the deal. What we also know is that the bottom line, we expect to get $0.10 to $0.12 of EPS accretion from Sensus. Now that's net of purchase accounting impacts. And then lastly, we expect our margin expansion pace to continue. Again, if you exclude the noncash acquisition impacts from the purchase accounting and you think about procurement, Lean Six Sigma and business simplification benefits, so we expect that margin expansion rate and pace to continue. And we also know that we're going to get $0.07 to $0.08 of carryover savings from restructuring that we've already taken this year that will flow into next year. So hopefully, to those listening, that gives you a little bit of a framework for how we're at least thinking initially about '17."

So we expected some of that. The real impact for us in the quarter, and I was just over there for our brand opening of our manufacturing facility and met with a number of our channel partners as well as with some customers in Saudi. And for those of you that are following the news there, you know that they're going through some serious budget constraints right now. And the common theme across pretty much all sectors is the common kind of down 20%, 30% in the quarter. I'm not sure what the kind of symmetry is there between that and what we saw. But for example, if the Saudi government just about a month ago announced that they are doing an across-the-board 20% reduction in all government employees' salary immediately, and that's being driven by some of their funding constraints. And so we saw that pull back in the quarter. We're being told that it will come back and that it's temporary. But right now, until we see an improvement in our order book there over the course of fourth quarter, we're trying to take a prudent view here on what kind of a drag that might have on our overall industrial growth."

But I would say, as we mentioned back in the call in August, we're very confident that we're going to get at least $50 million in cost synergies. And as I said in the last call, I'd be disappointed if we didn't have more than $100 million of revenue synergies over that time frame as well through 2020. The areas that are really the biggest opportunity for us on the cost side, big opportunities in the areas of procurement. And so whether it be overlapping in supplier base but also just using some of the tools that we put to use here at Xylem the last couple of years, we expect the same kind of progress and momentum to be there on a combined spend base with Sensus. There are also areas of opportunity in some of our back-office functions and G&A support functions on a global scale. On the revenue side, it really is going to be focused, I would say, if anything, in our synergy planning teams. I don't want to sound like the happy talking CEO here, but there were more revenue synergy opportunities than you coul shake a stick at. The key was that they're longer lead time, some of them. They're going to require R&D and engineering support from Sensus. And so we're going to make sure that we're disciplined and balanced on how we think about those things. But they are really predominantly, Chip, in areas such as, one, we got a number of customers today in common where they already own Sensus' FlexNet and data analytics solutions but they're only applied today to the clean water side of the network and we have opportunities to now connect our devices on the wastewater side to be able to provide similar solutions to the customer for their challenges on wastewater. Second is they've got a number of big international projects that are out there that they're bidding on that, in some cases, are with customers that are already customers of ours today that we, hopefully, are going to be able to help them leverage in some way. And third, we think there's opportunities to also lever their data analytics capabilities across multiple parts of the Xylem portfolio to bring in some of that Software-as-a-Service opportunity across our existing business.

Thanks for joining us to discuss our third quarter performance. Today marks a significant new chapter for Xylem. Yesterday, October 31, was the fifth anniversary of Xylem's spinning out of ITT and embarking on its",2054,"Thanks, Phil, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us to discuss our third quarter performance. Today marks a significant new chapter for Xylem. Yesterday, October 31, was the fifth anniversary of Xylem's spinning out of ITT and embarking on its journey as a new company. We've evolved since that day and made substantial progress, creating significant value for our shareholders. So today, on the first day of our sixth year, we began as a larger, stronger and more focused enterprise. We have a clear long-term strategy that we laid out last year at Investor Day, one of which is Xylem becomes the definitive market leader and a leading provider of advanced technologies and integrated solutions across the water sector to drive long-term growth, margin expansion and value creation.
We know where we want to take this company and we're making meaningful progress in executing those plans. I'm pleased with what our team has accomplished but I know we're still in the early innings. This morning, we announced we have successfully completed our acquisition of Sensus, a global leader in smart meters, network technologies and advanced data analytics. As I explained in August, this business is squarely aligned with our strategy of becoming a leading provider of systems-intelligent solutions to our customers, which we laid out at our Investor Day last year.
Their portfolio includes the type of advanced technologies that are fueling the transition of the water sector to smart infrastructure. The transaction closing process was smooth with no unexpected hurdles in the various regulatory reviews. Our highly successful debt offering, it was 10x oversubscribed, was a sign of great confidence in Xylem and in this transaction. Our teams did a great job all around in bringing this deal to a prompt close. Now we're focused on accelerating the integration process so we can realize the full value of this combination. I'll come back to the integration in a few moments. 
We had another announcement today and I'm speaking of our acquisition of Visenti, which we completed in October as well. Visenti, based in Singapore, has developed a suite of products and services that focus on increasing the productivity of water distribution networks. They primarily target the perennial challenge of leak detection, pressure management and water quality monitoring in the distribution network. While small, this company's solutions are complementary to both the Xylem and Sensus portfolio. We know them well. We entered into a strategic partnership in 2012, at the request of the Singapore Public Utility Board. The Public Utilities Board, which is widely recognized as the definitive thought leader in the water space, asked us to partner with them to pilot a comprehensive solution to monitor the drinking water network throughout Singapore, which was highly successful. Now that they are part of Xylem, with the global support and infrastructure we bring to the table, we will help them scale their business. I'll have more comments on the Visenti business in a few moments as well.
Now let's review our third quarter results. Our teams, once again, delivered a solid performance in a very mixed economic environment. While organic revenue was flat year-over-year, strong execution and accelerated productivity initiatives helped drive 90 basis points of margin expansion and 10% earnings growth. Orders in the quarter increased 1% year-over-year and were up 2% sequentially, boosted by some large new orders in emerging markets. Overall, we had expected the oil and gas sector trajectory to begin to level off, but to our disappointment, the declines continued and we now expect that trend to extend at least into next year. This continues to impact our dewatering business as well as portions of our Analytics portfolio. This prolonged weakness is having a disproportionate impact on regions that are highly dependent on commodities as a source of funding for other industries, such as the Middle East. We saw this play out in our results this quarter as the major project work there dropped off significantly.
On the positive side, the opening of our new factory in Dubai last month will enable us to be a more active participant in the book-and-bill business because we now can meet the quick lead times required by customers.
Let me address some other market conditions. We are operating in certain end markets that are experiencing growth. Public utilities is our best example at the moment and we are aggressively going after the business and in many regions, capturing share. And with the addition of Sensus, we are increasing our exposure to this sector with a broader portfolio of solutions and enhancing our leadership position in one of the faster-growing, higher-margin areas of the industry. 
In the quarter, we delivered 10% growth in the global public utility sector and that momentum is continuing. The U.S. continues to be the hottest market in the space, and there, we generated a 25% increase over last year's performance of 7% growth. This growth reflects the realization of pent-up demand in this space, but I also want to acknowledge the tremendous effort of our teams. They are taking nothing for granted and that is evident in their performance in capturing share. 
The industrial segment, which represents our largest end market, is a different story. This sector continues to be a challenge and we are closely monitoring a mixed macro environment. We realize that we cannot control market conditions, however, we are taking steps to mitigate some of the impact.  We're evaluating conditions by subsector and by region so we can optimize our cost basis and ensure that we are well positioned when market conditions begin to improve.
Moving to our emerging markets. Overall, our revenue was down 4% in the quarter, driven primarily by decline in the Middle East. One of the bright spots was China, where we generated growth in our infrastructure business. Additionally, our team is building backlog there, with sequential improvement of 19%, primarily in the Water Infrastructure business. They delivered a significant win in the quarter of $13 million for our Wedeco ozone systems that will be used in 2 pulp and paper plants. This will be the first ozone bleaching application in this sector in China and opens the door to new potential business with a far more environmentally friendly and sustainable solution than was previously used. This is driven in part by China's increasing regulations for more sustainable practices and industrial operations. Another noteworthy region is India. There, we continued to deliver on the $39 million custom pump job that we won last year in the third quarter. This installation will be used for the world's largest lift irrigation system, which will bring water to farms, serving thousands of rural villages. As we noted when we announced the win, this major project is providing a sound foundation for other similar projects in power and irrigation.
This past quarter, we won a $37 million contract for a pumping station that will be part of a $1 billion mega lift irrigation project in the Telangana region in Southern India. This project will ship substantially over the course of 2017. Once again, this success was the result of strong collaboration between our local team in India and our Flygt custom pump team in the U.S. They customized the design to meet the customer's exact specifications and ensure that the complex solution can be sourced completely with local supply.
Now as we've done all year, our focus on cost controls and increasing productivity remain steadfast. In the third quarter, we delivered $35 million in gross cost reductions, which brings our year-to-date total to $87 million. Our global procurement group continues to lever Xylem's scale to deliver sustainable savings across multiple categories. These actions helped to mitigate some of the impact of the challenging market conditions we faced.
In keeping with our productivity for growth mindset, these savings also funded strategic investments for growth. Additionally, we are accelerating targeted restructuring actions that will deliver incremental savings in the fourth quarter and greater savings in 2017. These results position us well to easily surpass our full year goal for cost savings and productivity improvements.
Finally, at the bottom line, we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $0.54 in the quarter, a 10% increase over last year's result.
We also generated $121 million in free cash flow, resulting in a 166% conversion rate. Now please turn to Slide 5, and I'll update you on the status of our acquisition integration.
We're thrilled to now have Sensus as part of a larger Xylem. Sensus is a complementary partner that significantly broadens our offerings with the type of systems-intelligent solutions that move our portfolio up the technology curve. This instantly increases the value we can bring to customers with solutions that target some of their most urgent challenges. The need to increase energy efficiency, improve life cycle costs and extract actionable insights from data to optimize their operations, these are all high on the priority list of customer needs that we are now better equipped to meet.
Together, we will strengthen our industry leadership position, particularly as we expand into new markets, leveraging Xylem's global reach and the strong customer relationships cultivated by both companies. With the deal closed, we are focused on executing our integration smoothly and efficiently so we can realize the full value of the combinations. Our teams have already been collaborating for several weeks and now that work will accelerate.
Today, Sensus will operate as an independent business unit and will be reported as a new segment. Randy Bays, who's been serving as President of Sensus, will continue to lead the business reporting to me. We will be thoughtful and deliberate as we enable greater collaboration across our sales teams, ensuring that we capture new opportunities while not disrupting the existing business. 
On the R&D side, our teams will immediately collaborate to identify areas where work can be combined or aligned to accelerate progress and fuel the substantial revenue synergies we expect to deliver. The Sensus business is increasing our exposure to more attractive end markets such as public utility through the fast-growing smart metering sector. In the last 2 quarters, Sensus delivered top line growth of more than 10%. This gives us even greater confidence in the 6% to 7% compounded revenue growth rate that we projected through 2020 when we announced the deal back in August.
With 2 months remaining in the calendar year, we expect Sensus to add about $0.01 to our full year adjusted EPS. In 2017, their contribution is expected to increase our earnings by at least 5% or approximately $0.10 to $0.12 of earnings per share.
We are still early in the process of evaluating the full range of possible synergies but we remain confident in our ability to deliver cost savings of at least $50 million and revenue synergies in excess of $100 million by 2020, which we communicated when we announced the deal.
With Visenti, we have a business that is highly complementary to both Xylem and Sensus' offerings. In fact, the company was in Sensus' own acquisition pipeline. Visenti operates in a $2 billion market of asset management solutions, which is growing in the high single-digit rate. One of the specific challenges that Visenti's technical solutions address is what's known as non-revenue water. This term refers to treated drinking water that is lost through leaks, theft or other causes. Globally, roughly 30% of treated drinking water is lost every year. Said another way, for a public utility that is 30% of their product just dripping away. As utilities and communities focus their resources on improving the resiliency of their infrastructure, this is an urgent and solvable challenge that we are now well positioned to help them address.
Furthermore, the addition of Visenti's highly expert data scientists, along with Sensus' capabilities in this area, will further accelerate our overall R&D work across Xylem in the area of systems intelligence. This is yet another compelling demonstration of how M&A can serve as a proxy for R&D. This was an attractive deal at $8 million plus earn-out opportunities. Given its relative size, we currently expect it to be neutral to both 2016 and 2017 results.
Now I'll turn it over to Mark for more details in the quarter, and then I'll come back to our final outlook for the year."

We generated 1 point of growth from acquisitions, which was offset by currency impacts.

We generated 1 point of growth from acquisitions, which was offset by currency impacts. We had another quarter of strong growth in public utilities, which helped mitigate increasing softness in the industrial end markets. 
Looking at our end markets in more detail. The outstanding growth we have seen in public utility continued for the fifth consecutive quarter.  Globally, we grew at 10% in this sector during the third quarter, reflecting our leadership position and ongoing strong execution in which we are capturing share and delivering value to our customers.  Revenues also grew 2% in both commercial and residential building services in the quarter.
Offsetting the growth in these end markets was a 7% decline in our industrial markets, including softer-than-expected revenues in our dewatering and Analytics businesses. I'll cover these challenges further in my overview of our segment performance.
Regionally, Western Europe grew 3% in the third quarter with modest growth across most of our businesses and end markets. The U.S. market was up 1%, as strong performance in public utilities was largely offset by weakness in the industrial markets. Our emerging market results were mixed. Overall, we saw a 4% decline in the quarter, which included a tough prior year comparison of 9% growth.
Our Middle East business declined 28% during the quarter, reflecting both the timing of large prior year project deliveries as well as a further slowdown in the region. China was down 4% year-over-year and in line with our expectations. We're encouraged by the quarter's sequential improvement in revenues and orders as well as positive year-over-year growth in our Water Infrastructure segment, reflecting what we believe is a slow but steady recovery in this market. 
India was a bright spot, delivering strong growth, up 67%, driven primarily by our continued execution on the large custom pump project that Patrick mentioned. 
Shifting gears, our teams did an outstanding job expanding operating margin by 90 basis points to 14.6%. Our initiatives around continuous improvement and business simplification continue to create significant value for the company.
In the quarter, global procurement, Lean and Six Sigma activities and restructuring savings reduced our cost by $35 million, resulting in 390 basis points of margin improvement. This included $4 million in savings from the restructuring actions we executed earlier this year. These savings more than offset 180 basis points of cost inflation and funded 90 basis points of strategic investments. Given the ongoing weak demand we're facing in the industrial end market, we're accelerating actions to mitigate the near-term impact and position the business for further margin expansion as conditions improve.
Acquisitions negatively impacted operating margins by 20 basis points in the quarter, reflecting in part noncash monetization costs associated with purchase accounting.
Given the challenges we faced during the quarter in our industrial markets, very pleased with our team's performance in delivering adjusted earnings per share of $0.54, an increase of 10% year-over-year. Please turn to Slide 7, and I'll provide additional details on our reporting segments.
Water Infrastructure recorded orders of $604 million, up 2% organically year-over-year. This growth was primarily driven by the $13 million treatment order which Patrick highlighted earlier. It also includes the $37 million custom pump order in India, which offset a similar large project award last year. 
We exited the quarter with total backlog of $598 million, down approximately 5% year-over-year but improving quarter sequentially by 10%. It's worth noting that our treatment project funnel continues to grow, up 22% from this time last year.  This trend gives us confidence that the municipal market will remain a source of growth for the foreseeable future. 
Revenues of $554 million represent a 1% increase year-over-year on an organic basis.
Acquisitions added an additional $8 million to the top line while foreign exchange was a $14 million headwind. 
In the U.S., the segment grew 6% overall. Our public utility business grew 25%, surpassing a very strong first half growth rate of 22%. This growth was partially offset by significant challenges in our dewatering business, including double-digit declines directly tied to the oil and gas market and a 15% reduction in equipment sales to distributors for reducing their investments in fleet inventory.
Western Europe grew 2% overall, driven by another solid quarter in the U.K. where our teams drove 14% growth, capturing opportunities as we continue through the AMP6 cycle. This growth was partially offset by the lapping of project deliveries across Europe as well as lower public utility demand in France.
Emerging markets declined by 6% overall, driven by substantial slowing in the Middle East and Latin American markets. These challenges were partially offset by a significant positive contribution from India, with revenues up more than 80%. And China returned to growth in the quarter, posting a 3% increase, a positive trend that we expect will continue.
The prolonged decline in oil and gas prices is significantly impacting the level of government and industrial spend in the Middle East, where revenues for the segment were down 42%. 
Revenues in Latin America were down 16% in the quarter, reflecting the lapping of prior year projects in our dewatering and Analytics businesses, and to a lesser extent, still challenging market conditions in the mining sector. 
Operating margin increased 50 basis points to 15.9% as productivity initiatives offset cost inflation and unfavorable mix as well as funding increased strategic growth investments.
Our productivity programs drove 380 basis points of margin expansion, reflecting a 100 basis point quarter sequential acceleration in year-over-year savings from these actions. 
Inflation was a 180 basis point headwind, and we had 70 basis points of unfavorable mix, largely driven by the declines in our higher-margin dewatering and analytics products. Acquisitions were also a 40 basis point drag on margin in the quarter. 
Applied Water booked orders of $342 million in the quarter, flat organically over the prior year. This segment entered the fourth quarter with total backlog of $177 million, most of which is expected to ship in the fourth quarter. Revenues were $343 million, down 1% organically versus the prior year. In Western Europe, revenue increased 4% with strong growth in the commercial building services and residential markets. Here, we continue to benefit from energy-efficient product launches and our enhanced regional sales capabilities. 
Segment revenue was up 1% in our emerging markets, primarily due to 7% growth in Latin America, which more than offset sales declines in the Middle East.
In the U.S., revenues were down 4% in the quarter. This was primarily driven by the segment's industrial revenues, which declined 9%, primarily reflecting continued weakness in oil and gas, and to a lesser extent, light industrial, attributable to lower O&M demand in food and beverage and decreased stocking levels by marine distributors.
Delays in the release of projects in the U.S. commercial building sector drove lower year-over-year revenues but were partially offset by growth in residential groundwater applications. Segment operating margin increased 180 basis points to 15.5% year-over-year.
Cost reductions drove an impressive 410 basis point margin improvement, representing a 30 basis point quarter sequential acceleration in year-over-year cost savings. This more than offset 170 basis points of cost inflation and 90 basis points from strategic growth investments, which included the localization of product assembly in the Middle East.
Now let's turn to Slide 9 to cover the company's cash flow and financial position. We closed the quarter with a cash balance of $659 million. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, and in connection with the Sensus and Visenti acquisitions, we utilized approximately $400 million of European cash to close these transactions. We also issued $900 million of long-term U.S. notes, which were split into 2 tranches. The first tranche was for $500 million with a 10-year maturity and a 3 1/4% interest rate. The second tranche was for $400 million, a 30-year maturity and a 4.375% interest rate. As Patrick indicated, we were 10x oversubscribed, reflecting investor support for the deal and our company's strong financial profile. To complete the deal financing, we placed $200 million of short-term European debt and $200 million of commercial paper, which we expect to repay over the next 12 to 18 months.
Lastly, I'd like to highlight that we continue to maintain our investment-grade credit rating, which will require that we focus our capital deployment on debt repayment over the next 12 to 18 months.
Now back to a few more cash items for the quarter. During the third quarter, we invested $28 million for capital expenditures and also returned $28 million to our shareholders through dividends. Free cash flow in the quarter was $121 million, a 4% increase from the prior year. Free cash flow conversion was 166% in the quarter, and we expect to deliver at least 100% cash conversion this year.
We also improved working capital as a percentage of revenue by 40 basis points in the quarter, excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign exchange. 
Now please turn to Slide 10, and Patrick will cover the update to our 2016 outlook."
118218449,321421504,1068643,"Xylem Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2016",2016-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Xylem Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mark. We're updating our full year revenue guidance and now expect to generate revenue of approximately $3.8 billion for the full year. This reflects a few changes. First, we are lowering our full year organic growth expectation from what was prev",629,"Thanks, Mark. We're updating our full year revenue guidance and now expect to generate revenue of approximately $3.8 billion for the full year. This reflects a few changes. First, we are lowering our full year organic growth expectation from what was previously a 2% to 3% range to 1.5% to reflect both our third quarter performance and changes to certain end market assumptions, which I'll cover in more detail in the next slide. This reduction includes nearly a full point decline due to weaker conditions in the Middle East. 
Secondly, we are updating our top line guidance to reflect greater-than-expected foreign exchange headwind. Lastly, we are incorporating the expected contribution from the Sensus acquisition. This includes $140 million revenue that we expect this business to generate in November and December. 
Along with the transactions we announced early this year, we now expect acquisitions to add approximately 5% of revenue growth to our full year 2016 performance.
Following another quarter of strong execution and productivity delivered by our team and anticipated contributions in the fourth quarter, we are forecasting full year operating margin of 13.4%, including 50 basis points of dilution attributable to acquisitions. Excluding the acquisition dilution, our operating margin is expected to increase 100 basis points over the prior year.
As I mentioned earlier, we are maintaining our previous EPS midpoint of $2.03, while narrowing our EPS guidance range of $2.02 to $2.04. Our new guidance reflects the net impact of the Sensus acquisition offset by $0.01 of unfavorable foreign exchange translation, in addition to other volume and cost-savings adjustments. Mark will provide more color on these impacts in a few minutes. 
Now please turn to Slide 11, and I'll walk you through the update to our end market assumptions for 2016.
Beginning with public utility at 33% total revenue before the impact of Sensus is added to the portfolio. Over the first 3 quarters, we generated very strong organic revenue growth, up 12% year-over-year. Looking ahead, we expect growth to moderate, particularly as we lap our very strong fourth quarter performance of last year when we grew 8%. We expect continued momentum in this market to generate a mid- to high single-digit increase in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
As a result of our performance to date and fourth quarter expectations, we now anticipate public utility growth in the high single to low double-digit range, which is higher than our previous guidance. Our industrial end market, which represents 44% of total revenues, full year organic revenue is expected to be down mid-single digits, weaker than we previously anticipated. We now expect declines in the oil and gas sector to continue at least into next year.
Moving to commercial. After first half growth of 3%, we delivered a 2% increase in the third quarter. Our teams continue to see relatively healthy levels of design and quoting activity, which could provide for some incremental growth in 2017. However, in the immediate term, based on actual order input rates, we believe that growth will remain in the flat to low single-digit range. Now this global outlook includes some geographic differences. For example, we expect a more stable growth environment in the U.S. institutional market and continued growth across most European geographies. China should benefit from the lapping of lower prior year comparisons. The Middle East, however, is expected to face more challenging market conditions. 
In residential, we now project full year revenue to be down low single digits. Agriculture will likely be down mid-single digits. Now while these sectors experienced challenging market conditions in the first half of the year, we did see some slight improvement in the third quarter. 
Now please turn to Slide 12, and Mark will walk you through more of the details on the outlook. Mark?"
118218449,321421504,1068643,"Xylem Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2016",2016-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Xylem Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Patrick. Before I cover the outlook, I'd like to spend a couple of minutes highlighting the benefits of our continuous improvement and business simplification programs, including the improvements we're making to the experience our customers and ch",749,"Thanks, Patrick. Before I cover the outlook, I'd like to spend a couple of minutes highlighting the benefits of our continuous improvement and business simplification programs, including the improvements we're making to the experience our customers and channel partners have when doing business with Xylem.
Our ability to operate our business in a more aligned fashion, with improved processes and by leveraging our global scale, is a significant opportunity for us at Xylem. For example, our centralized global procurement organization was formed less than 2 years ago and today is delivering savings and improved supplier quality and terms at a significantly higher level of performance. After posting record savings of $64 million last year, the team is well on its way to delivering $80 million in 2016, representing a 25% year-over-year improvement. 
Procurement savings have provided 200 basis points of operating margin expansion over the first 3 quarters and are expected to drive nearly 260 basis points in the fourth quarter of this year. 
Lean and Six Sigma are also gaining traction this year as we build more capability throughout the organization. This will be a significant value creation tool for years to come. As for this year, we anticipate completing more than 100 Kaizen events, which will provide approximately $35 million in full year savings. 
We anticipate an acceleration in savings from these activities as we close out the year, given the increased velocity of our Kaizen events as well as the leverage from higher fourth quarter volumes.  Beyond cost savings, this program is meaningfully improving the speed and service performance with our customers. For example, year-to-date, our on-time delivery has improved by 400 basis points while also enabling us to reduce customer lead times.
We also expect to see an increase in cost savings attributable to our business simplification activities. 
During the third quarter, we realized $4 million in restructuring cost savings, bringing our year-to-date total to $9 million. As a result of recent actions, we now anticipate $7 million of cost savings in the fourth quarter, nearly double the benefit from the programs executed earlier this year. These actions will help us mitigate some of the nearer-term demand weakness we are anticipating in our industrial markets and will provide additional run rate benefits in 2017. 
In summary, our focus on continuous improvement and business simplification has provided substantial benefits to date. These actions will enable us to continue to deliver margin expansion while also positioning us more competitively with our customers.
Please turn to Slide 13. As shown on this slide, we're maintaining the midpoint of our full year EPS guidance at $2.03 per share, while narrowing the range to $2.02 to $2.04 per share. While there was no change to the midpoint of our full year guidance, there are a number of factors which will be impacting our 4Q. Relative to prior guidance, we are reflecting the net impact of our revised revenue outlook, including $0.01 unfavorable impact from recent foreign exchange fluctuations. 
At the operating margin level, we expect higher productivity gains and incremental cost savings to provide 30 basis points of margin expansion and $0.05 of EPS benefit. We expect Sensus revenues to be $140 million for the 2 months ending December 31. We also expect Sensus operating income to be $0.04 accretive to fourth quarter earnings, including our preliminary estimate of $0.03 of noncash amortization cost for intangibles, which has a dilutive impact on Xylem's overall operating margins. We will provide an update to the expected impact from noncash intangible amortization on our next call after we complete the initial purchase price valuation for the opening balance sheet.
Finally, fourth quarter interest expense will increase $8 million or $0.03 per share, reflecting higher borrowings to fund the acquisition. 
Please turn to Slide 14, where I'll briefly summarize our key fourth quarter assumptions. Organic revenue growth is expected to be flat to up 1% for the fourth quarter, with Water Infrastructure anticipated to grow in the range of 1% to 2% and Applied Water expected to be flat to down 1%. As I mentioned, Sensus is expected to add approximately $140 million of revenues in the quarter. 
Operating margin is expected to range between 14.6% and 14.9%, including 130 basis points of dilution from this year's acquisitions, which is primarily due to noncash amortization of intangibles. And earnings are expected to range between $0.65 and $0.67 per share.
With that, I'll hand the call back over to Patrick for some closing comments. Patrick?"

This is a fairly short cycle business for us in dewatering and so it's kind of hand to mouth in terms of what rental rates are, et cetera. What we really saw in the quarter that was a bit more of a surprise for us was the pullback by our distributors in terms of them buying pumps from us, so cutting back on their capital spend. And speaking to them, trying to get a feel for how much of that is a near-term blip versus a new baseline and it's very difficult for them to get a read right now on the markets themselves. So we're saying it carries through 2017 but that's our best guess at this stage. But I would say there's nothing unique about our position in the space relative to others."

Now those investments in R&D will not be as steep as they were before because of the acquisition of Sensus. And we'll be leveraging their capabilities and investing a bit more in that area. But it was 300 or 400 basis points. And I'm pleased to say, Deane, that we're guiding for the full year.

They've got a number of other customers in other geographies, and quite frankly, have more requests for their services than they have the resources to do right now, which is really part of the backdrop for our partnership and acquisition of them. But there, they've got a couple of different software development capabilities that are able to, not only gather the data from inside the pipe using ultrasound techniques and other opportunities, but it's also their data science and data analytics capabilities as they model that data that's coming back. And their ability to do that 24/7, irrespective of what the weather is, is another opportunity that they leverage. They are unique and we do believe that there's an opportunity here to take this well beyond some of the emerging markets. We're actually going to plan. It's a good time for me to say we're actually going to be planning to do an Investor Day, Deane, in very early Q2, down in Raleigh-Durham, and we will be sure to have the team from Visenti there as well to be able to showcase that technology along with what we're getting here with Sensus."

So I think one of the drivers is that we are getting better visibility into the market as to the project funnel and pipeline, and we're improving our win rates. And part of that is, I think, the impact of us being able to leverage this integration of our commercial teams, looking across the entire public utility offering. So a lot of that lead generation is helping us in a number of geographies across the board. Secondly, I think as we mentioned before, given our substantial market share leadership position in that space, we stand to benefit disproportionately in a rising tide environment. And so we get a lot more looks, I think, than many of our competitors do and that's really driven as much by our large installed base. And so as the munis are reinvesting in refurbishment of their existing infrastructure, it's highly unusual that they would swap out or switch out an entire pump network, and so we get the disproportionate benefit of that replacement work. And the same on the aftermarket service repair side. We've seen continued record levels of break-and-fix business, especially here in North America, that continues to benefit us.

And of course, what happened in Middle East so suddenly in Saudi was the second surprise for us. And those 2 together caused us well more than 1 point of organic revenue growth in the quarter, which is where we missed. So yes, there certainly are idled assets that are there that oil and gas customers are using as well as mining. But it's also the impact, Nathan, of again just a mothballing and idling of either mines and/or fracking sites. And so those 2 things together were the impact. But what we really saw in the quarter was our indirect channel, the distributors pulling back on their CapEx spend, so dramatically down 15% in the quarter. That caught us a bit by surprise as well and we're trying to model that into our Q4 outlook and just trying to get a feel for what that might look like for '17. This might be a good opportunity to that point, Nathan, for me to perhaps share a little bit of the framework of how we're thinking about 2017. And if I start with the end markets, based on what we see today, we expect these mixed market conditions to continue into 2017. And again, that includes a really robust public utility sector but it will be against some tougher comparisons, given what our full year growth is this year. But we would still consider that to be very, very attractive. We would also expect a sluggish environment to continue in industrial, for the reasons that I just articulated here. Perhaps that's conservative, but we're trying to be conservative here. I'd say, at this point, it would be hard to see organic growth for our historical Xylem businesses, i.e. x Sensus beyond low single digits, but we're obviously going to learn a lot more as we get through Q4. We're going to be watching order trends closely, particularly in the Middle East and industrial. We're clearly taking actions to manage costs as we've done throughout this year, but I'd probably wrap up the '17 with what we do know. We know that we're going to get significant contributions to revenue from Sensus, which, given its recent performance, should itself grow at least 6% to 7%, which is in line with the long-term CAGR that we laid out back in August when we announced the deal. What we also know is that the bottom line, we expect to get $0.10 to $0.12 of EPS accretion from Sensus. Now that's net of purchase accounting impacts. And then lastly, we expect our margin expansion pace to continue. Again, if you exclude the noncash acquisition impacts from the purchase accounting and you think about procurement, Lean Six Sigma and business simplification benefits, so we expect that margin expansion rate and pace to continue. And we also know that we're going to get $0.07 to $0.08 of carryover savings from restructuring that we've already taken this year that will flow into next year. So hopefully, to those listening, that gives you a little bit of a framework for how we're at least thinking initially about '17."

So we expected some of that. The real impact for us in the quarter, and I was just over there for our grand opening of our manufacturing facility and met with a number of our channel partners as well as with some customers in Saudi. And for those of you that are following the news there, you know that they're going through some serious budget constraints right now. And the common theme across pretty much all sectors is a common kind of down 20%, 30% in the quarter. I'm not sure what the kind of symmetry is there between that and what we saw. But for example, if the Saudi government just about a month ago announced that they are doing an across-the-board 20% reduction in all government employees' salary immediately, and that's being driven by some of their funding constraints. And so we saw that pull back in the quarter. We're being told that it will come back and that it's temporary. But right now, until we see an improvement in our order book there over the course of fourth quarter, we're trying to take a prudent view here on what kind of a drag that might have on our overall industrial growth."

But I would say, as we mentioned back in the call in August, we're very confident that we're going to get at least $50 million in cost synergies. And as I said in the last call, I'd be disappointed if we didn't have more than $100 million of revenue synergies over that time frame as well through 2020. The areas that are really the biggest opportunity for us on the cost side, big opportunities in the areas of procurement. And so whether it be overlapping in supplier base but also just using some of the tools that we put to use here at Xylem the last couple of years, we expect the same kind of progress and momentum to be there on a combined spend base with Sensus. There are also areas of opportunity in some of our back-office functions and G&A support functions on a global scale. On the revenue side, it really is going to be focused, I would say, if anything, in our synergy planning teams. I don't want to sound like the happy talking CEO here, but there were more revenue synergy opportunities than you could shake a stick at. The key was that they're longer lead time, some of them. They're going to require R&D and engineering support from Sensus. And so we're going to make sure that we're disciplined and balanced on how we think about those things. But they are really predominantly, Chip, in areas such as, one, we got a number of customers today in common where they already own Sensus' FlexNet and data analytics solutions but they're only applied today to the clean water side of the network and we have opportunities to now connect our devices on the wastewater side to be able to provide similar solutions to the customer for their challenges on wastewater. Second is they've got a number of big international projects that are out there that they're bidding on that, in some cases, are with customers that are already customers of ours today that we, hopefully, are going to be able to help them leverage in some way. And third, we think there's opportunities to also lever their data analytics capabilities across multiple parts of the Xylem portfolio to bring in some of that Software-as-a-Service opportunity across our existing business. So these are longer lead times but we are very excited, both Xylem and Sensus, about the opportunity here."

Thanks for joining us to discuss our third quarter performance. Today marks a significant new chapter for Xylem.

Thanks for joining us to discuss our third quarter performance. Today marks a significant new chapter for Xylem. Yesterday, October 31, was the fifth anniversary of Xylem's spinning out of ITT and embarking on its journey as a new company. We've evolved since that day and made substantial progress, creating significant value for our shareholders. So today, on the first day of our sixth year, we began as a larger, stronger and more focused enterprise. We have a clear long-term strategy that we laid out last year at Investor Day, one of which is Xylem becomes the definitive market leader and a leading provider of advanced technologies and integrated solutions across the water sector to drive long-term growth, margin expansion and value creation.
We know where we want to take this company and we're making meaningful progress in executing those plans. I'm pleased with what our team has accomplished but I know we're still in the early innings. This morning, we announced we have successfully completed our acquisition of Sensus, a global leader in smart meters, network technologies and advanced data analytics. As I explained in August, this business is squarely aligned with our strategy of becoming a leading provider of systems-intelligent solutions to our customers, which we laid out at our Investor Day last year.
Their portfolio includes the type of advanced technologies that are fueling the transition of the water sector to smart infrastructure. The transaction closing process was smooth with no unexpected hurdles in the various regulatory reviews. Our highly successful debt offering, it was 10x oversubscribed, was a sign of great confidence in Xylem and in this transaction. Our teams did a great job all around in bringing this deal to a prompt close. Now we're focused on accelerating the integration process so we can realize the full value of this combination. I'll come back to the integration in a few moments. 
We had another announcement today and I'm speaking of our acquisition of Visenti, which we completed in October as well. Visenti, based in Singapore, has developed a suite of products and services that focus on increasing the productivity of water distribution networks. They primarily target the perennial challenge of leak detection, pressure management and water quality monitoring in the distribution network. While small, this company's solutions are complementary to both the Xylem and Sensus portfolio. We know them well. We entered into a strategic partnership in 2012, at the request of the Singapore Public Utility Board. The Public Utilities Board, which is widely recognized as the definitive thought leader in the water space, asked us to partner with them to pilot a comprehensive solution to monitor the drinking water network throughout Singapore, which was highly successful. Now that they are part of Xylem, with the global support and infrastructure we bring to the table, we will help them scale their business. I'll have more comments on the Visenti business in a few moments as well.
Now let's review our third quarter results. Our teams, once again, delivered a solid performance in a very mixed economic environment. While organic revenue was flat year-over-year, strong execution and accelerated productivity initiatives helped drive 90 basis points of margin expansion and 10% earnings growth. Orders in the quarter increased 1% year-over-year and were up 2% sequentially, boosted by some large new orders in emerging markets. Overall, we had expected the oil and gas sector trajectory to begin to level off, but to our disappointment, the declines continued and we now expect that trend to extend at least into next year. This continues to impact our dewatering business as well as portions of our Analytics portfolio. This prolonged weakness is having a disproportionate impact on regions that are highly dependent on commodities as a source of funding for other industries, such as the Middle East. We saw this play out in our results this quarter as the major project work there dropped off significantly.
On the positive side, the opening of our new factory in Dubai last month will enable us to be a more active participant in the book-and-bill business because we now can meet the quick lead times required by customers.
Let me address some other market conditions. We are operating in certain end markets that are experiencing growth. Public utilities is our best example at the moment and we are aggressively going after the business and in many regions, capturing share. And with the addition of Sensus, we are increasing our exposure to this sector with a broader portfolio of solutions and enhancing our leadership position in one of the faster-growing, higher-margin areas of the industry. 
In the quarter, we delivered 10% growth in the global public utility sector and that momentum is continuing. The U.S. continues to be the hottest market in the space, and there, we generated a 25% increase over last year's performance of 7% growth. This growth reflects the realization of pent-up demand in this space, but I also want to acknowledge the tremendous effort of our teams. They are taking nothing for granted and that is evident in their performance in capturing share. 
The industrial segment, which represents our largest end market, is a different story. This sector continues to be a challenge and we are closely monitoring a mixed macro environment. We realize that we cannot control market conditions, however, we are taking steps to mitigate some of the impact.  We're evaluating conditions by subsector and by region so we can optimize our cost basis and ensure that we are well positioned when market conditions begin to improve.
Moving to our emerging markets. Overall, our revenue was down 4% in the quarter, driven primarily by decline in the Middle East. One of the bright spots was China, where we generated growth in our infrastructure business. Additionally, our team is building backlog there, with sequential improvement of 19%, primarily in the Water Infrastructure business. They delivered a significant win in the quarter of $13 million for our Wedeco ozone systems that will be used in 2 pulp and paper plants. This will be the first ozone bleaching application in this sector in China and opens the door to new potential business with a far more environmentally friendly and sustainable solution than was previously used. This is driven in part by China's increasing regulations for more sustainable practices and industrial operations. Another noteworthy region is India. There, we continued to deliver on the $39 million custom pump job that we won last year in the third quarter. This installation will be used for the world's largest lift irrigation system, which will bring water to farms, serving thousands of rural villages. As we noted when we announced the win, this major project is providing a sound foundation for other similar projects in power and irrigation.
This past quarter, we won a $37 million contract for a pumping station that will be part of a $1 billion mega lift irrigation project in the Telangana region in Southern India. This project will ship substantially over the course of 2017. Once again, this success was the result of strong collaboration between our local team in India and our Flygt custom pump team in the U.S. They customized the design to meet the customer's exact specifications and ensure that the complex solution can be sourced completely with local supply.
Now as we've done all year, our focus on cost controls and increasing productivity remain steadfast. In the third quarter, we delivered $35 million in gross cost reductions, which brings our year-to-date total to $87 million. Our global procurement group continues to lever Xylem's scale to deliver sustainable savings across multiple categories. These actions helped to mitigate some of the impact of the challenging market conditions we faced.
In keeping with our productivity for growth mindset, these savings also funded strategic investments for growth. Additionally, we are accelerating targeted restructuring actions that will deliver incremental savings in the fourth quarter and greater savings in 2017. These results position us well to easily surpass our full year goal for cost savings and productivity improvements.
Finally, at the bottom line, we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $0.54 in the quarter, a 10% increase over last year's result.
We also generated $121 million in free cash flow, resulting in a 166% conversion rate. Now please turn to Slide 5, and I'll update you on the status of our acquisition integration.
We're thrilled to now have Sensus as part of a larger Xylem. Sensus is a complementary partner that significantly broadens our offerings with the type of systems-intelligent solutions that move our portfolio up the technology curve. This instantly increases the value we can bring to customers with solutions that target some of their most urgent challenges. The need to increase energy efficiency, improve life cycle costs and extract actionable insights from data to optimize their operations, these are all high on the priority list of customer needs that we are now better equipped to meet.
Together, we will strengthen our industry leadership position, particularly as we expand into new markets, leveraging Xylem's global reach and the strong customer relationships cultivated by both companies. With the deal closed, we are focused on executing our integration smoothly and efficiently so we can realize the full value of the combinations. Our teams have already been collaborating for several weeks and now that work will accelerate.
Today, Sensus will operate as an independent business unit and will be reported as a new segment. Randy Bays, who's been serving as President of Sensus, will continue to lead the business reporting to me. We will be thoughtful and deliberate as we enable greater collaboration across our sales teams, ensuring that we capture new opportunities while not disrupting the existing business. 
On the R&D side, our teams will immediately collaborate to identify areas where work can be combined or aligned to accelerate progress and fuel the substantial revenue synergies we expect to deliver. The Sensus business is increasing our exposure to more attractive end markets such as public utility through the fast-growing smart metering sector. In the last 2 quarters, Sensus delivered top line growth of more than 10%. This gives us even greater confidence in the 6% to 7% compounded revenue growth rate that we projected through 2020 when we announced the deal back in August.
With 2 months remaining in the calendar year, we expect Sensus to add about $0.01 to our full year adjusted EPS. In 2017, their contribution is expected to increase our earnings by at least 5% or approximately $0.10 to $0.12 of earnings per share.
We are still early in the process of evaluating the full range of possible synergies but we remain confident in our ability to deliver cost savings of at least $50 million and revenue synergies in excess of $100 million by 2020, which we communicated when we announced the deal.
With Visenti, we have a business that is highly complementary to both Xylem and Sensus' offerings. In fact, the company was in Sensus' own acquisition pipeline. Visenti operates in a $2 billion market of asset management solutions, which is growing in the high single-digit rate. One of the specific challenges that Visenti's technical solutions address is what's known as non-revenue water. This term refers to treated drinking water that is lost through leaks, theft or other causes. Globally, roughly 30% of treated drinking water is lost every year. Said another way, for a public utility that is 30% of their product just dripping away. As utilities and communities focus their resources on improving the resiliency of their infrastructure, this is an urgent and solvable challenge that we are now well positioned to help them address.
Furthermore, the addition of Visenti's highly expert data scientists, along with Sensus' capabilities in this area, will further accelerate our overall R&D work across Xylem in the area of systems intelligence. This is yet another compelling demonstration of how M&A can serve as a proxy for R&D. This was an attractive deal at $8 million plus earn-out opportunities. Given its relative size, we currently expect it to be neutral to both 2016 and 2017 results.
Now I'll turn it over to Mark for more details in the quarter, and then I'll come back to our final outlook for the year."

We generated 1 point of growth from acquisitions, which was offset by currency impacts.

We generated 1 point of growth from acquisitions, which was offset by currency impacts. We had another quarter of strong growth in public utilities, which helped mitigate increasing softness in the industrial end markets. 
Looking at our end markets in more detail. The outstanding growth we have seen in public utility continued for the fifth consecutive quarter.  Globally, we grew at 10% in this sector during the third quarter, reflecting our leadership position and ongoing strong execution in which we are capturing share and delivering value to our customers.  Revenues also grew 2% in both commercial and residential building services in the quarter.
Offsetting the growth in these end markets was a 7% decline in our industrial markets, including softer-than-expected revenues in our dewatering and Analytics businesses. I'll cover these challenges further in my overview of our segment performance.
Regionally, Western Europe grew 3% in the third quarter with modest growth across most of our businesses and end markets. The U.S. market was up 1%, as strong performance in public utilities was largely offset by weakness in the industrial markets. Our emerging market results were mixed. Overall, we saw a 4% decline in the quarter, which included a tough prior year comparison of 9% growth.
Our Middle East business declined 28% during the quarter, reflecting both the timing of large prior year project deliveries as well as a further slowdown in the region. China was down 4% year-over-year and in line with our expectations. We're encouraged by the quarter's sequential improvement in revenues and orders as well as positive year-over-year growth in our Water Infrastructure segment, reflecting what we believe is a slow but steady recovery in this market. 
India was a bright spot, delivering strong growth, up 67%, driven primarily by our continued execution on the large custom pump project that Patrick mentioned. 
Shifting gears, our teams did an outstanding job expanding operating margin by 90 basis points to 14.6%. Our initiatives around continuous improvement and business simplification continue to create significant value for the company.
In the quarter, global procurement, Lean and Six Sigma activities and restructuring savings reduced our cost by $35 million, resulting in 390 basis points of margin improvement. This included $4 million in savings from the restructuring actions we executed earlier this year. These savings more than offset 180 basis points of cost inflation and funded 90 basis points of strategic investments. Given the ongoing weak demand we're facing in the industrial end market, we're accelerating actions to mitigate the near-term impact and position the business for further margin expansion as conditions improve.
Acquisitions negatively impacted operating margins by 20 basis points in the quarter, reflecting in part noncash monetization costs associated with purchase accounting.
Given the challenges we faced during the quarter in our industrial markets, very pleased with our team's performance in delivering adjusted earnings per share of $0.54, an increase of 10% year-over-year. Please turn to Slide 7, and I'll provide additional details on our reporting segments.
Water Infrastructure recorded orders of $604 million, up 2% organically year-over-year. This growth was primarily driven by the $13 million treatment order which Patrick highlighted earlier. It also includes the $37 million custom pump order in India, which offset a similar large project award last year. 
We exited the quarter with total backlog of $598 million, down approximately 5% year-over-year but improving quarter sequentially by 10%. It's worth noting that our treatment project funnel continues to grow, up 22% from this time last year.  This trend gives us confidence that the municipal market will remain a source of growth for the foreseeable future. 
Revenues of $554 million represent a 1% increase year-over-year on an organic basis.
Acquisitions added an additional $8 million to the top line while foreign exchange was a $14 million headwind. 
In the U.S., the segment grew 6% overall. Our public utility business grew 25%, surpassing a very strong first half growth rate of 22%. This growth was partially offset by significant challenges in our dewatering business, including double-digit declines directly tied to the oil and gas market and a 15% reduction in equipment sales to distributors for reducing their investments in fleet inventory.
Western Europe grew 2% overall, driven by another solid quarter in the U.K. where our teams drove 14% growth, capturing opportunities as we continue through the AMP6 cycle. This growth was partially offset by the lapping of project deliveries across Europe as well as lower public utility demand in France.
Emerging markets declined by 6% overall, driven by substantial slowing in the Middle East and Latin American markets. These challenges were partially offset by a significant positive contribution from India, with revenues up more than 80%. And China returned to growth in the quarter, posting a 3% increase, a positive trend that we expect will continue.
The prolonged decline in oil and gas prices is significantly impacting the level of government and industrial spend in the Middle East, where revenues for the segment were down 42%. 
Revenues in Latin America were down 16% in the quarter, reflecting the lapping of prior year projects in our dewatering and Analytics businesses, and to a lesser extent, still challenging market conditions in the mining sector. 
Operating margin increased 50 basis points to 15.9% as productivity initiatives offset cost inflation and unfavorable mix as well as funding increased strategic growth investments.
Our productivity programs drove 380 basis points of margin expansion, reflecting a 100 basis point quarter sequential acceleration in year-over-year savings from these actions. 
Inflation was a 180 basis point headwind, and we had 70 basis points of unfavorable mix, largely driven by the declines in our higher-margin dewatering and analytics products. Acquisitions were also a 40 basis point drag on margin in the quarter. 
Applied Water booked orders of $342 million in the quarter, flat organically over the prior year. This segment entered the fourth quarter with total backlog of $177 million, most of which is expected to ship in the fourth quarter. Revenues were $343 million, down 1% organically versus the prior year. In Western Europe, revenue increased 4% with strong growth in the commercial building services and residential markets. Here, we continue to benefit from energy-efficient product launches and our enhanced regional sales capabilities. 
Segment revenue was up 1% in our emerging markets, primarily due to 7% growth in Latin America, which more than offset sales declines in the Middle East.
In the U.S., revenues were down 4% in the quarter. This was primarily driven by the segment's industrial revenues, which declined 9%, primarily reflecting continued weakness in oil and gas, and to a lesser extent, light industrial, attributable to lower O&M demand in food and beverage and decreased stocking levels by marine distributors.
Delays in the release of projects in the U.S. commercial building sector drove lower year-over-year revenues but were partially offset by growth in residential groundwater applications. Segment operating margin increased 180 basis points to 15.5% year-over-year.
Cost reductions drove an impressive 410 basis point margin improvement, representing a 30 basis point quarter sequential acceleration in year-over-year cost savings. This more than offset 170 basis points of cost inflation and 90 basis points from strategic growth investments, which included the localization of product assembly in the Middle East.
Now let's turn to Slide 9 to cover the company's cash flow and financial position. We closed the quarter with a cash balance of $659 million. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, and in connection with the Sensus and Visenti acquisitions, we utilized approximately $400 million of European cash to close these transactions. We also issued $900 million of long-term U.S. notes, which were split into 2 tranches. The first tranche was for $500 million with a 10-year maturity and a 3 1/4% interest rate. The second tranche was for $400 million, a 30-year maturity and a 4.375% interest rate. As Patrick indicated, we were 10x oversubscribed, reflecting investor support for the deal and our company's strong financial profile. To complete the deal financing, we placed $200 million of short-term European debt and $200 million of commercial paper, which we expect to repay over the next 12 to 18 months.
Lastly, I'd like to highlight that we continue to maintain our investment-grade credit rating, which will require that we focus our capital deployment on debt repayment over the next 12 to 18 months.
Now back to a few more cash items for the quarter. During the third quarter, we invested $28 million for capital expenditures and also returned $28 million to our shareholders through dividends. Free cash flow in the quarter was $121 million, a 4% increase from the prior year. Free cash flow conversion was 166% in the quarter, and we expect to deliver at least 100% cash conversion this year.
We also improved working capital as a percentage of revenue by 40 basis points in the quarter, excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign exchange. 
Now please turn to Slide 10, and Patrick will cover the update to our 2016 outlook."

We're updating our full year revenue guidance and now expect to generate revenue of approximately $3.8 billion for the full year. This reflects a few changes. First, we are lowering our full year organic growth expectation from what was prev",629,"Thanks, Mark. We're updating our full year revenue guidance and now expect to generate revenue of approximately $3.8 billion for the full year. This reflects a few changes. First, we are lowering our full year organic growth expectation from what was previously a 2% to 3% range to 1.5% to reflect both our third quarter performance and changes to certain end market assumptions, which I'll cover in more detail in the next slide. This reduction includes nearly a full point decline due to weaker conditions in the Middle East. 
Secondly, we are updating our top line guidance to reflect greater-than-expected foreign exchange headwind. Lastly, we are incorporating the expected contribution from the Sensus acquisition. This includes $140 million revenue that we expect this business to generate in November and December. 
Along with the transactions we announced early this year, we now expect acquisitions to add approximately 5% of revenue growth to our full year 2016 performance.
Following another quarter of strong execution and productivity delivered by our team and anticipated contributions in the fourth quarter, we are forecasting full year operating margin of 13.4%, including 50 basis points of dilution attributable to acquisitions. Excluding the acquisition dilution, our operating margin is expected to increase 100 basis points over the prior year.
As I mentioned earlier, we are maintaining our previous EPS midpoint of $2.03, while narrowing our EPS guidance range of $2.02 to $2.04. Our new guidance reflects the net impact of the Sensus acquisition offset by $0.01 of unfavorable foreign exchange translation, in addition to other volume and cost-savings adjustments. Mark will provide more color on these impacts in a few minutes. 
Now please turn to Slide 11, and I'll walk you through the update to our end market assumptions for 2016.
Beginning with public utility at 33% total revenue before the impact of Sensus is added to the portfolio. Over the first 3 quarters, we generated very strong organic revenue growth, up 12% year-over-year. Looking ahead, we expect growth to moderate, particularly as we lap our very strong fourth quarter performance of last year when we grew 8%. We expect continued momentum in this market to generate a mid- to high single-digit increase in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
As a result of our performance to date and fourth quarter expectations, we now anticipate public utility growth in the high single to low double-digit range, which is higher than our previous guidance. Our industrial end market, which represents 44% of total revenues, full year organic revenue is expected to be down mid-single digits, weaker than we previously anticipated. We now expect declines in the oil and gas sector to continue at least into next year.
Moving to commercial. After first half growth of 3%, we delivered a 2% increase in the third quarter. Our teams continue to see relatively healthy levels of design and quoting activity, which could provide for some incremental growth in 2017. However, in the immediate term, based on actual order input rates, we believe that growth will remain in the flat to low single-digit range. Now this global outlook includes some geographic differences. For example, we expect a more stable growth environment in the U.S. institutional market and continued growth across most European geographies. China should benefit from the lapping of lower prior year comparisons. The Middle East, however, is expected to face more challenging market conditions. 
In residential, we now project full year revenue to be down low single digits. Agriculture will likely be down mid-single digits. Now while these sectors experienced challenging market conditions in the first half of the year, we did see some slight improvement in the third quarter. 
Now please turn to Slide 12, and Mark will walk you through more of the details on the outlook. Mark?"
118218449,321421504,1069188,"Xylem Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2016",2016-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Xylem Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Patrick. Before I cover the outlook, I'd like to spend a couple of minutes highlighting the benefits of our continuous improvement and business simplification programs, including the improvements we're making to the experience our customers and ch",749,"Thanks, Patrick. Before I cover the outlook, I'd like to spend a couple of minutes highlighting the benefits of our continuous improvement and business simplification programs, including the improvements we're making to the experience our customers and channel partners have when doing business with Xylem.
Our ability to operate our business in a more aligned fashion, with improved processes and by leveraging our global scale, is a significant opportunity for us at Xylem. For example, our centralized global procurement organization was formed less than 2 years ago and today is delivering savings and improved supplier quality and terms at a significantly higher level of performance. After posting record savings of $64 million last year, the team is well on its way to delivering $80 million in 2016, representing a 25% year-over-year improvement. 
Procurement savings have provided 200 basis points of operating margin expansion over the first 3 quarters and are expected to drive nearly 260 basis points in the fourth quarter of this year. 
Lean and Six Sigma are also gaining traction this year as we build more capability throughout the organization. This will be a significant value creation tool for years to come. As for this year, we anticipate completing more than 100 Kaizen events, which will provide approximately $35 million in full year savings. 
We anticipate an acceleration in savings from these activities as we close out the year, given the increased velocity of our Kaizen events as well as the leverage from higher fourth quarter volumes.  Beyond cost savings, this program is meaningfully improving the speed and service performance with our customers. For example, year-to-date, our on-time delivery has improved by 400 basis points while also enabling us to reduce customer lead times.
We also expect to see an increase in cost savings attributable to our business simplification activities. 
During the third quarter, we realized $4 million in restructuring cost savings, bringing our year-to-date total to $9 million. As a result of recent actions, we now anticipate $7 million of cost savings in the fourth quarter, nearly double the benefit from the programs executed earlier this year. These actions will help us mitigate some of the nearer-term demand weakness we are anticipating in our industrial markets and will provide additional run rate benefits in 2017. 
In summary, our focus on continuous improvement and business simplification has provided substantial benefits to date. These actions will enable us to continue to deliver margin expansion while also positioning us more competitively with our customers.
Please turn to Slide 13. As shown on this slide, we're maintaining the midpoint of our full year EPS guidance at $2.03 per share, while narrowing the range to $2.02 to $2.04 per share. While there was no change to the midpoint of our full year guidance, there are a number of factors which will be impacting our 4Q. Relative to prior guidance, we are reflecting the net impact of our revised revenue outlook, including $0.01 unfavorable impact from recent foreign exchange fluctuations. 
At the operating margin level, we expect higher productivity gains and incremental cost savings to provide 30 basis points of margin expansion and $0.05 of EPS benefit. We expect Sensus revenues to be $140 million for the 2 months ending December 31. We also expect Sensus operating income to be $0.04 accretive to fourth quarter earnings, including our preliminary estimate of $0.03 of noncash amortization cost for intangibles, which has a dilutive impact on Xylem's overall operating margins. We will provide an update to the expected impact from noncash intangible amortization on our next call after we complete the initial purchase price valuation for the opening balance sheet.
Finally, fourth quarter interest expense will increase $8 million or $0.03 per share, reflecting higher borrowings to fund the acquisition. 
Please turn to Slide 14, where I'll briefly summarize our key fourth quarter assumptions. Organic revenue growth is expected to be flat to up 1% for the fourth quarter, with Water Infrastructure anticipated to grow in the range of 1% to 2% and Applied Water expected to be flat to down 1%. As I mentioned, Sensus is expected to add approximately $140 million of revenues in the quarter. 
Operating margin is expected to range between 14.6% and 14.9%, including 130 basis points of dilution from this year's acquisitions, which is primarily due to noncash amortization of intangibles. And earnings are expected to range between $0.65 and $0.67 per share.
With that, I'll hand the call back over to Patrick for some closing comments. Patrick?"

And it was also very concentrated in North America, here in the U.S. So I'd say the U.S. industrial was the primary impact. And then we also had -- we had a reasonably large project that we shipped out to Brazil, a couple of million dollars last year.

And we'll talk about the framework for Sensus further and the timing around when we'll give kind of new 3- and 5-year outlooks for the company. But our base business of Xylem, excluding Sensus, we believe that there is 300 to 400 basis points of operating margin expansion, and that is net of potential increases in R&D investment. Now those investments in R&D will not be as steep as they were before because of the acquisition of Sensus. And we'll be leveraging their capabilities and investing a bit more in that area. But it was 300 to 400 basis points. And I'm pleased to say, Deane, that we're guiding for the full year. If you take out the impacts of the purchase accounting from acquisitions, we will have delivered right at 100 basis points of that margin expansion this year. So I feel we're well on our way here and still in the early stages of that productivity focus."

They've got a number of other customers in other geographies, and quite frankly, have more requests for their services than they have the resources to do right now, which is really part of the backdrop for our partnership and acquisition of them. But there, they've got a couple of different software development capabilities that are able to, not only gather the data from inside the pipe using ultrasound techniques and other opportunities, but it's also their data science and data analytics capabilities as they model that data that's coming back. And their ability to do that 24/7, irrespective of what the weather is, is another opportunity that they leverage. They are unique and we do believe that there's an opportunity here to take this well beyond some of the emerging markets. We're actually going to plan. It's a good time for me to say we're actually going to be planning to do an Investor Day, Deane, in very early Q2, down in Raleigh-Durham, and we will be sure to have the team from Visenti there as well to be able to showcase that technology along with what we're getting here with Sensus."

So I think one of the drivers is that we are getting better visibility into the market as to the project funnel and pipeline, and we're improving our win rates. And part of that is, I think, the impact of us being able to leverage this integration of our commercial teams, looking across the entire public utility offering. So a lot of that lead generation is helping us in a number of geographies across the board. Secondly, I think as we mentioned before, given our substantial market share leadership position in that space, we stand to benefit disproportionately in a rising tide environment. And so we get a lot more looks, I think, than many of our competitors do and that's really driven as much by our large installed base. And so as the munis are reinvesting in refurbishment of their existing infrastructure, it's highly unusual that they would swap out or switch out an entire pump network, and so we get the disproportionate benefit of that replacement work. And the same on the aftermarket service repair side. We've seen continued record levels of break-and-fix business, especially here in North America, that continues to benefit us. And then lastly, we're in the early stages of some really exciting new product rollouts. We launched a new product called Conservor [ph], which is really not in these numbers but gives us great confidence about market share capture as we head into 2017 as well."

And of course, what happened in Middle East so suddenly in Saudi was the second surprise for us. And those 2 together caused us well more than 1 point of organic revenue growth in the quarter, which is where we missed. So yes, there certainly are idled assets that are there that oil and gas customers are using as well as mining. But it's also the impact, Nathan, of again just a mothballing and idling of either mines and/or fracking sites. And so those 2 things together were the impact. But what we really saw in the quarter was our indirect channel, the distributors pulling back on their CapEx spend, so dramatically down 15% in the quarter. That caught us a bit by surprise as well and we're trying to model that into our Q4 outlook and just trying to get a feel for what that might look like for '17. This might be a good opportunity to that point, Nathan, for me to perhaps share a little bit of the framework of how we're thinking about 2017. And if I start with the end markets, based on what we see today, we expect these mixed market conditions to continue into 2017. And again, that includes a really robust public utility sector but it will be against some tougher comparisons, given what our full year growth is this year. But we would still consider that to be very, very attractive. We would also expect a sluggish environment to continue in industrial, for the reasons that I just articulated here. Perhaps that's conservative, but we're trying to be conservative here. I'd say, at this point, it would be hard to see organic growth for our historical Xylem businesses, i.e. x Sensus beyond low single digits, but we're obviously going to learn a lot more as we get through Q4. We're going to be watching order trends closely, particularly in the Middle East and industrial. We're clearly taking actions to manage costs as we've done throughout this year, but I'd probably wrap up the '17 with what we do know. We know that we're going to get significant contributions to revenue from Sensus, which, given its recent performance, should itself grow at least 6% to 7%, which is in line with the long-term CAGR that we laid out back in August when we announced the deal. What we also know is that the bottom line, we expect to get $0.10 to $0.12 of EPS accretion from Sensus. Now that's net of purchase accounting impacts. And then lastly, we expect our margin expansion pace to continue. Again, if you exclude the noncash acquisition impacts from the purchase accounting and you think about procurement, Lean Six Sigma and business simplification benefits, so we expect that margin expansion rate and pace to continue. And we also know that we're going to get $0.07 to $0.08 of carryover savings from restructuring that we've already taken this year that will flow into next year. So hopefully, to those listening, that gives you a little bit of a framework for how we're at least thinking initially about '17."

So we expected some of that. The real impact for us in the quarter, and I was just over there for our grand opening of our manufacturing facility and met with a number of our channel partners as well as with some customers in Saudi. And for those of you that are following the news there, you know that they're going through some serious budget constraints right now. And the common theme across pretty much all sectors is a common kind of down 20%, 30% in the quarter. I'm not sure what the kind of symmetry is there between that and what we saw. But for example, if the Saudi government just about a month ago announced that they are doing an across-the-board 20% reduction in all government employees' salary immediately, and that's being driven by some of their funding constraints. And so we saw that pull back in the quarter. We're being told that it will come back and that it's temporary. But right now, until we see an improvement in our order book there over the course of fourth quarter, we're trying to take a prudent view here on what kind of a drag that might have on our overall industrial growth."

Robert, I wouldn't read too much into a spreading into the general industrial sector, kind of what we call light industrial. We saw a little bit of weakness there in the quarter but it was a rounding error relative to the impact that we saw from really 2 specific areas, and that was the impact of our distributors on the dewatering side heavily tied to oil and gas, and secondly, what happened in Saudi and the Middle East. Those are really the 2 new things for us in the quarter that have us thinking a little differently about our guide for this year and so -- in terms of our revenue number. I wouldn't read anything into the rest of the light industrial sector."

And again, I've had an opportunity to spend some time with those folks as well. And I think they're all feeling fine around the U.S. sector. It really is some timing of products being awarded. The funnel looks attractive. But we -- and after 2 years of pretty constant growth, we saw some slowing there in the quarter. Keeping a close eye on it as we get to the Q4, but it was still up a couple of percent in the quarter, which is down from where we've been tracking through the first half of the year. So again, keeping a close eye but nothing there. The other piece, obviously, was the weakness that we've seen in China. There continues to be a slowdown in China. We wouldn't say it's getting any worse, it's really just flatlined. And as we get through the end of this year, we'll lap that comparison and we'll be talking about net positive growth for China all in."

And we will be sharing in our Investor Day down at Raleigh-Durham, which again I'll say is going to be early Q2, that will be an opportunity for us to really showcase the progress we have on integration, how we're thinking about synergy, specific targets that we'll be committing to in our 3- and 5-year outlook for both cost and revenue. But I would say, as we mentioned back in the call in August, we're very confident that we're going to get at least $50 million in cost synergies. And as I said in the last call, I'd be disappointed if we didn't have more than $100 million of revenue synergies over that time frame as well through 2020. The areas that are really the biggest opportunity for us on the cost side, big opportunities in the areas of procurement. And so whether it be overlapping in supplier base but also just using some of the tools that we put to use here at Xylem the last couple of years, we expect the same kind of progress and momentum to be there on a combined spend base with Sensus. There are also areas of opportunity in some of our back-office functions and G&A support functions on a global scale. On the revenue side, it really is going to be focused, I would say, if anything, in our synergy planning teams. I don't want to sound like the happy talking CEO here, but there were more revenue synergy opportunities than you could shake a stick at. The key was that they're longer lead time, some of them. They're going to require R&D and engineering support from Sensus. And so we're going to make sure that we're disciplined and balanced on how we think about those things. But they are really predominantly, Chip, in areas such as, one, we got a number of customers today in common where they already own Sensus' FlexNet and data analytics solutions but they're only applied today to the clean water side of the network and we have opportunities to now connect our devices on the wastewater side to be able to provide similar solutions to the customer for their challenges on wastewater. Second is they've got a number of big international projects that are out there that they're bidding on that, in some cases, are with customers that are already customers of ours today that we, hopefully, are going to be able to help them leverage in some way. And third, we think there's opportunities to also lever their data analytics capabilities across multiple parts of the Xylem portfolio to bring in some of that Software-as-a-Service opportunity across our existing business. So these are longer lead times but we are very excited, both Xylem and Sensus, about the opportunity here."
