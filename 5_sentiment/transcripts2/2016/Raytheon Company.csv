I am very pleased with both our fourth quarter and full year 2015 results and I'd like to begin with touching on a few highlights. Our total book-to-bill ratio for the year was $1.09 million. This reflects strong",1327,"Thank you, Todd. Good morning, everyone. I am very pleased with both our fourth quarter and full year 2015 results and I'd like to begin with touching on a few highlights. 
Our total book-to-bill ratio for the year was $1.09 million. This reflects strong global demand for our Advanced Solutions and positions us well going into 2016. We finished the full year with top line growth of 2%, driven by our growth in our international business, which more than offset a slight decline in domestic. Company segment margins in 2015 were as expected at 13.1% as the team delivered solid operating performance. 
Cash flow was also solid, providing us the opportunity to return the majority of our cash flow to shareholders, while also funding our pension plans and invest in our future growth. So all in all, the company's performing very well and we are confident in our future. As you can see from our 2015 results and the 2016 outlook, the global threat environment continues to drive demand for Raytheon solutions. I would also add that in my conversation with our global customers, it is clear that short-term shifts and economic growth factors have taken a backseat to ensuring the sovereignty and security of the nations that face these security threats. In particular, let me highlight what we are seeing in 3 regions. 
In the Middle East, demands singles increased last year despite the decline in oil prices. Tensions within the region are driving demand for missile-defense, long-range radars, modernized command and control systems, sensors, cybersecurity and precision munitions, areas that are aligned with our core strengths. I've been asked many times how oil price have impacted demand. From our viewpoint, we have not seen a negative impact and here is one o  many examples why. 
Over the past year alone, Patriot has intercepted more than a dozen ballistic missiles fired in the region, missiles that otherwise could have caused significant casualties and damage to critical infrastructure and defense sites. In the Asia-Pacific region, customers are also updating their missile-defense systems, sensors and other capabilities in light of recent developments there. Increased tensions related to territorial disputes and evolving economic interests are motivating allies in this region to invest more heavily in deterrent capabilities to protect our national interests. As you may recall, South Korea awarded us a significant upgrade to its Patriot systems in 2015. 
Looking forward in 2016, we see opportunities across the region in tactical radars, ship based radars, missiles, force protection systems and precision munitions. And in Europe, we are seeing renewed and increased interest from a number of countries and acquiring integrated air and missile defense solutions, providing additional opportunities for Patriot and NASAMs. Domestically, we are pleased to see the passage of the Bipartisan Budget Act, which adjusted the defense budget caps higher for fiscal year '16 and fiscal year '17, including a 15% increase in modernization funding in fiscal year '16. These changes provided much-needed funding for our armed forces while also improving visibility and predictability for the defense industry. This will yield a positive impact on our results beginning in 2016 and then continuing into 2017. 
The units reemerged from several years of declining U.S. Defense budgets are now beginning to see growth, the environment remains competitive. To ensure Raytheon's long-term competitive advantage, we have increased our independent research and development, capital expenditures and other investments to fund the development of advanced game changing apologies from the future, ranging from hypersonics and cybersecurity to directed energy. 
As expected, IR&D reached 3% of our sales in 2015, a similar level as expected in 2016. And let me give you some more details about our 2015 results. Strong demand from global customers drove bookings of $25.2 billion for the full year, a 5% increase over 2014. Domestic bookings were strong with a full-year book-to-bill ratio of 1.04. This sets up a better than originally expected domestic revenue growth outlook for 2016, which I'll discuss more in a moment. 
International comprised 34% of our total bookings in 2015 and our international book-to-bill ratio was a very robust 1.19 for the year. Total backlog at the end of 2015 was $34.7 billion, an increase of $1.1 billion dollars over 2014, again providing a solid foundation as we move into 2016. International ended the year at 43% of total backlog compared to 40% at year end 2014. Successful execution of our growth strategy and increasing demand from our global customers resulted in return to growth in 2015, a year earlier than we had originally expected. 
Our full-year 2015 international sales increased 9% over 2014, reaching 31% of our total annual sales, a new company record. In addition, for the second consecutive year, we saw good growth in classified sales, which increased about 6% in the year. In this environment, we are also continuously looking for more ways to lower our cost, enhance our competitiveness and improve affordability for our customers. A few examples include executing our strategic sourcing strategy to reduce cost in our supply chain, leveraging our centralized global business services organization to more efficiently provide back office support for the businesses and reducing our footprint, taking out a gross total of 1.9 million square feet in 2015. 
In addition, we have kicked off a new complexity reduction initiative to reduce costs and simplify business processes across the company. 
Looking forward to 2016, we expect to see continued strong demand that should ultimately drive our bookings to the $25 billion to $26 billion range for the year. This would translate into a book-to-bill ratio of roughly 1.05. Key bookings for the year include Qatar early warning radar, the AMD phase of the next-generation jammer and SM-3. More than ever before, demand from our global customers is broad-based and diversified. Along with these strong bookings we experienced in 2015, this continues strength should position us well to deliver revenue growth of between 3% to 5% in 2016, which is better than what we had mentioned when we provided our initial outlook during the Q3 earnings call. 
I would add that this includes an expectation of 2% to 4% growth from domestic customers. This would be the first time we've seen growth in our domestic business since 2009. Further, cash flow from operations is expected to increase significantly in 2016 from solid 2015 levels. The strong fundamental performance provides the foundation for the continuation of our balanced capital deployment strategy, with the objective of creating shareholder value. Our #1 priority from his executive our growth strategy and investing in our sales. Beyond this, we remain committed to providing a competitive dividend. We also continue to see value on our stock and expect to continue to share buyback at the 2015's robust levels. 
Part of our growth strategy is bring our advanced cybersecurity capabilities to government and commercial customers around the world. In 2015, in support of this strategy, we increased our presence in the commercial cybersecurity market in a meaningful way with the formation of Raytheon|Websense. And earlier this month, we changed this name to Force Point to more effectively brand and position our broad cybersecurity capabilities in the market. We further strengthened Forcepoint by completing the acquisition of Stone Soft after the close of the fourth quarter. The small acquisition, which is consistent with our M&A strategy that we've articulated over the past several calls, provides next generation firewall technology that fills an important technology gap and broadens our cybersecurity capabilities. The Stone Soft acquisition will become part of the Forcepoint business segment. We're excited about the breadth and depth of the product offerings at Forcepoint that place us in a strong competitive position. 
I like to close by thanking the Raytheon team for a great year and for the dedication and all the efforts that went into returning the company to growth ahead of schedule, while continuing to deliver for our global customers. 
With that, let me turn it over to Toby."

I have a few opening remarks starting with the fourth quarter and full-year results, then I'll discuss our outlook for 2016. After that, we'll open up the call for questions. During my remarks, I will be referring to the web slides that we issued earlier this morning, which are posted on our website. Okay. Would everyone please move to Page 3. 
We are pleased with the solid performance the team delivered in both the fourth quarter and the full year with bookings, sales, EPS and operating cash flow all consistent with or better than our expectations. We had strong bookings in the fourth quarter at $7.9 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.24. And for the year, we had bookings of $25.2 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.09. This sets the stage for continued growth in 2016, which I'll discuss in more detail in just a few minutes. 
Sales were $6.3 billion in the quarter, up 3%, led by our missiles, IDS and Forcepoint businesses. International sales grew 16% in the fourth quarter. And for the year, sales were up 2% ending at $23.2 billion. Our EPS from continuing operations was $1.85 for the quarter and $6.75 for the full year, which I will give a little more color on in a few minutes. We also generated strong operating cash flow of $813 million for the quarter and $2.3 billion for the year after a $200 million pretax discretionary pension contribution, which was not in our prior guidance. 
Additionally, during the quarter, the company repurchased 2 million shares of common stock for $250 million, bringing the full year 2015 repurchases to 9 million shares for about $1 billion. As we have previously disclosed in the fourth quarter of 2015, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $2 billion of the company's outstanding common stock. The company ended the year with a solid balance sheet and net debt of approximately $2.1 billion. 
Turning now to Page 4. Let me go through some of the details of our fourth quarter and full-year results. As I've mentioned earlier, we had strong bookings of $7.9 billion in the quarter and $25.2 billion for the full year, resulting in a year end backlog of $34.7 billion. The company ended 2015 with the funded backlog of $25.1 billion, an increase of $2 billion from year-end 2014. It's worth noting that both IDS and Missile Systems had outstanding bookings performance for the full-year 2015. For the quarter, international orders represented 27% of our total company bookings and for the full year was 34% of full-year bookings. And as Tom mentioned earlier, at the end of 2015, approximately 43% of our total backlog was international. 
Turning now to Page 5. We had fourth quarter sales of $6.3 billion, up 3% over the same period in 2014. This was at the high end of the guidance range we had set in October. So looking now at the businesses. 
IDS had net sales of $1.7 billion in the quarter and they were up 5% from the same period last year, primarily due to higher sales on certain international Patriot programs and on the Air Warfare Destroyer program. Net sales at IIS were $1.4 billion in the quarter, down from the same period last year, primarily due to lower sales on an international classified program. Missile Systems had fourth quarter 2015 net sales of $1.9 billion, up 9% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. The increase was primarily due to higher sales on Paveway. SAS had net sales of $1.6 billion in Q4, the change was spread across numerous programs with no one significant driver. And for Forcepoint, the increase was primarily due to the acquisition of Websense, which we completed in the second quarter of 2015.  As a reminder, fourth quarter 2014 included the results for Raytheon Cyber Products only. 
For the full year, sales were $23.2 billion, up approximately 2% over full-year 2014, consistent with expectations. International sales growth more than offset a slight decline in domestic sales. 
Moving ahead to Page 6. We delivered solid operational performance in quarter and the full year. Looking at business margins in the quarter. As expected in the fourth quarter of 2015, IDS received a contract modification to restructure the AWD program, essentially separating our incentive fees from the shipyard's performance. This resulted in a favorable $53 million adjustment in the fourth quarter of 2015 for IDS. Missile Systems and SAS margins both exceeded the guidance range that we provided back in October, while both IIS and Forcepoint met our guidance. 
Turning to Page 7. We had solid operating margin performance for the year. Segment margins were 13.1%, which was consistent with our expectations. And as a reminder, this included $181 million for the eBorder settlement earlier in the year at IIS, worth about 80 basis points. 
On Page 8, you'll see both the fourth quarter and full-year EPS. In the fourth quarter 2015, our EPS was $1.85 and for the full year was $6.75. EPS for the quarter was strong and above the guidance we provided you in October even after accounting for the extension of the R&D tax credit. As a reminder, the R&D tax credit was worth about $0.11 and was not in our prior guidance. 
Moving on to our 2016 guidance on Page 9. We see sales in the range of between $24 billion and $24.5 billion, up 3% to 5% from 2015. The increase is driven by growth in both our domestic and international business. Our 2016 outlook for the deferred revenue adjustment is $67 million and for the amortization of acquired intangibles is $121 million. It's important to note that effective January 1, 2016, we reclassified amortization of acquired intangibles and the deferred revenue adjustment. This change affects all businesses other than Forcepoint, which has already been reporting that way. These noncash items will no longer be reported within the business segments, instead this will be reported in separate deferred revenue adjustments and amortization of acquired intangibles lines that we have provided for you here. A reconciliation that walks you from the prior method to the current one is in Attachment G the press release. 
As for pension, we see that 2016 FAS/CAS adjustment at a positive $428 million, which I'll discuss in just a minute. We expect net interest expense to be between $220 million and $230 million. We see our average diluted shares outstanding to be between $296 million and $298 million on a full-year basis, a reduction of approximately 2% to 3%, driven by the continuation of our share repurchase program, which we expect at levels comparable to 2015. 
We expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 30%. Our 2016 tax rate is higher than 2015, primarily due to the $0.29 per share favorable tax settlement we received in 2015. It's important to note that our 2016 tax rate includes the R&D tax credit, which was permanently extended at the end of 2015. In 2016, we see our EPS to be in the range of $6.80 to $7. Our operating cash flow for continuing operations for 2016 is expected to be between $2.7 billion and $3 billion compared to $2.3 billion in 2015. As we sit here today, we do not anticipate making a discretionary contribution to our pension plans in 2016. As we previously mentioned, we did make a $200 million discretionary contribution in 2015. 
Before moving on to Page 10, I want to mention that we expect our 2016 bookings to be between $25 billion and $26 billion, driven by demand from a broad base of domestic and international customers. And we expect stronger bookings in the second half of the year similar to the last several years. 
Continuing on to Page 10. Before I cover the 2016 guidance by business, it's important to note that effective January 1, 2016, we reorganized the IDS and IIS business segments to move certain air traffic systems, border and critical infrastructure protection and highway tolling programs from IDS to IIS. We did this to more efficiently leverage our capabilities within the businesses. To assist you with your modeling, you'll find the recast segment data in the attachments provided at the end of the earnings release. 
Now moving to our initial 2016 guidance by business. At the midpoint of the sales range, we expect to see growth in all of our businesses in 2016. With respect to segment margins, consistent with our prior comments, we expect 2016 margins to continue to be solid in the 12.4% to 12.6% range, which is in line to slightly up when you compare to 2015 excluding the eBorders settlement. And similar to 2015, our 2016 segment margin outlook assumes that IR&D is approximately 3% of sales. 
I would also like to point out that when it makes sense, we have and will continue to make opportunistic investments in specific next-generation U.S. programs to better position the company for a longer-term organic growth, investments which we believe will create value for our shareholders. At IDS, we see margins in the 15.9% to 16.1% range. I want to point out that our full-year 2016 guidance includes positive operating income at IDS related to an expected exit from certain business ventures later in 2016, which you can think of in the $100 million to $125 million range. Excluding this, the change from 2015 is driven by mix, most notably, we are continuing to ramp up on several new programs, including on a couple of Patriot awards that we received in early 2015 from South Korea and Saudi Arabia. As you know, we typically see lower margins with the inception of longer duration programs, which can increase overtime as we retire risk and drive operational efficiencies. 
We expect IIS margins of 7.4% to 7.6%. This is in line year-over-year when you adjust for the 2015 eBorders settlement. We see missiles margins in the 13% to 13.2% range, consistent with 2015. SAS margins are expected to be in a 12.9% to 13.1% range, down from 2015, driven by mix as a result of completing some international programs as well as from higher business investments in 2016. And at Forcepoint, we expect margins to be in the 11.5% to 12.5% range. This includes the impact from the Stone Soft acquisition that Tom discussed earlier. Without this impact, margins would have be approximately 15%. 
If you now turn to Page 11. We've provided you with our 2016 outlook by quarter. You'll notice that sales ramped up throughout the year. And on Page 12, as we have done in the past, we've provided the summary of the financial impact from pensions in 2015 as well as the projected impact for 2016 through 2018, holding all assumptions constant. As I've mentioned earlier, we see the FAS/CAS adjustment in 2016 at a positive $428 million, which reflects our investment returns in 2015 on our U.S. pension assets, which were flat in the December 31 discount rate of 4.5%. The discount rate is up 40 basis points from last year. 
Looking beyond 2016, keep in mind, each 25 basis point change in the discount rate drives a $70 million to $80 change in FAS/CAS. And finally, on Page 13, we have provided an updated 3-year outlook of the acquisition accounting adjustments to help you with your long-term modeling. Please note that you'll see a significant decline in the deferred revenue adjustment over the period and the amortization of acquired intangible assets will begin to decline more significantly after 2018. 
Before concluding, as we have discussed on past earnings calls with regard to our capital deployment strategy, we expect to continue to generate strong free cash flow and maintain a strong balance sheet at our current credit rating going forward. We remain focused on deploying capital to create value for our shareholders and customers. This includes internal investments to support our growth plans as well as returning capital to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends, making smaller targeted acquisitions that fit our technology and global growth needs and, from time to time, making discretionary contributions to our pension plans. 
Let me conclude by saying that in 2015, Raytheon again delivered solid operating performance with bookings, sales, earnings and operating cash flow all on or ahead of expectations. Book-to-bill was strong and our international business grew significantly. We have a strong balance sheet, which gives us flexibility and options to continue to drive shareholder value and we are well positioned to grow in 2016 and beyond, both in our international and domestic business. 
So with that, we'll open up the call for questions."

So we see an influence to the ramp up in the second half of the year, in part driven by the growth and the timing of the awards we saw in late '15. That flows through, obviously, to the EPS cadence. And the other thing I would add, the exit of business ventures at IDS that I talked about, that's planned to be in the second half in Q3, which has an influence on the back half cadence from an EPS point of view as well."

Let me kind of walk through that and try to give some more color around that. So as I've mentioned and you alluded to, we do have $100 million to $125 million in the 2016 forecast for IDS related to the exit of a business venture. I will note, at IDS in any given year, in part because of the nature of their programs and the size of them, we have had favorable profit adjustments that were significant, maybe about half of the size of this, if you look back over time. So this pickup is a bit larger, but it does help to offset in '16 some of the mix that we've been talking about that you just referred to with the ramp up of these programs that are in the early stages. Further, as we've talked about at both IDS and across the company, we are investing more, particularly in strategic areas where we do see significant growth opportunities. We also continue to execute on some lower margin programs at IDS such as AMDR, the Qatar 8, a classified radar program that we won last year and all this taken together is a key component of our growth story, but in the near term, it is impacting our IDS margins as well. At the end of the day, even with the IDS margin, we have been able to maintain a solid company margin position and deliver top line growth due to the strength of the portfolio. And we continue to be focused on driving down our costs, overhead and other costs, for the last several years. And as you know, we've seen significant improvements from a number of different initiatives there around facilities reductions, factory automation, strategic sourcing, expanding our shared services, working on our organization structure when we've collapsed from 6 to 4 businesses and, as we've talked about, internationally, we changed our model on how we approach to international business. And that is clearly paying off from a growth perspective overall and internationally. As we now are resuming growth, we'll continue to drive cost down with our objective to improve and grow earnings to both top line and margin improvement. As far as the cadence of IDS margin going forward, I would think of it this way. As you said, if you were to adjust for the exit of the business venture, I think as we said in the past, we would expect year-over-year to continue to see IDS margins improve incrementally. Again, adjusting for the impact of the business venture as these larger production programs that run 5 years kind of get into the sweet spot into '17 and '18, which would drive that improved margin at IDS."

So we purposely deferred that to the end of the year to have kind of a clean break on into '16 and then obviously puts both of those elements on the same basis consistently across the company. So that's part of what why we did it. As far as the second part of your question, are we concerned about the businesses wanting or being willing to pay more. So even if work that were to be the case, we've done a pretty disciplined process here the company. We've got a core team and acquisition review team that all acquisitions have to go through. I'm on that. Tom's on that, as you would imagine, a few others. And through that, we've spent a lot of time around valuation looking at it 2, 3 different ways. And I won't get into any stats, but I would tell you, there are plenty of deals in the past that we lost because we wouldn't bid higher, right? We lost on price for lack of a better way to say it.

And then the other capital business that we made or the normal investments we made to essentially be able to operate our factory and win in efficient manner. So that's -- I'll put that in context. And let me put together the opportunities for Patriot and Context. There was just a recent announcement by the new minister of defense, in Poland relative to his support of pursuing the Patriot program with the U.S. government. In fact, he kind of did a joint announcement with the U.S. ambassador to Poland on that subject with an objective to be able to get something going here this year. So that's a really good news for us. That's a very large potential program for Poland there. And just as I've mentioned earlier, I just returned from the Middle East and their strong demand for additional Patriot assets there. I mentioned in my script a number of over 10 intercepts by Patriot against ballistic missiles just in that region of the Middle East. So there's a strong demand across Eastern Europe and also the Middle East for additional Patriot assets, but also for upgrade. For example, just in the upgrade area alone, there's an opportunity to upgrade 72 fire units just to configuration 3 plus. So there's upgrade potentials and then there's also the new potentials for countries like Poland and adding additional fire units to other countries in the Middle East region. And I'm sure you're reading the newspapers, like the information I'm getting, especially of all the Asia-Pacific activities are going on. In fact, today, there was an article relative to Fed and Korea where we also have just gotten an award on Patriot there, too. So the bottom line is there seems to be a significant demand out there across potable areas, Eastern Europe, Asia-Pacific region and the Middle East for missile defense and Patriot is the system that's proven and is the system of choice for the nations. That's what we're seeing."

We have other activities in Qatar, which we're pursuing and we believe are accessible this year. There's a whole FMS in the area Aegis of supporting Aegis Assure. And also, upgrades on some ships in the international marketplace. For those who don't know, we did at Aegis radar components and the sybsystems for that radar. That alone is, for example, over $300 million. And then in the whole area of missles, both air-to-air and air-to-surface missiles, a significant demand of greater than $3 billion across multiple missiles, so they're multiple contracts, there's no one contract in missiles that's going to do it, but that's our portfolio. We have a very diverse portfolio that allows us to add these systems up. International ISR was over $700 million. And then we have our normal airborne radars and ISR, systems that probably pretty close to $1 billion. So I think what's different this year than others is we're seeing demand signals across our whole portfolio on the international side. And why is that. Well, we mentioned before that we changed our strategy about 2 years ago. We went from a regional strategy to a country strategy. And in that country strategy, we focused not on the 1 or 2 customers we've had in the past 30 years, but we expanded that. Now we're seeing that, but these other customers are buying in the order of $500 million to $1 billion programs, not just a $2 billion program. So bottom line is our portfolio, which is diverse, is now diverse in the international marketplace and these opportunities are coming across in multiple across multiple of our products."

I am very pleased with both our fourth quarter and full year 2015 results, and I'd like to begin by touching on a few highlights. 
Our total book-to-bill ratio for the year was 1.09. This reflects strong global demand for our advanced solutions and positions us well going into 2016. We finished the full year with top line growth of 2%, driven by our growth in our international business, which more than offset a slight decline in domestic. Company segment margins in 2015 were as expected at 13.1% as the team delivered solid operating performance. 
Cash flow was also solid, providing us the opportunity to return the majority of our cash flow to shareholders, while also funding our pension plans and investing in our future growth. So all in all, the company is performing very well, and we are confident in our future. 
As you can see from our 2015 results and the 2016 outlook, the global threat environment continues to drive demand for Raytheon solutions. I would also add that in my conversations with our global customers, it is clear that short-term shifts and economic growth factors have taken a backseat to ensuring the sovereignty and security of the nations that face these security threats. In particular, let me highlight what we are seeing in 3 regions. 
In the Middle East, demands signals increased last year, despite the decline in oil prices. Tensions within the region are driving demand for missile defense, long-range radars, modernized command and control systems, sensors, cybersecurity and precision munitions, areas that align with our core strengths. I've been asked many times how oil prices have impacted demand. From our viewpoint, we have not seen a negative impact, and here is one of many examples why. Over the past year alone, Patriot has intercepted more than a dozen ballistic missiles fired in the region, missiles that otherwise could have caused significant casualties and damage to critical infrastructure and defense sites. 
In the Asia Pacific region, customers are also updating their missile defense systems, sensors and other capabilities in light of recent developments there. Increased tensions related to territorial disputes and evolving economic interests are motivating allies in this region to invest more heavily in deterrent capabilities to protect our national interests. As you may recall, South Korea awarded us a significant upgrade to its Patriot Systems in 2015. Looking forward in 2016, we see opportunities across the region in tactical radars, ship-based radars, missiles, force protection systems and precision munitions. 
And in Europe, we are seeing renewed and increased interest from a number of countries and acquiring integrated air and missile defense solutions, providing additional opportunities for Patriot and NASAMs. 
Domestically, we were pleased to see the passage of the Bipartisan Budget Act, which adjusted the defense budget caps higher for fiscal year '16 and fiscal year '17, including a 15% increase in modernization funding in fiscal year '16. These changes provided much-needed funding for our armed forces, while also improving visibility and predictability for the defense industry. This will yield a positive impact on our results beginning in 2016 and then continuing into 2017. 
Even as we emerge from several years of declining U.S. Defense budgets are now beginning to see growth, the environment remains competitive. To ensure Raytheon's long-term competitive advantage, we have increased our independent research and development, capital expenditures and other investments to fund the development of the advanced game-changing technologies of the future, ranging from hypersonics and cybersecurity to directed energy. As expected, IR&D reached 3% of our sales in 2015, a similar level as expected in 2016. 
And let me give you some more details about our 2015 results. Strong demand from global customers drove bookings of $25.2 billion for the full year, a 5% increase over 2014. Domestic bookings were strong with a full year book-to-bill ratio of 1.04. This sets up a better-than-originally-expected domestic revenue growth outlook for 2016, which I'll discuss more in a moment. 
International comprised 34% of our total bookings in 2015, and our international book-to-bill ratio was a very robust 1.19 for the year. Total backlog at the end of 2015 was $34.7 billion, an increase of $1.1 billion over 2014, again providing a solid foundation as we move into 2016. International ended the year at 43% of total backlog compared to 40% at year-end 2014. Successful execution of our growth strategy and increasing demand from our global customers resulted in a return of growth in 2015, a year earlier than we had originally expected. Our full year 2015 international sales increased 9% over 2014, reaching 31% of our total annual sales, a new company record. 
In addition, for the second consecutive year, we saw a good growth in classified sales, which increased about 6% in the year. In this environment, we are also continuously looking for more ways to lower our cost, enhance our competitiveness and improve affordability for our customers. A few examples include executing our strategic sourcing strategy to reduce cost in our supply chain, leveraging our centralized global business services organization to more efficiently provide back office support to the businesses and reducing our footprint, taking out a gross total of 1.9 million square feet in 2015. In addition, we have kicked off a new complexity reduction initiative to reduce costs and simplify business processes across the company. 
Looking forward to 2016, we expect to see continued strong demand that should ultimately drive our bookings to the $25 billion to $26 billion range for the year. This would translate into a book-to-bill ratio of approximately 1.05. Key bookings for the year include Qatar early warning radar, the EMD phase of the Next Generation Jammer and SM-3. More than ever before, demand from our global customers is broad-based and diversified. 
Along with these strong bookings we experienced in 2015, this continued strength should position us well to deliver revenue growth of between 3% to 5% in 2016, which is better than what we had mentioned when we provided our initial outlook during the Q3 earnings call. I would add that this includes an expectation of 2% to 4% growth from domestic customers. This would be the first time we've seen growth in our domestic business since 2009. Further, cash flow from operations is expected to increase significantly in 2016 from solid 2015 levels. 
This strong fundamental performance provides the foundation for the continuation of our balanced capital deployment strategy, with the objective of creating shareholder value. Our #1 priority remains executing our growth strategy and investing in our sales. Beyond this, we remain committed to providing a competitive dividend. We also continue to see value in our stock and expect to continue the share buyback at the 2015's robust levels. 
Part of our growth strategy is bring our advanced cybersecurity capabilities to government and commercial customers around the world. In 2015, in support of this strategy, we increased our presence in the commercial cybersecurity market in a meaningful way with the formation of Raytheon|Websense. And earlier this month, we changed its name to Forcepoint to more effectively brand and position our broad cybersecurity capabilities in the market. We further strengthened Forcepoint by completing the acquisition of Stonesoft after the close of the fourth quarter. The small acquisition, which is consistent with our M&A strategy that we've articulated over the past several calls, provides next-generation firewall technology that fills an important technology gap and broadens our cybersecurity capabilities. The Stonesoft acquisition will become part of the Forcepoint business segment. We're excited about the breadth and depth of the product offerings at Forcepoint that place us in a strong competitive position. 
I'd like to close by thanking the Raytheon team for a great year and for the dedication and all the efforts that went into returning the company to growth ahead of schedule, while continuing to deliver for our global customers. 
With that, let me turn it over to Toby."
105612,322029158,922486,"Raytheon Company, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2016",2016-01-28,"Earnings Calls","Raytheon Company","Executives","Okay. Thanks, Tom.

I have a few opening remarks, starting with the fourth quarter and full year results, then I'll discuss our outlook for 2016. After that, we'll open up the call for questions. During my remarks, I will be referring to the web slides that we issued earlier this morning, which are posted on our website. Okay, would everyone please move to Page 3.
We are pleased with the solid performance the team delivered in both the fourth quarter and the full year, with bookings, sales, EPS and operating cash flow all consistent with or better than our expectations. We had strong bookings in the fourth quarter at $7.9 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.24. And for the year, we had bookings of $25.2 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.09. This sets the stage for continued growth in 2016, which I'll discuss in more detail in just a few minutes. 
Sales were $6.3 billion in the quarter, up 3%, led by our missiles, IDS and Forcepoint businesses. International sales grew 16% in the fourth quarter. And for the year, sales were up 2%, ending at $23.2 billion. 
Our EPS from continuing operations was $1.85 for the quarter and $6.75 for the full year, which I will give a little more color on in a few minutes. We also generated strong operating cash flow of $813 million for the quarter and $2.3 billion for the year after a $200 million pretax discretionary pension contribution, which was not in our prior guidance. 
Additionally, during the quarter, the company repurchased 2 million shares of common stock for $250 million, bringing the full year 2015 repurchases to 9 million shares for about $1 billion. As we have previously disclosed in the fourth quarter of 2015, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $2 billion of the company's outstanding common stock. The company ended the year with a solid balance sheet and net debt of approximately $2.1 billion. 
Turning now to Page 4. Let me go through some of the details of our fourth quarter and full year results. As I mentioned earlier, we had strong bookings of $7.9 billion in the quarter and $25.2 billion for the full year, resulting in a year-end backlog of $34.7 billion. The company ended 2015 with a funded backlog of $25.1 billion, an increase of $2 billion from year-end 2014. It's worth noting that both IDS and Missile Systems had outstanding bookings performance for the full year 2015. For the quarter, international orders represented 27% of our total company bookings and for the full year was 34% of total bookings. And as Tom mentioned earlier, at the end of 2015, approximately 43% of our total backlog was international. 
Turning now to Page 5. We had fourth quarter sales of $6.3 billion, up 3% over the same period in 2014. This was at the high end of the guidance range we had set in October. 
So looking now at the businesses. IDS had net sales of $1.7 billion in the quarter, and they were up 5% from the same period last year, primarily due to higher sales on certain international Patriot programs and on the Air Warfare Destroyer program. Net sales at IIS were $1.4 billion in the quarter, down from the same period last year, primarily due to lower sales on an international classified program. Missile Systems had fourth quarter 2015 net sales of $1.9 billion, up 9% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. The increase was primarily due to higher sales on Paveway. SAS had net sales of $1.6 billion in Q4. The change was spread across numerous programs with no one significant driver. And for Forcepoint, the increase was primarily due to the acquisition of Websense, which we completed in the second quarter of 2015. As a reminder, fourth quarter 2014 included the results for Raytheon Cyber Products only. 
For the full year, sales were $23.2 billion, up approximately 2% over full-year 2014, consistent with expectations. International sales growth more than offset a slight decline in domestic sales. 
Moving ahead to Page 6. We delivered solid operational performance in quarter and the full year. Looking at business margins in the quarter. As expected in the fourth quarter of 2015, IDS received a contract modification to restructure the AWD program, essentially separating our incentive fees from the shipyard's performance. This resulted in a favorable $53 million adjustment in the fourth quarter of 2015 for IDS. Missile Systems and SAS margins both exceeded the guidance range that we provided back in October, while both IIS and Forcepoint met our guidance.
Turning to Page 7. We had solid operating margin performance for the year. Segment margins were 13.1%, which was consistent with our expectations. And as a reminder, this included $181 million for the eBorder settlement earlier in the year at IIS, worth about 80 basis points. 
On Page 8, you'll see both the fourth quarter and full year EPS. In the fourth quarter 2015, our EPS was $1.85, and for the full year was $6.75. EPS for the quarter was strong and above the guidance we provided you in October, even after accounting for the extension of the R&D tax credit. As a reminder, the R&D tax credit was worth about $0.11 and was not in our prior guidance. 
Moving on to our 2016 guidance on Page 9. We see sales in the range of between $24 billion and $24.5 billion, up 3% to 5% from 2015. The increase is driven by growth in both our domestic and international business. Our 2016 outlook for the deferred revenue adjustment is $67 million, and for the amortization of acquired intangibles is $121 million. It's important to note that effective January 1, 2016, we reclassified amortization of acquired intangibles and the deferred revenue adjustment. This change affects all businesses other than Forcepoint, which had already been reporting that way. 
These noncash items will no longer be reported within the business segments. Instead, these will be reported in separate deferred revenue adjustment and amortization of acquired intangibles lines that we have provided for you here. A reconciliation that walks you from the prior method to the current one is in Attachment G the press release. 
As for pension, we see that 2016 FAS/CAS Adjustment at a positive $428 million, which I'll discuss in just a minute. We expect net interest expense to be between $220 million and $230 million. We see our average diluted shares outstanding to be between $296 million and $298 million on a full year basis, a reduction of approximately 2% to 3%, driven by the continuation of our share repurchase program, which we expect at levels comparable to 2015. 
We expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 30%. Our 2016 tax rate is higher than 2015, primarily due to the $0.29 per share favorable tax settlement we received in 2015. It's important to note that our 2016 tax rate includes the R&D tax credit, which was permanently extended at the end of 2015. 
In 2016, we see our EPS to be in the range of $6.80 to $7. Our operating cash flow for continuing operations for 2016 is expected to be between $2.7 billion and $3 billion compared to $2.3 billion in 2015. 
As we sit here today, we do not anticipate making a discretionary contribution to our pension plans in 2016. As we've previously mentioned, we did make a $200 million discretionary contribution in 2015. 
Before moving on to Page 10, I want to mention that we expect our 2016 bookings to be between $25 billion and $26 billion, driven by demand from a broad base of domestic and international customers. And we expect stronger bookings in the second half of the year, similar to the last several years. 
Continuing on to Page 10. Before I cover the 2016 guidance by business, it's important to note that effective January 1, 2016, we reorganized the IDS and IIS business segments to move certain air traffic systems, border and critical infrastructure protection and highway tolling programs from IDS to IIS. We did this to more efficiently leverage our capabilities within the businesses. To assist you with your modeling, you'll find the recast segment data in the attachments provided at the end of the earnings release. 
Now moving to our initial 2016 guidance by business. At the midpoint of the sales range, we expect to see growth in all of our businesses in 2016. With respect to segment margins, consistent with our prior comments, we expect 2016 margins to continue to be solid in the 12.4% to 12.6% range, which is in line to slightly up when you compare to 2015 excluding the eBorders settlement. And similar to 2015, our 2016 segment margin outlook assumes that IR&D is approximately 3% of sales. 
I would also like to point out that when it makes sense, we have and will continue to make opportunistic investments in specific next-generation U.S. programs to better position the company for a longer-term organic growth, investments which we believe will create value for our shareholders. 
At IDS, we see margins in the 15.9% to 16.1% range. I want to point out that our full year 2016 guidance includes positive operating income at IDS related to an expected exit from certain business ventures later in 2016, which you can think of in the $100 million to $125 million range. Excluding this, the change from 2015 is driven by mix. Most notably, we are continuing to ramp up on several new programs, including on a couple of Patriot awards that we received in early 2015 from South Korea and Saudi Arabia. As you know, we typically see lower margins at the inception of longer duration programs, which can increase over time as we retire risk and drive operational efficiencies. 
We expect IIS margins of 7.4% to 7.6%. This is in line year-over-year when you adjust for the 2015 eBorders settlement. 
We see missiles margins in the 13% to 13.2% range, consistent with 2015. 
SAS margins are expected to be in the 12.9% to 13.1% range, down from 2015, driven by mix as a result of completing some international programs as well as from higher business investments in 2016. 
And at Forcepoint, we expect margins to be in the 11.5% to 12.5% range. This includes the impact from the Stonesoft acquisition that Tom discussed earlier. Without this impact, margins would be approximately 15%. 
If you now turn to Page 11. We've provided you with our 2016 outlook by quarter. You'll notice that sales ramped up throughout the year. 
And on Page 12, as we have done in the past, we've provided a summary of the financial impact from pensions in 2015 as well as the projected impact for 2016 through 2018, holding all assumptions constant. As I've mentioned earlier, we see the FAS/CAS Adjustment in 2016 at a positive $428 million, which reflects our investment returns in 2015 on our U.S. pension assets, which were flat in the December 31 discount rate of 4.5%. The discount rate is up 40 basis points from last year. Looking beyond 2016, keep in mind, each 25 basis point change in the discount rate drives a $70 million to $80 million change in FAS/CAS. 
And finally, on Page 13, we have provided an updated 3-year outlook of the acquisition accounting adjustments to help you with your long-term modeling. Please note that you'll see a significant decline in the deferred revenue adjustment over the period, and the amortization of acquired intangible assets will begin to decline more significantly after 2018. 
Before concluding, as we have discussed on past earnings calls with regard to our capital deployment strategy, we expect to continue to generate strong free cash flow and maintain a strong balance sheet at our current credit rating going forward. We remain focused on deploying capital to create value for our shareholders and customers. This includes internal investments to support our growth plans as well as returning capital to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends, making smaller targeted acquisitions that fit our technology and global growth needs, and from time to time, making discretionary contributions to our pension plans. 
Let me conclude by saying that in 2015, Raytheon again delivered solid operating performance with bookings, sales, earnings and operating cash flow all on or ahead of expectations. Book-to-bill was strong, and our international business grew significantly. We have a strong balance sheet, which gives us flexibility and options to continue to drive shareholder value, and we are well positioned to grow in 2016 and beyond, both in our international and domestic business. 
So with that, we'll open up the call for questions."

It's influenced by, as you would expect, the timing of awards, especially in 2015, and we had a strong back half to the year. So we see an influence to the ramp up in the second half of the year, in part, driven by the growth and the timing of the awards we saw in late '15. That flows through, obviously, to the EPS cadence. And the other thing I would add, the exit of business ventures at IDS that I talked about, that's planned to be in the second half in Q3, which has an influence on the back half cadence from an EPS point of view as well."

Let me kind of walk through that and try to give some more color around that. So as I've mentioned, and you alluded to, we do have $100 million to $125 million in the 2016 forecast for IDS related to the exit of a business venture. I will note, at IDS, in any given year, in part, because of the nature of their programs and the size of them, we have had favorable profit adjustments that were significant, maybe about the half of the size of this, if you look back over time. So this pickup is a bit larger. But it does help to offset in '16 some of the mix that we've been talking about that you just referred to with the ramp up of these programs that are in the early stages. Further, as we've talked about at both IDS and across the company, we are investing more, particularly in strategic areas where we do see significant growth opportunities. We also continue to execute on some lower margin programs at IDS, such as AMDR, the Qatar ADOC, a classified radar program that we won last year. And all this taken together is a key component of our growth story. But in the near term, it is impacting our IDS margins as well. At the end of the day, even with the IDS margin, we have been able to maintain a solid company margin position and deliver top line growth due to the strength of the portfolio. And we continue to be focused on driving down our costs, overhead and other costs, for the last several years. And as you know, we've seen significant improvements from a number of different initiatives there around facilities, reductions, factory automation, strategic sourcing, expanding our shared services, working on our organization structure when we've collapsed from 6 to 4 businesses. And as we've talked about, internationally, we changed our model on how we approached international business. And that is clearly paying off from a growth perspective, overall and internationally. As we now are resuming growth, we'll continue to drive cost down with our objective to improve and grow earnings through both top line and margin improvement. As far as the cadence of IDS margin going forward, I would think of it this way. As you said, if you were to adjust for the exit of the business venture, I think as we said in the past, we would expect year-over-year and have continued to see IDS margins improve incrementally. Again, adjusting for the impact of the business venture as these larger production programs that run 5 years kind of get into the sweet spot into '17 and '18, which would drive that improved margin at IDS."

And it's usually in the plus or minus the third year of those programs, which will be starting in '17 when we normally see the opportunity to retire risk, drive efficiencies. We also had, if you recall, at the end of '14, a major award for Qatar. Again, that will kind be hitting its sweet spot when we get into '17.

So I think #1 is we do invest inside the company relative to ensuring that we have the right discriminators and differentiators to compete across all our businesses, and not only just to compete, but obviously to win. And so those investments come through the avenue of IRAD, some capital investments, also people, bringing on the right talent so that we can go and win those major competitions because they are the future franchises for the company. And that's been our overall strategy over the years. We look at programs that are going to have runs for decades. What's the next Patriot? One of the examples is this Air and Missile Defense Radar, that's going to be our next major franchise coming to fruition here in the next several years; Next Generation Jammer win; the FAB-T win. These are all franchise programs. And we made sure that over the years that we have been investing in the right IRAD, in the right -- the capital to support those projects, and then also in having the right talent on board. And that's just something that we do as part of the company moving forward. Now the good news is that we're seeing the results of those investments, and the results are these franchises that we won over the last couple of years. And that we intend to continue to win as we move forward. And we see a lot of opportunity here in 2016, 2017 and 2018 already in terms of new franchise opportunities. And so Howard, I think the bottom line is we're making the right investments and we're seeing the right results relative to these new franchises."

And then the other capital investments that we made are the normal investments we make to essentially be able to operate our factory in a lean and efficient manner. So that's -- I'll put that in context. And let me put together the opportunities for Patriot in context. There was just a recent announcement by the new Minister of Defense, Macierewicz, in Poland relative to his support of pursuing the Patriot program with the U.S. government. In fact, he kind of did a joint announcement with the U.S. ambassador to Poland on that subject with an objective to be able to get something going here this year. So that's a really good news for us. That's a very large potential program for Poland there. And I just -- as I've mentioned earlier, I just returned from the Middle East and there's strong demand for additional Patriot assets there. I mentioned in my script a number of -- over 10 intercepts by Patriot against ballistic missiles, just in that region of the Middle East. So there's a strong demand across Eastern Europe and also the Middle East for additional Patriot assets, but also for upgrade. For example, there's -- just in the upgrade area alone, there's an opportunity to upgrade 72 fire units just to Configuration 3+. So there's upgrade potentials. And then there's also the new potentials for countries like Poland and adding additional fire units to other countries in the Middle East region. And I'm sure you're reading the newspapers, like as the information that I'm getting, especially of all the Asia Pacific activities that are going on. In fact, today, there was an article relative to Fed and Korea where we also have just gotten an award on Patriot there too. So the bottom line is there seems to be a significant demand out there across multiple areas, Eastern Europe, Asia Pacific region and the Middle East, for missile defense. And then Patriot is the system that's proven and is the system of choice for these nations. That's what we're seeing."

So I think that's getting out there, that, that capability is available, and we're hearing -- getting demand signals from customers on that. So the bottom line is, is Patriot is a franchise, and we continue to evolve it. We continue to upgrade it, increase its capabilities, add new technologies, and it's -- we're seeing increased demand across those 3 major areas of the world.

For those that don't know, we do the Aegis radar and all the components and the subsystems for that radar. That alone is, for example, over $300 million. And then in the whole area of missiles, both air-to-air and air-to-surface missiles, a significant demand of greater than $3 billion across multiple missiles, so they're multiple contracts. There's no one contract in missiles that's going to do it. But that's our portfolio. We have a very diverse portfolio that allows us to add these systems up. International ISR was over $700 million. And then we have our normal airborne radars and ISR EO/IR systems. That's probably pretty close to $1 billion. So I think what's different this year than others is we're seeing demand signals across our whole portfolio on the international side. And you say, ""Why is that?"" Well, we mentioned before that we changed our strategy about 2 years ago. We went from a regional strategy to a country strategy. And in that country strategy, we focused not on the 1 or 2 customers we've had in the past 30 years, but we expanded that. And now we're seeing that. But these other customers are buying in the order of $500 million to $1 billion programs, not just a $2 billion program.

I am very pleased with both our fourth quarter and full year 2015 results, and I'd like to begin by touching on a few highlights. 
Our total book-to-bill ratio for the year was 1.09. This reflects strong global demand for our advanced solutions and positions us well going into 2016. We finished the full year with top line growth of 2%, driven by our growth in our international business, which more than offset a slight decline in domestic. Company segment margins in 2015 were as expected at 13.1% as the team delivered solid operating performance. 
Cash flow was also solid, providing us the opportunity to return the majority of our cash flow to shareholders, while also funding our pension plans and investing in our future growth. So all in all, the company is performing very well, and we are confident in our future. 
As you can see from our 2015 results and the 2016 outlook, the global threat environment continues to drive demand for Raytheon solutions. I would also add that in my conversations with our global customers, it is clear that short-term shifts and economic growth factors have taken a backseat to ensuring the sovereignty and security of the nations that face these security threats. In particular, let me highlight what we are seeing in 3 regions. 
In the Middle East, demand signals increased last year, despite the decline in oil prices. Tensions within the region are driving demand for missile defense, long-range radars, modernized command to control systems, sensors, cybersecurity and precision munitions, areas that align with our core strengths. I've been asked many times how oil prices have impacted demand. From our viewpoint, we have not seen a negative impact, and here is one of many examples why. Over the past year alone, Patriot has intercepted more than a dozen ballistic missiles fired in the region, missiles that otherwise could have caused significant casualties and damage to critical infrastructure and defense sites. 
In the Asia Pacific region, customers are also updating their missile defense systems, sensors and other capabilities in light of recent developments there. Increased tensions related to territorial disputes and evolving economic interests are motivating allies in this region to invest more heavily in deterrent capabilities to protect their national interests. As you may recall, South Korea awarded us a significant upgrade to its Patriot Systems in 2015. Looking forward in 2016, we see opportunities across the region in tactical radars, ship-based radars, missiles, force protection systems and precision munitions. 
And in Europe, we are seeing renewed and increased interest from a number of countries in acquiring integrated air and missile defense solutions, providing additional opportunities for Patriot and NASAMs. 
Domestically, we were pleased to see the passage of the Bipartisan Budget Act, which adjusted the defense budget caps higher for fiscal year '16 and fiscal year '17, including a 15% increase in modernization funding in fiscal year '16. These changes provided much-needed funding for our armed forces, while also improving visibility and predictability for the defense industry. This will yield a positive impact on our results beginning in 2016 and then continuing into 2017. 
Even as we emerge from several years of declining U.S. Defense budgets, are now beginning to see growth, the environment remains competitive. To ensure Raytheon's long-term competitive advantage, we have increased our independent research and development, capital expenditures and other investments to fund the development of the advanced game-changing technologies of the future, ranging from hypersonics and cybersecurity to directed energy. As expected, IR&D reached 3% of our sales in 2015, a similar level as expected in 2016. 
And let me give you some more details about our 2015 results. Strong demand from global customers drove bookings of $25.2 billion for the full year, a 5% increase over 2014. Domestic bookings were strong with a full year book-to-bill ratio of 1.04. This sets up a better-than-originally-expected domestic revenue growth outlook for 2016, which I'll discuss more in a moment. 
International comprised 34% of our total bookings in 2015, and our international book-to-bill ratio was a very robust 1.19 for the year. Total backlog at the end of 2015 was $34.7 billion, an increase of $1.1 billion over 2014, again providing a solid foundation as we move into 2016. International ended the year at 43% of total backlog compared to 40% at year-end 2014. Successful execution of our growth strategy and increasing demand from our global customers resulted in a return of growth in 2015, a year earlier than we had originally expected. Our full year 2015 international sales increased 9% over 2014, reaching 31% of our total annual sales, a new company record. 
In addition, for the second consecutive year, we saw a good growth in classified sales, which increased about 6% in the year. In this environment, we are also continuously looking for more ways to lower our cost, enhance our competitiveness and improve affordability for our customers. A few examples include executing our strategic sourcing strategy to reduce cost in our supply chain, leveraging our centralized global business services organization to more efficiently provide back office support to the businesses and reducing our footprint, taking out a gross total of 1.9 million square feet in 2015. In addition, we have kicked off a new complexity reduction initiative to reduce costs and simplify business processes across the company. 
Looking forward to 2016, we expect to see continued strong demand that should ultimately drive our bookings to the $25 billion to $26 billion range for the year. This would translate into a book-to-bill ratio of approximately 1.05. Key bookings for the year include Qatar early warning radar, the EMD phase of the Next Generation Jammer and SM-3. More than ever before, demand from our global customers is broad-based and diversified. 
Along with these strong bookings we experienced in 2015, this continued strength should position us well to deliver revenue growth of between 3% to 5% in 2016, which is better than what we had mentioned when we provided our initial outlook during the Q3 earnings call. I would add that this includes an expectation of 2% to 4% growth from domestic customers. This would be the first time we've seen growth in our domestic business since 2009. Further, cash flow from operations is expected to increase significantly in 2016 from solid 2015 levels. 
This strong fundamental performance provides the foundation for the continuation of our balanced capital deployment strategy, with the objective of creating shareholder value. Our #1 priority remains executing our growth strategy and investing in our sales. Beyond this, we remain committed to providing a competitive dividend. We also continue to see value in our stock and expect to continue the share buyback at the 2015's robust levels. 
Part of our growth strategy is bringing our advanced cybersecurity capabilities to government and commercial customers around the world. In 2015, in support of this strategy, we increased our presence in the commercial cybersecurity market in a meaningful way with the formation of Raytheon|Websense. And earlier this month, we changed its name to Forcepoint to more effectively brand and position our broad cybersecurity capabilities in the market. We further strengthened Forcepoint by completing the acquisition of Stonesoft after the close of the fourth quarter. The small acquisition, which is consistent with our M&A strategy that we've articulated over the past several calls, provides next-generation firewall technology that fills an important technology gap and broadens our cybersecurity capabilities. The Stonesoft acquisition will become part of the Forcepoint business segment. We're excited about the breadth and depth of the product offerings at Forcepoint that place us in a strong competitive position. 
I'd like to close by thanking the Raytheon team for a great year and for the dedication and all the efforts that went into returning the company to growth ahead of schedule, while continuing to deliver for our global customers. 
With that, let me turn it over to Toby."
105612,322029158,922680,"Raytheon Company, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2016",2016-01-28,"Earnings Calls","Raytheon Company","Executives","Okay. Thanks, Tom.

I have a few opening remarks, starting with the fourth quarter and full year results, then I'll discuss our outlook for 2016. After that, we'll open up the call for questions. During my remarks, I will be referring to the web slides that we issued earlier this morning, which are posted on our website. Okay, would everyone please move to Page 3.
We are pleased with the solid performance the team delivered in both the fourth quarter and the full year, with bookings, sales, EPS and operating cash flow all consistent with or better than our expectations. We had strong bookings in the fourth quarter at $7.9 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.24. And for the year, we had bookings of $25.2 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.09. This sets the stage for continued growth in 2016, which I'll discuss in more detail in just a few minutes. 
Sales were $6.3 billion in the quarter, up 3%, led by our missiles, IDS and Forcepoint businesses. International sales grew 16% in the fourth quarter. And for the year, sales were up 2%, ending at $23.2 billion. 
Our EPS from continuing operations was $1.85 for the quarter and $6.75 for the full year, which I will give a little more color on in a few minutes. We also generated strong operating cash flow of $813 million for the quarter and $2.3 billion for the year after a $200 million pretax discretionary pension contribution, which was not in our prior guidance. 
Additionally, during the quarter, the company repurchased 2 million shares of common stock for $250 million, bringing the full year 2015 repurchases to 9 million shares for about $1 billion. As we have previously disclosed in the fourth quarter of 2015, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $2 billion of the company's outstanding common stock. The company ended the year with a solid balance sheet and net debt of approximately $2.1 billion. 
Turning now to Page 4. Let me go through some of the details of our fourth quarter and full year results. As I mentioned earlier, we had strong bookings of $7.9 billion in the quarter and $25.2 billion for the full year, resulting in a year-end backlog of $34.7 billion. The company ended 2015 with a funded backlog of $25.1 billion, an increase of $2 billion from year-end 2014. It's worth noting that both IDS and Missile Systems had outstanding bookings performance for the full year 2015. For the quarter, international orders represented 27% of our total company bookings and for the full year was 34% of total bookings. And as Tom mentioned earlier, at the end of 2015, approximately 43% of our total backlog was international. 
Turning now to Page 5. We had fourth quarter sales of $6.3 billion, up 3% over the same period in 2014. This was at the high end of the guidance range we had set in October. 
So looking now at the businesses. IDS had net sales of $1.7 billion in the quarter, and they were up 5% from the same period last year, primarily due to higher sales on certain international Patriot programs and on the Air Warfare Destroyer program. Net sales at IIS were $1.4 billion in the quarter, down from the same period last year, primarily due to lower sales on an international classified program. Missile Systems had fourth quarter 2015 net sales of $1.9 billion, up 9% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. The increase was primarily due to higher sales on Paveway. SAS had net sales of $1.6 billion in Q4. The change was spread across numerous programs with no one significant driver. And for Forcepoint, the increase was primarily due to the acquisition of Websense, which we completed in the second quarter of 2015. As a reminder, fourth quarter 2014 included the results for Raytheon Cyber Products only. 
For the full year, sales were $23.2 billion, up approximately 2% over full-year 2014, consistent with expectations. International sales growth more than offset a slight decline in domestic sales. 
Moving ahead to Page 6. We delivered solid operational performance in the quarter and the full year. Looking at business margins in the quarter. As expected in the fourth quarter of 2015, IDS received a contract modification to restructure the AWD program, essentially separating our incentive fees from the shipyard's performance. This resulted in a favorable $53 million adjustment in the fourth quarter of 2015 for IDS. Missile Systems and SAS margins both exceeded the guidance range that we provided back in October, while both IIS and Forcepoint met our guidance.
Turning to Page 7. We had solid operating margin performance for the year. Segment margins were 13.1%, which was consistent with our expectations. And as a reminder, this included $181 million for the eBorder settlement earlier in the year at IIS, worth about 80 basis points. 
On Page 8, you'll see both the fourth quarter and full year EPS. In the fourth quarter 2015, our EPS was $1.85, and for the full year was $6.75. EPS for the quarter was strong and above the guidance we provided you in October, even after accounting for the extension of the R&D tax credit. As a reminder, the R&D tax credit was worth about $0.11 and was not in our prior guidance. 
Moving on to our 2016 guidance on Page 9. We see sales in the range of between $24 billion and $24.5 billion, up 3% to 5% from 2015. The increase is driven by growth in both our domestic and international business. Our 2016 outlook for the deferred revenue adjustment is $67 million, and for the amortization of acquired intangibles is $121 million. It's important to note that effective January 1, 2016, we reclassified amortization of acquired intangibles and the deferred revenue adjustment. This change affects all businesses other than Forcepoint, which had already been reporting that way. 
These noncash items will no longer be reported within the business segments. Instead, these will be reported in separate deferred revenue adjustment and amortization of acquired intangibles lines that we have provided for you here. A reconciliation that walks you from the prior method to the current one is in Attachment G to the press release. 
As for pension, we see the 2016 FAS/CAS Adjustment at a positive $428 million, which I'll discuss in just a minute. We expect net interest expense to be between $220 million and $230 million. We see our average diluted shares outstanding to be between $296 million and $298 million on a full year basis, a reduction of approximately 2% to 3%, driven by the continuation of our share repurchase program, which we expect at levels comparable to 2015. 
We expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 30%. Our 2016 tax rate is higher than 2015, primarily due to the $0.29 per share favorable tax settlement we received in 2015. It's important to note that our 2016 tax rate includes the R&D tax credit, which was permanently extended at the end of 2015. 
In 2016, we see our EPS to be in the range of $6.80 to $7. Our operating cash flow for continuing operations for 2016 is expected to be between $2.7 billion and $3 billion compared to $2.3 billion in 2015. 
As we sit here today, we do not anticipate making a discretionary contribution to our pension plans in 2016. As we've previously mentioned, we did make a $200 million discretionary contribution in 2015. 
Before moving on to Page 10, I want to mention that we expect our 2016 bookings to be between $25 billion and $26 billion, driven by demand from a broad base of domestic and international customers. And we expect stronger bookings in the second half of the year, similar to the last several years. 
Continuing on to Page 10. Before I cover the 2016 guidance by business, it's important to note that effective January 1, 2016, we reorganized the IDS and IIS business segments to move certain air traffic systems, border and critical infrastructure protection and highway tolling programs from IDS to IIS. We did this to more efficiently leverage our capabilities within the businesses. To assist you with your modeling, you'll find the recast segment data in the attachments provided at the end of the earnings release. 
Now moving to our initial 2016 guidance by business. At the midpoint of the sales range, we expect to see growth in all of our businesses in 2016. With respect to segment margins, consistent with our prior comments, we expect 2016 margins to continue to be solid in the 12.4% to 12.6% range, which is in line to slightly up when you compare to 2015 excluding the eBorders settlement. And similar to 2015, our 2016 segment margin outlook assumes that IR&D is approximately 3% of sales. 
I would also like to point out that when it makes sense, we have and will continue to make opportunistic investments in specific next-generation U.S. programs to better position the company for a longer-term organic growth, investments which we believe will create value for our shareholders. 
At IDS, we see margins in the 15.9% to 16.1% range. I want to point out that our full year 2016 guidance includes positive operating income at IDS related to an expected exit from certain business ventures later in 2016, which you can think of in the $100 million to $125 million range. Excluding this, the change from 2015 is driven by mix. Most notably, we are continuing to ramp up on several new programs, including on a couple of Patriot awards that we received in early 2015 from South Korea and Saudi Arabia. As you know, we typically see lower margins at the inception of longer duration programs, which can increase over time as we retire risk and drive operational efficiencies. 
We expect IIS margins of 7.4% to 7.6%. This is in line year-over-year when you adjust for the 2015 eBorders settlement. 
We see missiles margins in the 13% to 13.2% range, consistent with 2015. 
SAS margins are expected to be in the 12.9% to 13.1% range, down from 2015, driven by mix as a result of completing some international programs as well as from higher business investments in 2016. 
And at Forcepoint, we expect margins to be in the 11.5% to 12.5% range. This includes the impact from the Stonesoft acquisition that Tom discussed earlier. Without this impact, margins would be approximately 15%. 
If you'd now turn to Page 11. We've provided you with our 2016 outlook by quarter. You'll notice that sales ramped up throughout the year. 
And on Page 12, as we have done in the past, we've provided a summary of the financial impact from pensions in 2015 as well as the projected impact for 2016 through 2018, holding all assumptions constant. As I mentioned earlier, we see the FAS/CAS Adjustment in 2016 at a positive $428 million, which reflects our investment returns in 2015 on our U.S. pension assets, which were flat in the December 31 discount rate of 4.5%. The discount rate is up 40 basis points from last year. Looking beyond 2016, keep in mind, each 25 basis point change in the discount rate drives a $70 million to $80 million change in FAS/CAS. 
And finally, on Page 13, we have provided an updated 3-year outlook of the acquisition accounting adjustments to help you with your long-term modeling. Please note that you'll see a significant decline in the deferred revenue adjustment over the period, and the amortization of acquired intangible assets will begin to decline more significantly after 2018. 
Before concluding, as we have discussed on past earnings calls with regard to our capital deployment strategy, we expect to continue to generate strong free cash flow and maintain a strong balance sheet at our current credit rating going forward. We remain focused on deploying capital to create value for our shareholders and customers. This includes internal investments to support our growth plans as well as returning capital to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends, making smaller targeted acquisitions that fit our technology and global growth needs, and from time to time, making discretionary contributions to our pension plans. 
Let me conclude by saying that in 2015, Raytheon again delivered solid operating performance with bookings, sales, earnings and operating cash flow all on or ahead of expectations. Book-to-bill was strong, and our international business grew significantly. We have a strong balance sheet, which gives us flexibility and options to continue to drive shareholder value, and we are well positioned to grow in 2016 and beyond, both in our international and domestic business. 
So with that, we'll open up the call for questions."

It's influenced by, as you would expect, the timing of awards, especially in 2015, and we had a strong back half to the year. So we see an influence to the ramp up in the second half of the year, in part, driven by the growth and the timing of the awards we saw in late '15. That flows through, obviously, to the EPS cadence. And the other thing I would add, the exit of business ventures at IDS that I talked about, that's planned to be in the second half in Q3, which has an influence on the back half cadence from an EPS point of view as well."

Let me kind of walk through that and try to give some more color around that.

Let me kind of walk through that and try to give some more color around that. So as I mentioned, and you alluded to, we do have $100 million to $125 million in the 2016 forecast for IDS related to the exit of a business venture. I will note, at IDS, in any given year, in part, because of the nature of their programs and the size of them, we have had favorable profit adjustments that were significant, maybe about the half of the size of this, if you look back over time. So this pickup is a bit larger. But it does help to offset in '16 some of the mix that we've been talking about that you just referred to with the ramp up of these programs that are in the early stages. Further, as we've talked about at both IDS and across the company, we are investing more, particularly in strategic areas where we do see significant growth opportunities. We also continue to execute on some lower margin programs at IDS, such as AMDR, the Qatar ADOC, a classified radar program that we won last year. And all this taken together is a key component of our growth story. But in the near term, it is impacting our IDS margins as well. At the end of the day, even with the IDS margin, we have been able to maintain a solid company margin position and deliver top line growth due to the strength of the portfolio. And we continue to be focused on driving down our costs, overhead and other costs, for the last several years. And as you know, we've seen significant improvements from a number of different initiatives there around facilities, reductions, factory automation, strategic sourcing, expanding our shared services, working on our organization structure when we've collapsed from 6 to 4 businesses. And as we've talked about, internationally, we changed our model on how we approached international business. And that is clearly paying off from a growth perspective, overall and internationally. As we now are resuming growth, we'll continue to drive cost down with our objective to improve and grow earnings through both top line and margin improvement. As far as the cadence of IDS margin going forward, I would think of it this way. As you said, if you were to adjust for the exit of the business venture, I think as we said in the past, we would expect year-over-year, to continue to see IDS margins improve incrementally. Again, adjusting for the impact of the business venture as these larger production programs that run 5 years kind of get into the sweet spot into '17 and '18, which would drive that improved margin at IDS."

And it's usually in the plus or minus the third year of those programs, which will be starting in '17 when we normally see the opportunity to retire risk, drive efficiencies. We also had, if you recall, at the end of '14, a major award for Qatar. Again, that will kind of be hitting its sweet spot when we get into '17.

And the words they used, I've mentioned this before and I heard it again, just to say several weeks ago, is that a strong defense is a strong deterrence. And in fact, during my trip, we uncovered or were told about several other opportunities in the region. So if anything, we're seeing a stronger demand than a slowdown.

If you recall, back April, May of last year when we announced the Websense deal, for that acquisition, we started with that convention but only limited to that acquisition.

So we purposely deferred that to the end of the year to have kind of a clean break going into '16, and it obviously puts both of those elements on the same basis consistently across the company. So that's Part 1, why we did it. As far as the second part of your question, are we concerned about the businesses wanting or being willing to pay more? Even if that were to be the case, we've got a pretty disciplined process here at the company. We've got a core team, an acquisition review team, that all acquisitions have to go through. I'm on that. Tom's on that, as you would imagine, a few others. And through that, we spend a lot of time around valuation, looking at it 2, 3 different ways. And I won't get into any stats, but I would tell you, there are plenty of deals in the past that we lost because we wouldn't bid higher, right? We lost on price, for lack of a better way to say it.

So I think number 1 is, we do invest inside the company relative to ensuring that we have the right discriminators and differentiators to compete across all our businesses, and not only just to compete, but obviously to win.

And that's been our overall strategy over the years. We look at programs that are going to have runs for decades. What's the next Patriot? One of the examples is this Air and Missile Defense Radar, that's going to be our next major franchise coming to fruition here in the next several years; Next Generation Jammer win; the FAB-T win. These are all franchise programs. And we made sure that over the years that we had been investing in the right IRAD, in the right -- the capital to support those projects, and then also in having the right talent on board. And that's just something that we do as part of the company moving forward. Now the good news is that we're seeing the results of those investments, and the results are these franchises that we won over the last couple of years.

And then the other capital investments that we made are the normal investments we make to essentially be able to operate our factory in a lean and efficient manner. So that's -- I'll put that in context. And let me put together the opportunities for Patriot in context. There was just a recent announcement by the new Minister of Defense, Macierewicz, in Poland relative to his support of pursuing the Patriot program with the U.S. government. In fact, he kind of did a joint announcement with the U.S. ambassador to Poland on that subject with an objective to be able to get something going here this year. So that's a really good news for us. That's a very large potential program for Poland there. And I just -- as I mentioned earlier, I just returned from the Middle East and there's strong demand for additional Patriot assets there. I mentioned in my script a number of -- over 10 intercepts by Patriot against ballistic missiles, just in that region of the Middle East. So there's a strong demand across Eastern Europe and also the Middle East for additional Patriot assets, but also for upgrade. For example, there's -- just in the upgrade area alone, there's an opportunity to upgrade 72 fire units just to Configuration 3+. So there's upgrade potentials. And then there's also the new potentials for countries like Poland and adding additional fire units to other countries in the Middle East region. And I'm sure you're reading the newspapers, like as the information that I'm getting, especially of all the Asia Pacific activities that are going on. In fact, today, there was an article relative to FAD in Korea where we also have just gotten an award on Patriot there too. So the bottom line is there seems to be a significant demand out there across multiple areas, Eastern Europe, Asia Pacific region and the Middle East, for missile defense. And then Patriot is the system that's proven and is the system of choice for these nations. That's what we're seeing."

So I think that's getting out there, that, that capability is available, and we're hearing -- getting demand signals from customers on that. So the bottom line is, is Patriot is a franchise, and we continue to evolve it. We continue to upgrade it, increase its capabilities, add new technologies, and it's -- we're seeing increased demand across those 3 major areas of the world.

For those that don't know, we do the Aegis radar and all the components and the subsystems for that radar. That alone is, for example, over $300 million. And then in the whole area of missiles, both air-to-air and air-to-surface missiles, a significant demand of greater than $3 billion across multiple missiles, so they're multiple contracts. There's no one contract in missiles that's going to do it. But that's our portfolio. We have a very diverse portfolio that allows us to add these systems up. International ISR was over $700 million. And then we have our normal airborne radars and ISR EO/IR systems. That's probably pretty close to $1 billion. So I think what's different this year than others is we're seeing demand signals across our whole portfolio on the international side. And you say, ""Why is that?"" Well, we mentioned before that we changed our strategy about 2 years ago. We went from a regional strategy to a country strategy. And in that country strategy, we focused not on the 1 or 2 customers we've had in the past 30 years, but we expanded that. And now we're seeing that. But these other customers are buying in the order of $500 million to $1 billion programs, not just a $2 billion program.

I am very pleased with both our fourth quarter and full year 2015 results, and I'd like to begin by touching on a few highlights. 
Our total book-to-bill ratio for the year was 1.09. This reflects strong global demand for our advanced solutions and positions us well going into 2016. We finished the full year with top line growth of 2%, driven by our growth in our international business, which more than offset a slight decline in domestic. Company segment margins in 2015 were as expected at 13.1% as the team delivered solid operating performance. 
Cash flow was also solid, providing us the opportunity to return the majority of our cash flow to shareholders, while also funding our pension plans and investing in our future growth. So all in all, the company is performing very well, and we are confident in our future. 
As you can see from our 2015 results and the 2016 outlook, the global threat environment continues to drive demand for Raytheon solutions. I would also add that in my conversations with our global customers, it is clear that short-term shifts and economic growth factors have taken a backseat to ensuring the sovereignty and security of the nations that face these security threats. In particular, let me highlight what we are seeing in 3 regions. 
In the Middle East, demand signals increased last year, despite the decline in oil prices. Tensions within the region are driving demand for missile defense, long-range radars, modernized command to control systems, sensors, cybersecurity and precision munitions, areas that align with our core strengths. I've been asked many times how oil prices have impacted demand. From our viewpoint, we have not seen a negative impact, and here is one of many examples why. Over the past year alone, Patriot has intercepted more than a dozen ballistic missiles fired in the region, missiles that otherwise could have caused significant casualties and damage to critical infrastructure and defense sites. 
In the Asia Pacific region, customers are also updating their missile defense systems, sensors and other capabilities in light of recent developments there. Increased tensions related to territorial disputes and evolving economic interests are motivating allies in this region to invest more heavily in deterrent capabilities to protect their national interests. As you may recall, South Korea awarded us a significant upgrade to its Patriot Systems in 2015. Looking forward in 2016, we see opportunities across the region in tactical radars, ship-based radars, missiles, force protection systems and precision munitions. 
And in Europe, we are seeing renewed and increased interest from a number of countries in acquiring integrated air and missile defense solutions, providing additional opportunities for Patriot and NASAMs. 
Domestically, we were pleased to see the passage of the Bipartisan Budget Act, which adjusted the defense budget caps higher for fiscal year '16 and fiscal year '17, including a 15% increase in modernization funding in fiscal year '16. These changes provided much-needed funding for our armed forces, while also improving visibility and predictability for the defense industry. This will yield a positive impact on our results beginning in 2016 and then continuing into 2017. 
Even as we emerge from several years of declining U.S. Defense budgets, are now beginning to see growth, the environment remains competitive. To ensure Raytheon's long-term competitive advantage, we have increased our independent research and development, capital expenditures and other investments to fund the development of the advanced game-changing technologies of the future, ranging from hypersonics and cybersecurity to directed energy. As expected, IR&D reached 3% of our sales in 2015, a similar level as expected in 2016. 
And let me give you some more details about our 2015 results. Strong demand from global customers drove bookings of $25.2 billion for the full year, a 5% increase over 2014. Domestic bookings were strong with a full year book-to-bill ratio of 1.04. This sets up a better-than-originally-expected domestic revenue growth outlook for 2016, which I'll discuss more in a moment. 
International comprised 34% of our total bookings in 2015, and our international book-to-bill ratio was a very robust 1.19 for the year. Total backlog at the end of 2015 was $34.7 billion, an increase of $1.1 billion over 2014, again providing a solid foundation as we move into 2016. International ended the year at 43% of total backlog compared to 40% at year-end 2014. Successful execution of our growth strategy and increasing demand from our global customers resulted in a return of growth in 2015, a year earlier than we had originally expected. Our full year 2015 international sales increased 9% over 2014, reaching 31% of our total annual sales, a new company record. 
In addition, for the second consecutive year, we saw a good growth in classified sales, which increased about 6% in the year. In this environment, we are also continuously looking for more ways to lower our cost, enhance our competitiveness and improve affordability for our customers. A few examples include executing our strategic sourcing strategy to reduce cost in our supply chain, leveraging our centralized global business services organization to more efficiently provide back office support to the businesses and reducing our footprint, taking out a gross total of 1.9 million square feet in 2015. In addition, we have kicked off a new complexity reduction initiative to reduce costs and simplify business processes across the company. 
Looking forward to 2016, we expect to see continued strong demand that should ultimately drive our bookings to the $25 billion to $26 billion range for the year. This would translate into a book-to-bill ratio of approximately 1.05. Key bookings for the year include Qatar early warning radar, the EMD phase of the Next Generation Jammer and SM-3. More than ever before, demand from our global customers is broad-based and diversified. 
Along with these strong bookings we experienced in 2015, this continued strength should position us well to deliver revenue growth of between 3% to 5% in 2016, which is better than what we had mentioned when we provided our initial outlook during the Q3 earnings call. I would add that this includes an expectation of 2% to 4% growth from domestic customers. This would be the first time we've seen growth in our domestic business since 2009. Further, cash flow from operations is expected to increase significantly in 2016 from solid 2015 levels. 
This strong fundamental performance provides the foundation for the continuation of our balanced capital deployment strategy, with the objective of creating shareholder value. Our #1 priority remains executing our growth strategy and investing in our sales. Beyond this, we remain committed to providing a competitive dividend. We also continue to see value in our stock and expect to continue the share buyback at the 2015's robust levels. 
Part of our growth strategy is bringing our advanced cybersecurity capabilities to government and commercial customers around the world. In 2015, in support of this strategy, we increased our presence in the commercial cybersecurity market in a meaningful way with the formation of Raytheon|Websense. And earlier this month, we changed its name to Forcepoint to more effectively brand and position our broad cybersecurity capabilities in the market. We further strengthened Forcepoint by completing the acquisition of Stonesoft after the close of the fourth quarter. The small acquisition, which is consistent with our M&A strategy that we've articulated over the past several calls, provides next-generation firewall technology that fills an important technology gap and broadens our cybersecurity capabilities. The Stonesoft acquisition will become part of the Forcepoint business segment. We're excited about the breadth and depth of the product offerings at Forcepoint that place us in a strong competitive position. 
I'd like to close by thanking the Raytheon team for a great year and for the dedication and all the efforts that went into returning the company to growth ahead of schedule, while continuing to deliver for our global customers. 
With that, let me turn it over to Toby."
105612,322029158,923046,"Raytheon Company, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2016",2016-01-28,"Earnings Calls","Raytheon Company","Executives","Okay. Thanks, Tom.

I have a few opening remarks, starting with the fourth quarter and full year results, then I'll discuss our outlook for 2016. After that, we'll open up the call for questions. During my remarks, I will be referring to the web slides that we issued earlier this morning, which are posted on our website. Okay, would everyone please move to Page 3.
We are pleased with the solid performance the team delivered in both the fourth quarter and the full year, with bookings, sales, EPS and operating cash flow all consistent with or better than our expectations. We had strong bookings in the fourth quarter at $7.9 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.24. And for the year, we had bookings of $25.2 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.09. This sets the stage for continued growth in 2016, which I'll discuss in more detail in just a few minutes. 
Sales were $6.3 billion in the quarter, up 3%, led by our missiles, IDS and Forcepoint businesses. International sales grew 16% in the fourth quarter. And for the year, sales were up 2%, ending at $23.2 billion. 
Our EPS from continuing operations was $1.85 for the quarter and $6.75 for the full year, which I will give a little more color on in a few minutes. We also generated strong operating cash flow of $813 million for the quarter and $2.3 billion for the year after a $200 million pretax discretionary pension contribution, which was not in our prior guidance. 
Additionally, during the quarter, the company repurchased 2 million shares of common stock for $250 million, bringing the full year 2015 repurchases to 9 million shares for about $1 billion. As we have previously disclosed in the fourth quarter of 2015, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $2 billion of the company's outstanding common stock. The company ended the year with a solid balance sheet and net debt of approximately $2.1 billion. 
Turning now to Page 4. Let me go through some of the details of our fourth quarter and full year results. As I mentioned earlier, we had strong bookings of $7.9 billion in the quarter and $25.2 billion for the full year, resulting in a year-end backlog of $34.7 billion. The company ended 2015 with a funded backlog of $25.1 billion, an increase of $2 billion from year-end 2014. It's worth noting that both IDS and Missile Systems had outstanding bookings performance for the full year 2015. For the quarter, international orders represented 27% of our total company bookings and for the full year was 34% of total bookings. And as Tom mentioned earlier, at the end of 2015, approximately 43% of our total backlog was international. 
Turning now to Page 5. We had fourth quarter sales of $6.3 billion, up 3% over the same period in 2014. This was at the high end of the guidance range we had set in October. 
So looking now at the businesses. IDS had net sales of $1.7 billion in the quarter, and they were up 5% from the same period last year, primarily due to higher sales on certain international Patriot programs and on the Air Warfare Destroyer program. Net sales at IIS were $1.4 billion in the quarter, down from the same period last year, primarily due to lower sales on an international classified program. Missile Systems had fourth quarter 2015 net sales of $1.9 billion, up 9% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. The increase was primarily due to higher sales on Paveway. SAS had net sales of $1.6 billion in Q4. The change was spread across numerous programs with no one significant driver. And for Forcepoint, the increase was primarily due to the acquisition of Websense, which we completed in the second quarter of 2015. As a reminder, fourth quarter 2014 included the results for Raytheon Cyber Products only. 
For the full year, sales were $23.2 billion, up approximately 2% over full-year 2014, consistent with expectations. International sales growth more than offset a slight decline in domestic sales. 
Moving ahead to Page 6. We delivered solid operational performance in the quarter and the full year. Looking at business margins in the quarter. As expected in the fourth quarter of 2015, IDS received a contract modification to restructure the AWD program, essentially separating our incentive fees from the shipyard's performance. This resulted in a favorable $53 million adjustment in the fourth quarter of 2015 for IDS. Missile Systems and SAS margins both exceeded the guidance range that we provided back in October, while both IIS and Forcepoint met our guidance.
Turning to Page 7. We had solid operating margin performance for the year. Segment margins were 13.1%, which was consistent with our expectations. And as a reminder, this included $181 million for the eBorder settlement earlier in the year at IIS, worth about 80 basis points. 
On Page 8, you'll see both the fourth quarter and full year EPS. In the fourth quarter 2015, our EPS was $1.85, and for the full year was $6.75. EPS for the quarter was strong and above the guidance we provided you in October, even after accounting for the extension of the R&D tax credit. As a reminder, the R&D tax credit was worth about $0.11 and was not in our prior guidance. 
Moving on to our 2016 guidance on Page 9. We see sales in the range of between $24 billion and $24.5 billion, up 3% to 5% from 2015. The increase is driven by growth in both our domestic and international business. Our 2016 outlook for the deferred revenue adjustment is $67 million, and for the amortization of acquired intangibles is $121 million. It's important to note that effective January 1, 2016, we reclassified amortization of acquired intangibles and the deferred revenue adjustment. This change affects all businesses other than Forcepoint, which had already been reporting that way. 
These noncash items will no longer be reported within the business segments. Instead, these will be reported in separate deferred revenue adjustment and amortization of acquired intangibles lines that we have provided for you here. A reconciliation that walks you from the prior method to the current one is in Attachment G to the press release. 
As for pension, we see the 2016 FAS/CAS Adjustment at a positive $428 million, which I'll discuss in just a minute. We expect net interest expense to be between $220 million and $230 million. We see our average diluted shares outstanding to be between $296 million and $298 million on a full year basis, a reduction of approximately 2% to 3%, driven by the continuation of our share repurchase program, which we expect at levels comparable to 2015. 
We expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 30%. Our 2016 tax rate is higher than 2015, primarily due to the $0.29 per share favorable tax settlement we received in 2015. It's important to note that our 2016 tax rate includes the R&D tax credit, which was permanently extended at the end of 2015. 
In 2016, we see our EPS to be in the range of $6.80 to $7. Our operating cash flow for continuing operations for 2016 is expected to be between $2.7 billion and $3 billion compared to $2.3 billion in 2015. 
As we sit here today, we do not anticipate making a discretionary contribution to our pension plans in 2016. As we've previously mentioned, we did make a $200 million discretionary contribution in 2015. 
Before moving on to Page 10, I want to mention that we expect our 2016 bookings to be between $25 billion and $26 billion, driven by demand from a broad base of domestic and international customers. And we expect stronger bookings in the second half of the year, similar to the last several years. 
Continuing on to Page 10. Before I cover the 2016 guidance by business, it's important to note that effective January 1, 2016, we reorganized the IDS and IIS business segments to move certain air traffic systems, border and critical infrastructure protection and highway tolling programs from IDS to IIS. We did this to more efficiently leverage our capabilities within the businesses. To assist you with your modeling, you'll find the recast segment data in the attachments provided at the end of the earnings release. 
Now moving to our initial 2016 guidance by business. At the midpoint of the sales range, we expect to see growth in all of our businesses in 2016. With respect to segment margins, consistent with our prior comments, we expect 2016 margins to continue to be solid in the 12.4% to 12.6% range, which is in line to slightly up when you compare to 2015 excluding the eBorders settlement. And similar to 2015, our 2016 segment margin outlook assumes that IR&D is approximately 3% of sales. 
I would also like to point out that when it makes sense, we have and will continue to make opportunistic investments in specific next-generation U.S. programs to better position the company for a longer-term organic growth, investments which we believe will create value for our shareholders. 
At IDS, we see margins in the 15.9% to 16.1% range. I want to point out that our full year 2016 guidance includes positive operating income at IDS related to an expected exit from certain business ventures later in 2016, which you can think of in the $100 million to $125 million range. Excluding this, the change from 2015 is driven by mix. Most notably, we are continuing to ramp up on several new programs, including on a couple of Patriot awards that we received in early 2015 from South Korea and Saudi Arabia. As you know, we typically see lower margins at the inception of longer duration programs, which can increase over time as we retire risk and drive operational efficiencies. 
We expect IIS margins of 7.4% to 7.6%. This is in line year-over-year when you adjust for the 2015 eBorders settlement. 
We see missiles margins in the 13% to 13.2% range, consistent with 2015. 
SAS margins are expected to be in the 12.9% to 13.1% range, down from 2015, driven by mix as a result of completing some international programs as well as from higher business investments in 2016. 
And at Forcepoint, we expect margins to be in the 11.5% to 12.5% range. This includes the impact from the Stonesoft acquisition that Tom discussed earlier. Without this impact, margins would be approximately 15%. 
If you'd now turn to Page 11. We've provided you with our 2016 outlook by quarter. You'll notice that sales ramped up throughout the year. 
And on Page 12, as we have done in the past, we've provided a summary of the financial impact from pensions in 2015 as well as the projected impact for 2016 through 2018, holding all assumptions constant. As I mentioned earlier, we see the FAS/CAS Adjustment in 2016 at a positive $428 million, which reflects our investment returns in 2015 on our U.S. pension assets, which were flat in the December 31 discount rate of 4.5%. The discount rate is up 40 basis points from last year. Looking beyond 2016, keep in mind, each 25 basis point change in the discount rate drives a $70 million to $80 million change in FAS/CAS. 
And finally, on Page 13, we have provided an updated 3-year outlook of the acquisition accounting adjustments to help you with your long-term modeling. Please note that you'll see a significant decline in the deferred revenue adjustment over the period, and the amortization of acquired intangible assets will begin to decline more significantly after 2018. 
Before concluding, as we have discussed on past earnings calls with regard to our capital deployment strategy, we expect to continue to generate strong free cash flow and maintain a strong balance sheet at our current credit rating going forward. We remain focused on deploying capital to create value for our shareholders and customers. This includes internal investments to support our growth plans as well as returning capital to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends, making smaller targeted acquisitions that fit our technology and global growth needs, and from time to time, making discretionary contributions to our pension plans. 
Let me conclude by saying that in 2015, Raytheon again delivered solid operating performance with bookings, sales, earnings and operating cash flow all on or ahead of expectations. Book-to-bill was strong, and our international business grew significantly. We have a strong balance sheet, which gives us flexibility and options to continue to drive shareholder value, and we are well positioned to grow in 2016 and beyond, both in our international and domestic business. 
So with that, we'll open up the call for questions."

So we see an influence to the ramp up in the second half of the year, in part, driven by the growth and the timing of the awards we saw in late '15. That flows through, obviously, to the EPS cadence. And the other thing I would add, the exit of business ventures at IDS that I talked about, that's planned to be in the second half in Q3, which has an influence on the back half cadence from an EPS point of view as well."

Because if we go back a year ago, when you were looking forward, you were expecting some margin expansion, that you would see operating margins up in the 15% range. And it seemed as the year went on, and you looked at the new awards coming in, that pushed out in time, that margin expansion. But now as you look at 2016 and if you make adjustments for the exit from these businesses, it seems like you're still at a lower margin level than one might think or one might have expected. Can you talk about how you look at that IDS trajectory now? I know you mentioned a couple of the new programs which will -- you may have put some pressure on margins in the near term. But I'm trying to understand when we can expect to get kind of the full margin advantage one might expect from a mature set of international programs."

Let me kind of walk through that and try to give some more color around that.

Let me kind of walk through that and try to give some more color around that. So as I mentioned, and you alluded to, we do have $100 million to $125 million in the 2016 forecast for IDS related to the exit of a business venture. I will note, at IDS, in any given year, in part, because of the nature of their programs and the size of them, we have had favorable profit adjustments that were significant, maybe about the half of the size of this, if you look back over time. So this pickup is a bit larger. But it does help to offset in '16 some of the mix that we've been talking about that you just referred to with the ramp up of these programs that are in the early stages. Further, as we've talked about at both IDS and across the company, we are investing more, particularly in strategic areas where we do see significant growth opportunities. We also continue to execute on some lower margin programs at IDS, such as AMDR, the Qatar ADOC, a classified radar program that we won last year. And all this taken together is a key component of our growth story. But in the near term, it is impacting our IDS margins as well. At the end of the day, even with the IDS margin, we have been able to maintain a solid company margin position and deliver top line growth due to the strength of the portfolio. And we continue to be focused on driving down our costs, overhead and other costs, for the last several years. And as you know, we've seen significant improvements from a number of different initiatives there around facilities, reductions, factory automation, strategic sourcing, expanding our shared services, working on our organization structure when we've collapsed from 6 to 4 businesses. And as we've talked about, internationally, we changed our model on how we approached international business. And that is clearly paying off from a growth perspective, overall and internationally. As we now are resuming growth, we'll continue to drive cost down with our objective to improve and grow earnings through both top line and margin improvement. As far as the cadence of IDS margin going forward, I would think of it this way. As you said, if you were to adjust for the exit of the business venture, I think as we said in the past, we would expect year-over-year, to continue to see IDS margins improve incrementally. Again, adjusting for the impact of the business venture as these larger production programs that run 5 years kind of get into the sweet spot into '17 and '18, which would drive that improved margin at IDS."

And those are -- we're only a year into those, right? And it's usually in the plus or minus the third year of those programs, which will be starting in '17 when we normally see the opportunity to retire risk, drive efficiencies. We also had, if you recall, at the end of '14, a major award for Qatar. Again, that will kind of be hitting its sweet spot when we get into '17.

And then the other capital investments that we made are the normal investments we make to essentially be able to operate our factory in a lean and efficient manner. So that's -- I'll put that in context. And let me put together the opportunities for Patriot in context. There was just a recent announcement by the new Minister of Defense, Macierewicz, in Poland relative to his support of pursuing the Patriot program with the U.S. government. In fact, he kind of did a joint announcement with the U.S. ambassador to Poland on that subject with an objective to be able to get something going here this year. So that's a really good news for us. That's a very large potential program for Poland there. And I just -- as I mentioned earlier, I just returned from the Middle East and there's strong demand for additional Patriot assets there. I mentioned in my script a number of -- over 10 intercepts by Patriot against ballistic missiles, just in that region of the Middle East. So there's a strong demand across Eastern Europe and also the Middle East for additional Patriot assets, but also for upgrade. For example, there's -- just in the upgrade area alone, there's an opportunity to upgrade 72 fire units just to Configuration 3+. So there's upgrade potentials. And then there's also the new potentials for countries like Poland and adding additional fire units to other countries in the Middle East region. And I'm sure you're reading the newspapers, like as the information that I'm getting, especially of all the Asia Pacific activities that are going on. In fact, today, there was an article relative to FAD in Korea where we also have just gotten an award on Patriot there too. So the bottom line is there seems to be a significant demand out there across multiple areas, Eastern Europe, Asia Pacific region and the Middle East, for missile defense. And then Patriot is the system that's proven and is the system of choice for these nations. That's what we're seeing."

By the way, it was -- that was one of the requests that I had in several of my meetings with key leaders in the Middle East, was a desire to have our new AESA 360 system added to their configurations. So I think that's getting out there, that, that capability is available, and we're hearing -- getting demand signals from customers on that. So the bottom line is, is Patriot is a franchise, and we continue to evolve it. We continue to upgrade it, increase its capabilities, add new technologies, and it's -- we're seeing increased demand across those 3 major areas of the world.

We also have international Patriot, greater than $1 billion worth of bookings that are in play. We have other activities in Qatar, which we're pursuing and we believe are accessible this year. There's a whole FMS in the area of Aegis, supporting Aegis Ashore. And also, upgrades on some ships in the international marketplace. For those that don't know, we do the Aegis radar and all the components and the subsystems for that radar. That alone is, for example, over $300 million. And then in the whole area of missiles, both air-to-air and air-to-surface missiles, a significant demand of greater than $3 billion across multiple missiles, so they're multiple contracts. There's no one contract in missiles that's going to do it. But that's our portfolio. We have a very diverse portfolio that allows us to add these systems up. International ISR was over $700 million. And then we have our normal airborne radars and ISR EO/IR systems. That's probably pretty close to $1 billion. So I think what's different this year than others is we're seeing demand signals across our whole portfolio on the international side. And you say, ""Why is that?"" Well, we mentioned before that we changed our strategy about 2 years ago. We went from a regional strategy to a country strategy. And in that country strategy, we focused not on the 1 or 2 customers we've had in the past 30 years, but we expanded that. And now we're seeing that. But these other customers are buying in the order of $500 million to $1 billion programs, not just a $2 billion program.

Good morning, everyone. Raytheon has had a good start out of the gates in 2016, so the company bookings reached 39% in the first quarter and book-to-bill ratio was 1.08, driven in part by a large year-over-year increase in demand in the Middle East, North Africa region as well as strong domestic bookings. Our first quarter sales were well above our expectations with strong growth at our Missile business. Cash flow and EPS were also better-than-expected. This good start gives us continued confidence in our full year outlook. 
Toby will cover the financial details with you in a few moments. Across our global markets, demand for precision unions, command-and-control including C5I solutions, force protection, integrated air and missile defense ISR platforms continues to be strong. As we've seen in prior quarters, our Middle East and North African customers are continuing to look past in term volatility in oil prices and are investing in high priority solutions to address an immediate and rapidly evolving threat environment. 
I visited the region earlier this month to celebrate our 50th anniversary in Saudi Arabia and met with customers. While there, I received firsthand feedback about the successful performance of our products and how they are helping protect citizens and critical infrastructure everyday. I can tell you from these discussions that the interest level across the entire region remains high for the types ofadvanced solutions we offer. One of the more significant upcoming opportunities includes an early warning radar system for Qatar at IDS, which we expect to be awarded later this year. This program, which will significantly increase the air and missile defense sensing capabilities for Qatar as a value approaching of $1 billion and has already been through the congressional notification process. As I mentioned earlier, our bookings in the quarter were strong. When looking across the businesses, at  key driver was space and airborne systems, which had a book-to-bill ratio of 1.7 in the quarter, driven by domestic space-based sensor solutions and both domestic and international classified. This was the second consecutive quarter of strong bookings at SAS. And building on this, after the close of the first quarter, we announced that SAS has received a $1 billion bookings  for the engineering and manufacturing development phase for the next-generation jammer franchise. These awards provide a solid foundation from which SAS will ramp sales growth into the second half of this year. In addition to SAS, we also saw a strong year-over-year increase in bookings in Missile systems, driven by a number of products including AMRAAM and SM-6. 
Before moving on, I would like to point out that our overall domestic classified business, which expressed a significant increase in full year 2015 bookings, continued to see strong demand into the first quarter of 2016. Book-to-bill for the total company domestic classified was 1.3 in the quarter. First quarter sales of the company increased 9% year-over-year. Our international revenue was up 17% and represented 30% of total sales. Domestic sales were up 6% with domestic classified sales increasing 12%. 
As I mentioned earlier, one of the key drivers of the company's first quarter sales was Missile Systems. Let me take a few moments to talk a little bit more about what is driving activity at Missiles. As many of you know, our Missile business includes a number of franchise programs. A global customers look to us to ensure that these programs continue to offer the most advanced capabilities, so that they can stay ahead of evolving threats. A great example of this in the quarter was solid growth from AMRAAM, where we are ramping up production on the latest most advanced version of the missile, 20D, while this missile shares the AMRAAM name with earlier versions and is vastly more capable across of our program portfolio and missiles, there are many other examples, where we create value by upgrading the systems technology including programs, such as the Missile, a premier ship missile for our global customers. Also, we are seeing opportunities to adapt the existing technology to new missions, such as in the case of SM-6 and Tom Hawk, which are now expanding into the anti-ship domain. 
Finally, we are developing new capabilities that are on the cutting edge of innovation, including hypersonics and directed energy. In addition to this, another growth driver of Missile Systems has been the increase in operating tempo of our U.S. interest of customers. As we sit here today, we see this continuing to be a revenue tailwind for the company at least through next year. The taking a step back, when you look at Raytheon over the past several quarters, it reinforces the value of our diverse portfolio of advanced solutions for our global customers. A recent book extent that SAS and Missile Systems, a significant bookings in longer cycle programs at IDS over the past couple of years as well as upcoming opportunities and the competitive position of IIS and Forcepoint and global cybersecurity marketsmore provide a strong foundation for future growth and margin expansion. 
We were encouraged by the U.S. fiscal year 2017 defense budget request in fight up request, which was released in February. The overall top line for the fiscal year '17 budget is consistent with the Bipartisan Budget Act 2015. With key electronic warfare, ISR, Missile defense, cyber and long-range strike, all areas that played to our strengths. And Department of Defense focused on high-end capabilities through its offset strategy elements aligns well with our high-end capabilities Raytheon is known for, and we are actively working with DoD in this area. We continue to see broad-based support for funding a robust national defense. 
Turning now to Forcepoint. We American's double progress to completing the integration of recent decorations recovery performance in the quarter was solid and above our expectation for the business remains on track to meet the growth objectives we outlined for you in prior calls as much as integration behind this. As today we announced the change in leadership at Forcepoint. Matthew was previously at Harbour Networks, will take over as Forcepoint CEO on May 9th. This change is designed to build on the growth capabilities of the integrated businesses. Matt has the background of managing technology companies and has a proven track record of driving growth. John McCormack who did an outstanding job managing Forcepoint, both when it was private and during the integration of with Raytheon staying on through the end of the year as an adviser. We thank john for all of his hard work and help is positioning Forcepoint to move to the next level. Forcepoint remains well positioned for the future. 
During the first quarter, we continue to execute our balanced capital deployment strategy. In March, we raised our dividend by 9.3%. This is the 12th consecutive annual increase will increase to our dividend, it reflects our view at a sustainable competitive dividend as a key capital deployment priority. 
We also repurchased $400 million of stock through our share repurchase program. And as we said on the call in January, we expect full year 2016 share buyback to approximately 2015 levels, market conditions permitting. 
Before concluding, I would like to touch on the topic that we don't often talk about on earnings calls, which is at most important to our shareholders, and that is corporate governance. The company is committed to being a leader in contemporary corporate governance, and we believe that good governance and as a shareholder value. In recent years, we have adopted a number of policies, processes and practices to ensure effective governments. To this end, in March, the Board of Directors voted to amend the company's bylaws to implement proxy access. Providing shareholders with the process by which they can include nominees and the company's annual meeting proxy materials. The implementation of proxy access follows on our previous adoption of shareholder action by written consent in 2014 and a special meeting measure in 2010. And further demonstrates Raytheon's commitments to world-class governance practices. 
In summary, we had a good order quarter with solid bookings, revenue growth and EPS performance. We continue to execute our growth strategies, while at the same time placing a high priority on driving shareholder value. So thank you to the entire run wanting for the good start of 2016. Together, we have built on the momentum generated by our 2015 return to growth by delivering a strong quarter for our company, customers and shareholders. With that, I'll turn it over to Toby."

During my remarks, I will be referring to the website that we issued earlier this morning. If everyone to turn to Page 3. We are pleased with the solid performance team delivered in the first quarter with bookings, sales, EPS and operating cash flow all better than our expectations. It's a good start for the year, and we're positioned well for achieving our full year outlook. 
We had solid bookings in the first quarter of $6.2 billion, resulting in an book-to-bill ratio of 1.08. Sales were $5.8 billion in the quarter, up 9% led by our Missile, SAS and Forcepoint businesses. Our EPS from continuing operations was $1.43, which I'll give a little more color on in just a moment. We generated strong operating cash flow of $325 million in the first quarter, primarily due to the timing of collections and tax payments. During the quarter, the company bought back 3.2 million shares of common stock under the share repurchase program for $400 million. And we announced last month that we increased our dividend by 9.3%, we have now raised our annual dividend every year for the past 20 years. I also want to point out that we raise in the EPS guidance that we provided in January. I'll discuss guidance further in just a few minutes. Turning now to Page 4. Let me start by providing some detail on our first quarter results. Companies bookings for the first quarter were $6.2 billion, an increase of approximately $1.7 billion over the same period last year. 
International awards represented 27% of the total bookings. And on a trailing 4-quarter basis, the book-to-bill ratio was 1.14. A few key bookings in the first quarter included $646 million on AMRAAM at Missiles, and at SAS, over $650 million on an international classified contract and the $553 million award on the Joint Polar Satellite System program. And shortly after the close of the quarter, The U.S. Navy awarded SAS of $1 billion contract of the next-generation jammer program for engineering and manufacturing development. Backlog at the end of the first quarter was $34.8 billion and on a funded basis was $26.2 billion, an increase of approximately $2.4 million in funded backlog compared to the first quarter of 2015. It's worth noting that we ended the first quarter of 2016 with approximately 42% of our backlog compressed of international programs. 
If you now move to Page 5. As I just mentioned, for the first quarter 2016, sales were higher than the guidance we set in January. Sales were particularly strong at both Missile and at SAS. We still expect sales for the company to ramp up throughout the year with the strong second half driven by our bookings over the past several quarters and the duration of our programs. 
Looking now at sales by business. IDS had first quarter 2016 net sales of $1.3 billion. The increase from Q1 2015 was primarily driven by higher sales on certain international Patriot programs. We expect IDS sales to increase as we move through the year as some of our international Patriot programs continue to ramp up. 
In the first quarter 2016, IIS had net sales of $1.5 billion. Compared with the same quarter last year, the increase is probably due to our cybersecurity and special mission programs. Missile Systems had first quarter 2016 net sales of $1.7 billion, a 17% increase from the first quarter 2015 was primarily due to both the Paveway and AMRAAM programs. SAS had net sales of $1.5 billion higher sales on classified programs, including an international program contributed to the 7% increase versus last year. And for Forcepoint, the increase is primarily due to the acquisitions of Websense, which we completed the second quarter of 2015 and Stonesoft stones of which was acquired in the first quarter of 2016.  As a reminder, first quarter 2015 included the results for only Raytheon Cyber Products. 
Moving ahead to Page 6. Let me spend a few minutes talking about our margins. Our operating margin was up 10.6% for the total company and 10.2% on a business segment basis. We did out 2 programs with some unique circumstances that impacted our margins in the quarter, one at IDS for $36 million, that's because it's in joint venture about half was offset through the noncontrolling interest line on the income statement. And one at Missiles for $22 million. We don't see any significant remaining financial exposure on these programs. If you exclude the 2 adjustments I just mentioned, our segment margins would be about 100 basis points higher than reported. 
In addition, as we talked about on last year's first quarter call, it's also important to note that in the first quarter of 2015, Missiles recorded a $25 million or approximately 170 basis points favorable resolution of a contractual issue related to a supplier settlement. As expected, IIS and SAS margins both were down compared to same period last year, primarily driven by a change in program mix. 
Also, IIS first quarter 2015 margin included the favorable eBorders settlement worth about 340 basis points or $0.42 per share on a total company basis. And at Forcepoint, the first quarter 2016 operating margin was slightly above our expectations for the quarter, driven by strong operating performance. We remain focused on margin improvement going forward and see our base -- business segments margin in the 12.4% to 12.6% range in the full year, consistent with the guidance we laid out in January. We also see our margin cadence improving as we move throughout the year. 
As we have discussed on past calls, we are continuously working for more ways to lower our cost, enhance our competitiveness and improve affordability for our customers. In a few examples include executing our strategic sourcing strategy to reduce cost in our supply chain, factory automation, complexity reduction initiatives and reducing our footprint. Given these efforts, our strong backlog and as we progress through the life cycle with some of our production programs, we continue to see opportunities for margin expansion. 
Turning now to Page 7. First quarter 2016 EPS of $1.43 was better-than-expected, driven largely by higher volume and the unrecognized tax benefit associated with the adoption of new accounting standard for stock compensation worth about $0.05. 
On Page 8, we are updating the company's financial outlook for 2016. We will still expect our full year 2016 net sales to be in the range of between $24 billion to $24.5 billion, up 3% to 5% from 2015. The increase is driven by growth in both our domestic and international business. We have increased the full year deferred revenue adjustment by $10 million to $77 million to reflect the updated estimate of purchasing accounting related to the Stonesoft acquisition we completed earlier in the year. We have lowered our effective tax rate to reflect the tax benefit associated with the adoption of new accounting standard for stock compensation that I just discussed, which in total is worth about $0.13 for the full year, with the additional $0.08 expected in the second quarter. We now expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 28.5%. And we have raised our full year 2016 EPS to reflect the tax benefit I just mentioned. We now expect our EPS to be in a range of between $6.93 and $7.13. 
As I discussed earlier, we repurchased 3.2 million in shares of common stock for $400 million in the quarter and continue to see our diluted share count in the range of between 296 million and 298 million shares for 2016, a 3% reduction at the midpoint of the range. 
Operating cash flow in the first quarter was strong. And we continue to see our full year 2016 operating cash flow outlook between $2.7 billion and $3 billion. And as you can see on Page 9, we've included guidance by business, which is unchanged from our prior outlook. I want to reiterate that at IDS, we still see margins in the 15.9% to 16.1% range. As I said, on the general recall, our full year 2016 guidance includes positive operating income at IDS related to an expected exit from certain business ventures later in 2016, which you cna now think of in the $125 million to $150 million range. This is subject to the finalization of the transaction, which we expect to close in the second half of the year. 
And as a reminder, when thinking about our 2017 company margin, we see opportunities for upside from 2016 levels, excluding the impact of this gain at IDS that I just discussed, which is expected to be worth about 50 to 60 basis points at the company level in 2016. 
Before moving on to Page 10, as I mentioned on the January call, we still see our 2016 bookings to be between $25 billion and $26 billion, driven by demand from the broad base of domestic and international customers. The first quarter was a good step to meeting this target. 
On Page 10, we provided some directional guidance on how we currently see the quarterly cadence for sales, EPS and operating cash flow for the balance of 2016. Here you can see the ramp up we have been referring to in the second half of the year. I want to point out that we now expect the second quarter sales to be in the range of just under $5.7 billion to $5.8 billion, lower than our prior guidance due to the timing of volume that occurred in Q1 that I talked about earlier. And EPS from continuing operations is now expected to be in a range of $1.51 to $1.56, slightly higher than our prior guidance due to the adoption of the new accounting standard for stock compensation, worth about $0.08 in the second quarter. 
Before concluding, I'd like to spend a minute to talk about our balanced demand balance capital deployment strategy. We repurchased $400 million of stock in the quarter. As we said on the January call, we expect full year 2016 share buybacks to approximate 2015's levels. We've raised the dividend by 9.3%, our 12th consecutive annual increase. We continue to expect to generate strong free cash flow for the year and target returning 80% to 90% of free cash flow to shareholders, while maintaining strong balance sheet. 
In summary, we saw a good performance in the first quarter. Our bookings were ahead of last year's first quarter and sales, EPS and operating cash flow from continuing operations were all higher than the guidance we set in January. We remain well positioned for the year with our domestic customers priority areas and continue to be aligned with the evolving priorities of our international customers. Our objective is to drive the business to maximize value for our customers and shareholders. With that, Tom and I will now open the call up for questions."

Very similar to -- if you look at last year at Missiles, we had an issue with the supplier and we recovered that cost from the supply of last year. This is unfortunately, some cases part of the business when a supplier doesn't perform or has issues, we have to take the charge, but then you go back and recover those costs. That's where we are at on that one. The other one was, though a bit of a stranger deal with the customer relative to some changes in scope and defining who is responsible to scope was and also some other issues relative to the structure of the contract, so it was more of a -- to us it's kind of onetime type of an issue.

As I mentioned, I just came -- I actually been in Middle East twice in the -- since the beginning of the year already. Last won was to celebrate our 50th anniversary in Saudi. And I got first hand information from the folks that are using Patriot systems in both over that period of time from both the UAE and from Saudi. I can tell you that the success has been just tremendous relative to them preventing damages due to missiles landing in the cities and villages. So there's a strong, this in the success of the system, which is, I would say kind of unleashing a lot other demand within the region to have the capability. So there's the basic element. What we're seeing beyond that is a demand on the Patriot systems for an advanced radar with 360 capability, and that demand is essentially primary part of demand is coming from international. We also are seeing it from the U.S. Army, that's a road map to add a 360-degree AESA capable system. So we've invested in that technology. I mean, it goes, all the way back to again the work that we have done almost going 15, 20 years ago, but leading up to how we won the AMDR program using the technology, but now it's transitioning into the Patriot system. We're also seeing high demand for, I would call, third offset strategy concepts and in areas obviously hypersonics, undersea, you saw secretary talk about something called about distributed referenced the work that's been done on Tom Hawk and SM-6 relative to ship capability. So we're seeing a quite bit opportunities for either enhancements to our existing systems or new systems that to mature our position to go win those. We are doing activities to support those.

Just remember the $90 million in the K that you're referring to would be the cost to us to exit the venture, not necessary the P&L impact, but the cash impact. But as far as how we would expect to see things improving or recovering us, we do expect to see margins get better or expand in Q2 and beyond that into the second half of '16. As I mentioned before, even looking out into '17, we still see opportunity for margin expansion. And again, as a reminder, that's excluding the $125 million to $150 million impact from the business in '16. That said, if you think about Q2 for a minute, we do expect it to be in line with Q1 venue, when adjust Q1 for the impact of the 2 programs that I talked about, that I mentioned about 100 basis points impact. If you look over the last couple of years from a total company point of view, we typically see our higher margins in the back half and even more towards Q4. We still see it playing up the same this year and it was set up that with the initial guidance we gave you before these charges. We also have the gain in Q3 from the venture exit that we talked about. And then, we do expect the improved performance in Q4 as we ramp up on some of our production programs, flow-through the retirement of risk and benefit from the combination of strong volume and driving efficiency. So there is a ramp, Sam. The increase in the gain on the bench accounts for the part of the way that this is offset, combined with -- we are generally speaking driving more efficiencies through the business in the back half of the year.

And we're really looking at how do we go to the next level relative to the growth of that business and one of the areas that we see as a big opportunity is in the large enterprises. The Websense company came across with a very, very strong solid foundation and small of the medium and prices. With some of the larger enterprises. We see segment opportunity in expanding into large enterprise area. And Matt significant experience in that area. He has worked all the way back in Symantec, and also at Harbor Networks.

What I can maybe give a little bit of color on, I'll just go real quick by the businesses is maybe giving an indication on how we see things playing out through the balance of this year. So we talked about IDS what happened in the quarter with the $36 million impact, but we do see the margin improving up through the year, partly driven by a improvement in business mix, some of our larger international programs moved to the production cycle, and then you mentioned, a minute ago, we do have in the second half and the third quarter, the gain from the exit of the venture, which is $125 million to $150 million, and that's about 210 million to 250 basis points at the IDS level. For IIS, we're expecting totally year, 7 4 to 7 6, that would be roughly in line with 2015 after adjusting for that Q1  What we see happening compared to Q1 there is improved mix going forward within IIS. Some improved productivity is we move through the year and also some improvement coming from expected our fees for IIS from a Mrs. Point of view, we talked about the impact in the first quarter with the $22 million adjustment. But if we look forward with the balance of the year, we still see missiles getting to the 13% to 13.2% range with margin starting to expand in Q2 and in the second half of the year, really driven by mix and the timing in the ramp up of programs and some expected efficiencies that we would see in sales. And SAS, they were down year-over-year in Q1 as we expect really driven by some mix, but they were little bit ahead of our expectation for the quarter. And then, when we think about SAS moving forward, again we're still in the 12.9% to 13.1% range, and we do expect the margin to improve throughout the year driven by more favorable mix and therefore, the timing of some program improvements. At Forcepoint, real quick, margin improved in the quarter because of the addition of Websense of that question last year, still on track for the total year, 11.5% to 12.5% range, really with a little bit more ramp up our expansion in the second half of the year, driven by 2 things: the completion of integration activities related to the Stonesoft acquisition; and also as the sales ramp up in the back half of the year. So overall, we do see the cadence improving in Q2 as well as the second half, primary as we progress through program-wise cycles on some of our more recent awards, and you to the timing of the expected program improvements as well."

Raytheon has had a good start out of the gates in 2016. Total company bookings increased 39% in the first quarter and our book-to-bill ratio was 1.08, driven in part by a large year-over-year increase in demand in",1433,"Thank you, Todd. Good morning, everyone. Raytheon has had a good start out of the gates in 2016. Total company bookings increased 39% in the first quarter and our book-to-bill ratio was 1.08, driven in part by a large year-over-year increase in demand in the Middle East, North Africa region as well as strong domestic bookings. Our first quarter sales were well above our expectation, with strong growth in our Missile business. Cash flow and EPS were also better than expected. This good start gives us continued confidence in our full year outlook. 
Toby will cover the financial details with you in a few moments. Across our global markets, demand for precision munitions, Command and Control, including C5I solutions, force protection, integrated air and missile defense and missionized ISR platforms continues to be strong. As we've seen in prior quarters, our Middle East and North Africa customers are continuing to look past near-term volatility in oil prices and are investing in high-priority solutions to address an immediate and rapidly evolving threat environment. 
I visited the region earlier this month to celebrate our 50th anniversary in Saudi Arabia and met with customers. While there, I received firsthand feedback about the successful performance of our products and how they are helping protect citizens and critical infrastructure everyday. I can tell you from these discussions that the interest level across the entire MENA region remains high for the types of advanced solutions we offer. One of the more significant upcoming MENA opportunities includes an early warning radar system for Qatar in IDS, which we expect to be awarded later this year. This program, which will significantly increase the air and missile defense sensing capabilities for Qatar has a value approaching $1 billion and has already been through the congressional notification process. 
As I mentioned earlier, our bookings in the quarter were strong. When looking across the businesses, a true driver was Space and Airborne Systems, which had a book-to-bill ratio of 1.7 in the quarter, driven by domestic space-based sensor solutions in both domestic and international classified. This was the second consecutive quarter of strong bookings at SAS. And building on this, after the close of the first quarter, we announced that SAS has received a $1 billion booking for the engineering and manufacturing development phase for the Next Generation Jammer franchise. These awards provide a solid foundation from which SAS will ramp sales growth into the second half of this year. In addition to SAS, we also saw a strong year-over-year increase in bookings in Missile Systems, driven by a number of products including AMRAAM and SM-6. 
Before moving on, I would also like to point out that our overall domestic classified business, which experienced a significant increase in full year 2015 bookings, continued to see strong demand into the first quarter of 2016. Book-to-bill for the total company domestic classified was 1.3 in the quarter. First quarter sales of the company increased 9% year-over-year. Our international revenue was up 17% and represented 30% of total sales. Domestic sales were up 6%, with domestic classified sales increasing 12%. 
As I mentioned earlier, one of the key drivers of the company's first quarter sales was Missile Systems. Let me take a few moments to talk a little bit more about what is driving activity at Missiles. As many of you know, our Missile business includes a number of franchise programs. Our global customers look to us to ensure that these programs continue to offer the most advanced capabilities, so that they can stay ahead of evolving threats. A great example of this in the quarter was solid growth from AMRAAM, where we are ramping up production on the latest, most advanced version of the missile, the AIM-120D. While this missile shares the AMRAAM name with earlier versions, it is vastly more capable. Across our program portfolio at Missiles, there are many other examples, where we create value by upgrading the systems technology, including programs, such as the Evolved SeaSparrow Missile, a premier ship defense missile for our global customers. Also, we are seeing opportunities to adapt the existing technology to new missions, such as in the case of SM-6 and Tomahawk, which are now expanding into the anti-ship domain. 
Finally, we are developing new capabilities that are on the cutting edge of innovation, including hypersonics and directed energy. In addition to this, another growth driver in Missile Systems has been the increase in operating tempo of our U.S. and international customers. As we sit here today, we see this continuing to be a revenue tailwind for the company at least through next year. But taking a step back, when you look at Raytheon over the past several quarters, it reinforces the value of our diverse portfolio of advanced solutions for our global customers. The recent booking strength at SAS and Missile Systems, the significant bookings in the longer-cycle programs at IDS over the past couple of years as well as upcoming opportunities and the competitive position of IIS and Forcepoint in global cybersecurity markets provide a strong foundation for future growth and margin expansion. 
We were encouraged by the U.S. fiscal year 2017 defense budget in fight up [ph] request, which was released in February. The overall top line for the fiscal year '17 budget is consistent with the Bipartisan Budget Act 2015, with key focus areas including electronic warfare, ISR, missile defense, cyber and long-range strike, all areas that play to our strengths. The Department of Defense's focus on high-end capabilities through its Third Offset strategy aligns well with the high-end capabilities Raytheon is known for, and we are actively working with the DoD in this area. We continue to see broad-based support for funding a robust national defense. 
Turning now to Forcepoint. We've made considerable progress toward completing the integration of recent acquisitions. Operating performance in the quarter was solid and above our expectations. Further, the business remains on track to meet the growth objectives we've outlined for you in prior calls, with much of the integration behind us. Yesterday, we announced the change in leadership at Forcepoint. Matthew Moynahan, who was previously at Arbor Networks, will take over as Forcepoint's CEO on May 9. This change is designed to build on the growth capabilities of the integrated businesses. Matt has a deep background of managing technology companies and has a proven track record of driving growth. John McCormack, who did an outstanding job managing Forcepoint, both when it was private and during the integration with Raytheon, is staying on through the end of the year as an adviser. We thank John for all of his hard work and help in positioning Forcepoint to move to the next level. Forcepoint remains well positioned for the future. 
During the first quarter, we continued to execute our balanced capital deployment strategy. In March, we raised our dividend by 9.3%. This is the 12th consecutive annual increase to our dividend, and reflects our view that a sustainable, competitive dividend is a key capital deployment priority. 
We also repurchased $400 million of stock through our share repurchase program. And as we said on the call in January, we expect a full year 2016 share buyback to approximately 2015 levels, market conditions permitting. 
Before concluding, I would like to touch on a topic that we don't often talk about on earnings calls, but which is of the most importance to our shareholders, and that is corporate governance. The company is committed to being a leader in contemporary corporate governance, and we believe that good governance enhances shareholder value. In recent years, we have adopted a number of policies, processes and practices to ensure effective governance. To this end, in March, the Board of Directors voted to amend the company's bylaws to implement proxy access, providing shareholders with a process by which they can include nominees in the company's annual meeting proxy materials. The implementation of proxy access follows on our previous adoption of shareholder action by written consent in 2014 and a special meeting measure in 2010; and further demonstrates Raytheon's commitment to world-class governance practices. 
In summary, we had a good overall quarter, with solid bookings, revenue growth and EPS performance. We continue to execute our growth strategy, while at the same time placing a high priority on driving shareholder value. So thank you to the entire Raytheon team for the good start to 2016. Together, we have built on the momentum generated by our 2015 return to growth by delivering a strong quarter for our company, customers and shareholders. With that, I'll turn it over to Toby."

I have a few opening remarks, starting with the first quarter highlights, and then we'll move on to questions. During my remarks, I'll be referring to the webslides that we issued earlier this morning. If everyone would turn to Page 3. 
We are pleased with the solid performance the team delivered in the first quarter, with bookings, sales, EPS and operating cash flow all better than our expectations. It's a good start to the year, and we're positioned well for achieving our full year outlook. 
We had solid bookings in the first quarter of $6.2 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.08. Sales were $5.8 billion in the quarter, up 9%, led by our Missiles, SAS and Forcepoint businesses. Our EPS from continuing operations was $1.43, which I'll give a little more color on in just a moment. We generated strong operating cash flow of $325 million in the first quarter, primarily due to the timing of collections and tax payments. During the quarter, the company bought back 3.2 million shares of common stock under the share repurchase program for $400 million. And we announced last month that we increased our dividend by 9.3%. We have now raised our annual dividend every year for the past 12 years. I also want to point out that we're raising the EPS guidance that we provided in January. I'll discuss guidance further in just a few minutes. 
Turning now to Page 4. Let me start by providing some detail on our first quarter results. Company bookings for the first quarter were $6.2 billion, an increase of approximately $1.7 billion over the same period last year. 
International awards represented 27% of the total bookings. And on a trailing 4-quarter basis, the book-to-bill ratio was 1.14. A few key bookings in the first quarter included $646 million on AMRAAM at Missiles; and at SAS, over $650 million on an international classified contract; and a $553 million award on the Joint Polar Satellite System program. And shortly after the close of the quarter, the U.S. Navy awarded SAS a $1 billion contract on the Next Generation Jammer program for engineering and manufacturing development. Backlog at the end of the first quarter was $34.8 billion and on a funded basis was $26.2 billion, an increase of approximately $2.4 billion in funded backlog compared to the first quarter of 2015. It's worth noting that we ended the first quarter of 2016 with approximately 42% of our backlog comprised of international programs. 
If you now move to Page 5. As I just mentioned, for the first quarter 2016, sales were higher than the guidance we set in January. Sales were particularly strong at both Missiles and at SAS. We still expect sales for the company to ramp up throughout the year, with the strong second half driven by our bookings over the past several quarters and the duration of our programs. 
Looking now at sales by business. IDS had first quarter 2016 net sales of $1.3 billion. The increase from Q1 2015 was primarily driven by higher sales on certain international Patriot programs. We expect IDS sales to increase as we move through the year, as some of our international Patriot programs continue to ramp up. 
In the first quarter 2016, IIS had net sales of $1.5 billion. Compared with the same quarter last year, the increase is probably due to our cybersecurity and special mission programs. Missile Systems had first quarter 2016 net sales of $1.7 billion. The 17% increase from the first quarter 2015 was primarily due to both the Paveway and AMRAAM programs. SAS had net sales of $1.5 billion. Higher sales on classified programs, including an international program, contributed to the 7% increase versus last year. And for Forcepoint, the increase is primarily due to the acquisitions of Websense, which we completed in the second quarter of 2015; and Stonesoft, which was acquired in the first quarter of 2016. As a reminder, first quarter 2015 included the results for only Raytheon Cyber Products. 
Moving ahead to Page 6. Let me spend a few minutes talking about our margins. Our operating margin was 10.6% for the total company and 10.2% on a business segment basis. We did have 2 programs with some unique circumstances that impacted our margins in the quarter: one at IDS for $36 million that, because it's in a joint venture, about half was offset through the noncontrolling interest line on the income statement; and one at Missiles for $22 million. We don't see any significant remaining financial exposure on these programs. If you exclude the 2 adjustments I just mentioned, our segment margins would be about 100 basis points higher than reported. 
In addition, as we talked about on last year's first quarter call, it's also important to note that in the first quarter of 2015, Missiles recorded a $25 million or approximately 170 basis points favorable resolution of a contractual issue related to a supplier settlement. As expected, IIS and SAS margins were both down compared to the same period last year, primarily driven by a change in program mix. 
Also, IIS first quarter 2015 margin included the favorable eBorders settlement worth about 340 basis points or $0.42 per share on a total company basis. And at Forcepoint, the first quarter 2016 operating margin was slightly above our expectations for the quarter, driven by strong operating performance. We remain focused on margin improvement going forward and see our base business segment margin in the 12.4% to 12.6% range for the full year, consistent with the guidance we laid out in January. We also see our margin cadence improving as we move throughout the year. 
As we have discussed on past calls, we are continuously looking for more ways to lower our costs, enhance our competitiveness and improve affordability for our customers. A few examples include: executing our strategic sourcing strategy to reduce cost in our supply chain, factory automation, complexity reduction initiatives and reducing our footprint. Given these efforts, our strong backlog and as we progress through the life cycle of some of our production programs, we continue to see opportunities for margin expansion. 
Turning now to Page 7. First quarter 2016 EPS of $1.43 was better than expected, driven largely by higher volume and the recognized tax benefit associated with the adoption of the new accounting standard for stock compensation worth about $0.05. 
On Page 8, we are updating the company's financial outlook for 2016. We still expect our full year 2016 net sales to be in the range of between $24 billion and $24.5 billion, up 3% to 5% from 2015. The increase is driven by growth in both our domestic and international business. We have increased the full year deferred revenue adjustment by $10 million to $77 million to reflect the updated estimate of purchase accounting related to the Stonesoft acquisition we completed earlier in the year. We have lowered our effective tax rate to reflect the tax benefit associated with the adoption of the new accounting standard for stock compensation that I just discussed which, in total, is worth about $0.13 for the full year, with the additional $0.08 expected in the second quarter. We now expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 28.5%. And we have raised our full year 2016 EPS to reflect the tax benefit I just mentioned. We now expect our EPS to be in a range of between $6.93 and $7.13. 
As I discussed earlier, we repurchased 3.2 million shares of common stock for $400 million in the quarter and continue to see our diluted share count in the range of between 296 million and 298 million shares for 2016, a 3% reduction at the midpoint of the range. 
Operating cash flow in the first quarter was strong. And we continue to see our full year 2016 operating cash flow outlook between $2.7 billion and $3 billion. And as you can see on Page 9, we've included guidance by business, which is unchanged from our prior outlook. I want to reiterate that at IDS, we still see margins in the 15.9% to 16.1% range. As I said on the January call, our full year 2016 guidance includes positive operating income at IDS related to an expected exit from certain business ventures later in 2016, which you can now think of in the $125 million to $150 million range. This is subject to the finalization of the transaction, which we expect to close in the second half of the year. 
And as a reminder, when thinking about our 2017 company margin, we see opportunity for upside from 2016 levels, excluding the impact of this gain at IDS that I just discussed, which is expected to be worth about 50 to 60 basis points at the company level in 2016. 
Before moving on to Page 10, as I mentioned on the January call, we still see our 2016 bookings to be between $25 billion and $26 billion, driven by demand from a broad base of domestic and international customers. The first quarter was a good step to meeting this target. 
On Page 10, we provided some directional guidance on how we currently see the quarterly cadence for sales, EPS and operating cash flow for the balance of 2016. Here, you can see the ramp up we have been referring to in the second half of the year. I want to point out that we now expect the second quarter sales to be in the range of just under $5.7 billion to $5.8 billion, lower than our prior guidance due to the timing of volume that occurred in Q1 that I talked about earlier. And EPS from continuing operations is now expected to be in a range of $1.51 to $1.56, slightly higher than our prior guidance due to the adoption of the new accounting standard for stock compensation, worth about $0.08 in the second quarter. 
Before concluding, I'd like to spend a minute to talk about our balanced capital deployment strategy. We repurchased $400 million of stock in the quarter. And as we said on the January call, we expect the full year 2016 share buyback to approximate 2015's levels. We raised the dividend by 9.3%, our 12th consecutive annual increase. We continue to expect to generate strong free cash flow for the year and target returning 80% to 90% of free cash flow to shareholders, while maintaining strong balance sheet. 
In summary, we saw good performance in the first quarter. Our bookings were ahead of last year's first quarter and sales, EPS and operating cash flow from continuing operations were all higher than the guidance we set in January. We remain well positioned for the year with our domestic customers' priority areas and continue to be aligned with the evolving priorities of our international customers. Our objective is to drive the business to maximize value for our customers and shareholders. 
With that, Tom and I will now open the call up for questions."

They do have unique circumstances. One of them was a program essentially complete, and we were having some, I would call it, warranty issues on some shelters from a supplier. We are working through that with the supplier. We did take a charge this quarter due to that. However, we are working with that supplier to, essentially, recover those costs. Very similar to -- if you look at last year at Missiles, we had an issue with the supplier and we recovered the cost from that supply last year. This is unfortunately, in some cases, part of the business; when a supplier doesn't perform or has issues, we have to take the charge. But then we go back and recover those costs. That's where we're at on that one. The other one was -- it was a bit of a stranger deal with the customer relative to some changes in scope and defining whose responsibility the scope was and also some other issues relative to the structure of the contract. So it's more of a -- to us, it's kind of a onetime type of an issue. We don't see that as systemic across the business. And so I would -- I am looking at these 2 as one-off.

As I mention",373,"Yes, so I think one of the areas that we're -- besides the demand for the Patriot upgrade to Configuration 3+ on the existing systems, there also has been a demand from new fire units from several countries that are facing significant issues. As I mentioned, I just came -- I actually have been in the Middle East twice in the -- since the beginning of the year already. The last one was to celebrate our 50th anniversary in Saudi. And I got firsthand information from the folks that are using the Patriot Systems in both -- over that period of time from both the UAE and from Saudi. I can tell you that the success has been just tremendous relative to them preventing damages due tactical ballistic missiles landing in their cities and villages. So there's a strong -- they're seeing the success of that system which is, I would say, kind of unleashing a lot other demand within the region to have the capability. So that's the basic element. What we're seeing beyond that is a demand on the Patriot System for an advanced AESA radar with 360 capability. And that demand is -- essentially, the primary part of that demand is coming from international. We also are seeing it from the U.S. Army, that's the road map to add a 360-degree AESA capability to the Patriot System. So we have invested in that technology. I mean, it goes all the way back to, again, work that we've done almost going 15, 20 years ago; but leading up to how we won the AMDR program using that technology. But now it's transitioning into the Patriot System. We're also seeing high demand for, we call it, Third Offset strategy concepts. And in there is, obviously, hypersonics, undersea. You saw Secretary Ash Carter talk about something called distributed lethality, and you referenced the work that's being done on Tomahawk and the SM-6 relative to add anti-ship capability. So we're seeing quite a bit of opportunities for either enhancements to our existing systems or new systems that, to ensure that we're positioned to go win those, we are doing IRAD activities to support those. I don't know if that kind of answered your question."

Now just remember, the $90 million in the K that you're referring to would be the cost to us to exit the venture, not necessarily the P&L impact, but the cash impact. But as far as how we expect to see things improving or recovering this, we do expect to see margins get better or expand in Q2 and, beyond that, into the second half of '16. And as I mentioned before, even looking out into '17, we still see opportunity for margin expansion. And again, as a reminder, that's excluding the $125 million to $150 million impact from the business venture exit in '16. That said, if you think about Q2 for a minute, we do expect it to be in line with Q1, when you adjust Q1 for the impact of the 2 programs that I talked about, that I mentioned had about 100 basis point impact. If you look over the last couple of years from a total company point of view, we typically see our higher margins in the back half and even more towards Q4. We still see it playing out the same this year. And it was set up that way in the initial guidance we gave you before these charges. We also have the gain in Q3 from the venture exit that we talked about. And then, we do expect the improved performance in Q4 as we ramp up on some of our production programs, both through the retirement of risk and benefit from the combination of strong volume and driving efficiencies. So there is a ramp, Sam. The increase in the gain on the venture accounts for part of the way that this is offset, combined with, generally speaking, driving more efficiencies through the business in the back half of the year. And again, other than those adjustments in the first quarter, not much has really changed relative to the cadence as to how we see things ramping up through the year."

And we also have other activities that we're seeing, I would say, strength in and that is the area of C5ISR across the region. And one of the big areas is integrating all of these missile defense capabilities that a nation has and tying them together and providing a common operating picture for those, tying that together with an air operating center and then providing an overall joint operating center for the entire country. So we're seeing demand for that kind of capability across the region. And then outside of the radar I mentioned, there's just a replenishment, essentially, of effectors that have been either used or now are kind of off the shelf, the expiration dates that they need to replenish. And well, that's just happening, so we're not seeing anything that's slipping to the right in those elements in the Middle East right now."

It's not consistent business-by-business. What I can maybe give you a little bit of color on, I'll just go real quick by the businesses, is maybe give you an indication on how we see things playing out through the balance of this year, right? So we talked about IDS and what happened in the quarter with the $36 million impact. But we do see the margin improving through the year, partly driven by improvement in business mix, as some of our larger international programs move to the production cycle. And then you mentioned it a minute ago, we do have, in the second half and the third quarter, the gain from the exit of the venture, which is $125 million to $150 million. That's about 210 to 250 basis points at the IDS level. For IIS, we're expecting total year, 7.4% to 7.6%. That would be roughly in line with 2015 after adjusting for the Q1 IBOR. What we see happening compared to Q1 there is improved mix going forward within IIS; some improved productivity as we move through the year; and also some improvement coming from expected award fees for IIS. From a Missiles point of view, we talked about the impact in the first quarter with the $22 million adjustment. But if we look forward for the balance of the year, we still see Missiles getting to the 13% to 13.2% range, with margins starting to improve or expand in Q2 and in the second half of the year, really driven by mix and the timing in the ramp-up of programs and some expected efficiencies that we would see at Missiles. At SAS, they were down year-over-year in Q1 as we expected, really driven by some mix. But they were a little bit ahead of our expectations for the quarter. And then, when we think about SAS moving forward, again, we're still in the 12.9% to 13.1% range, and we do expect the margin to improve throughout the year driven by more favorable mix and, therefore, the timing of some program improvements. At Forcepoint, real quick, margin improved in the quarter because of the addition of Websense, the acquisition last year. Still on track for the total year, 11.5% to 12.5% range, really, with a little bit more of a ramp or expansion in the second half of the year, driven by 2 things: the completion of integration activities related to the Stonesoft acquisition; and also as the sales ramp up in the back half of the year. So overall, we do see the cadence improving in Q2 as well as the second half, primarily as we progress through program life cycles on some of our more recent awards and due to the timing of expected program improvements as well."

Good morning, everyone. Raytheon has had a good start out of the gates in 2016. Total company bookings increased 39% in the first quarter and our book-to-bill ratio was 1.08, driven in part by a large year-over-year increase in demand in the Middle East, North Africa region as well as strong domestic bookings. Our first quarter sales were well above our expectation, with strong growth in our Missiles business. Cash flow and EPS were also better than expected. This good start gives us continued confidence in our full year outlook. 
Toby will cover the financial details with you in a few moments. Across our global markets, demand for precision munitions, Command and Control, including C5I solutions, force protection, integrated air and missile defense and missionized ISR platforms continues to be strong. As we've seen in prior quarters, our Middle East and North Africa customers are continuing to look past near-term volatility in oil prices and are investing in high-priority solutions to address an immediate and rapidly evolving threat environment. 
I visited the region earlier this month to celebrate our 50th anniversary in Saudi Arabia and met with customers. While there, I received firsthand feedback about the successful performance of our products and how they are helping protect citizens and critical infrastructure every day. I can tell you from these discussions that the interest level across the entire MENA region remains high for the types of advanced solutions we offer. One of the more significant upcoming MENA opportunities includes an early warning radar system for Qatar at IDS, which we expect to be awarded later this year. This program, which will significantly increase the air and missile defense sensing capabilities for Qatar has a value approaching $1 billion and has already been through the congressional notification process. 
As I mentioned earlier, our bookings in the quarter were strong. When looking across the businesses, a key [ph] driver was Space and Airborne Systems, which had a book-to-bill ratio of 1.7 in the quarter, driven by domestic space-based sensor solutions in both domestic and international classified. This was the second consecutive quarter of strong bookings at SAS. And building on this, after the close of the first quarter, we announced that SAS had received a $1 billion booking for the engineering and manufacturing development phase for the Next Generation Jammer franchise. These awards provide a solid foundation from which SAS will ramp sales growth into the second half of this year. In addition to SAS, we also saw a strong year-over-year increase in bookings in Missile Systems, driven by a number of products including AMRAAM and SM-6. 
Before moving on, I would also like to point out that our overall domestic classified business, which experienced a significant increase in full year 2015 bookings, continued to see strong demand into the first quarter of 2016. Book-to-bill for the total company domestic classified was 1.3 in the quarter. First quarter sales for the company increased 9% year-over-year. Our international revenue was up 17% and represented 30% of total sales. Domestic sales were up 6%, with domestic classified sales increasing 12%. 
As I mentioned earlier, one of the key drivers of the company's first quarter sales was Missile Systems. Let me take a few moments to talk a little bit more about what is driving activity at Missiles. As many of you know, our Missile business includes a number of franchise programs. Our global customers look to us to ensure that these programs continue to offer the most advanced capabilities, so that they can stay ahead of evolving threats. A great example of this in the quarter was solid growth from AMRAAM, where we are ramping up production on the latest, most advanced version of the missile, the AIM-120D. While this missile shares the AMRAAM name with earlier versions, it is vastly more capable. Across our program portfolio at Missiles, there are many other examples, where we create value by upgrading the systems technology, including programs, such as the Evolved SeaSparrow Missile, a premier ship defense missile for our global customers. Also, we are seeing opportunities to adapt the existing technology to new missions, such as in the case of SM-6 and Tomahawk, which are now expanding into the anti-ship domain. 
Finally, we are developing new capabilities that are on the cutting edge of innovation, including hypersonics and directed energy. In addition to this, another growth driver in Missile Systems has been the increase in operating tempo of our U.S. and international customers. As we sit here today, we see this continuing to be a revenue tailwind for the company at least through next year. But taking a step back, when you look at Raytheon over the past several quarters, it reinforces the value of our diverse portfolio of advanced solutions for our global customers. The recent booking strength at SAS and Missile Systems, the significant bookings in longer-cycle programs at IDS over the past couple of years as well as upcoming opportunities and the competitive position of IIS and Forcepoint in global cybersecurity markets provide a strong foundation for future growth and margin expansion. 
We were encouraged by the U.S. fiscal year 2017 defense budget and FYDP request, which was released in February. The overall top line for the fiscal year '17 budget is consistent with the Bipartisan Budget Act 2015, with key focus areas including electronic warfare, ISR, missile defense, cyber and long-range strike, all areas that play to our strengths. The Department of Defense's focus on high-end capabilities through its Third Offset strategy aligns well with the high-end capabilities Raytheon is known for, and we are actively working with the DoD in this area. We continue to see broad-based support for funding a robust national defense. 
Turning now to Forcepoint. We've made considerable progress toward completing the integration of recent acquisitions. Operating performance in the quarter was solid and above our expectations. Further, the business remains on track to meet the growth objectives we've outlined for you on prior calls. With much of the integration behind us, yesterday, we announced the change in leadership at Forcepoint. Matthew Moynahan, who was previously at Arbor Networks, will take over as Forcepoint's CEO on May 9. This change is designed to build on the growth capabilities of the integrated businesses. Matt has a deep background of managing technology companies and has a proven track record of driving growth. John McCormack, who did an outstanding job managing Forcepoint, both when it was private and during the integration with Raytheon, is staying on through the end of the year as an adviser. We thank John for all of his hard work and help in positioning Forcepoint to move to the next level. Forcepoint remains well positioned for the future. 
During the first quarter, we continued to execute our balanced capital deployment strategy. In March, we raised our dividend by 9.3%. This is the 12th consecutive annual increase to our dividend, and reflects our view that a sustainable, competitive dividend is a key capital deployment priority. 
We also repurchased $400 million of stock through our share repurchase program. And as we said on the call in January, we expect a full year 2016 share buyback to approximately 2015 levels, market conditions permitting. 
Before concluding, I would like to touch on a topic that we don't often talk about on earnings calls, but which is of the most importance to our shareholders, and that is corporate governance. The company is committed to being a leader in contemporary corporate governance, and we believe that good governance enhances shareholder value. In recent years, we have adopted a number of policies, processes and practices to ensure effective governance. To this end, in March, the Board of Directors voted to amend the company's bylaws to implement proxy access, providing shareholders with a process by which they can include nominees in the company's annual meeting proxy materials. The implementation of proxy access follows on our previous adoption of shareholder action by written consent in 2014 and a special meeting measure in 2010; and further demonstrates Raytheon's commitment to world-class governance practices. 
In summary, we had a good overall quarter, with solid bookings, revenue growth and EPS performance. We continue to execute our growth strategy, while at the same time placing a high priority on driving shareholder value. So thank you to the entire Raytheon team for the good start to 2016. Together, we have built on the momentum generated by our 2015 return to growth by delivering a strong quarter for our company, customers and shareholders. With that, I'll turn it over to Toby."

During my remarks, I'll be referring to the webslides that we issued earlier this morning. If everyone would turn to Page 3. 
We are pleased with the solid performance the team delivered in the first quarter, with bookings, sales, EPS and operating cash flow all better than our expectations. It's a good start to the year, and we're positioned well for achieving our full year outlook. 
We had solid bookings in the first quarter of $6.2 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.08. Sales were $5.8 billion in the quarter, up 9%, led by our Missiles, SAS and Forcepoint businesses. Our EPS from continuing operations was $1.43, which I'll give a little more color on in just a moment. We generated strong operating cash flow of $325 million in the first quarter, primarily due to the timing of collections and tax payments. During the quarter, the company bought back 3.2 million shares of common stock under the share repurchase program for $400 million. And we announced last month that we increased our dividend by 9.3%. We have now raised our annual dividend every year for the past 12 years. I also want to point out that we're raising the EPS guidance that we provided in January. I'll discuss guidance further in just a few minutes. 
Turning now to Page 4. Let me start by providing some detail on our first quarter results. Company bookings for the first quarter were $6.2 billion, an increase of approximately $1.7 billion over the same period last year. 
International awards represented 27% of the total bookings. And on a trailing 4-quarter basis, the book-to-bill ratio was 1.14. A few key bookings in the first quarter included $646 million on AMRAAM at Missiles; and at SAS, over $650 million on an international classified contract; and a $553 million award on the Joint Polar Satellite System program. And shortly after the close of the quarter, the U.S. Navy awarded SAS a $1 billion contract on the Next Generation Jammer program for engineering and manufacturing development. Backlog at the end of the first quarter was $34.8 billion and on a funded basis was $26.2 billion, an increase of approximately $2.4 billion in funded backlog compared to the first quarter of 2015. It's worth noting that we ended the first quarter of 2016 with approximately 42% of our backlog comprised of international programs. 
If you'd now move to Page 5. As I just mentioned, for the first quarter 2016, sales were higher than the guidance we set in January. Sales were particularly strong at both Missiles and at SAS. We still expect sales for the company to ramp up throughout the year, with the strong second half driven by our bookings over the past several quarters and the duration of our programs. 
Looking now at sales by business. IDS had first quarter 2016 net sales of $1.3 billion. The increase from Q1 2015 was primarily driven by higher sales on certain international Patriot programs. We expect IDS sales to increase as we move through the year, as some of our international Patriot programs continue to ramp up. 
In the first quarter 2016, IIS had net sales of $1.5 billion. Compared with the same quarter last year, the increase was primarily due to our cybersecurity and special mission programs. 
Missile Systems had first quarter 2016 net sales of $1.7 billion. The 17% increase from the first quarter 2015 was primarily due to both the Paveway and AMRAAM programs. 
SAS had net sales of $1.5 billion. Higher sales on classified programs, including an international program, contributed to the 7% increase versus last year. 
And for Forcepoint, the increase was primarily due to the acquisitions of Websense, which we completed in the second quarter of 2015; and Stonesoft, which was acquired in the first quarter of 2016. As a reminder, first quarter 2015 included the results for only Raytheon Cyber Products. 
Moving ahead to Page 6. Let me spend a few minutes talking about our margins. Our operating margin was 10.6% for the total company and 10.2% on a business segment basis. We did have 2 programs with some unique circumstances that impacted our margins in the quarter: one at IDS for $36 million that, because it's in a joint venture, about half was offset through the noncontrolling interest line on the income statement; and one at Missiles for $22 million. We don't see any significant remaining financial exposure on these programs. If you exclude the 2 adjustments I just mentioned, our segment margins would be about 100 basis points higher than reported. 
In addition, as we talked about on last year's first quarter call, it's also important to note that in the first quarter of 2015, Missiles recorded a $25 million or approximately 170 basis point favorable resolution of a contractual issue related to a supplier settlement. As expected, IIS and SAS margins were both down compared to the same period last year, primarily driven by a change in program mix. 
Also, IIS first quarter 2015 margin included the favorable eBorders settlement worth about 340 basis points or $0.42 per share on a total company basis. And at Forcepoint, the first quarter 2016 operating margin was slightly above our expectations for the quarter, driven by strong operating performance. We remain focused on margin improvement going forward and see our base business segment margins in the 12.4% to 12.6% range for the full year, consistent with the guidance we laid out in January. We also see our margin cadence improving as we move throughout the year. 
As we have discussed on past calls, we are continuously looking for more ways to lower our costs, enhance our competitiveness and improve affordability for our customers. A few examples include: executing our strategic sourcing strategy to reduce costs in our supply chain, factory automation, complexity reduction initiatives and reducing our footprint. Given these efforts, our strong backlog and as we progress through the life cycle of some of our production programs, we continue to see opportunities for margin expansion. 
Turning now to Page 7. First quarter 2016 EPS of $1.43 was better than expected, driven largely by higher volume and the recognized tax benefit associated with the adoption of the new accounting standard for stock compensation worth about $0.05. 
On Page 8, we are updating the company's financial outlook for 2016. We still expect our full year 2016 net sales to be in the range of between $24 billion and $24.5 billion, up 3% to 5% from 2015. The increase is driven by growth in both our domestic and international business. We have increased the full year deferred revenue adjustment by $10 million to $77 million to reflect the updated estimate of purchase accounting related to the Stonesoft acquisition we completed earlier in the year. We have lowered our effective tax rate to reflect the tax benefit associated with the adoption of the new accounting standard for stock compensation that I just discussed which, in total, is worth about $0.13 for the full year, with the additional $0.08 expected in the second quarter. We now expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 28.5%. And we have raised our full year 2016 EPS to reflect the tax benefit I just mentioned. We now expect our EPS to be in a range of between $6.93 and $7.13. 
As I discussed earlier, we repurchased 3.2 million shares of common stock for $400 million in the quarter and continue to see our diluted share count in the range of between 296 million and 298 million shares for 2016, a 3% reduction at the midpoint of the range. 
Operating cash flow in the first quarter was strong. And we continue to see our full year 2016 operating cash flow outlook between $2.7 billion and $3 billion. And as you can see on Page 9, we've included guidance by business, which is unchanged from our prior outlook. I want to reiterate that at IDS, we still see margins in the 15.9% to 16.1% range. As I said on the January call, our full year 2016 guidance includes positive operating income at IDS related to an expected exit from certain business ventures later in 2016, which you can now think of in the $125 million to $150 million range. This is subject to the finalization of the transaction, which we expect to close in the second half of the year. 
And as a reminder, when thinking about our 2017 company margin, we see opportunity for upside from 2016 levels, excluding the impact of this gain at IDS that I just discussed, which is expected to be worth about 50 to 60 basis points at the company level in 2016. 
Before moving on to Page 10, as I mentioned on the January call, we still see our 2016 bookings to be between $25 billion and $26 billion, driven by demand from a broad base of domestic and international customers. The first quarter was a good step to meeting this target. 
On Page 10, we provided some directional guidance on how we currently see the quarterly cadence for sales, EPS and operating cash flow for the balance of 2016. Here, you can see the ramp we have been referring to in the second half of the year. I want to point out that we now expect the second quarter sales to be in the range of just under $5.7 billion to $5.8 billion, lower than our prior guidance due to the timing of volume that occurred in Q1 that I talked about earlier. And EPS from continuing operations is now expected to be in a range of $1.51 to $1.56, slightly higher than our prior guidance due to the adoption of the new accounting standard for stock compensation, worth about $0.08 in the second quarter. 
Before concluding, I'd like to spend a minute to talk about our balanced capital deployment strategy. We repurchased $400 million of stock in the quarter. And as we said on the January call, we expect the full year 2016 share buyback to approximate 2015's levels. We raised the dividend by 9.3%, our 12th consecutive annual increase. We continue to expect to generate strong free cash flow for the year and target returning 80% to 90% of free cash flow to shareholders, while maintaining a strong balance sheet. 
In summary, we saw good performance in the first quarter. Our bookings were ahead of last year's first quarter and sales, EPS and operating cash flow from continuing operations were all higher than the guidance we set in January. We remain well positioned for the year with our domestic customers' priority areas and continue to be aligned with the evolving priorities of our international customers. Our objective is to drive the business to maximize value for our customers and shareholders. 
With that, Tom and I will now open the call up for questions."

They do have unique circumstances. One of them was a program essentially complete, and we were having some, I would call it, warranty issues on some shelters from a supplier. We are working through that with the supplier. We did take a charge this quarter due to that. However, we are working with that supplier to, essentially, recover those costs. Very similar to -- if you look at last year at Missiles, we had an issue with a supplier and we recovered the costs from that supplier last year. This is unfortunately, in some cases, part of the business; when a supplier doesn't perform or has issues, we have to take the charge. But then we go back and recover those costs. That's where we're at on that one. The other one was a little bit of a stranger deal with a customer relative to some changes in scope and defining whose responsibility the scope was and also some other issues relative to the structure of the contract.

And I got firsthand information from the folks that are using the Patriot Systems in both -- over that period of time from both the UAE and from Saudi. I can tell you that the success has been just tremendous relative to them preventing damages due tactical ballistic missiles landing in their cities and villages. So there's a strong -- they're seeing the success of that system which is, I would say, kind of unleashing a lot other demand within the region to have the capability. So that's the basic element. What we're seeing beyond that is a demand on the Patriot System for an advanced AESA radar with 360 capability. And that demand is -- essentially, the primary part of that demand is coming from international. We also are seeing it from the U.S. Army, that's the road map to add a 360-degree AESA capability to the Patriot System. So we have invested in that technology. I mean, it goes all the way back to, again, work that we've done almost going 15, 20 years ago; but leading up to how we won the AMDR program using that technology. But now it's transitioning into the Patriot System. We're also seeing high demand for, I'd call it, Third Offset strategy concepts. And in there is, obviously, hypersonics, undersea. You saw Secretary Ash Carter talk about something called distributed lethality, and he referenced the work that's being done on Tomahawk and the SM-6 relative to add anti-ship capability. So we're seeing quite a bit of opportunities for either enhancements to our existing systems or new systems that, to ensure that we're positioned to go win those, we are doing IRAD activities to support those. I don't know if that kind of answers your question."

So no, we did not consider these in the guidance that we gave, either the one at IDS or the one at Missiles. Now just remember, the $90 million in the K that you're referring to would be the cost to us to exit the venture, not necessarily the P&L impact, but the cash impact. But as far as how we expect to see things improving or recovering this, we do expect to see margins get better or expand in Q2 and, beyond that, into the second half of '16. And as I mentioned before, even looking out into '17, we still see opportunity for margin expansion. And again, as a reminder, that's excluding the $125 million to $150 million impact from the business venture exit in '16. That said, if you think about Q2 for a minute, we do expect it to be in line with Q1, when you adjust Q1 for the impact of the 2 programs that I talked about, that I mentioned had about 100 basis point impact. If you look over the last couple of years from a total company point of view, we typically see our higher margins in the back half and even more towards Q4. We still see it playing out the same this year. And it was set up that way in the initial guidance we gave you before these charges. We also have the gain in Q3 from the venture exit that we talked about. And then, we do expect the improved performance in Q4 as we ramp up on some of our production programs, both through the retirement of risk and benefit from the combination of strong volume and driving efficiencies. So there is a ramp, Sam. The increase in the gain on the venture accounts for part of the way that this is offset, combined with, generally speaking, driving more efficiencies through the business in the back half of the year. And again, other than those adjustments in the first quarter, not much has really changed relative to the cadence as to how we see things ramping up through the year."

And one of the big areas is integrating all of these missile defense capabilities that a nation has and tying them together and providing a common operating picture for those, tying that together with an air operating center and then providing an overall joint operating center for the entire country. So we're seeing a demand signal for that kind of capability across the region.

Has the army decided to move ahead with the new missile program rather than just extend ATACMS? And I was wondering if you can give us any sense about the size and timing of the program and the opportunity?"

It's not consistent business-by-business. What I can maybe give you a little bit of color on, I'll just go real quick by the businesses, is maybe give you an indication on how we see things playing out through the balance of this year, right? So we talked about IDS and what happened in the quarter with the $36 million impact. But we do see the margin improving through the year, partly driven by improvement in business mix, as some of our larger international programs move to through the production cycle. And then you mentioned it a minute ago, we do have, in the second half in the third quarter, the gain from the exit of the venture, which is $125 million to $150 million. That's about 210 to 250 basis points at the IDS level. For IIS, we're expecting total year, 7.4% to 7.6%. That would be roughly in line with 2015 after adjusting for the Q1 EIBOR. What we see happening compared to Q1 there is improved mix going forward within IIS; some improved productivity as we move through the year; and also some improvement coming from expected award fees for IIS. From a Missiles point of view, we talked about the impact in the first quarter with the $22 million adjustment. But if we look forward for the balance of the year, we still see Missiles getting to the 13% to 13.2% range, with margins starting to improve or expand in Q2 and in the second half of the year, really driven by mix and the timing in the ramp-up of programs and some expected efficiencies that we would see at Missiles. At SAS, they were down year-over-year in Q1 as we expected, really driven by some mix. But they were a little bit ahead of our expectations for the quarter. And then, when we think about SAS moving forward, again, we're still in the 12.9% to 13.1% range, and we do expect the margin to improve throughout the year driven by more favorable mix and, therefore, the timing of some program improvements. At Forcepoint, real quick, margin improved in the quarter because of the addition of Websense, the acquisition last year. Still on track for the total year, 11.5% to 12.5% range, really, with a little bit more of a ramp or expansion in the second half of the year, driven by 2 things: the completion of integration activities related to the Stonesoft acquisition; and also as the sales ramp up in the back half of the year. So overall, we do see the cadence improving in Q2 as well as the second half, primarily as we progress through program life cycles on some of our more recent awards and due to the timing of expected program improvements as well."

Good morning, everyone. Raytheon has had a good start out of the gates in 2016. Total company bookings increased 39% in the first quarter and our book-to-bill ratio was 1.08, driven in part by a large year-over-year increase in demand in the Middle East, North Africa region as well as strong domestic bookings. Our first quarter sales were well above our expectation, with strong growth in our Missiles business. Cash flow and EPS were also better than expected. This good start gives us continued confidence in our full year outlook. 
Toby will cover the financial details with you in a few moments. Across our global markets, demand for precision munitions, Command and Control, including C5I solutions, force protection, integrated air and missile defense and missionized ISR platforms continues to be strong. As we've seen in prior quarters, our Middle East and North Africa customers are continuing to look past near-term volatility in oil prices and are investing in high-priority solutions to address an immediate and rapidly evolving threat environment. 
I visited the region earlier this month to celebrate our 50th anniversary in Saudi Arabia and met with customers. While there, I received firsthand feedback about the successful performance of our products and how they are helping protect citizens and critical infrastructure every day. I can tell you from these discussions that the interest level across the entire MENA region remains high for the types of advanced solutions we offer. One of the more significant upcoming MENA opportunities includes an early warning radar system for Qatar at IDS, which we expect to be awarded later this year. This program, which will significantly increase the air and missile defense sensing capabilities for Qatar has a value approaching $1 billion and has already been through the congressional notification process. 
As I mentioned earlier, our bookings in the quarter were strong. When looking across the businesses, a key [ph] driver was Space and Airborne Systems, which had a book-to-bill ratio of 1.7 in the quarter, driven by domestic space-based sensor solutions in both domestic and international classified. This was the second consecutive quarter of strong bookings at SAS. And building on this, after the close of the first quarter, we announced that SAS had received a $1 billion booking for the engineering and manufacturing development phase for the Next Generation Jammer franchise. These awards provide a solid foundation from which SAS will ramp sales growth into the second half of this year. In addition to SAS, we also saw a strong year-over-year increase in bookings in Missile Systems, driven by a number of products including AMRAAM and SM-6. 
Before moving on, I would also like to point out that our overall domestic classified business, which experienced a significant increase in full year 2015 bookings, continued to see strong demand into the first quarter of 2016. Book-to-bill for the total company domestic classified was 1.3 in the quarter. First quarter sales for the company increased 9% year-over-year. Our international revenue was up 17% and represented 30% of total sales. Domestic sales were up 6%, with domestic classified sales increasing 12%. 
As I mentioned earlier, one of the key drivers of the company's first quarter sales was Missile Systems. Let me take a few moments to talk a little bit more about what is driving activity at Missiles. As many of you know, our Missile business includes a number of franchise programs. Our global customers look to us to ensure that these programs continue to offer the most advanced capabilities, so that they can stay ahead of evolving threats. A great example of this in the quarter was solid growth from AMRAAM, where we are ramping up production on the latest, most advanced version of the missile, the AIM-120D. While this missile shares the AMRAAM name with earlier versions, it is vastly more capable. Across our program portfolio at Missiles, there are many other examples, where we create value by upgrading the systems technology, including programs, such as the Evolved SeaSparrow Missile, a premier ship defense missile for our global customers. Also, we are seeing opportunities to adapt the existing technology to new missions, such as in the case of SM-6 and Tomahawk, which are now expanding into the anti-ship domain. 
Finally, we are developing new capabilities that are on the cutting edge of innovation, including hypersonics and directed energy. In addition to this, another growth driver in Missile Systems has been the increase in operating tempo of our U.S. and international customers. As we sit here today, we see this continuing to be a revenue tailwind for the company at least through next year. But taking a step back, when you look at Raytheon over the past several quarters, it reinforces the value of our diverse portfolio of advanced solutions for our global customers. The recent booking strength at SAS and Missile Systems, the significant bookings in longer-cycle programs at IDS over the past couple of years as well as upcoming opportunities and the competitive position of IIS and Forcepoint in global cybersecurity markets provide a strong foundation for future growth and margin expansion. 
We were encouraged by the U.S. fiscal year 2017 defense budget and FYDP request, which was released in February. The overall top line for the fiscal year '17 budget is consistent with the Bipartisan Budget Act 2015, with key focus areas including electronic warfare, ISR, missile defense, cyber and long-range strike, all areas that play to our strengths. The Department of Defense's focus on high-end capabilities through its Third Offset strategy aligns well with the high-end capabilities Raytheon is known for, and we are actively working with the DoD in this area. We continue to see broad-based support for funding a robust national defense. 
Turning now to Forcepoint. We've made considerable progress toward completing the integration of recent acquisitions. Operating performance in the quarter was solid and above our expectations. Further, the business remains on track to meet the growth objectives we've outlined for you on prior calls. With much of the integration behind us, yesterday, we announced the change in leadership at Forcepoint. Matthew Moynahan, who was previously at Arbor Networks, will take over as Forcepoint's CEO on May 9. This change is designed to build on the growth capabilities of the integrated businesses. Matt has a deep background of managing technology companies and has a proven track record of driving growth. John McCormack, who did an outstanding job managing Forcepoint, both when it was private and during the integration with Raytheon, is staying on through the end of the year as an adviser. We thank John for all of his hard work and help in positioning Forcepoint to move to the next level. Forcepoint remains well positioned for the future. 
During the first quarter, we continued to execute our balanced capital deployment strategy. In March, we raised our dividend by 9.3%. This is the 12th consecutive annual increase to our dividend, and reflects our view that a sustainable, competitive dividend is a key capital deployment priority. 
We also repurchased $400 million of stock through our share repurchase program. And as we said on the call in January, we expect a full year 2016 share buyback to approximately 2015 levels, market conditions permitting. 
Before concluding, I would like to touch on a topic that we don't often talk about on earnings calls, but which is of the most importance to our shareholders, and that is corporate governance. The company is committed to being a leader in contemporary corporate governance, and we believe that good governance enhances shareholder value. In recent years, we have adopted a number of policies, processes and practices to ensure effective governance. To this end, in March, the Board of Directors voted to amend the company's bylaws to implement proxy access, providing shareholders with a process by which they can include nominees in the company's annual meeting proxy materials. The implementation of proxy access follows on our previous adoption of shareholder action by written consent in 2014 and a special meeting measure in 2010; and further demonstrates Raytheon's commitment to world-class governance practices. 
In summary, we had a good overall quarter, with solid bookings, revenue growth and EPS performance. We continue to execute our growth strategy, while at the same time placing a high priority on driving shareholder value. So thank you to the entire Raytheon team for the good start to 2016. Together, we have built on the momentum generated by our 2015 return to growth by delivering a strong quarter for our company, customers and shareholders. With that, I'll turn it over to Toby."

We are pleased with the solid performance the team delivered in the first quarter, with bookings, sales, EPS and operating cash flow all better than our expectations. It's a good start to the year, and we're positioned well for achieving our full year outlook. 
We had solid bookings in the first quarter of $6.2 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.08. Sales were $5.8 billion in the quarter, up 9%, led by our Missiles, SAS and Forcepoint businesses. Our EPS from continuing operations was $1.43, which I'll give a little more color on in just a moment. We generated strong operating cash flow of $325 million in the first quarter, primarily due to the timing of collections and tax payments. During the quarter, the company bought back 3.2 million shares of common stock under the share repurchase program for $400 million. And we announced last month that we increased our dividend by 9.3%. We have now raised our annual dividend every year for the past 12 years. I also want to point out that we're raising the EPS guidance that we provided in January. I'll discuss guidance further in just a few minutes. 
Turning now to Page 4. Let me start by providing some detail on our first quarter results. Company bookings for the first quarter were $6.2 billion, an increase of approximately $1.7 billion over the same period last year. 
International awards represented 27% of the total bookings. And on a trailing 4-quarter basis, the book-to-bill ratio was 1.14. A few key bookings in the first quarter included $646 million on AMRAAM at Missiles; and at SAS, over $650 million on an international classified contract; and a $553 million award on the Joint Polar Satellite System program. And shortly after the close of the quarter, the U.S. Navy awarded SAS a $1 billion contract on the Next Generation Jammer program for engineering and manufacturing development. Backlog at the end of the first quarter was $34.8 billion and on a funded basis was $26.2 billion, an increase of approximately $2.4 billion in funded backlog compared to the first quarter of 2015. It's worth noting that we ended the first quarter of 2016 with approximately 42% of our backlog comprised of international programs. 
If you'd now move to Page 5. As I just mentioned, for the first quarter 2016, sales were higher than the guidance we set in January. Sales were particularly strong at both Missiles and at SAS. We still expect sales for the company to ramp up throughout the year, with the strong second half driven by our bookings over the past several quarters and the duration of our programs. 
Looking now at sales by business. IDS had first quarter 2016 net sales of $1.3 billion. The increase from Q1 2015 was primarily driven by higher sales on certain international Patriot programs. We expect IDS sales to increase as we move through the year, as some of our international Patriot programs continue to ramp up. 
In the first quarter 2016, IIS had net sales of $1.5 billion. Compared with the same quarter last year, the increase was primarily due to our cybersecurity and special mission programs. 
Missile Systems had first quarter 2016 net sales of $1.7 billion. The 17% increase from the first quarter 2015 was primarily due to both the Paveway and AMRAAM programs. 
SAS had net sales of $1.5 billion. Higher sales on classified programs, including an international program, contributed to the 7% increase versus last year. 
And for Forcepoint, the increase was primarily due to the acquisitions of Websense, which we completed in the second quarter of 2015; and Stonesoft, which was acquired in the first quarter of 2016. As a reminder, first quarter 2015 included the results for only Raytheon Cyber Products. 
Moving ahead to Page 6. Let me spend a few minutes talking about our margins. Our operating margin was 10.6% for the total company and 10.2% on a business segment basis. We did have 2 programs with some unique circumstances that impacted our margins in the quarter: one at IDS for $36 million that, because it's in a joint venture, about half was offset through the noncontrolling interest line on the income statement; and one at Missiles for $22 million. We don't see any significant remaining financial exposure on these programs. If you exclude the 2 adjustments I just mentioned, our segment margins would be about 100 basis points higher than reported. 
In addition, as we talked about on last year's first quarter call, it's also important to note that in the first quarter of 2015, Missiles recorded a $25 million or approximately 170 basis point favorable resolution of a contractual issue related to a supplier settlement. As expected, IIS and SAS margins were both down compared to the same period last year, primarily driven by a change in program mix. 
Also, IIS first quarter 2015 margin included the favorable eBorders settlement worth about 340 basis points or $0.42 per share on a total company basis. And at Forcepoint, the first quarter 2016 operating margin was slightly above our expectations for the quarter, driven by strong operating performance. We remain focused on margin improvement going forward and see our base business segment margins in the 12.4% to 12.6% range for the full year, consistent with the guidance we laid out in January. We also see our margin cadence improving as we move throughout the year. 
As we have discussed on past calls, we are continuously looking for more ways to lower our costs, enhance our competitiveness and improve affordability for our customers. A few examples include: executing our strategic sourcing strategy to reduce costs in our supply chain, factory automation, complexity reduction initiatives and reducing our footprint. Given these efforts, our strong backlog and as we progress through the life cycle of some of our production programs, we continue to see opportunities for margin expansion. 
Turning now to Page 7. First quarter 2016 EPS of $1.43 was better than expected, driven largely by higher volume and the recognized tax benefit associated with the adoption of the new accounting standard for stock compensation worth about $0.05. 
On Page 8, we are updating the company's financial outlook for 2016. We still expect our full year 2016 net sales to be in the range of between $24 billion and $24.5 billion, up 3% to 5% from 2015. The increase is driven by growth in both our domestic and international business. We have increased the full year deferred revenue adjustment by $10 million to $77 million to reflect the updated estimate of purchase accounting related to the Stonesoft acquisition we completed earlier in the year. We have lowered our effective tax rate to reflect the tax benefit associated with the adoption of the new accounting standard for stock compensation that I just discussed which, in total, is worth about $0.13 for the full year, with the additional $0.08 expected in the second quarter. We now expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 28.5%. And we have raised our full year 2016 EPS to reflect the tax benefit I just mentioned. We now expect our EPS to be in a range of between $6.93 and $7.13. 
As I discussed earlier, we repurchased 3.2 million shares of common stock for $400 million in the quarter and continue to see our diluted share count in the range of between 296 million and 298 million shares for 2016, a 3% reduction at the midpoint of the range. 
Operating cash flow in the first quarter was strong. And we continue to see our full year 2016 operating cash flow outlook between $2.7 billion and $3 billion. And as you can see on Page 9, we've included guidance by business, which is unchanged from our prior outlook. I want to reiterate that at IDS, we still see margins in the 15.9% to 16.1% range. As I said on the January call, our full year 2016 guidance includes positive operating income at IDS related to an expected exit from certain business ventures later in 2016, which you can now think of in the $125 million to $150 million range. This is subject to the finalization of the transaction, which we expect to close in the second half of the year. 
And as a reminder, when thinking about our 2017 company margin, we see opportunity for upside from 2016 levels, excluding the impact of this gain at IDS that I just discussed, which is expected to be worth about 50 to 60 basis points at the company level in 2016. 
Before moving on to Page 10, as I mentioned on the January call, we still see our 2016 bookings to be between $25 billion and $26 billion, driven by demand from a broad base of domestic and international customers. The first quarter was a good step to meeting this target. 
On Page 10, we provided some directional guidance on how we currently see the quarterly cadence for sales, EPS and operating cash flow for the balance of 2016. Here, you can see the ramp we have been referring to in the second half of the year. I want to point out that we now expect the second quarter sales to be in the range of just under $5.7 billion to $5.8 billion, lower than our prior guidance due to the timing of volume that occurred in Q1 that I talked about earlier. And EPS from continuing operations is now expected to be in a range of $1.51 to $1.56, slightly higher than our prior guidance due to the adoption of the new accounting standard for stock compensation, worth about $0.08 in the second quarter. 
Before concluding, I'd like to spend a minute to talk about our balanced capital deployment strategy. We repurchased $400 million of stock in the quarter. And as we said on the January call, we expect the full year 2016 share buyback to approximate 2015's levels. We raised the dividend by 9.3%, our 12th consecutive annual increase. We continue to expect to generate strong free cash flow for the year and target returning 80% to 90% of free cash flow to shareholders, while maintaining a strong balance sheet. 
In summary, we saw good performance in the first quarter. Our bookings were ahead of last year's first quarter and sales, EPS and operating cash flow from continuing operations were all higher than the guidance we set in January. We remain well positioned for the year with our domestic customers' priority areas and continue to be aligned with the evolving priorities of our international customers. Our objective is to drive the business to maximize value for our customers and shareholders. 
With that, Tom and I will now open the call up for questions."

They do have unique circumstances. One of them was a program essentially complete, and we were having some, I would call it, warranty issues on some shelters from a supplier. We are working through that with the supplier. We did take a charge this quarter due to that. However, we are working with that supplier to, essentially, recover those costs. Very similar to -- if you look at last year at Missiles, we had an issue with a supplier and we recovered the costs from that supplier last year. This is unfortunately, in some cases, part of the business; when a supplier doesn't perform or has issues, we have to take the charge. But then we go back and recover those costs. That's where we're at on that one. The other one was a little bit of a stranger deal with a customer relative to some changes in scope and defining whose responsibility the scope was and also some other issues relative to the structure of the contract. So it was more of a -- to us, it's kind of a onetime type of an issue. We don't see that as systemic across the business. And so I would -- I am looking at these 2 as one-off.

As I mentioned, I just came back -- I've actually been in the Middle East twice in the -- since the beginning of the year already. The last one was to celebrate our 50th anniversary in Saudi. And I got firsthand information from the folks that are using the Patriot Systems in both -- over that period of time from both the UAE and from Saudi. I can tell you that the success has been just tremendous relative to them preventing damages due tactical ballistic missiles landing in their cities and villages. So there's a strong -- they're seeing the success of that system which is, I would say, kind of unleashing a lot other demand within the region to have the capability. So that's the basic element. What we're seeing beyond that is a demand on the Patriot System for an advanced AESA radar with 360 capability. And that demand is -- essentially, the primary part of that demand is coming from international. We also are seeing it from the U.S. Army, that's the road map to add a 360-degree AESA capability to the Patriot System. So we have invested in that technology. I mean, it goes all the way back to, again, work that we've done almost going 15, 20 years ago; but leading up to how we won the AMDR program using that technology. But now it's transitioning into the Patriot System. We're also seeing high demand for, I'd call it, Third Offset strategy concepts. And in there is, obviously, hypersonics, undersea. You saw Secretary Ash Carter talk about something called distributed lethality, and he referenced the work that's being done on Tomahawk and the SM-6 relative to add anti-ship capability. So we're seeing quite a bit of opportunities for either enhancements to our existing systems or new systems that, to ensure that we're positioned to go win those, we are doing IRAD activities to support those. I don't know if that kind of answers your question."

So no, we did not consider these in the guidance that we gave, either the one at IDS or the one at Missiles. Now just remember, the $90 million in the K that you're referring to would be the cost to us to exit the venture, not necessarily the P&L impact, but the cash impact. But as far as how we expect to see things improving or recovering this, we do expect to see margins get better or expand in Q2 and, beyond that, into the second half of '16. And as I mentioned before, even looking out into '17, we still see opportunity for margin expansion. And again, as a reminder, that's excluding the $125 million to $150 million impact from the business venture exit in '16. That said, if you think about Q2 for a minute, we do expect it to be in line with Q1, when you adjust Q1 for the impact of the 2 programs that I talked about, that I mentioned had about 100 basis point impact. If you look over the last couple of years from a total company point of view, we typically see our higher margins in the back half and even more towards Q4. We still see it playing out the same this year. And it was set up that way in the initial guidance we gave you before these charges. We also have the gain in Q3 from the venture exit that we talked about. And then, we do expect the improved performance in Q4 as we ramp up on some of our production programs, both through the retirement of risk and benefit from the combination of strong volume and driving efficiencies. So there is a ramp, Sam. The increase in the gain on the venture accounts for part of the way that this is offset, combined with, generally speaking, driving more efficiencies through the business in the back half of the year. And again, other than those adjustments in the first quarter, not much has really changed relative to the cadence as to how we see things ramping up through the year."

And then with the recent acquisition of Stonesoft created a, I would call it, a commercial cybersecurity products company that has about $600 million revenue, which puts it right up there in terms of the largest cybersecurity commercial software companies in the world. And what we're seeing is the demand for those products across the -- essentially, across each one of their major areas: the TRITON product, the Stonesoft next-generation firewalls and the SureView product line that came out of RCP. And we're really looking at how do we go to the next level relative to the growth of that business. And one of the areas that we see as a big opportunity is in the large enterprises. The Websense company came across with a very, very strong solid foundation in the SME areas, small to medium sized enterprises; with some large enterprises. But we see significant opportunity in expanding into a large enterprise area. And Matt Moynahan has significant experience in that area. He has worked all the way back in Symantec, Veracode and also at Arbor Networks. And so we needed to bring in a leader with that kind of experience to go drive the expansion and the market segmentation into those 2 groups. That's really the -- he's really the right guy to now come in and then take the lead [ph]. J. Mac [ph], John McCormack, did an excellent job for us in the integration and in making sure that we had a solid foundation. But we believe now is the time to bring in somebody who can take us into the next markets, especially in the large enterprises."

It's not consistent business-by-business. What I can maybe give you a little bit of color on, I'll just go real quick by the businesses, is maybe give you an indication on how we see things playing out through the balance of this year, right? So we talked about IDS and what happened in the quarter with the $36 million impact. But we do see the margin improving through the year, partly driven by improvement in business mix, as some of our larger international programs move to through the production cycle. And then you mentioned it a minute ago, we do have, in the second half in the third quarter, the gain from the exit of the venture, which is $125 million to $150 million. That's about 210 to 250 basis points at the IDS level. For IIS, we're expecting total year, 7.4% to 7.6%. That would be roughly in line with 2015 after adjusting for the Q1 EIBOR. What we see happening compared to Q1 there is improved mix going forward within IIS; some improved productivity as we move through the year; and also some improvement coming from expected award fees for IIS. From a Missiles point of view, we talked about the impact in the first quarter with the $22 million adjustment. But if we look forward for the balance of the year, we still see Missiles getting to the 13% to 13.2% range, with margins starting to improve or expand in Q2 and in the second half of the year, really driven by mix and the timing in the ramp-up of programs and some expected efficiencies that we would see at Missiles. At SAS, they were down year-over-year in Q1 as we expected, really driven by some mix. But they were a little bit ahead of our expectations for the quarter. And then, when we think about SAS moving forward, again, we're still in the 12.9% to 13.1% range, and we do expect the margin to improve throughout the year driven by more favorable mix and, therefore, the timing of some program improvements. At Forcepoint, real quick, margin improved in the quarter because of the addition of Websense, the acquisition last year. Still on track for the total year, 11.5% to 12.5% range, really, with a little bit more of a ramp or expansion in the second half of the year, driven by 2 things: the completion of integration activities related to the Stonesoft acquisition; and also as the sales ramp up in the back half of the year. So overall, we do see the cadence improving in Q2 as well as the second half, primarily as we progress through program life cycles on some of our more recent awards and due to the timing of expected program improvements as well."

I'm very pleased with Raytheon's strong second quarter performance. Our global growth strategy continues to drive our results, with second quarter revenue up 3%. Our operating performance in the quarter was solid,",999,"Thank you, Todd. Good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased with Raytheon's strong second quarter performance. Our global growth strategy continues to drive our results, with second quarter revenue up 3%. Our operating performance in the quarter was solid, with a strong increase in sequential margins. And cash flow generation in the second quarter was well above our expectations. Given our performance in 2016 to date and how we are seeing the balance of the year playing out, we are raising our EPS and cash flow guidance for the year. Further, based on strong demand that we are seeing from our global customers, we also have raised our outlook for bookings. Toby will walk you through the details in a few minutes.
During the second quarter, I visited a number of country leaders in the Asia Pacific region. And earlier this month, we hosted several hundred customer meetings at the Farnborough Airshow. It was a remarkable level of consistency among these conversations. That is, customers are interested in capabilities to address 2 key missions. One, support global counterterrorism campaigns; and two, maintain deterrence in a charged geopolitical environment. More specifically, we continue to see strong demand for integrated air and missile defense solutions, precision munitions and C5ISR capabilities. This demand has been broad based across the European, MENA and Asia Pacific regions. Further, this year, there has been an added sense of urgency. I can't think of a time when our international pipeline of opportunities was more robust than it is today.
Our international model, which looks at countries as markets is paying off. Let me give you just a few examples. One of our larger international opportunities over the next several months is the Qatar upgraded early warning radar. This radar will significantly improve Qatar's long-range situational awareness capabilities and represents $1 billion opportunity for the company. This follows on the country's previous order for 10 Patriot fire units and an Air Defense Operating Center. We also see further opportunity in country for TP2 radars as part of a FAD system later in 2017 or 2018. This is consistent with how we have been thinking about the progression of opportunities in the country for sometime.
Another large upcoming opportunity for the company is in Patriot, which is also progressing well. Government-to-government negotiations are ongoing, and we've achieved key milestones with Polish Industry on work share, including signing a letter of intent to work at Poland's largest defense contractor, DGC.
We anticipate that this multibillion dollar opportunity will be awarded some time in 2017. We also see additional opportunities in Poland, including short-range air defense systems related to our product line.
Looking at second quarter, our bookings were strong with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.18. Strength in the quarter was driven by the $1 billion Next Generation Jammer booking at the beginning of the quarter, a nearly $500 million upgrade to Kuwait's 6 Patriot fire units, as well as several notable missile bookings for AIM 9X, Paveway and SM-3. You may recall that we also had a strong bookings in the first quarter, which together with our Q2 results, drove our year-to-date book-to-bill ratio of 1.13. The strength in bookings lays the foundation for future growth and bolsters our confidence in our outlook. 
In the second quarter, International represented 31% of total company bookings. I would also point out that with the Kuwait Patriot booking, this is the second consecutive quarter where we have had a significant award form the MENA region. At the end of the second quarter, 42% of our total backlog was from international customers.
Our sales growth in the second quarter was ahead of our expectations. Domestic sales increased slightly, while International increased approximately 8% in the quarter, showing that our global growth strategy remains on track.
Overall, International represented 32% of total sales in the quarter.
As we look at future growth drivers for the company, I would like to take a minute to highlight a couple of our many examples. In the second quarter, we delivered the first air and missile defense radar to the U.S. Navy's Pacific Missile Range facility ahead of schedule. AMDR is the next-generation integrated air and ballistic missile defense radar for the U.S. Navy's DDG 51 Flight 3 destroyers and fills a critical capability gap for the surface fleet. This delivery is the latest in a series of milestones achieved for AMDR as it advances through the engineering and manufacturing development phase, which is now close to 80% complete.
AMDR will soon transition to low rate initial production. It remains on track for initial delivery in 2019.
Another example of a future growth driver for the company is Small Diameter Bomb II, which we continue to test with the U.S. Air Force. Small Diameter Bomb II features a highly advanced tri-mode seeker, which includes infrared imaging, millimeterwave radar and laser guidance to find and attack targets from ranges that can exceed 40 miles. Testing will continue this summer as the program moves through low rate initial production. Small Diameter Bomb II, represents a $4 billion opportunity over the lifetime of this franchise program.
Before closing, I'd like to take a moment to briefly touch on the fiscal year's '17 defense budget. As most of you know, both the House and the Senate have marked up their respective bills, and there are significant differences between them. These differences will need to be reconciled before the budget is finalized. Given this, and the fact that it is an election year, we are anticipating that there will be another continuing resolution, which will probably extend beyond the election in November. This assumption is considered within our financial guidance range.
Overall, I'm very pleased with the team's performance in the second quarter. Simply put, we had outstanding results, a solid growth and strong execution. I want to thank the team for all its efforts, which continue to deliver for our company and global customers.
With that, let me turn it over to Toby."

During my remarks, I'll be referring to the web slides that we issued earlier this morning. If everyone would please turn to Page 3.
We are pleased with the strong performance the team delivered in the second quarter with bookings, sales, EPS and operating cash flow all better than our expectations. We had strong bookings in the second quarter of $7.1 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.18. Sales were $6 billion in the quarter, up 3%, led by our Space and Airborne Systems and Missiles businesses. Our EPS from continuing operations was $2.38, which I'll give a little more color on in a few minutes. 
We generated strong operating cash flow of $746 million in the second quarter, which was better than our prior guidance, primarily driven by the timing of collections. Second quarter 2016 operating cash flow was higher than last year's second quarter, primarily due to the timing of payments and cash taxes, as well as lower required pension contributions.
During the quarter, the company repurchased 1.6 million shares of common stock for $202 million, bringing the year-to-date share repurchase to 4.8 million shares or $602 million.
I want to spend a minute talking about the recent ThalesRaytheonSystems transaction that was concluded at the end of June. Raytheon and Thales concluded an agreement to transition the stakeholder positions each company held in the TRS joint venture structure, with Raytheon acquiring 100% of the TRS U.S. operations and Thales acquiring 100% of the French operations. As a result of the transaction, Raytheon made a net cash payment to Thales in the amount of $90 million and recorded a tax-free gain of $158 million at IDS or $0.53 per diluted share in our second quarter financial results. It's important to note that we had previously forecast this to occur in the third quarter of this year at about $150 million.
I also want to point out that we're raising the EPS and operating cash flow guidance that we provided in April, reflecting our strong performance to date. I'll discuss guidance further in just a few minutes.
Turning now to Page 4.
Let me start by providing some detail on our second quarter results. Company bookings for the second quarter were $7.1 billion and on a year-to-date basis were $13.3 billion, an increase of approximately $1.3 billion over the same period last year. It's worth noting that on a trailing 4-quarter basis, our book-to-bill ratio was 1.11.
For the quarter, international was 31% of our total company bookings, and on a year-to-date basis, was 29%. For the year, we expect international to be about 35% of total bookings.
As Tom just mentioned, we booked several significant awards in the second quarter, including about $1 billion for the Next Generation Jammer program for the U.S. Navy, $574 million on domestic and foreign training programs in support of Warfighter FOCUS activities, $487 million to provide advanced Patriot air and missile defense capabilities for Kuwait and approximately $300 million a piece on both AIM-9X Sidewinder, short-range air-to-air missiles and Paveway.
Backlog at the end of the second quarter was $35.3 billion, and on a funded basis, was $26.1 billion, both up approximately $800 million compared to last year's second quarter.
If you now move to Page 5. As I mentioned earlier, for the second quarter 2016, sales exceeded the high end of guidance we set in April, primarily due to the timing within the year and better-than-expected performance across several of the businesses. For the second quarter, our international sales were approximately 32% of total sales.
Looking now at sales by business. IDS had second quarter 2016 net sales of $1.4 billion. As expected, the change in net sales for the quarter was primarily driven by the recognition of previously deferred precontract cost on our international Patriot program in the second quarter 2015.
In the second quarter 2016, IIS had net sales of $1.6 billion, up 3% compared with the same quarter last year. The increase was primarily due to our cybersecurity and special mission programs. Missile Systems had second quarter 2016 net sales of $1.7 billion, a 6% increase from the second quarter 2015 was primarily due to the Paveway program.
SAS had net sales of $1.5 billion. The 9% increase versus last year was driven by higher sales on classified programs. And for Forcepoint, the increase was primarily due to the acquisition of Websense, which we completed at the end of May 2015.
Moving ahead to Page 6. Overall, the company continues to perform well. Our operating margin was 15.9% for the total company and 14.8% on a business segment basis.
It's worth noting that the impact of the TRS gain that I discussed earlier was essentially in line with our prior expectation and was worth $158 million or about 250 basis points at the company level for the second quarter of 2016.
So looking now at the business margins. The increase in margin at IDS included the results of the TRS transaction. Without the transaction, the IDS margin in the second quarter would have been 15.5%, reflecting a strong operating performance. 
IIS operating margin was in line with last year's second quarter. Missiles margin was up 170 basis points in the quarter compared with the same period last year, primarily driven by higher net program efficiencies and a favorable change in program mix in the second quarter of 2016. The decrease in margin at SAS in the quarter, compared with the same period last year, was primarily driven by a change in program mix. 
And at Forcepoint, the second quarter 2016 operating margin was higher than last year's comparable quarter, primarily due to the acquisition of Websense. Forcepoint's Q2 margin improved from Q2 2015, and as expected, was impacted by integration and transition costs.
As we've discussed on past calls, we remain focused on margin improvement going forward. We are continuously looking for ways to lower our costs, enhance our competitiveness and improve affordability for our customers.
In the second quarter, one of the key drivers of our margin improvement was the payoff from our investment in factory automation and equipment upgrades, and we also saw productivity gains from increased operating leverage.
Turning now to Page 7.
Second quarter 2016 EPS was $2.38, better than expected, primarily driven by higher sales and productivity as well as from the timing of the TRS transaction, which as mentioned earlier, was previously forecast to occur in the third quarter. As expected, second quarter 2016 also included the tax benefit associated with the new accounting standard for stock compensation, which we previously adopted in the first quarter, worth about $0.10. Of note, second quarter 2015 included a favorable $0.29 noncash tax settlement.
On Page 8, as I mentioned earlier, we are updating the company's financial outlook for 2016 to reflect our improved operating performance to date compared to our prior guidance.
We still expect our full year 2016 net sales to be in the range of between $24 billion and $24.5 billion, up 3% to 5% from 2015. The increase is driven by growth in both our domestic and international business.
We've increased our full year 2016 EPS by $0.20 from our prior guidance, and now expect it to be in the range of $7.13 to $7.33. The increase is driven by our improved performance in the first half of the year, as well as a slight improvement to the effective tax rate and slightly lower interest expense.
Turning to our share repurchase. Through the end of the second quarter, we repurchased 4.8 million shares of common stock for just over $600 million and continue to see our diluted share count in the range of between 296 million and 298 million shares for 2016, a 3% reduction at the midpoint of the range. Also, based on our strong performance to date, we have increased the range for our 2016 operating cash flow guidance by $100 million, and now see it between $2.8 billion and $3.1 billion.
And as you can see on Page 9, we've included guidance by business. We left the sales unchanged from prior outlook.
Looking at margins. We've increased the margin guidance range for the company, and now see operating margin to be in the range of 13.2% to 13.4% for the full year, up 20 basis points from our prior guidance.
At the business segment level, we now see the operating margin in the range of 12.6% to 12.8% for the full year, driven by higher expected operating margin at IDS and SAS.
Before moving on to Page 10, given our year-to-date bookings strength and our expectations for strong back half of the year, we are now raising our full year 2016 bookings outlook to $26 billion, plus or minus $500 million. This $500 million increase to the prior range is driven by strong demand from our global customers.
On Page 10, we have provided guidance on how we currently see our third quarter for sales, earnings and operating cash flow from continuing operations. We still expect third quarter sales to be in the range of just under $6 billion to $6.1 billion, consistent with our prior guidance. EPS from continuing operations is now expected to be in the range of $1.57 to $1.62, lower than our prior guidance due to the timing of the TRS transaction, which we had previously forecast in the third quarter. Some of this impact has been offset by the timing of performance improvements previously expected in the fourth quarter.
Before concluding, as we have discussed on past earnings calls with regard to our capital deployment strategy, we expect to continue to generate strong free cash flow and maintain a solid balance sheet at our current credit rating going forward.
We remain focused on the deploying capital to create value for our shareholders and customers. This includes internal investments to support our growth plans and productivity improvements, as well as returning capital to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends, making small targeted acquisitions that our technology and global growth needs, and from time to time, making discretionary contributions to our pension plans.
In summary, if you stand back and look at the quarter, we had strong performance. Our bookings, sales, EPS and operating cash flow from continuing operations were all higher than expected. Based on this performance and our near-term expectations, we increased our 2016 guidance for EPS, operating margin and operating cash flow.
With that, Tom and I will open up the call for questions."

At our last call, we indicated a target of 89 -- 80% to 90% of free cash flow going back to shareholders. Right now, we probably see it maybe at the bottom of that range, pending market conditions. And if we continue to see strong movement in the stock, we're not going to chase the stock price. Share repurchase will still continue to be a core part of our capital deployment strategy with the stated goals reducing the diluted share count over time, and that hasn't changed.

We will give everyone an updated outlook as we typically do on the third quarter call. That said, let me give you a little bit of insight to a few things. Year-to-date, our asset return is about 4.5%. And due to assets moving, any type of actual return will have to be significantly different than expected at year-end in order to have a meaningful impact on 2017  FAS/CAS and/or net cash. That said, assuming all other assumptions remain the same, every 25 basis points change in our discount rate has about an $80 million impact on 2017  FAS/CAS. And net cash will be unchanged because it continues to be based upon a 25-year average discount rate. So a few variables there that you all can use and model. But again, with half the year left to go, a little too early to predict exactly next year may look like. And we'll update you here at the end of October on our third quarter call."

So we've been talking about IDS for a while, but we obviously continue to see opportunities to expand margin further in the second half of the year. We did raise our margin guidance based upon the results for the first half of the year, up by about 40 basis points. Half of that was because of a little bit higher off gain on the TRS transaction, and the other half was from productivity we are seeing because of the leverage of the volume going to our factory, the investments in factory automation, equipment upgrades, as we mentioned before. And I talked about our third quarter guidance and how it was, from a timing point of view impacted by TRS moving into Q2. But we did offset, that was worth about $0.50. We did offset about $0.12 of that, primarily driven by further opportunities for net program efficiencies to drive more margin. Those are moving in from Q4 to Q3, not just at IDS, but at other businesses. So we feel really good about where we are headed going forward from a margin perspective. We would expect to continue, as we've been saying, both at the company level and specifically at IDS to continue to expand margins going forward beyond '16 into '17 as well. From an IIS perspective on the sales, they had a good quarter. Their sales were up to 3%, driven by cybersecurity and special mission programs. For the second half, we see their sales in line with last year's second half despite having 4 fewer workdays and we still expect growth for the year at IIS in the low single digits."

You're right, we have seen a buildup in our CIP balance. This increase was in line with what we were expecting.

You're right, we have seen a buildup in our CIP balance. This increase was in line with what we were expecting. It was primarily driven by our sales growth, along with the timing of program millstones and collections, including the ramp-up on some of the more recent awards that we've had last year and into the early part of this year. It's also important, and I would note, that our expected cadence a similar this year to prior years with a buildup of CIP in the first half and then a decrease in the second half, really driven primarily by the timing of certain milestones in collections. If you look forward to the end of the year, and I think we talked about this back in Q1, we would expect our CIP balance to be up compared to '15 but more in line with what our balance was at the end of Q1 of 2016. And this is aligned with our growth profile, and again, driven by the timing of program milestones. As we move to the back half of '16 and into 2017, we will continue to focus on driving working capital improvements and cash flow generation across the business.
We obviously saw strong cash flow here in the quarter, some of it was timing, David, right? But some of it was permanent improvement for the year, which is why we raised the outlook for the year by a $100 million to the new range of $2.8 billion to $3.1 billion. As far as cash taxes go, I think that was your second question. No change from a total year point of view from what we were previously expecting there. We still think cash taxes that will be paid a little bit over $900 million for the year, the net off refunds a little over $750 million for the year as well. I think your third question was around the cash impact in '17 from the required funding of the pension. So look, as we've said previously there, when we hold all the assumptions constant, we see our CAS increasing going from '16 to '17 as we transition fully to harmonization and then remaining relatively flat beyond that. In '16, the pension cash flow is a bit of an anomaly. It's up from '15. But then again, after '16, the cash flow for pension still expected to be positive but more, as we've said, in a normalized rate, plus or minus $700 million net positive. We do sea improved cash flow in our business as programs continues progress through their life cycles and achieve significant program milestones that will improve the cash position. And our continued focus on working capital, including cycle time and payment term reductions with our customers will also drive some cash flow, which could -- and will offset part of that increase. As a reminder, that increase is really driven by the plants coming out of full funding from a PPA point of view, and again, primarily having to fund the annual service costs. As we always do, kind of last point here, we'll continue to monitor all aspects of the pension and we will consider making it, if it makes economic sense to the company, to the shareholders, we'll consider making discretionary contributions before the year is over that could potentially have a further impact on the cash flow profile in '17 and beyond."

Our global growth strategy continues to drive our results with second quarter revenue up 3%. Our operating performance in the quarter was solid with a strong increase in sequential margins. And cash flow generation in the second quarter was well above our expectations. Given our performance in 2016 to date and how we are seeing the balance of the year playing out, we are raising our EPS and cash flow guidance for the year. Further, based on strong demand that we are seeing from our global customers, we also have raised our outlook for bookings. Toby will walk you through the details in a few minutes.
During the second quarter, I visited a number of country leaders in the Asia Pacific region. And earlier this month, we hosted several hundred customer meetings at the Farnborough Airshow. There was a remarkable level of consistency among these conversations. That is, customers are interested in capabilities to address 2 key missions: one, support global counterterrorism campaigns; and two, maintain deterrence in a charged geopolitical environment. More specifically, we continue to see strong demand for integrated air and missile defense solutions, precision munitions and C5ISR capabilities. This demand has been broad-based across the European, MENA and Asia Pacific regions. Further, this year, there has been an added sense of urgency. I can't think of a time when our international pipeline of opportunities was more robust than it is today.
Our international model, which looks at countries as markets, is paying off. Let me just give you a few examples. One of our larger international opportunities over the next several months is the Qatar Upgraded Early Warning Radar. This radar will significantly improve Qatar's long-range situational awareness capabilities and represents $1 billion opportunity for the company. This follows on the country's previous order for 10 Patriot fire units and an Air Defense Operating Center. We also see further opportunity in country for TPY-2 radars as part of a THAAD system later in 2017 or 2018. This is consistent with how we have been thinking about the progression of opportunities in the country for some time.
Another large upcoming opportunity for the company is Poland Patriot, which is also progressing well. Government-to-government negotiations are ongoing, and we've achieved key milestones with Polish industry on work share, including signing a letter of intent to work at Poland's largest defense contractor, DGC.
We anticipate that this multibillion dollar opportunity will be awarded some time in 2017. We also see additional opportunities in Poland, including short-range air defense systems related to our NASAMS product line.
Looking at second quarter, our bookings were strong with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.18. Strength in the quarter was driven by the $1 billion Next Generation Jammer booking at the beginning of the quarter, a nearly $500 million upgrade to Kuwait's 6 Patriot fire units as well as several notable missile bookings for AIM 9X, Paveway and SM-3. You may recall that we also had a strong bookings in the first quarter, which, together with our Q2 results, drove a year-to-date book-to-bill ratio of 1.13. This strength in bookings lays the foundation for future growth and bolsters our confidence in our outlook.
In the second quarter, international represented 31% of total company bookings. I would also point out that with the Kuwait Patriot booking, this is the second consecutive quarter where we have had a significant award from the MENA region. At the end of the second quarter, 42% of our total backlog was from international customers.
Our sales growth in the second quarter was ahead of our expectations. Domestic sales increased slightly, while international increased approximately 8% in the quarter, showing that our global growth strategy remains on track.
Overall, international represented 32% of total sales in the quarter.
As we look at future growth drivers for the company, I would like to take a minute to highlight a couple of our many examples. In the second quarter, we delivered the first Air and Missile Defense Radar to the U.S. Navy's Pacific Missile Range Facility ahead of schedule. AMDR is the next-generation integrated air and ballistic missile defense radar for the U.S. Navy's DDG-51 Flight III destroyers and fills a critical capability gap for the surface fleet. This delivery is the latest in a series of milestones achieved for AMDR as it advances through the engineering and manufacturing development phase, which is now close to 80% complete. AMDR will soon transition to low-rate initial production and remains on track for initial delivery in 2019.
Another example of a future growth driver for the company is Small Diameter Bomb II, which we continue to test with the U.S. Air Force. Small Diameter Bomb II features a highly advanced tri-mode seeker, which includes infrared imaging, millimeter wave radar and laser guidance to find and attack targets from ranges that can exceed 40 miles. Testing will continue this summer as the program moves through low-rate initial production. Small Diameter Bomb II represents a $4 billion opportunity over the lifetime of this franchise program.
Before closing, I'd like to take a moment to briefly touch on the fiscal year's '17 defense budget. As most of you know, both the House and the Senate have marked up their respective bills, and there are significant differences between them. These differences will need to be reconciled before the budget is finalized. Given this and the fact that it is an election year, we are anticipating that there will be another continuing resolution, which will probably extend beyond the election in November. This assumption is considered within our financial guidance range.
Overall, I'm very pleased with the team's performance in the second quarter. Simply put, we had an outstanding results, a solid growth and strong execution. I want to thank the team for all its efforts, which continue to deliver for our company and global customers.
With that, let me turn it over to Toby."
105612,371819388,1015491,"Raytheon Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Raytheon Company","Executives","Okay. Thanks, Tom.

I have a few opening remarks starting with the second quarter highlights, and then we'll move on to questions. During my remarks, I'll be referring to the web slides that we issued earlier this morning.
Everyone would please turn to Page 3. We are pleased with the strong performance the team delivered in the second quarter with bookings, sales, EPS and operating cash flow all better than our expectations. We had strong bookings in the second quarter of $7.1 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.18. Sales were $6 billion in the quarter, up 3%, led by our Space and Airborne Systems and Missiles businesses. Our EPS from continuing operations was $2.38, which I'll give a little more color on in a few minutes.
We generated strong operating cash flow of $746 million in the second quarter, which was better than our prior guidance, primarily driven by the timing of collections. Second quarter 2016 operating cash flow was higher than last year's second quarter primarily due to the timing of payments and cash taxes as well as lower required pension contributions.
During the quarter, the company repurchased 1.6 million shares of common stock for $202 million, bringing the year-to-date share repurchase to 4.8 million shares for $602 million.
I want to spend a minute talking about the recent ThalesRaytheonSystems transaction that was concluded at the end of June. Raytheon and Thales concluded an agreement to transition the stakeholder positions each company held in the TRS joint venture structure, with Raytheon acquiring 100% of the TRS U.S. operations and Thales acquiring 100% of the French operations. As a result of the transaction, Raytheon made a net cash payment to Thales in the amount of $90 million and recorded a tax-free gain of $158 million at IDS or $0.53 per diluted share in our second quarter financial results. It's important to note that we had previously forecast this to occur in the third quarter of this year at about $150 million.
I also want to point out that we're raising the EPS and operating cash flow guidance that we provided in April, reflecting our strong performance to date. I'll discuss guidance further in just a few minutes.
Turning now to Page 4. Let me start by providing some detail on our second quarter results. Company bookings for the second quarter were $7.1 billion and, on a year-to-date basis, were $13.3 billion, an increase of approximately $1.3 billion over the same period last year. It's worth noting that on a trailing 4-quarter basis, our book-to-bill ratio was 1.11.
For the quarter, international was 31% of our total company bookings and, on a year-to-date basis, was 29%. For the year, we expect international to be about 35% of total bookings.
As Tom just mentioned, we booked several significant awards in the second quarter, including about $1 billion for the Next Generation Jammer program for the U.S. Navy, $574 million on domestic and foreign training programs in support of Warfighter FOCUS activities, $487 million to provide advanced Patriot air and missile defense capabilities for Kuwait and approximately $300 million a piece on both AIM-9X Sidewinder, short-range air-to-air missiles and Paveway.
Backlog at the end of the second quarter was $35.3 billion and, on a funded basis, was $26.1 billion, both up approximately $800 million compared to last year's second quarter.
If you now move to Page 5. As I mentioned earlier, for the second quarter 2016, sales exceeded the high end of guidance we set in April primarily due to the timing within the year and better-than-expected performance across several of the businesses. For the second quarter, our international sales were approximately 32% of total sales.
Looking now at sales by business. IDS had second quarter 2016 net sales of $1.4 billion. As expected, the change in net sales for the quarter was primarily driven by the recognition of previously deferred precontract cost on an international Patriot program in the second quarter 2015.
In the second quarter 2016, IIS had net sales of $1.6 billion, up 3% compared with the same quarter last year. The increase was primarily due to our cybersecurity and special mission programs. Missile Systems had second quarter 2016 net sales of $1.7 billion. The 6% increase from the second quarter 2015 was primarily due to the Paveway program.
SAS had net sales of $1.5 billion. The 9% increase versus last year was driven by higher sales on classified programs. And for Forcepoint, the increase was primarily due to the acquisition of Websense, which we completed at the end of May 2015.
Moving ahead to Page 6. Overall, the company continues to perform well. Our operating margin was 15.9% for the total company and 14.8% on a business segment basis. It's worth noting that the impact of the TRS gain that I discussed earlier was essentially in line with our prior expectation and was worth $158 million or about 260 basis points at the company level for the second quarter of 2016.
So looking now at the business margins. The increase in margin at IDS included the results of the TRS transaction. Without the transaction, the IDS margin in the second quarter would have been 15.5%, reflecting a strong operating performance.
IIS operating margin was in line with last year's second quarter. Missiles margin was up 170 basis points in the quarter compared with the same period last year primarily driven by higher net program efficiencies and a favorable change in program mix in the second quarter of 2016. The decrease in margin at SAS in the quarter compared with the same period last year was primarily driven by a change in program mix. And at Forcepoint, the second quarter 2016 operating margin was higher than last year's comparable quarter primarily due to the acquisition of Websense. Forcepoint's Q2 margin improved from Q2 2015 and, as expected, was impacted by integration and transition costs.
As we've discussed on past calls, we remain focused on margin improvement going forward. We are continuously looking for ways to lower our costs, enhance our competitiveness and improve affordability for our customers. In the second quarter, one of the key drivers of our margin improvement was the payoff from our investment in factory automation and equipment upgrades, and we also saw productivity gains from increased operating leverage.
Turning now to Page 7. Second quarter 2016 EPS was $2.38, better than expected, primarily driven by higher sales and productivity as well as from the timing of the TRS transaction, which, as mentioned earlier, was previously forecast to occur in the third quarter. As expected, second quarter 2016 also included the tax benefit associated with the new accounting standard for stock compensation, which we previously adopted in the first quarter, worth about $0.10. Of note, second quarter 2015 included a favorable $0.29 noncash tax settlement.
On Page 8, as I mentioned earlier, we are updating the company's financial outlook for 2016 to reflect our improved operating performance to date compared to our prior guidance. We still expect our full year 2016 net sales to be in the range of between $24 billion and $24.5 billion, up 3% to 5% from 2015. The increase is driven by growth in both our domestic and international business.
We've increased our full year 2016 EPS by $0.20 from our prior guidance and now expect it to be in the range of $7.13 to $7.33. The increase is driven by our improved performance in the first half of the year as well as a slight improvement to the effective tax rate and slightly lower interest expense.
Turning to our share repurchase. Through the end of the second quarter, we repurchased 4.8 million shares of common stock for just over $600 million and continue to see our diluted share count in the range of between 296 million and 298 million shares for 2016, a 3% reduction at the midpoint of the range. Also, based on our strong performance to date, we have increased the range for our 2016 operating cash flow guidance by $100 million and now see it between $2.8 billion and $3.1 billion.
And as you can see on Page 9, we've included guidance by business. We left the sales unchanged from prior outlook.
Looking at margins. We've increased the margin guidance range for the company and now see operating margin to be in the range of 13.2% to 13.4% for the full year, up 20 basis points from our prior guidance.
At the business segment level, we now see the operating margin in the range of 12.6% to 12.8% for the full year driven by higher expected operating margin at IDS and SAS.
Before moving on to Page 10, given our year-to-date bookings strength and our expectations for a strong back half of the year, we are now raising our full year 2016 bookings outlook to $26 billion, plus or minus $500 million. This $500 million increase to the prior range is driven by a strong demand from our global customers.
On Page 10, we have provided guidance on how we currently see our third quarter for sales, earnings per share and operating cash flow from continuing operations. We still expect third quarter sales to be in the range of just under $6 billion to $6.1 billion, consistent with our prior guidance. EPS from continuing operations is now expected to be in the range of $1.57 to $1.62, lower than our prior guidance due to the timing of the TRS transaction, which we had previously forecast in the third quarter. Some of this impact has been offset by the timing of performance improvements previously expected in the fourth quarter.
Before concluding, as we have discussed on past earnings calls with regard to our capital deployment strategy, we expect to continue to generate strong free cash flow and maintain a solid balance sheet at our current credit rating going forward.
We remain focused on the deploying capital to create value for our shareholders and customers. This includes internal investments to support our growth plans and productivity improvements as well as returning capital to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends, making small targeted acquisitions that our technology and global growth needs and from time to time, making discretionary contributions to our pension plans.
In summary, if you stand back and look at the quarter, we had strong performance. Our bookings, sales, EPS and operating cash flow from continuing operations were all higher than expected. Based on this performance and our near-term expectations, we increased our 2016 guidance for EPS, operating margin and operating cash flow.
With that, Tom and I will open up the call for questions."

Year-to-date, our asset return is about 4.5%.

That said, assuming all other assumptions remain the same, every 25 basis points change in our discount rate has about an $80 million impact on 2017 FAS/CAS.

And I'll start, Howard, with IDS, right? So we've been talking about IDS for a while, but we obviously continue to see opportunities to expand margin further in the second half of the year. We did raise our margin guidance based upon the results through the first half of the year, up by about 40 basis points. Half of that was because of a little bit higher of gain on the TRS transaction, and the other half was from productivity we are seeing because of the leverage of the volume going through our factory, the investments in factory automation, equipment upgrades, as we mentioned before. And I talked about our third quarter guidance and how it was, from a timing point of view, impacted by TRS moving into Q2. But we did offset. That was worth about $0.50. We did offset about $0.12 of that primarily driven by further opportunities for net program efficiencies to drive more margin. Those are moving in from Q4 to Q3, not just at IDS but at other businesses. So we feel real good about where we are headed going forward from a margin perspective. We would expect to continue, as we've been saying, both at the company level and specifically at IDS, to continue to expand margins going forward beyond '16 into '17 as well. From an IIS perspective on the sales, they had a good quarter. Their sales were up to 3%, driven by cybersecurity and special mission programs. For the second half, we see their sales in line with last year's second half despite having 4 fewer workdays, and we still expect growth for the year at IIS in the low single digits."

You're right, we have seen a buildup in our CIP balance. This increase was in line with what we were expecting. It was primarily driven by our sales growth, along with the timing of program milestones and collections, i",581,"Sure. So let me start with the CIP. You're right, we have seen a buildup in our CIP balance. This increase was in line with what we were expecting. It was primarily driven by our sales growth, along with the timing of program milestones and collections, including the ramp-up on some of the more recent awards that we've had last year and into the early part of this year. It's also important, and I would note that our expected cadence is similar this year to prior years with the buildup of CIP in the first half and then a decrease in the second half, really driven primarily by the timing of certain milestones in collections. If you look forward to the end of the year, and I think we talked about this back in Q1, we would expect our CIP balance to be up compared to '15 but more in line with what our balance was at the end of Q1 of 2016. And this is aligned with our growth profile and again, driven by the timing of program milestones. As we move to the back half of '16 and into 2017, we will continue to focus on driving working capital improvements and cash flow generation across the business. We obviously saw a strong cash flow here in the quarter. Some of it was timing, David, right? But some of it was permanent improvement for the year, which is why we raised the outlook for the year by $100 million to the new range of $2.8 billion to $3.1 billion. As far as cash taxes go, I think that was your second question, no change from a total year point of view from what we were previously expecting there. We still think cash taxes that will be paid a little bit over $900 million for the year, the net off refunds a little over $750 million for the year as well. I think your third question was around the cash impact in '17 from the required funding of the pension. So look, as we've said previously there, when we hold all the assumptions constant, we see our cash increasing going from '16 to '17 as we transition fully to harmonization and then remaining relatively flat beyond that. In '16, the pension cash flow is a bit of an anomaly. It's up from '15. But then again, after '16, the cash flow for pension is still expected to be positive but more, as we've said, in a normalized rate, plus or minus $700 million net positive. We do see improved cash flow in our business as programs continue to progress through their life cycles and achieve significant program milestones that will improve the cash position. And our continued focus on working capital, including cycle time and payment term reductions with our customers, will also drive some cash flow, which could -- and will offset part of that increase. As a reminder, that increase is really driven by the plants coming out of full funding from a PPA point of view and again, primarily having to fund the annual service costs. As we always do, kind of last point here, we'll continue to monitor all aspects of the pension. And we will consider making it -- if it makes economic sense to the company, to the shareholders, we'll consider making discretionary contributions before the year is over that could potentially have a further impact on the cash flow profile in '17 and beyond."

The 15.5% margin that IDS delivered, excluding the TRS gain, as I mentioned, part of that was from accelerating net program efficiencies, profit improvements from the back half of the year into the second quarter. We see a little bit more of that in the third quarter. We upped the margin guidance by the 40 basis points: half of which was attributable to operating performance; the other half to the gain. And we would expect to continue to see margin improvement at IDS beyond '16's rate normalized for the TRS gain. We'd expect to see improvement continuing into '17."

Our global growth strategy continues to drive our results with second quarter revenue up 3%. Our operating performance in the quarter was solid with a strong increase in sequential margins. And cash flow generation in the second quarter was well above our expectations. Given our performance in 2016 to date and how we are seeing the balance of the year playing out, we are raising our EPS and cash flow guidance for the year. Further, based on strong demand that we are seeing from our global customers, we also have raised our outlook for bookings. Toby will walk you through the details in a few minutes.
During the second quarter, I visited a number of country leaders in the Asia Pacific region. And earlier this month, we hosted several hundred customer meetings at the Farnborough Airshow. There was a remarkable level of consistency among these conversations. That is, customers are interested in capabilities to address 2 key missions: one, support global counterterrorism campaigns; and two, maintain deterrence in a charged geopolitical environment. More specifically, we continue to see strong demand for integrated air and missile defense solutions, precision munitions and C5ISR capabilities. This demand has been broad-based across the European, MENA and Asia Pacific regions. Further, this year, there has been an added sense of urgency. I can't think of a time when our international pipeline of opportunities was more robust than it is today.
Our international model, which looks at countries as markets, is paying off. Let me just give you a few examples. One of our larger international opportunities over the next several months is the Qatar Upgraded Early Warning Radar. This radar will significantly improve Qatar's long-range situational awareness capabilities and represents $1 billion opportunity for the company. This follows on the country's previous order for 10 Patriot fire units and an Air Defense Operating Center. We also see further opportunity in country for TPY-2 radars as part of a THAAD system later in 2017 or 2018. This is consistent with how we have been thinking about the progression of opportunities in the country for some time.
Another large upcoming opportunity for the company is Poland Patriot, which is also progressing well. Government-to-government negotiations are ongoing, and we've achieved key milestones with Polish industry on work share, including signing a letter of intent to work with Poland's largest defense contractor, DGC.
We anticipate that this multibillion dollar opportunity will be awarded some time in 2017. We also see additional opportunities in Poland, including short-range air defense systems related to our NASAMS product line.
Looking at second quarter, our bookings were strong with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.18. Strength in the quarter was driven by the $1 billion Next Generation Jammer booking at the beginning of the quarter, a nearly $500 million upgrade to Kuwait's 6 Patriot fire units as well as several notable missile bookings for AIM 9X, Paveway and SM-3. You may recall that we also had a strong bookings in the first quarter, which, together with our Q2 results, drove a year-to-date book-to-bill ratio of 1.13. This strength in bookings lays the foundation for future growth and bolsters our confidence in our outlook.
In the second quarter, international represented 31% of total company bookings. I would also point out that with the Kuwait Patriot booking, this is the second consecutive quarter where we have had a significant award from the MENA region. At the end of the second quarter, 42% of our total backlog was from international customers.
Our sales growth in the second quarter was ahead of our expectations. Domestic sales increased slightly, while international increased approximately 8% in the quarter, showing that our global growth strategy remains on track.
Overall, international represented 32% of total sales in the quarter.
As we look at future growth drivers for the company, I would like to take a minute to highlight a couple of our many examples. In the second quarter, we delivered the first Air and Missile Defense Radar to the U.S. Navy's Pacific Missile Range Facility ahead of schedule. AMDR is the next-generation integrated air and ballistic missile defense radar for the U.S. Navy's DDG-51 Flight III destroyers and fills a critical capability gap for the surface fleet. This delivery is the latest in a series of milestones achieved for AMDR as it advances through the engineering and manufacturing development phase, which is now close to 80% complete. AMDR will soon transition to low-rate initial production and remains on track for initial delivery in 2019.
Another example of a future growth driver for the company is Small Diameter Bomb II, which we continue to test with the U.S. Air Force. Small Diameter Bomb II features a highly advanced tri-mode seeker, which includes infrared imaging, millimeter wave radar and laser guidance to find and attack targets from ranges that can exceed 40 miles. Testing will continue this summer as the program moves through low-rate initial production. Small Diameter Bomb II represents a $4 billion opportunity over the lifetime of this franchise program.
Before closing, I'd like to take a moment to briefly touch on the fiscal year's '17 defense budget. As most of you know, both the House and the Senate have marked up their respective bills, and there are significant differences between them. These differences will need to be reconciled before the budget is finalized. Given this and the fact that it is an election year, we are anticipating that there will be another continuing resolution, which will probably extend beyond the election in November. This assumption is considered within our financial guidance range.
Overall, I'm very pleased with the team's performance in the second quarter. Simply put, we had an outstanding results with solid growth and strong execution. I want to thank the team for all its efforts, which continue to deliver for our company and global customers.
With that, let me turn it over to Toby."

I have a few opening remarks starting with the second quarter highlights, and then we'll move on to questions. During my remarks, I'll be referring to the web slides that we issued earlier this morning.
Everyone would please turn to Page 3. We are pleased with the strong performance the team delivered in the second quarter with bookings, sales, EPS and operating cash flow all better than our expectations. We had strong bookings in the second quarter of $7.1 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.18. Sales were $6 billion in the quarter, up 3%, led by our Space and Airborne Systems and Missiles businesses. Our EPS from continuing operations was $2.38, which I'll give a little more color on in a few minutes.
We generated strong operating cash flow of $746 million in the second quarter, which was better than our prior guidance, primarily driven by the timing of collections. Second quarter 2016 operating cash flow was higher than last year's second quarter primarily due to the timing of payments and cash taxes as well as lower required pension contributions.
During the quarter, the company repurchased 1.6 million shares of common stock for $202 million, bringing the year-to-date share repurchase to 4.8 million shares for $602 million.
I want to spend a minute talking about the recent ThalesRaytheonSystems transaction that was concluded at the end of June. Raytheon and Thales concluded an agreement to transition the stakeholder positions each company held in the TRS joint venture structure, with Raytheon acquiring 100% of the TRS U.S. operations and Thales acquiring 100% of the French operations. As a result of the transaction, Raytheon made a net cash payment to Thales in the amount of $90 million and recorded a tax-free gain of $158 million at IDS or $0.53 per diluted share in our second quarter financial results. It's important to note that we had previously forecast this to occur in the third quarter of this year at about $150 million.
I also want to point out that we're raising the EPS and operating cash flow guidance that we provided in April, reflecting our strong performance to date. I'll discuss guidance further in just a few minutes.
Turning now to Page 4. Let me start by providing some detail on our second quarter results. Company bookings for the second quarter were $7.1 billion and, on a year-to-date basis, were $13.3 billion, an increase of approximately $1.3 billion over the same period last year. It's worth noting that on a trailing 4-quarter basis, our book-to-bill ratio was 1.11.
For the quarter, international was 31% of our total company bookings and, on a year-to-date basis, was 29%. For the year, we expect international to be about 35% of total bookings.
As Tom just mentioned, we booked several significant awards in the second quarter, including about $1 billion for the Next Generation Jammer program for the U.S. Navy, $574 million on domestic and foreign training programs in support of Warfighter FOCUS activities, $487 million to provide advanced Patriot air and missile defense capabilities for Kuwait and approximately $300 million apiece on both AIM-9X Sidewinder, short-range air-to-air missiles and Paveway.
Backlog at the end of the second quarter was $35.3 billion and, on a funded basis, was $26.1 billion, both up approximately $800 million compared to last year's second quarter.
We now move to Page 5. As I mentioned earlier, for the second quarter 2016, sales exceeded the high end of guidance we set in April primarily due to the timing within the year and better-than-expected performance across several of the businesses. For the second quarter, our international sales were approximately 32% of total sales.
Looking now at sales by business. IDS had second quarter 2016 net sales of $1.4 billion. As expected, the change in net sales for the quarter was primarily driven by the recognition of previously deferred precontract cost on an international Patriot program in the second quarter 2015.
In the second quarter 2016, IIS had net sales of $1.6 billion, up 3% compared with the same quarter last year. The increase was primarily due to our cybersecurity and special mission programs. Missile Systems had second quarter 2016 net sales of $1.7 billion. The 6% increase from the second quarter 2015 was primarily due to the Paveway program.
SAS had net sales of $1.5 billion. The 9% increase versus last year was driven by higher sales on classified programs. And for Forcepoint, the increase was primarily due to the acquisition of Websense, which we completed at the end of May 2015.
Moving ahead to Page 6. Overall, the company continues to perform well. Our operating margin was 15.9% for the total company and 14.8% on a business segment basis. It's worth noting that the impact of the TRS gain that I discussed earlier was essentially in line with our prior expectation and was worth $158 million or about 260 basis points at the company level for the second quarter of 2016.
So looking now at the business margins. The increase in margin at IDS included the results of the TRS transaction. Without the transaction, the IDS margin in the second quarter would have been 15.5%, reflecting their strong operating performance.
IIS operating margin was in line with last year's second quarter. Missiles margin was up 170 basis points in the quarter compared with the same period last year primarily driven by higher net program efficiencies and a favorable change in program mix in the second quarter of 2016. The decrease in margin at SAS in the quarter compared with the same period last year was primarily driven by a change in program mix. And at Forcepoint, the second quarter 2016 operating margin was higher than last year's comparable quarter primarily due to the acquisition of Websense. Forcepoint's Q2 margin improved from Q2 2015 and, as expected, was impacted by integration and transition costs.
As we've discussed on past calls, we remain focused on margin improvement going forward. We are continuously looking for ways to lower our costs, enhance our competitiveness and improve affordability for our customers. In the second quarter, one of the key drivers of our margin improvement was the payoff from our investment in factory automation and equipment upgrades, and we also saw productivity gains from increased operating leverage.
Turning now to Page 7. Second quarter 2016 EPS was $2.38, better than expected, primarily driven by higher sales and productivity as well as from the timing of the TRS transaction, which, as mentioned earlier, was previously forecast to occur in the third quarter. As expected, second quarter 2016 also included the tax benefit associated with the new accounting standard for stock compensation, which we previously adopted in the first quarter, worth about $0.10. Of note, second quarter 2015 included a favorable $0.29 noncash tax settlement.
On Page 8, as I mentioned earlier, we are updating the company's financial outlook for 2016 to reflect our improved operating performance to date compared to our prior guidance. We still expect our full year 2016 net sales to be in the range of between $24 billion and $24.5 billion, up 3% to 5% from 2015. The increase is driven by growth in both our domestic and international business.
We've increased our full year 2016 EPS by $0.20 from our prior guidance and now expect it to be in the range of $7.13 to $7.33. The increase is driven by our improved performance in the first half of the year as well as a slight improvement to the effective tax rate and slightly lower interest expense.
Turning to our share repurchase. Through the end of the second quarter, we repurchased 4.8 million shares of common stock for just over $600 million and continue to see our diluted share count in the range of between 296 million and 298 million shares for 2016, a 3% reduction at the midpoint of the range. Also, based on our strong performance to date, we have increased the range for our 2016 operating cash flow guidance by $100 million and now see it between $2.8 billion and $3.1 billion.
And as you can see on Page 9, we've included guidance by business. We left the sales unchanged from prior outlook.
Looking at margins. We've increased the margin guidance range for the company and now see operating margin to be in a range of 13.2% to 13.4% for the full year, up 20 basis points from our prior guidance.
At the business segment level, we now see the operating margin in a range of 12.6% to 12.8% for the full year driven by higher expected operating margin at IDS and SAS.
Before moving on to Page 10, given our year-to-date bookings strength and our expectations for a strong back half of the year, we are now raising our full year 2016 bookings outlook to $26 billion, plus or minus $500 million. This $500 million increase to the prior range is driven by strong demand from our global customers.
On Page 10, we have provided guidance on how we currently see our third quarter for sales, earnings per share and operating cash flow from continuing operations. We still expect third quarter sales to be in a range of just under $6 billion to $6.1 billion, consistent with our prior guidance. EPS from continuing operations is now expected to be in a range of $1.57 to $1.62, lower than our prior guidance due to the timing of the TRS transaction, which we had previously forecast in the third quarter. Some of this impact has been offset by the timing of performance improvements previously expected in the fourth quarter.
Before concluding, as we have discussed on past earnings calls with regard to our capital deployment strategy, we expect to continue to generate strong free cash flow and maintain a solid balance sheet at our current credit rating going forward.
We remain focused on deploying capital to create value for our shareholders and customers. This includes internal investments to support our growth plans and productivity improvements as well as returning capital to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends, making small targeted acquisitions that our technology and global growth needs and from time to time, making discretionary contributions to our pension plans.
In summary, if you stand back and look at the quarter, we had strong performance. Our bookings, sales, EPS and operating cash flow from continuing operations were all higher than expected. Based on this performance and our near-term expectations, we increased our 2016 guidance for EPS, operating margin and operating cash flow.
With that, Tom and I will open up the call for questions."

We're more than halfway through what we had targeted at the beginning of the year. That said, related to the repurchase, we still continue to see value in our stock. At our last call, we indicated a target of 89 -- 80% to 90% of free cash flow going back to shareholders. Right now, we probably see it maybe at the bottom of that range, pending market conditions. And if we continue to see strong movement in the stock, we're not going to chase the stock price. Share repurchase will still continue to be a core part of our capital deployment strategy with the stated goal of reducing the diluted share count over time, and that hasn't changed.

Year-to-date, our asset return is about 4.5%. And due to assets moving, any type of actual return would have to be significantly different than expected at year end in order to have a meaningful impact on 2017 FAS/CAS and/or net cash. That said, assuming all other assumptions remain the same, every 25 basis points change in our discount rate has about an $80 million impact on 2017 FAS/CAS.

And I'll start, Howard, with IDS, right? So we've been talking about IDS for a while, but we obviously continue to see opportunities to expand margin further in the second half of the year. We did raise our margin guidance based upon the results through the first half of the year, up by about 40 basis points. Half of that was because of a little bit higher of gain on the TRS transaction, and the other half was from productivity we are seeing because of the leverage of the volume going through our factory, the investments in factory automation, equipment upgrades, as we mentioned before. And I talked about our third quarter guidance and how it was, from a timing point of view, impacted by TRS moving into Q2. But we did offset. That was worth about $0.50. We did offset about $0.12 of that primarily driven by further opportunities for net program efficiencies to drive more margin. Those are moving in from Q4 to Q3, not just at IDS but at other businesses. So we feel real good about where we are headed going forward from a margin perspective. We would expect to continue, as we've been saying, both at the company level and specifically at IDS, to continue to expand margins going forward beyond '16 into '17 as well. From an IIS perspective on the sales, they had a good quarter. Their sales were up to 3%, driven by cybersecurity and special mission programs.

And we've been pretty consistent over the last couple of years with our customers, our nations that produce oil. They have a demand for our products because they're looking to protect their citizens and their sovereignty, and we're seeing no change to that sitting here today."

They also are working and completing up on the Next Generation Jammer EMD program, which is in full swing. I know they're a significant revenue generator for the overall business. And I can tell you, they're operating on all cylinders relative to all the other programs that they have in there. And it's a good healthy mix. I would call it new programs coming onboard.

You're right, we have seen a buildup in our CIP balance. This increase was in line with what we were expecting. It was primarily driven by our sales growth, along with the timing of program milestones and collections, i",580,"Sure. So let me start with the CIP. You're right, we have seen a buildup in our CIP balance. This increase was in line with what we were expecting. It was primarily driven by our sales growth, along with the timing of program milestones and collections, including the ramp-up on some of the more recent awards that we've had last year and into the early part of this year. It's also important, and I would note that our expected cadence is similar this year to prior years with the buildup of CIP in the first half and then a decrease in the second half, really driven primarily by the timing of certain milestones in collections. If you look forward to the end of the year, and I think we talked about this back in Q1, we would expect our CIP balance to be up compared to '15 but more in line with what our balance was at the end of Q1 of 2016. And this is aligned with our growth profile and again, driven by the timing of program milestones. As we move to the back half of '16 and into 2017, we will continue to focus on driving working capital improvements and cash flow generation across the business. We obviously saw a strong cash flow here in the quarter. Some of it was timing, David, right? But some of it was permanent improvement for the year, which is why we raised the outlook for the year by $100 million to the new range of $2.8 billion to $3.1 billion. As far as cash taxes go, I think that was your second question, no change from a total year point of view from what we were previously expecting there. We still think cash taxes that will be paid a little bit over $900 million for the year, the net of refunds a little over $750 million for the year as well. I think your third question was around the cash impact in '17 from the required funding of the pension. So look, as we've said previously there, when we hold all the assumptions constant, we see our CAS increasing going from '16 to '17 as we transition fully to harmonization and then remaining relatively flat beyond that. In '16, the pension cash flow is a bit of an anomaly. It's up from '15. But then again, after '16, the cash flow from pension is still expected to be positive but more, as we've said, at a normalized rate, plus or minus $700 million net positive. We do see improved cash flow in our business as programs continue to progress through their life cycles and achieve significant program milestones that will improve the cash position. And our continued focus on working capital, including cycle time and payment term reductions with our customers, will also drive some cash flow, which could -- and will offset part of that increase. As a reminder, that increase is really driven by the plants coming out of full funding from a PPA point of view and again, primarily having to fund the annual service costs. As we always do, kind of last point here, we'll continue to monitor all aspects of the pension. And we will consider making -- if it makes economic sense to the company, to the shareholders, we'll consider making discretionary contributions before the year is over that could potentially have a further impact on the cash flow profile in '17 and beyond."

The 15.5% margin that IDS delivered, excluding the TRS gain, as I mentioned, part of that was from accelerating net program efficiencies, profit improvements from the back half of the year into the second quarter. We see a little bit more of that in the third quarter. We upped the margin guidance by the 40 basis points: half of which was attributable to operating performance; the other half to the gain.

I'm very pleased with Raytheon's strong second quarter performance. Our global growth strategy continues to drive our results with second quarter revenue up 3%.

Our global growth strategy continues to drive our results with second quarter revenue up 3%. Our operating performance in the quarter was solid with a strong increase in sequential margins. And cash flow generation in the second quarter was well above our expectations. Given our performance in 2016 to date and how we are seeing the balance of the year playing out, we are raising our EPS and cash flow guidance for the year. Further, based on strong demand that we are seeing from our global customers, we also have raised our outlook for bookings. Toby will walk you through the details in a few minutes.
During the second quarter, I visited a number of country leaders in the Asia Pacific region. And earlier this month, we hosted several hundred customer meetings at the Farnborough Airshow. There was a remarkable level of consistency among these conversations. That is, customers are interested in capabilities to address 2 key missions: one, support global counterterrorism campaigns; and two, maintain deterrence in a charged geopolitical environment. More specifically, we continue to see strong demand for integrated air and missile defense solutions, precision munitions and C5ISR capabilities. This demand has been broad-based across the European, MENA and Asia Pacific regions. Further, this year, there has been an added sense of urgency. I can't think of a time when our international pipeline of opportunities was more robust than it is today.
Our international model, which looks at countries as markets, is paying off. Let me just give you a few examples. One of our larger international opportunities over the next several months is the Qatar Upgraded Early Warning Radar. This radar will significantly improve Qatar's long-range situational awareness capabilities and represents $1 billion opportunity for the company. This follows on the country's previous order for 10 Patriot fire units and an Air Defense Operating Center. We also see further opportunity in country for TPY-2 radars as part of a THAAD system later in 2017 or 2018. This is consistent with how we have been thinking about the progression of opportunities in the country for some time.
Another large upcoming opportunity for the company is Poland Patriot, which is also progressing well. Government-to-government negotiations are ongoing, and we've achieved key milestones with Polish industry on work share, including signing a letter of intent to work with Poland's largest defense contractor, DGC.
We anticipate that this multibillion dollar opportunity will be awarded some time in 2017. We also see additional opportunities in Poland, including short-range air defense systems related to our NASAMS product line.
Looking at second quarter, our bookings were strong with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.18. Strength in the quarter was driven by the $1 billion Next Generation Jammer booking at the beginning of the quarter, a nearly $500 million upgrade to Kuwait's 6 Patriot fire units as well as several notable missile bookings for AIM 9X, Paveway and SM-3. You may recall that we also had a strong bookings in the first quarter, which, together with our Q2 results, drove a year-to-date book-to-bill ratio of 1.13. This strength in bookings lays the foundation for future growth and bolsters our confidence in our outlook.
In the second quarter, international represented 31% of total company bookings. I would also point out that with the Kuwait Patriot booking, this is the second consecutive quarter where we have had a significant award from the MENA region. At the end of the second quarter, 42% of our total backlog was from international customers.
Our sales growth in the second quarter was ahead of our expectations. Domestic sales increased slightly, while international increased approximately 8% in the quarter, showing that our global growth strategy remains on track.
Overall, international represented 32% of total sales in the quarter.
As we look at future growth drivers for the company, I would like to take a minute to highlight a couple of our many examples. In the second quarter, we delivered the first Air and Missile Defense Radar to the U.S. Navy's Pacific Missile Range Facility ahead of schedule. AMDR is the next-generation integrated air and ballistic missile defense radar for the U.S. Navy's DDG-51 Flight III destroyers and fills a critical capability gap for the surface fleet. This delivery is the latest in a series of milestones achieved for AMDR as it advances through the engineering and manufacturing development phase, which is now close to 80% complete. AMDR will soon transition to low-rate initial production and remains on track for initial delivery in 2019.
Another example of a future growth driver for the company is Small Diameter Bomb II, which we continue to test with the U.S. Air Force. Small Diameter Bomb II features a highly advanced tri-mode seeker, which includes infrared imaging, millimeter wave radar and laser guidance to find and attack targets from ranges that can exceed 40 miles. Testing will continue this summer as the program moves through low-rate initial production. Small Diameter Bomb II represents a $4 billion opportunity over the lifetime of this franchise program.
Before closing, I'd like to take a moment to briefly touch on the fiscal year's '17 defense budget. As most of you know, both the House and the Senate have marked up their respective bills, and there are significant differences between them. These differences will need to be reconciled before the budget is finalized. Given this and the fact that it is an election year, we are anticipating that there will be another continuing resolution, which will probably extend beyond the election in November. This assumption is considered within our financial guidance range.
Overall, I'm very pleased with the team's performance in the second quarter. Simply put, we had an outstanding results with solid growth and strong execution. I want to thank the team for all its efforts, which continue to deliver for our company and global customers.
With that, let me turn it over to Toby."

We had strong bookings in the second quarter of $7.1 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.18. Sales were $6 billion in the quarter, up 3%, led by our Space and Airborne Systems and Missiles businesses. Our EPS from continuing operations was $2.38, which I'll give a little more color on in a few minutes.
We generated strong operating cash flow of $746 million in the second quarter, which was better than our prior guidance, primarily driven by the timing of collections. Second quarter 2016 operating cash flow was higher than last year's second quarter primarily due to the timing of payments and cash taxes as well as lower required pension contributions.
During the quarter, the company repurchased 1.6 million shares of common stock for $202 million, bringing the year-to-date share repurchase to 4.8 million shares for $602 million.
I want to spend a minute talking about the recent ThalesRaytheonSystems transaction that was concluded at the end of June. Raytheon and Thales concluded an agreement to transition the stakeholder positions each company held in the TRS joint venture structure, with Raytheon acquiring 100% of the TRS U.S. operations and Thales acquiring 100% of the French operations. As a result of the transaction, Raytheon made a net cash payment to Thales in the amount of $90 million and recorded a tax-free gain of $158 million at IDS or $0.53 per diluted share in our second quarter financial results. It's important to note that we had previously forecast this to occur in the third quarter of this year at about $150 million.
I also want to point out that we're raising the EPS and operating cash flow guidance that we provided in April, reflecting our strong performance to date. I'll discuss guidance further in just a few minutes.
Turning now to Page 4. Let me start by providing some detail on our second quarter results. Company bookings for the second quarter were $7.1 billion and, on a year-to-date basis, were $13.3 billion, an increase of approximately $1.3 billion over the same period last year. It's worth noting that on a trailing 4-quarter basis, our book-to-bill ratio was 1.11.
For the quarter, international was 31% of our total company bookings and, on a year-to-date basis, was 29%. For the year, we expect international to be about 35% of total bookings.
As Tom just mentioned, we booked several significant awards in the second quarter, including about $1 billion for the Next Generation Jammer program for the U.S. Navy, $574 million on domestic and foreign training programs in support of Warfighter FOCUS activities, $487 million to provide advanced Patriot air and missile defense capabilities for Kuwait and approximately $300 million apiece on both AIM-9X Sidewinder, short-range air-to-air missiles and Paveway.
Backlog at the end of the second quarter was $35.3 billion and, on a funded basis, was $26.1 billion, both up approximately $800 million compared to last year's second quarter.
We now move to Page 5. As I mentioned earlier, for the second quarter 2016, sales exceeded the high end of guidance we set in April primarily due to the timing within the year and better-than-expected performance across several of the businesses. For the second quarter, our international sales were approximately 32% of total sales.
Looking now at sales by business. IDS had second quarter 2016 net sales of $1.4 billion. As expected, the change in net sales for the quarter was primarily driven by the recognition of previously deferred precontract cost on an international Patriot program in the second quarter 2015.
In the second quarter 2016, IIS had net sales of $1.6 billion, up 3% compared with the same quarter last year. The increase was primarily due to our cybersecurity and special mission programs. Missile Systems had second quarter 2016 net sales of $1.7 billion. The 6% increase from the second quarter 2015 was primarily due to the Paveway program.
SAS had net sales of $1.5 billion. The 9% increase versus last year was driven by higher sales on classified programs. And for Forcepoint, the increase was primarily due to the acquisition of Websense, which we completed at the end of May 2015.
Moving ahead to Page 6. Overall, the company continues to perform well. Our operating margin was 15.9% for the total company and 14.8% on a business segment basis. It's worth noting that the impact of the TRS gain that I discussed earlier was essentially in line with our prior expectation and was worth $158 million or about 260 basis points at the company level for the second quarter of 2016.
So looking now at the business margins. The increase in margin at IDS included the results of the TRS transaction. Without the transaction, the IDS margin in the second quarter would have been 15.5%, reflecting their strong operating performance.
IIS operating margin was in line with last year's second quarter. Missiles margin was up 170 basis points in the quarter compared with the same period last year primarily driven by higher net program efficiencies and a favorable change in program mix in the second quarter of 2016. The decrease in margin at SAS in the quarter compared with the same period last year was primarily driven by a change in program mix. And at Forcepoint, the second quarter 2016 operating margin was higher than last year's comparable quarter primarily due to the acquisition of Websense. Forcepoint's Q2 margin improved from Q2 2015 and, as expected, was impacted by integration and transition costs.
As we've discussed on past calls, we remain focused on margin improvement going forward. We are continuously looking for ways to lower our costs, enhance our competitiveness and improve affordability for our customers. In the second quarter, one of the key drivers of our margin improvement was the payoff from our investment in factory automation and equipment upgrades, and we also saw productivity gains from increased operating leverage.
Turning now to Page 7. Second quarter 2016 EPS was $2.38, better than expected, primarily driven by higher sales and productivity as well as from the timing of the TRS transaction, which, as mentioned earlier, was previously forecast to occur in the third quarter. As expected, second quarter 2016 also included the tax benefit associated with the new accounting standard for stock compensation, which we previously adopted in the first quarter, worth about $0.10. Of note, second quarter 2015 included a favorable $0.29 noncash tax settlement.
On Page 8, as I mentioned earlier, we are updating the company's financial outlook for 2016 to reflect our improved operating performance to date compared to our prior guidance. We still expect our full year 2016 net sales to be in the range of between $24 billion and $24.5 billion, up 3% to 5% from 2015. The increase is driven by growth in both our domestic and international business.
We've increased our full year 2016 EPS by $0.20 from our prior guidance and now expect it to be in the range of $7.13 to $7.33. The increase is driven by our improved performance in the first half of the year as well as a slight improvement to the effective tax rate and slightly lower interest expense.
Turning to our share repurchase. Through the end of the second quarter, we repurchased 4.8 million shares of common stock for just over $600 million and continue to see our diluted share count in the range of between 296 million and 298 million shares for 2016, a 3% reduction at the midpoint of the range. Also, based on our strong performance to date, we have increased the range for our 2016 operating cash flow guidance by $100 million and now see it between $2.8 billion and $3.1 billion.
And as you can see on Page 9, we've included guidance by business. We left the sales unchanged from prior outlook.
Looking at margins. We've increased the margin guidance range for the company and now see operating margin to be in a range of 13.2% to 13.4% for the full year, up 20 basis points from our prior guidance.
At the business segment level, we now see the operating margin in a range of 12.6% to 12.8% for the full year driven by higher expected operating margin at IDS and SAS.
Before moving on to Page 10, given our year-to-date bookings strength and our expectations for a strong back half of the year, we are now raising our full year 2016 bookings outlook to $26 billion, plus or minus $500 million. This $500 million increase to the prior range is driven by strong demand from our global customers.
On Page 10, we have provided guidance on how we currently see our third quarter for sales, earnings per share and operating cash flow from continuing operations. We still expect third quarter sales to be in a range of just under $6 billion to $6.1 billion, consistent with our prior guidance. EPS from continuing operations is now expected to be in a range of $1.57 to $1.62, lower than our prior guidance due to the timing of the TRS transaction, which we had previously forecast in the third quarter. Some of this impact has been offset by the timing of performance improvements previously expected in the fourth quarter.
Before concluding, as we have discussed on past earnings calls with regard to our capital deployment strategy, we expect to continue to generate strong free cash flow and maintain a solid balance sheet at our current credit rating going forward.
We remain focused on deploying capital to create value for our shareholders and customers. This includes internal investments to support our growth plans and productivity improvements as well as returning capital to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends, making small targeted acquisitions that our technology and global growth needs and from time to time, making discretionary contributions to our pension plans.
In summary, if you stand back and look at the quarter, we had strong performance. Our bookings, sales, EPS and operating cash flow from continuing operations were all higher than expected. Based on this performance and our near-term expectations, we increased our 2016 guidance for EPS, operating margin and operating cash flow.
With that, Tom and I will open up the call for questions."

At our last call, we indicated a target of 89 -- 80% to 90% of free cash flow going back to shareholders. Right now, we probably see it maybe at the bottom of that range, pending market conditions. And if we continue to see strong movement in the stock, we're not going to chase the stock price. Share repurchase will still continue to be a core part of our capital deployment strategy with the stated goal of reducing the diluted share count over time, and that hasn't changed.

We will give everyone an updated outlook as we typically do on the third quarter call. That said, let me give you a little bit of insight to a few things. Year-to-date, our asset return is about 4.5%. And due to assets moving, any type of actual return would have to be significantly different than expected at year end in order to have a meaningful impact on 2017 FAS/CAS and/or net cash. That said, assuming all other assumptions remain the same, every 25 basis points change in our discount rate has about an $80 million impact on 2017 FAS/CAS. And net cash would be unchanged because it continues to be based upon a 25-year average discount rate. So a few variables there that you all can use and model.

And I'll start, Howard, with IDS, right? So we've been talking about IDS for a while, but we obviously continue to see opportunities to expand margin further in the second half of the year. We did raise our margin guidance based upon the results through the first half of the year, up by about 40 basis points. Half of that was because of a little bit higher of gain on the TRS transaction, and the other half was from productivity we are seeing because of the leverage of the volume going through our factory, the investments in factory automation, equipment upgrades, as we mentioned before. And I talked about our third quarter guidance and how it was, from a timing point of view, impacted by TRS moving into Q2. But we did offset. That was worth about $0.50. We did offset about $0.12 of that primarily driven by further opportunities for net program efficiencies to drive more margin. Those are moving in from Q4 to Q3, not just at IDS but at other businesses. So we feel real good about where we are headed going forward from a margin perspective. We would expect to continue, as we've been saying, both at the company level and specifically at IDS, to continue to expand margins going forward beyond '16 into '17 as well. From an IIS perspective on the sales, they had a good quarter. Their sales were up to 3%, driven by cybersecurity and special mission programs. For the second half, we see their sales in line with last year's second half despite having 4 fewer workdays, and we still expect growth for the year at IIS in the low single digits."

You're right, we have seen a buildup in our CIP balance. This increase was in line with what we were expecting.

You're right, we have seen a buildup in our CIP balance. This increase was in line with what we were expecting. It was primarily driven by our sales growth, along with the timing of program milestones and collections, including the ramp-up on some of the more recent awards that we've had last year and into the early part of this year. It's also important, and I would note that our expected cadence is similar this year to prior years with the buildup of CIP in the first half and then a decrease in the second half, really driven primarily by the timing of certain milestones in collections. If you look forward to the end of the year, and I think we talked about this back in Q1, we would expect our CIP balance to be up compared to '15 but more in line with what our balance was at the end of Q1 of 2016. And this is aligned with our growth profile and again, driven by the timing of program milestones. As we move to the back half of '16 and into 2017, we will continue to focus on driving working capital improvements and cash flow generation across the business. We obviously saw a strong cash flow here in the quarter. Some of it was timing, David, right? But some of it was permanent improvement for the year, which is why we raised the outlook for the year by $100 million to the new range of $2.8 billion to $3.1 billion. As far as cash taxes go, I think that was your second question, no change from a total year point of view from what we were previously expecting there. We still think cash taxes that will be paid a little bit over $900 million for the year, the net of refunds a little over $750 million for the year as well. I think your third question was around the cash impact in '17 from the required funding of the pension. So look, as we've said previously there, when we hold all the assumptions constant, we see our CAS increasing going from '16 to '17 as we transition fully to harmonization and then remaining relatively flat beyond that. In '16, the pension cash flow is a bit of an anomaly. It's up from '15. But then again, after '16, the cash flow from pension is still expected to be positive but more, as we've said, at a normalized rate, plus or minus $700 million net positive. We do see improved cash flow in our business as programs continue to progress through their life cycles and achieve significant program milestones that will improve the cash position. And our continued focus on working capital, including cycle time and payment term reductions with our customers, will also drive some cash flow, which could -- and will offset part of that increase. As a reminder, that increase is really driven by the plants coming out of full funding from a PPA point of view and again, primarily having to fund the annual service costs. As we always do, kind of last point here, we'll continue to monitor all aspects of the pension. And we will consider making -- if it makes economic sense to the company, to the shareholders, we'll consider making discretionary contributions before the year is over that could potentially have a further impact on the cash flow profile in '17 and beyond."

The 15.5% margin that IDS delivered, excluding the TRS gain, as I mentioned, part of that was from accelerating net program efficiencies, profit improvements from the back half of the year into the second quarter. We see a little bit more of that in the third quarter. We upped the margin guidance by the 40 basis points: half of which was attributable to operating performance; the other half to the gain.

I'm pleased to report his company reported operating performance in the third quarter and our growth strategy remains on track. Revenue increased by over 4% and our operational execution was a solid across the business is with overall operating margins above our expectation. As a result, our earnings per share was well ahead of our prior guidance for the quarter. 
Based on the company's performance, we have updated our guidance for the year, Toby will provide more color on this as well as high-level outlook for 2017 in a few moments. 
We continue to see strong demand from our global customers for Advanced Technology. This demand drove our third quarter book-to-bill ratio of 1.15 and our year-to-date book-to-bill ratio currently stands at a healthy 1.14. I would note that our year-to-date classified bookings of more surpassed a record annual level. 
Given our booking strength and our expectation for a solid fourth quarter, we have raised our bookings outlook range again for the year by another $500 million to a range of $26 billion to $27 billion. As you know, bookings ultimately drives revenue, but this positions us well for the continued solid top line growth for 2017. 
I'd like to point out that our domestic bookings were particularly strong in the third quarter, driven by classified, training, joint precision approach and landing systems, Standard Missile 3, and several additional missile programs. Classified bookings were very strong, representing 22% of total company bookings in the quarter. For our overall domestic business, it is worth noting that bookings have exceeded revenue in each quarter this year. One key area of focus for team is capturing and renewing franchise program. These are large, longer duration program in the last decade and have both domestic and international potential. 
In the third quarter, we received a key new franchise booking in our naval radar area with dwhere enterprise and surveillance radar for word. This competitive award for the initial engineering, manufacturing development phase of the program that will ultimately equip U.S. Navy ship and carriers with the new radar based on our gallium nitride or technology. To recall, we developed GAN as a big technology over a decade ago and leverage for previous franchise wins on the missile defense radar and the generation jammer, both for the U.S. Navy. 
All together, these programs put us in a strong position to support our U.S. Navy and international customers with advanced capabilities to counter emerging threats. The Asian win represent an opportunity of over $1 billion for the company. We see additional opportunities to leverage GAN technology on our ground-based radar franchises as well. 
The Missile Defense Agency recently awarded contract to develop a process to incorporate GAN components into existing and future radars. These are long range radars used to detect and track ballistic missiles. And earlier this year, we began showcasing a new GAN based radar for Patriot integrated air and missile defense system, a key industry event such as AUSA in the form international airshow. 
Customer feedback and interest from these events are strong and we are actively pursuing new opportunities for this radar with key customers. I'm pleased with the progress we're making on these multiple franchise pursuits and with a clear success of our GAN investment, which has positioned us well across both radar and electronic warfare segments. 
As we look to potential future bookings, there are number of large upcoming opportunities for the company, including an early warning radar system for Qatar as well as Patriot, Standard Missile 2 and radar upgrades across Japan and Taiwan, which combined, represents a multibillion dollar opportunity. Further, we continue to make progress on the Patriot opportunity in Poland. And we have seen the Poland signed a letter of request for integrated air and missile defense system with the U.S. in September based on the Patriot System. We believe Poland will sign a foreign military sales agreement with the U.S. government sometime later this year, early next. 
On this timeline, we would expect in term a signed contract with the U.S. government and booking awards later in 2017 for initial Patriot capability. I would add that in addition to Poland with the other emerging Patriot opportunities in the European region. 
Turning to sales. Our third quarter increased by 4.3% as a result of continued execution of our growth strategy. As we discussed on past earnings calls, the company is aligned with the needs of our global customers and continues to invest in what we expect to be future growth areas. Internationally, sales were up 7% in the quarter and represented 32% of our total sales. Domestic sales increased by 3% and included classified growth of 5%. 
Forcepoint, our cybersecurity product business, saw sales increased 31% for the third quarter, in which 18% was organic.  I like to take a minute to update you further on Forcepoint. The business is performing well and on track to meet its 2016 objective. The integration of all acquisitions is essentially complete. Forcepoint's new CEO, has been onboard for 5 months now and is making very good progress. We have put in place an updated strategic plan that addresses areas of cybersecurity market where we believe we have an opportunity for leadership. One of these areas is advanced insider threat that we are providing integrated system by combining our short video and data loss prevention capabilities as policy and analytics to capitalize on its rapidly expanding market area. 
We believe this approach will align well with our strategy to further penetrate in the enterprise and very large enterprise customer markets and support Forcepoint's long-term growth. 
Turning to capital deployment. We continue to pursue a balanced capital deployment strategy. Our #1 priority remains investing in organic growth. Beyond that, we remain focused on prudently returning capital to shareholders via competitive, sustainable dividend and share repurchases, market conditions permitting. We continue to use smaller targeted M&A to build technology and market gap to augment both our defense business and commercial cybersecurity capability. 
The bottom line, we had a great quarter with strong sales and margin as well as solid bookings which sets the stage for continued top line growth. Further, I would like to thank the entire Raytheon team, our employees are proud of what they do every day for our customers, company and shareholders. With that, let me turn over to Tony."

During my remarks, I'll be referring to the web slides that we issued earlier this morning. If everyone would please turn to Page 3. 
We are pleased with the strong performance of the team delivered in the third quarter with bookings, sales and EPS all at or better than our expectations. We had strong bookings in the third quarter of $6.9 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.15. Sales were $6 billion in the quarter, up 4%, led by our missiles, SAS and Forcepoint. Our EPS from continuing operations was $1.79, which I'll give a little more color on in a few minutes. 
We generated solid operating cash flow of $640 million in the third quarter. Third quarter 2016 operating cash flow was lower than last year's third quarter as expected, primarily due to the timing of collections and payments. And on a year-to-date basis, operating cash flow of $1.7 billion was ahead of last year's year-to-date operating cash flow by approximately $200 million. During 
the quarter, the company repurchased 1.4 million shares of common stock for $198 million, bringing the year-to-date share repurchase to 6.2 million shares for $801 million. I also want to point out that we're raising the EPS guidance that we provided in July, reflecting our strong performance to date. I'll discuss guidance further in just a few minutes. 
Turning now to Page 4. Let me start by providing some detail on our third quarter results. The company bookings continue to be strong. For the third quarter, bookings were $6.9 billion and on the year-to-date basis were $20.3 billion, an increase of approximately $2.9 million over the same period last year. It's worth noting that on a trailing 4-quarter basis, our book-to-bill ratio was 1.16. For the quarter, international was 21% of our total company bookings and on the year-to-date basis was 26%. 
We booked several significant awards the third quarter, including $538 million on Standard Missile 3, $376 million for Phalanx Weapon Systems, $286 million on domestic and foreign training programs in support of Warfighter FOCUS activities, $265 million to provide advanced Patriot air and missile defense capabilities for our international customers and $255 million on the joint position approach and landing system program, an all weather landing system for land-based and sea based aircraft for the U.S. Navy. Total backlog at the end of third quarter was $35.8 billion, an increase of approximately $2.2 billion compared to the end of the third quarter 2015, and funded backlog was $25.7 billion, an increase of approximately $1.3 billion compared to the end of the third quarter 2015. 
If you now moved to Page 5. For the third quarter, 2016 sales were in line with the guidance we set in July. Our international sales were approximately 32% of total sales. Looking now at sales by business. IDS had third quarter 2016 net sales of $1.3 billion. As expected, the change in net sales for the quarter was primarily driven by lower net sales on certain radar production programs and on international communications program. In the third quarter 2016, IIS had net sales of $1.5 billion, up slightly compared with the same quarter last year. 
Missile Systems had third quarter 2016 net sales of $1.8 billion. The 9% increase from the third quarter 2015 was primarily due to the Paveway and Amram programs. SAS had net sales of $1.6 billion. The 10% increase versus last year was driven by higher sales on an international classified program. And for Forcepoint, the 31% increase was primarily driven by higher sales in federal products and services and the acquisition of Stonesoft, which was completed in the first quarter of 2016. 
Moving ahead to Page 6. Overall, the company continues to perform well. Our operating margin was 13.4% for the total company and 12.5% on a business segment basis. 
So looking now at the business margins. All performed at or above our expectations. The increase in margin at IDS in the third quarter compared to the comparable quarter last year reflects improved program performance. Both IIS and missiles operating margins were in line with last year's third quarter. As expected, SAS margin decreased in the quarter compared with the same period last year, primarily driven by change in program mix. And at Forcepoint, the third quarter 2016 operating margin was, as expected, lower than last year's comparable quarter, primarily due to an increase in professional services and hardware sales relative to total sales and an increase in commissions due to higher bookings. 
Turning now to Page 7. Third quarter 2016 EPS was $1.79, better than expected, driven by timing of program improvements from the fourth quarter as well as some nonoperating payment. 
On Page 8, as I've mentioned earlier, we are updating the company's financial outlook for 2016 to reflect our improved operating performance to date and our expectations for the fourth quarter compared to our prior guidance. We have tightened the range for full-year 2016 net sales, increasing the low end by $200 million. We now expect net sales to be between $24.2 billion and $24.5 billion, up 4% to 5% from 2015. The increase is driven by growth in both our domestic and international business. As we have gotten prior year's during the quarter, we updated our actuarial estimates related to our pension plan. As a result of this update, the FAS/CAS adjustment for the year increased by $5 million from $428 million to $433 million for a favorable impact of approximately $0.01 per share. We've increased our full-year 2016 EPS, raising the low end by $0.15 and the high end by $0.05 from our prior guidance and now expect it to be in the range of $7.28 to $7.38. The increase is primarily driven by our improved performance to date as well as slightly higher pension income and lower interest expense. 
Turning to our share repurchase. Through the end of the third quarter, we repurchased 6.2 million shares of common stock for just over $800 million and now see our diluted share count of approximately 297 million shares for 2016, a 3% year-over-year reduction. As a percent of free cash flow, we expect to return approximately 80% of free cash flow to shareholders this year, depending on market conditions. 
Now as you can see on Page 9, we've included guidance by business. We've increased and tightened the full-year sales outlook at both missiles and SAS. In addition, we tightened the full year sales range for IDS and IIS. 
Looking at margins. We've narrowed the margin guidance range for the company, breaking the low end by 10 basis points from our prior guidance and now see operating margins to be in the range of 13.3% to 13.4% for the full year. At the business segment level, we now see the operating margin in the range of 12.7% to 12.8% for the full year. 
Before moving on to Page 10. As Tom mentioned earlier, given our year-to-date booking strength and our expectation for a solid fourth quarter, we are now raising our full-year 2016 bookings outlook to $26.5 billion plus or minus $500 million. This $500 million increase to the prior range is driven by strong demand from our global customers and positions us well for 2017. This marks our second consecutive $500 million quarterly increase to our bookings outlook. We expect international to be about 1/3 of total bookings for the year. 
On Page 10, we have provided guidance on how we currently see the fourth quarter for sales, earnings per share and operating cash flow from continuing operations. We still expect fourth quarter sales to be in the range of $6.4 million to $6.7 million, consistent with our prior guidance. It's important to note that the fourth quarter of 2016 has for fewer workdays in the comparable period last year, which has an impact to sales of approximately $100 million per day. 
EPS from continuing operations is now expected to be in a range of $1.68 to $1.70, reflecting the timing of performance improvements we achieved earlier than previously expected. 
Now turning to next year. As we've done in the past, we intend to provide detailed 2017 guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call in January. As we sit here today, we currently see strong sales growth for 2017 of 3% to 5% over the midpoint of our 2016 outlook. We expect segment margins to be up for 2017 compared to 2016, excluding the CRS transaction in 2016, which contributes about 70 basis points. 
We are well positioned going forward with further margin expansion over time both on the domestic side as new development franchise wins transition to production and on the international side as large production programs moves through your life cycle. We expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 30% in 2017. In addition, we expect solid operating cash flow in 2017, slightly lower than 2016 as improvement from the businesses, as expected, is offset by higher cash taxes and required pension contributions. Of course, I want to caveat all this by saying our assumptions are based on the defense budget being approved in Washington before year end, thereby avoiding an extended or government shutdown. 
Before moving on, I want to point out consistent with our public filings, that we plan to early adopt the revenue recognition standard in the first quarter of 2017. We do not expect the impact of adopting the new standard to be material to our results. So if you could please move to Page 11. We have provided a FAS/CAS pension adjusted matrix for 2017 as we've been in prior years. As a reminder, the range of outcomes shown our estimates. Actual results will be based on factors that are not determined until year-end; in particular, the final discount rate, the actual asset returns and the long-term return on asset assumption, all of which could impact the estimates on this matrix.
As we sit here today, the discount rate is approximately 75 basis points lower than it was at the end of 2015 and would be roughly 3.75%, and our return on assets through October 25 is a little above 5%. In addition, we have been seeing downward pressure on our long-term return on asset assumption driven by the most recent capital market expectations. Based on this, we currently see a potential reduction from 8% to a range of 7.25% to 7.5%. I would note that for each 25 basis points change in the assumption down to 7.25%, we would expect an additional $55 million reduction for the FAS/CAS Adjustment for 2017 compared to what you see on the chart.
On Page 12, we have provided an updated net cash from pension outlook as well as the prior outlook that we provided to you in January using the same discount rate and return assumption. It's worth noting that the net cash from pension in 2017 is now expected to be better compared to our prior outlook. And given our CAS prepayment balance of nearly $7 billion, we continue to expect CAS recovery to exceed contributions well into the next decade. Said another way, we expect pension to be a net positive contributor to cash flow over the next 10-plus years under current assumptions. Please note that all of these assumptions exclude us making any potential discretionary pension contributions. And just to be clear, the final discount rate, the actual asset returns and the long-term return on asset assumptions won't be known until we close out 2016. We'll provide a more detailed pension outlook on our January year-end call.
In summary, we saw a solid performance in the third quarter. Bookings were strong. Our sales and EPS were at or above our expectations, and our strong cash flow and balance sheet will allow us to continue to drive value for our customers and our shareholders. We are well positioned for continued growth in 2017.
With that, Tom and I will open the call up for questions."

And then also, in the core business, the TRITON cloud work is -- we're also starting to see significant movement in that. But the area [ph] I was trying to point out in my discussion is one of the other areas where we've taken I would call our defense-grade capabilities into the commercial cybersecurity marketplace. And that's really on the insider threat. And so we took our -- essentially our product which was what we call the SureView product. We're tying that together, integrating that with the data loss prevention capability that Websense brought along and some analytics on top of that, providing an unbelievable capability to the marketplace relative to the event of insider threat. And as you've probably been reading in the press, there's quite a bit of insider threat issues that are going on across the commercial industry along different verticals. So we're extremely happy with the performance. Toby's here. He's got the details, and he can just run you through what we saw here in the third quarter and what we're seeing in the future."

So on the numbers side for Q3 and Q4, even though I did mention the federal and some of the services, when you peel this back and decompose it, the legacy TRITON business also saw a significant growth of about 18% in the quarter as well. So we really saw growth across the entire portfolio with the exception, as we expected, we've been talking about the legacy Web Filtering business, which did continue to decline. Along those lines, I do want to take a second, and as Tom talked about and as we are evolving our strategic position to align with the cybersecurity market where we see the greatest opportunities, the legacy delineation when we've talked in the past about TRITON and the Web Filtering, even though I just kind of gave you some color on it, it is becoming less meaningful to us given our changes in the organization and our go-to-market approach around that. But again, growth across the entire portfolio, we're focused strategically. If you roll that forward to Q4 from a top line perspective, we'd expect growth rates similar to Q3 on a year-over-year basis and margin that is higher. To your question, we'd be looking at margins in the 16-plus percent range for the fourth quarter. Obviously, we didn't change the outlook for the year, so we feel good that the team has a path forward there."

As I said in my comments, we knew about some certain radar programs and one international communications program that was winding down. So that was what we had assumed going back to the beginning of the year. But we are seeing a little bit of timing impact on a couple international programs but now expect it in late Q4, early Q1. So that's what's driving primarily the change -- what happened in the quarter relative to the revenue, the sales and then also for the total year. From a margin point of view, I think what you're seeing is consistent with what we've been saying that IDS towards the back half of the year has some of the -- and I wouldn't say they're completing, I would say some of the major production programs that we booked over the last couple of years are, from an execution point of view, moving through their life cycles. They're at [ph] points where we obviously feel comfortable in increasing the booking rates there. You saw strong margins from IDS back in Q2, excluding the TRS gain. We see it again here in Q3. So I think things -- from our perspective, things are playing out on the margin line at IDS pretty much as we would have expected, and if anything, a little bit more favorable timing. I think some of the improvements we saw in Q2 and 3, if we go back 3 or 6 months, we would have said, would have been in Q4 and 3. So things that may have been accelerated within the year by about 90 days, but all good news from our perspective."

So if anything, that ramp-up in Q4 is a little less than it was going back to January. I think you all know we traditionally have a cash profile that's more back-end weighted. There's nothing different this year. And the underlying driver is not one individual thing, but it's primarily some significant milestone collections really across pretty much the entire portfolio of programs. So nothing unusual from our perspective."

In terms of terms and conditions, we're really not seeing any changes in our contracting with the department or with the U.S. government. The department, as you know, is pushing more towards a fixed-price incentive fee construct on, I would call, production-type programs than they've had in the past. Something we're used to many years back, it's kind of rotated back in. So I think going through the initial iterations and making sure everybody understands that kind of a construct and then sets it up in a way that provides the contractors an incentive to do well, I think we're going through a little bit of transient on that, but it seems like it's settling out pretty quick. On the international side, we -- again, on the FMS contracts, we're not seeing much difference there relative to terms and conditions. Again, there is some issues relative to fixed-price incentive fee on production contracts. That's actually being debated in the halls of Congress. And right now, the NDAA has some language in it about the international production-type contracts being [ph] fixed price versus fixed-price incentive fee. And that's the only area that I see that's different. And our direct commercial sales, no difference there than we've had in the past."

And I think what I want to do is go back to this concept of buckets, and we're seeing these 3 demand areas. One is counterterrorism, counterinsurgency. The other bucket is deterrence, deterring a threat from taking action. And then there's a third bucket out there, which, I'm going to say, it's Third Offset strategy-type stuff, worrying about near-peer nation threats with advanced technologies. In Europe, the big one there is deterrence. We're seeing Eastern Europe very concerned in that area. And so they're looking for systems that will provide them that kind of a deterrence capability, and so we're seeing a lot of action on things like the Patriot System and then also our NASAMS system that we have at the nation's capital. And we had a sale in Oman and several other countries out there. So we're seeing significant pull for those deterrence-type systems in Europe. As we move to the Middle East, you're correct. I would say it's a little different in Middle East. It's a demand from both the counterinsurgency, counterterrorism bucket and then also the deterrence bucket. And on the counterinsurgency, I think you kind of understand that, that's some of the demand up-tempo pull here for precision weapons and some other ground systems that we have. On the deterrence side, I mean, there is a concern -- there is a neighbor of the GCC that the GCC is concerned about, and so you're getting into deterrence there, and therefore, you see the demand for systems like Patriot across the whole region. And so that's the deterrence bucket. And if we go over to the Asia-Pacific region, it's clear that it's -- and most of the effort there demand [ph] is again coming from this deterrence bucket, looking for solutions like Patriot, advanced weapons, radars to be able to see things, ballistic missiles before they hit them. And so the Asia-Pacific region is in big demand on the deterrence. The third bucket is really coming directly from the Department of Defense. Obviously, for all regions in the global area to the able to essentially come up from 20 years of fighting wars of insurgency to now dealing with near peer threats that potentially have capabilities that are at or potentially some cases may be better or perceived to be better than what the U.S. has. And so it's a big catch up area they are. I mentioned -- we did mention on the call about the significant increase in classified work. I think it's really addressing that bucket and to help the Department of Defense to regain, in some cases, its superior capabilities over near peer threats. And that's it."

And I don't know that I can really add anything beyond the sensitivity that I gave in my prepared comments. You're right that cash flow is going to continue to be positive from pension. There were a lot of questions earlier this year and concerns about overall cash flow because of the higher required contributions in 2017. That's got better based upon our current estimates by close to $200 million. Our overall cash flow for the company next year, as I've mentioned earlier, may be slightly lower than where we're looking at for this year, but still very, very strong. And I think if you look out over time, while near term, we may have some headwind on pensions from a P&L point of view, for an EPS point of view in '17, we'd expect that over time, even under those lower rates that I talked about, that we would see improvement in that profile, a pattern that would be similar to what we were seeing in the past where year-over-year, the EPS would improve, all else equal, based upon you and revised assumptions in '17, '18 -- beyond '17 into '18 and '19.

We have some other awards that we are anticipating will be starting up, which are contributing to the growth as well as some continued ramp on some international patriot programs that are already in our backlog as they move through their lifecycle there. So we have a path forward relative to the growth in IDS on the top line. From a margin perspective, I'll reiterate, we are really pleased with what the margin at IDS both in Q2 and in Q3 here. As we have talked about before, we were expecting an improvement in the margin at IDS, more in the back half of the year. We've accelerated some of that into Q2 and here again in Q3. We did raise our margin guidance by 20 basis points on the high end at IDS to reflect our solid performance to date. And we continue to expect solid operational performance in Q4. About in line where we are year-to-date, okay, if you want to think of it this way, when you adjust for the TRS transaction.

We'll pursue targeted acquisitions. I think Tom mentioned in his opening comments, once the technology market access, market channel type of gaps, I won't comment on rumors out there in the marketplace, but what I will say generically, we don't have as part of our plan to go after big deals, okay? That would be something strategic and opportunistic. We want to provide the right level of return to our shareholders. Somewhere as we target 8% to 90% of current year cash flow that includes competitive and sustainable dividend and the buy back. Obviously, they continue to reduce the diluted share count over time. And we do, as you know, make from time to time, discretionary pension contributions. That said, let me reiterate because it has come up in the past relative to the thought about any large acquisitions, whether it be on the defense side and/or the commercial cyber side.

It will have to be timed out, so that they have enough money to cover it over the multiple years that these new systems take to come on board."

And if I start of the front of the business, we do continue to expect to see a solid book-to-bill ratio next year over 1, even on the higher sales volume is a mentioned which we see growing in the 3% to 5% range. I will say that this growth is more heavily weighted towards our missiles and SAS business then followed by IDS and IIS. And we also see growth again both domestically and internationally next year. On the margin comment, I'm kind of stick to where I mentioned earlier that in '17, when you adjust for the TRS transaction this year at the segment level, we see segment level margins improving. That said, obviously we're not giving details by business at this point. But since you asked about IDS and historically, there's been a lot of focus there, what I will tell you is we do see meaningful improvement in the IDS margin next year. Again, excluding the 2016 impact of TRS, although I will say that for IDS, if you thinking of 16% or above next year, that's probably too aggressive. I'll just kind of leave it at that. I mentioned cash flow is the continued to be strong. We do expect higher cash from the businesses, partially offsetting pension and higher cash taxes. On our tax rate, if you recall in '16, our effective tax rate is impacted by the TRS transaction and the gain on that of just under $160 million was tax-free. So when I look at the tax rate for '17 right now, think of it around 30%, which is more in line where '16 would be excluding the TRS. And then you mentioned Forcepoint. I think what I'll say on Forcepoint, we still expect double-digit growth and double-digit margins from them next year. Obviously, our goal today relative to '17 was just to give you a high-level look where we're headed. We're still working through our process internally to finalize our views on '17 and in January, we'll update you on that including details by our businesses."

I'm pleased to report that the company had strong operating performance in the third quarter and our growth strategy remains on track. Revenue increased by over 4% and our operational execution was solid across the business is with overall operating margins above our expectation. As a result, our earnings per share was well ahead of our prior guidance for the quarter. 
Based on the company's performance, we have updated our guidance for the year, Toby will provide more color on this as well as high-level outlook for 2017 in a few moments. 
We continue to see strong demand from our global customers for Advanced Technology. This demand drove third quarter book-to-bill ratio of 1.15 and our year-to-date book-to-bill ratio currently stands at a healthy 1.14. I would note that our year-to-date classified bookings of more surpassed a record annual level. 
Given our booking strength and our expectation for a solid fourth quarter, we have raised our bookings outlook range again for the year by another $500 million to a range of $26 billion to $27 billion. As you know, bookings ultimately drives revenue, but this positions us well for the continued solid top line growth for 2017. 
I'd like to point out that our domestic bookings were particularly strong in the third quarter, driven by classified, training, joint precision approach and landing systems, Standard Missile 3, Phalanx and several additional missile programs. Classified bookings were very strong, representing 22% of total company bookings in the quarter. For our overall domestic business, it is worth noting that bookings have exceeded revenue in each quarter this year. One key area of focus for team is capturing and renewing franchise programs. These are large, longer duration program in the last decades and have both domestic and international potential. 
In the third quarter, we received a key new franchise booking in our naval radar area with the enterprise air surveillance radar or EASR. This competitive award for the initial engineering, manufacturing development phase of the program that will ultimately equip U.S. Navy ships and carriers with the new radar based on our gallium nitride or GaN technology. To recall, we developed GaN as a big bet technology over a decade ago and leveraged it for previous franchise wins on the air missile defense radar and the next generation jammer, both for the U.S. Navy. 
All together, these programs put us in a strong position to support our U.S. Navy and international customers with advanced capabilities to counter emerging threats. The EASR win represents an opportunity of over $1 billion for the company. We see additional opportunities to leverage GaN technology on our ground-based radar franchises as well. 
The Missile Defense Agency recently awarded us a contract to develop a process to incorporate GaN components into existing and future Tippy Two radars. These are long range radars used to detect and track ballistic missiles. And earlier this year, we began showcasing a new GaN based radar [ph] for Patriot integrated air and missile defense system, at key industry event such as AUSA in the form international airshow. 
Customer feedback and interest from these events is strong and we are actively pursuing new opportunities for this radar with key customers. I'm pleased with the progress we're making on these multiple franchise pursuits and with a clear success of our GAN investment, which has positioned us well across both radar and electronic warfare segments. 
As we look to potential future bookings, there are a number of large upcoming opportunities for the company, including an early warning radar system for Qatar as well as Patriot, Standard Missile 2 and radar upgrades across Japan and Taiwan, which combined, represents a multibillion dollar opportunity. Further, we continue to make progress on the Patriot opportunity in Poland. You have seen the Poland signed a letter of request for integrated air and missile defense system with the U.S. in September based on the Patriot System. We believe Poland will sign a foreign military sales agreement with the U.S. government sometime later this year, early next. 
On this timeline, we would expect in turn a signed contract with the U.S. government and booking awards later in 2017 for initial Patriot capability. I would add that in addition to Poland with the other emerging Patriot opportunities in the European region. 
Turning to sales. Our third quarter increased by a solid 4.3% as a result of continued execution of our growth strategy. As we discussed on past earnings calls, the company is aligned with the needs of our global customers and continues to invest in what we expect to be future growth areas. Internationally, sales were up 7% in the quarter and represented 32% of our total sales. Domestic sales increased by 3% and included classified growth of 5%. 
Forcepoint, our cybersecurity product business, saw sales increased 31% for the third quarter, in which 18% was organic.  I like to take a minute to update you further on Forcepoint. The business is performing well and on track to meet its 2016 objective. The integration of all acquisitions is essentially complete. Forcepoint's new CEO, Matt Moynahan has been onboard for 5 months now and is making very good progress. We have put in place an updated strategic plan that addresses areas of the cybersecurity market where we believe we have an opportunity for leadership. One of these areas is advanced insider threat that we are providing an integrated system by combining our shore view and data loss prevention capabilities as policy and analytics to capitalize on this rapidly expanding market area. 
We believe this approach will align well with our strategy to further penetrate in the enterprise and very large enterprise customer markets and support Forcepoint's long-term growth. 
Turning to capital deployment. We continue to pursue a balanced capital deployment strategy. Our #1 priority remains investing in organic growth. Beyond that, we remain focused on prudently returning capital to shareholders via competitive, sustainable dividend and share repurchases, market conditions permitting. We continue to use smaller targeted M&A to build technology and market gap to augment both our defense business and commercial cybersecurity capability. 
The bottom line, we had a great quarter with strong sales and margin as well as solid bookings which sets the stage for continued top line growth. For that, I would like to thank the entire Raytheon team, our employees are proud of what they do every day for our customers, company and shareholders. With that, let me turn it over to Tony."

During my remarks, I'll be referring to the web slides that we issued earlier this morning. If everyone would please turn to Page 3. 
We are pleased with the strong performance the team delivered in the third quarter with bookings, sales and EPS all at or better than our expectations. We had strong bookings in the third quarter of $6.9 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.15. Sales were $6 billion in the quarter, up 4%, led by missiles, SAS and Forcepoint. Our EPS from continuing operations was $1.79, which I'll give a little more color on in a few minutes. 
We generated solid operating cash flow of $640 million in the third quarter. Third quarter 2016 operating cash flow was lower than last year's third quarter as expected, primarily due to the timing of collections and payments. And on a year-to-date basis, operating cash flow of $1.7 billion was ahead of last year's year-to-date operating cash flow by approximately $200 million. During 
the quarter, the company repurchased 1.4 million shares of common stock for $198 million, bringing the year-to-date share repurchase to 6.2 million shares for $801 million. I also want to point out that we're raising the EPS guidance that we provided in July, reflecting our strong performance to date. I'll discuss guidance further in just a few minutes. 
Turning now to Page 4. Let me start by providing some detail on our third quarter results. The company bookings continue to be strong. For the third quarter, bookings were $6.9 billion and on the year-to-date basis were $20.3 billion, an increase of approximately $2.9 billion over the same period last year. It's worth noting that on a trailing 4-quarter basis, our book-to-bill ratio was 1.16. For the quarter, international was 21% of our total company bookings and on the year-to-date basis was 26%. 
We booked several significant awards in the third quarter, including $538 million on Standard Missile 3, $376 million for Phalanx Weapon Systems, $286 million on domestic and foreign training programs in support of Warfighter FOCUS activities, $265 million to provide advanced Patriot air and missile defense capabilities for our international customers and $255 million on the joint precision approach and landing system program, an all weather landing system for land-based and sea based aircraft for the U.S. Navy. Total backlog at the end of third quarter was $35.8 billion, an increase of approximately $2.2 billion compared to the end of the third quarter 2015, and funded backlog was $25.7 billion, an increase of approximately $1.3 billion compared to the end of the third quarter 2015. 
If you now moved to Page 5. For the third quarter, 2016 sales were in line with the guidance we set in July. Our international sales were approximately 32% of total sales. Looking now at sales by business. IDS had third quarter 2016 net sales of $1.3 billion. As expected, the change in net sales for the quarter was primarily driven by lower net sales on certain radar production programs and on an international communications program. In the third quarter 2016, IIS had net sales of $1.5 billion, up slightly compared with the same quarter last year. 
Missile Systems had third quarter 2016 net sales of $1.8 billion. The 9% increase from the third quarter 2015 was primarily due to the Paveway and Amram programs. SAS had net sales of $1.6 billion. The 10% increase versus last year was driven by higher sales on an international classified program. And for Forcepoint, the 31% increase was primarily driven by higher sales in federal products and services and the acquisition of Stonesoft, which was completed in the first quarter of 2016. 
Moving ahead to Page 6. Overall, the company continues to perform well. Our operating margin was 13.4% for the total company and 12.5% on a business segment basis. 
So looking now at the business margins. All performed at or above our expectations. The increase in margin at IDS in the third quarter compared to the comparable quarter last year reflects improved program performance. Both IIS and missiles operating margins were in line with last year's third quarter. As expected, SAS margin decreased in the quarter compared with the same period last year, primarily driven by a change in program mix. And at Forcepoint, the third quarter 2016 operating margin was, as expected, lower than last year's comparable quarter, primarily due to an increase in professional services and hardware sales relative to total sales and an increase in commissions due to higher bookings. 
Turning now to Page 7. Third quarter 2016 EPS was $1.79, better than expected, driven by timing of program improvements from the fourth quarter as well as some nonoperating items. 
On Page 8, as I've mentioned earlier, we are updating the company's financial outlook for 2016 to reflect our improved operating performance to date and our expectations for the fourth quarter compared to our prior guidance. We have tightened the range for full-year 2016 net sales, increasing the low end by $200 million. We now expect net sales to be between $24.2 billion and $24.5 billion, up 4% to 5% from 2015. The increase is driven by growth in both our domestic and international business. As we have done in prior year's during the quarter, we updated our actuarial estimates related to our pension plan. As a result of this update, the FAS/CAS adjustment for the year increased by $5 million from $428 million to $433 million for a favorable impact of approximately $0.01 per share. We've increased our full-year 2016 EPS, raising the low end by $0.15 and the high end by $0.05 from our prior guidance and now expect it to be in the range of $7.28 to $7.38. The increase is primarily driven by our improved performance to date as well as slightly higher pension income and lower interest expense. 
Turning to our share repurchase. Through the end of the third quarter, we repurchased 6.2 million shares of common stock for just over $800 million and now see our diluted share count of approximately 297 million shares for 2016, a 3% year-over-year reduction. As a percent of free cash flow, we expect to return approximately 80% of free cash flow to shareholders this year, depending on market conditions. 
And as you can see on Page 9, we've included guidance by business. We've increased and tightened the full-year sales outlook at both missiles and SAS. In addition, we tightened the full year sales range for IDS and IIS. 
Looking at margins. We've narrowed the margin guidance range for the company, breaking the low end by 10 basis points from our prior guidance and now see operating margins to be in the range of 13.3% to 13.4% for the full year. At the business segment level, we now see the operating margin in the range of 12.7% to 12.8% for the full year. 
Before moving on to Page 10. As Tom mentioned earlier, given our year-to-date booking strength and our expectation for a solid fourth quarter, we are now raising our full-year 2016 bookings outlook to $26.5 billion plus or minus $500 million. This $500 million increase to the prior range is driven by strong demand from our global customers and positions us well for 2017. This marks our second consecutive $500 million quarterly increase to our bookings outlook. We expect international to be about 1/3 of total bookings for the year. 
On Page 10, we have provided guidance on how we currently see the fourth quarter for sales, earnings per share and operating cash flow from continuing operations. We still expect fourth quarter sales to be in the range of $6.4 billion to $6.7 billion, consistent with our prior guidance. It's important to note that the fourth quarter of 2016 has for fewer workdays in the comparable period last year, which has an impact to sales of approximately $100 million per day. 
EPS from continuing operations is now expected to be in a range of $1.68 to $1.78, reflecting the timing of performance improvements we achieved earlier than previously expected. 
Now turning to next year. As we've done in the past, we intend to provide detailed 2017 guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call in January. As we sit here today, we currently see strong sales growth for 2017 of 3% to 5% over the midpoint of our 2016 outlook. We expect segment margins to be up for 2017 compared to 2016, excluding the CRS transaction in 2016, which contributes about 70 basis points. 
We are well positioned going forward with further margin expansion over time both on the domestic side as new development franchise wins transition to production and on the international side as large production programs moves through your life cycle. We expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 30% in 2017. In addition, we expect solid operating cash flow in 2017, slightly lower than 2016 as improvement from the businesses, as expected, is offset by higher cash taxes and required pension contributions. Of course, I want to caveat all this by saying our assumptions are based on the defense budget being approved in Washington before year end, thereby avoiding an extended CR or a government shutdown. 
Before moving on, I want to point out consistent with our public filings, that we plan to early adopt the revenue recognition standard in the first quarter of 2017. We do not expect the impact of adopting the new standard to be material to our results. So if you could please move to Page 11. We have provided a FAS/CAS pension adjusted matrix for 2017 as we've been in prior years. As a reminder, the range of outcomes shown are estimates. 
Actual Actual results will be based on factors that are not determined until year-end; in particular, the final discount rate, the actual asset returns and the long-term return on asset assumption, all of which could impact the estimates on this matrix.
As we sit here today, the discount rate is approximately 75 basis points lower than it was at the end of 2015 and would be roughly 3.75%, and our return on assets through October 25 is a little above 5%. In addition, we have been seeing downward pressure on our long-term return on asset assumption driven by the most recent capital market expectations. Based on this, we currently see a potential reduction from 8% to a range of 7.25% to 7.5%. I would note that for each 25 basis points change in the assumption down to 7.25%, we would expect an additional $55 million reduction for the FAS/CAS Adjustment for 2017 compared to what you see on the chart.
On Page 12, we have provided an updated net cash from pension outlook as well as the prior outlook that we provided to you in January using the same discount rate and return assumption. It's worth noting that the net cash from pension in 2017 is now expected to be better compared to our prior outlook. And given our CAS prepayment balance of nearly $7 billion, we continue to expect CAS recovery to exceed contributions well into the next decade. Said another way, we expect pension to be a net positive contributor to cash flow over the next 10-plus years under current assumptions. Please note that all of these assumptions exclude us making any potential discretionary pension contributions. And just to be clear, the final discount rate, the actual asset returns and the long-term return on asset assumptions won't be known until we close out 2016. We'll provide a more detailed pension outlook on our January year-end call.
In summary, we saw a solid performance in the third quarter. Bookings were strong. Our sales and EPS were at or above our expectations, and our strong cash flow and balance sheet will allow us to continue to drive value for our customers and our shareholders. We are well positioned for continued growth in 2017.
With that, Tom and I will open the call up for questions."

Actually, we're very excited about Forcepoint because we are starting to see some significant moves in the marketplace. Many have a solid foundation. They have -- you mentioned it already, they probably have one of the largest federal groups of any of the competitors out there. In fact, I think a lot of competitors [ph] wish they had as much federal access as we do into the cybersecurity market. And we sell in that federal group as a commercial company. That's one. You also did mention the next-generation firewall that they have that is often running, getting a lot of traction on that. You can see the sales on that is up. And then also, in the core business, the TRITON cloud work is -- we're also starting to see significant movement in that. But the area I was trying to point out in my discussion is one of the other areas where we've taken I would call our defense-grade capabilities into the commercial cybersecurity marketplace. And that's really on the insider threat. And so we took our -- essentially our product which was what we call the SureView product. We're tying that together, integrating that with the data loss prevention capability that Websense brought along and some analytics on top of that, providing an unbelievable capability to the marketplace relative to the event of insider threat. And as you've probably been reading in the press, there's quite a bit of insider threat issues that are going on across the commercial industry along different verticals. So we're extremely happy with the performance. Toby's here. He's got the details, and he can just run you through what we saw here in the third quarter and what we're seeing in the future."

So we really saw growth across the entire portfolio with the exception, as we expected, we've been talking about the legacy Web Filtering business, which did continue to decline. Along those lines, I do want to take a second, and as Tom talked about and as we are evolving our strategic position to align with the cybersecurity market where we see the greatest opportunities, the legacy delineation when we've talked in the past about TRITON and the Web Filtering, even though I just kind of gave you some color on it, it is becoming less meaningful to us given our changes in the organization and our go-to-market approach around that. But again, growth across the entire portfolio, we're focused strategically. If you roll that forward to Q4 from a top line perspective, we'd expect growth rates similar to Q3 on a year-over-year basis and margin that is higher.

As I said in my comments, we knew about some certain radar programs and one international communications program that was winding down. So that was what we had assumed going back to the beginning of the year. But we are seeing a little bit of timing impact on a couple international programs but now expect it in late Q4, early Q1. So that's what's driving primarily the change -- what happened in the quarter relative to the revenue, the sales and then also for the total year. From a margin point of view, I think what you're seeing is consistent with what we've been saying that IDS towards the back half of the year has some of the -- and I wouldn't say they're completing, I would say some of the major production programs that we booked over the last couple of years are, from an execution point of view, moving through their life cycles. They're at points where we obviously feel comfortable in increasing the booking rates there. You saw strong margins from IDS back in Q2, excluding the TRS gain. We see it again here in Q3. So I think things -- from our perspective, things are playing out on the margin line at IDS pretty much as we would have expected, and if anything, a little bit more favorable timing. I think some of the improvements we saw in Q2 and 3, if we go back 3 or 6 months, we would have said, would have been in Q4 and 3. So things that may have been accelerated within the year by about 90 days, but all good news from our perspective."

In terms of terms and conditions, we're really not seeing any changes in our contracting with the department or with the U.S. government. The department, as you know, is pushing more towards a fixed-price incentive fee construct on, I would call, production-type programs than they've had in the past. Something we're used to many years back, it's kind of rotated back in. So I think going through the initial iterations and making sure everybody understands that kind of a construct and then sets it up in a way that provides the contractors an incentive to do well, I think we're going through a little bit of transient on that, but it seems like it's settling out pretty quick. On the international side, we -- again, on the FMS contracts, we're not seeing much difference there relative to terms and conditions. Again, there is some issues relative to fixed-price incentive fee on production contracts. That's actually being debated in the halls of Congress. And right now, the NDAA has some language in it about the international production-type contracts being fixed price versus fixed-price incentive fee. And that's the only area that I see that's different. And our direct commercial sales, no difference there than we've had in the past."

And I think what I want to do is go back to this concept of buckets, and we're seeing these 3 demand areas. One is counterterrorism, counterinsurgency. The other bucket is deterrence, deterring a threat from taking action. And then there's a third bucket out there, which, I'm going to say, it's Third Offset strategy-type stuff, worrying about near-peer nation threats with advanced technologies. In Europe, the big one there is deterrence. We're seeing Eastern Europe very concerned in that area. And so they're looking for systems that will provide them that kind of a deterrence capability, and so we're seeing a lot of action on things like the Patriot System and then also our NASAMS system that we have at the nation's capital. And we had a sale in Oman and several other countries out there. So we're seeing significant pull for those deterrence-type systems in Europe. As we move to the Middle East, you're correct. I would say it's a little different in Middle East. It's a demand from both the counterinsurgency, counterterrorism bucket and then also the deterrence bucket. And on the counterinsurgency, I think you kind of understand that, that's some of the demand up-tempo pull here for precision weapons and some other ground systems that we have. On the deterrence side, I mean, there is a concern -- there is a neighbor of the GCC that the GCC is concerned about, and so you're getting into deterrence there, and therefore, you see the demand for systems like Patriot across the whole region. And so that's the deterrence bucket. And if we go over to the Asia-Pacific region, it's clear that it's -- and most of the effort there, demand signal is again coming from this deterrence bucket, looking for solutions like Patriot, advanced weapons, radars to be able to see things, ballistic missiles before they hit them. And so the Asia-Pacific region is in big demand on the deterrence. The third bucket is really coming directly from the Department of Defense, obviously, for all regions in the global area to be able to essentially come up from 20 years of fighting wars of insurgency to now dealing with near-peer threats that potentially have capabilities that are at or potentially some cases may be better or perceived to be better than what the U.S. has. And so it's a big catch-up area there. I mentioned -- we did mention on the call about significant increase in classified work. I think it's really addressing that bucket and to help the Department of Defense regain, in some cases, its superior capabilities over near-peer threats. And that's it."

And I don't know that I can really add anything beyond the sensitivity that I gave in my prepared comments. You're right that cash flow is going to continue to be positive from pension. There were a lot of questions earlier this year and concerns about overall cash flow because of the higher required contributions in 2017. That's got better based upon our current estimates by close to $200 million. Our overall cash flow for the company next year, as I mentioned earlier, may be slightly lower than where we're looking at for this year but still very, very strong. And I think if you look out over time, while near term, we may have some headwind on pensions from a P&L point of view. For an EPS point of view in '17, we'd expect that over time, even under those lower rates that I talked about, that we would see improvement in that profile, a pattern that would be similar to what we were seeing in the past where year-over-year, the EPS would improve, all else equal, based upon even revised assumptions in '17, '18 -- beyond '17 into '18 and '19.

We have some other awards that we are anticipating will be starting up, which are contributing to that growth as well as some continued ramp on some international Patriot programs that are already in our backlog as they move through their life cycle there. So we have a path forward relative to the growth in IDS on the top line. From a margin perspective, I reiterate, we are really pleased with what -- with the margin at IDS both in Q2 and in Q3 here. As we had talked about before, we were expecting an improvement in the margin at IDS, more in the back half of the year. We've accelerated some of that into Q2 and here again in Q3. We did raise our margin guidance by 20 basis points on the high end at IDS to reflect our solid performance to date. And we continue to expect solid operational performance in Q4, about in line where we are year-to-date, okay, if you want to think of it this way, when you adjust for the TRS transaction. The improvements we're seeing, they can be lumpy as well, right, because they're specifically tied to programs, the execution of those programs and the timing of those events, which, in some cases, if not a lot cases, aren't out of our control.

So specifically, from kind of a priority perspective, we're always looking to invest in ourselves, in the business, to drive growth where it makes sense. That's not going to change. We'll pursue targeted acquisitions. I think Tom mentioned in his opening comments ones that fill technology market access, market channel type of gaps. I won't comment on rumors out there in the marketplace, but what I will say generically, we don't have as part of our plan to go after big deals, okay? That would be something strategic and opportunistic. We want to provide the right level of return to our shareholders, somewhere -- as we target 80% to 90% of current year cash flow that includes a competitive and sustainable dividend and the buyback. Obviously, they continue to reduce the diluted share count over time. And we do, as you know, make from time to time discretionary pension contributions. That said, let me reiterate because it has come up in the past relative to the thought about any large acquisitions, whether it be on the defense side and/or the commercial cyber side, that is not in our plan. So rumors are rumors that are out there, and I'll leave that at that."

Number one, from where you sit right now, do you see the Pentagon getting sufficient fundings so we can actually have a major recapitalization of military platforms and sensors? And also, as with the trainer, should we be expecting Raytheon to becoming more of a platform prime? Or is that more of an exception and you're thinking about being a major system prime on sensors and weapons? If one or long-term trend towards increased defense spending, I'm just trying to get a sense of how you guys are thinking about positioning Raytheon in that area."

Both parties and positions are that they want to remove the Budget Control Act caps, and so -- which will be required to be able to fund this you call the recapitalization but also some new capability needs as part of this Third Offset strategy. We are seeing funding going into that area. We did see in '16 the BCA was lifted, and also '17 is looking good in terms of its budget moving forward. The question was what will happen in '18, '19 and beyond, and then if that's really going to be the output of this election. Again, both parties are significantly supporting strong defense moving forward. So as long as the funds are there and that we have Congress supporting it, I see that we'll be able to support most of this recapitalization. It will have to be timed out so that they have enough money to cover it over the multiple years that these new systems take to come on board."

Let me -- I'll address margin, but let me maybe give you and everybody a few comments on '17 a little bit beyond what I mentioned earlier. And if I start at the front end of the business, we do continue to expect to see a solid book-to-bill ratio next year over 1, even on the higher sales volume, as I mentioned, which we see growing in the 3% to 5% range. I will say that this growth is more heavily weighted towards our missiles and SAS business, then followed by IDS and IIS. And we also see growth again both domestically and internationally next year. On the margin comment, I'm kind of going to stick to where I mentioned earlier that in '17, when you adjust for the TRS transaction this year at the segment level, we see segment-level margins improving. That said, obviously, we're not giving details by business at this point, but since you asked about IDS and historically, there's been a lot of focus there, what I will tell you is we do see meaningful improvement in the IDS margin next year, again, excluding the 2016 impact of TRS. Although I will say that for IDS, if you're thinking of 16% or above next year, that's probably too aggressive. And I'll just kind of leave it at that. I mentioned cash flow is going to continue to be strong. We do expect higher cash from the businesses, partially offsetting pension and higher cash taxes. On our tax rate, if you recall in '16, our effective tax rate is impacted by the TRS transaction, and the gain on that of just under $160 million was tax-free. So when I look at the tax rate for '17 right now, think of it around 30%, which is more in line where '16 would be, excluding TRS. And then you mentioned Forcepoint. I think what I'll say on Forcepoint, we still expect double-digit growth and double-digit margins from them next year. Obviously, our goal today relative to '17 was just give you a high-level look where we're headed. We're still working through our process internally to finalize our views on '17. And in January, we'll update you on that, including details by our businesses."

I'm pleased to report that the company had strong operating performance in the third quarter and our growth strategy remains on track.

I'm pleased to report that the company had strong operating performance in the third quarter and our growth strategy remains on track. Revenue increased by over 4% and our operational execution was solid across the businesses with overall operating margins above our expectation. As a result, our earnings per share was well ahead of our prior guidance for the quarter. 
Based on the company's performance, we have updated our guidance for the year, Toby will provide more color on this as well as high-level outlook for 2017 in a few moments. 
We continue to see strong demand from our global customers for Advanced Technology. This demand drove third quarter book-to-bill ratio of 1.15 and our year-to-date book-to-bill ratio currently stands at a healthy 1.14. I would note that our year-to-date classified bookings have already surpassed our record annual level. 
Given our booking strength and our expectation for a solid fourth quarter, we have raised our bookings outlook range again for the year by another $500 million to a range of $26 billion to $27 billion. As you know, bookings ultimately drives revenue, but this positions us well for the continued solid top line growth for 2017. 
I'd like to point out that our domestic bookings were particularly strong in the third quarter, driven by classified, training, the joint precision approach and landing systems, Standard Missile 3, Phalanx and several additional missile programs. Classified bookings were very strong, representing 22% of total company bookings in the quarter. For our overall domestic business, it is worth noting that bookings have exceeded revenue in each quarter this year. One key area of focus for team is capturing and renewing franchise programs. These are large, long duration programs that last decades and have both domestic and international potential. 
In the third quarter, we received a key new franchise booking in our naval radar area for the enterprise air surveillance radar or EASR. This competitive award for the initial engineering, manufacturing development phase of the program that will ultimately equip U.S. Navy ships and carriers with the new radar based on our gallium nitride or GaN technology. To recall, we developed GaN as a big bet technology over a decade ago and leveraged it for previous franchise wins on the air missile defense radar and the next generation jammer, both for the U.S. Navy. 
All together, these programs put us in a strong position to support our U.S. Navy and international customers with advanced capabilities to counter emerging threats. The EASR win represents an opportunity of over $1 billion for the company. We see additional opportunities to leverage GaN technology on our ground-based radar franchises as well. 
The Missile Defense Agency recently awarded us a contract to develop a process to incorporate GaN components into existing and future Tippy Two radars. These are long range radars used to detect and track ballistic missiles. And earlier this year, we began showcasing a new GaN based EASR radar for our Patriot integrated air and missile defense system at key industry events such as AUSA and the Farnborough international airshow. 
Customer feedback and interest from these events is strong and we are actively pursuing new opportunities for this radar with key customers. I'm pleased with the progress we're making on these multiple franchise pursuits and with a clear success of our GaN investment, which has positioned us well across both radar and electronic warfare segments. 
As we look to potential future bookings, there are a number of large upcoming opportunities for the company, including an early warning radar system for Qatar as well as Patriot, Standard Missile 2 and radar upgrades across Japan and Taiwan, which combined, represents a multibillion dollar opportunity. Further, we continue to make progress on the Patriot opportunity in Poland. You may have seen that Poland signed a letter of request for integrated air and missile defense system with the U.S. in September based on the Patriot System. We believe Poland will sign a foreign military sales agreement with the U.S. government sometime later this year, early next. 
On this timeline, we would expect in turn a signed contract with the U.S. government and booking awards later in 2017 for initial Patriot capability. I would add that in addition to Poland, we see other emerging Patriot opportunities in the European region. 
Turning to sales. Our third quarter increased by a solid 4.3% as a result of the continued execution of our growth strategy. As we've discussed on past earnings calls, the company is aligned with the needs of our global customers and continues to invest in what we expect to be future growth areas. Internationally, sales were up 7% in the quarter and represented 32% of our total sales. Domestic sales increased by 3% and included classified growth of 5%. 
Forcepoint, our cybersecurity product business, saw sales increase 31% for the third quarter, in which 18% was organic.  I would like to take a minute to update you further on Forcepoint. The business is performing well and on track to meet its 2016 objective. The integration of all acquisitions is essentially complete. Forcepoint's new CEO, Matt Moynahan has been onboard for 5 months now and is making very good progress. We have put in place an updated strategic plan that addresses areas of the cybersecurity market where we believe we have an opportunity for leadership. One of these areas is advanced insider threat that we are providing an integrated system by combining our SureView and data loss prevention capabilities as policy and analytics to capitalize on this rapidly expanding market area. 
We believe this approach will align well with our strategy to further penetrate in the enterprise and very large enterprise customer markets and support Forcepoint's long-term growth. 
Turning to capital deployment. We continue to pursue a balanced capital deployment strategy. Our #1 priority remains investing in organic growth. Beyond that, we remain focused on prudently returning capital to shareholders via competitive, sustainable dividend and share repurchases, market conditions permitting. We continue to use smaller targeted M&A to fill technology or market gaps to augment both our defense business and commercial cybersecurity capability. 
The bottom line, we had a great quarter with strong sales and margin as well as solid bookings which sets the stage for continued top line growth. For that, I would like to thank the entire Raytheon team, our employees are proud of what they do every day for our customers, company and shareholders. With that, let me turn it over to Toby."

During my remarks, I'll be referring to the web slides that we issued earlier this morning. If everyone would please turn to Page 3. 
We are pleased with the strong performance the team delivered in the third quarter with bookings, sales and EPS all at or better than our expectations. We had strong bookings in the third quarter of $6.9 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.15. Sales were $6 billion in the quarter, up 4%, led by missiles, SAS and Forcepoint. Our EPS from continuing operations was $1.79, which I'll give a little more color on in a few minutes. 
We generated solid operating cash flow of $640 million in the third quarter. Third quarter 2016 operating cash flow was lower than last year's third quarter as expected, primarily due to the timing of collections and payments. And on a year-to-date basis, operating cash flow of $1.7 billion was ahead of last year's year-to-date operating cash flow by approximately $200 million. During the quarter, the company repurchased 1.4 million shares of common stock for $198 million, bringing the year-to-date share repurchase to 6.2 million shares for $801 million. I also want to point out that we're raising the EPS guidance that we provided in July, reflecting our strong performance to date. I'll discuss guidance further in just a few minutes. 
Turning now to Page 4. Let me start by providing some detail on our third quarter results. The company bookings continue to be strong. For the third quarter, bookings were $6.9 billion and on the year-to-date basis were $20.3 billion, an increase of approximately $2.9 billion over the same period last year. It's worth noting that on a trailing 4-quarter basis, our book-to-bill ratio was 1.16. For the quarter, international was 21% of our total company bookings and on the year-to-date basis was 26%. 
We booked several significant awards in the third quarter, including $538 million on Standard Missile 3, $376 million for Phalanx Weapon Systems, $286 million on domestic and foreign training programs in support of Warfighter FOCUS activities, $265 million to provide advanced Patriot air and missile defense capabilities for our international customers and $255 million on the joint precision approach and landing system program, an all-weather landing system for land-based and sea based aircraft for the U.S. Navy. Total backlog at the end of third quarter was $35.8 billion, an increase of approximately $2.2 billion compared to the end of the third quarter 2015, and funded backlog was $25.7 billion, an increase of approximately $1.3 billion compared to the end of the third quarter 2015. 
If you now move to Page 5. For the third quarter, 2016 sales were in line with the guidance we set in July. Our international sales were approximately 32% of total sales. Looking now at sales by business. IDS had third quarter 2016 net sales of $1.3 billion. As expected, the change in net sales for the quarter was primarily driven by lower net sales on certain radar production programs and on an international communications program. In the third quarter 2016, IIS had net sales of $1.5 billion, up slightly compared with the same quarter last year. 
Missile Systems had third quarter 2016 net sales of $1.8 billion. The 9% increase from the third quarter 2015 was primarily due to the Paveway and AMRAAM programs. SAS had net sales of $1.6 billion. The 10% increase versus last year was driven by higher sales on an international classified program. And for Forcepoint, the 31% increase was primarily driven by higher sales in federal products and services and the acquisition of Stonesoft, which was completed in the first quarter of 2016. 
Moving ahead to Page 6. Overall, the company continues to perform well. Our operating margin was 13.4% for the total company and 12.5% on a business segment basis. 
So looking now at the business margins. All performed at or above our expectations. The increase in margin at IDS in the third quarter compared to the comparable quarter last year reflects improved program performance. Both IIS and missiles operating margins were in line with last year's third quarter. As expected, SAS margin decreased in the quarter compared with the same period last year, primarily driven by a change in program mix. And at Forcepoint, the third quarter 2016 operating margin was, as expected, lower than last year's comparable quarter, primarily due to an increase in professional services and hardware sales relative to total sales and an increase in commissions due to higher bookings. 
Turning now to Page 7. Third quarter 2016 EPS was $1.79, better than expected, driven by timing of program improvements from the fourth quarter as well as some nonoperating items. 
On Page 8, as I've mentioned earlier, we are updating the company's financial outlook for 2016 to reflect our improved operating performance to date and our expectations for the fourth quarter compared to our prior guidance. We have tightened the range for full-year 2016 net sales, increasing the low end by $200 million. We now expect net sales to be between $24.2 billion and $24.5 billion, up 4% to 5% from 2015. The increase is driven by growth in both our domestic and international business. As we have done in prior year's during the quarter, we updated our actuarial estimates related to our pension plan. As a result of this update, the FAS/CAS adjustment for the year increased by $5 million from $428 million to $433 million for a favorable impact of approximately $0.01 per share. We have increased our full-year 2016 EPS, raising the low end by $0.15 and the high end by $0.05 from our prior guidance and now expect it to be in the range of $7.28 to $7.38. The increase is primarily driven by our improved performance to date as well as slightly higher pension income and lower interest expense. 
Turning to our share repurchase. Through the end of the third quarter, we repurchased 6.2 million shares of common stock for just over $800 million and now see our diluted share count at approximately 297 million shares for 2016, a 3% year-over-year reduction. As a percent of free cash flow, we expect to return approximately 80% of free cash flow to shareholders this year, depending on market conditions. 
And as you can see on Page 9, we've included guidance by business. We've increased and tightened the full-year sales outlook at both missiles and SAS. In addition, we tightened the full year sales range for IDS and IIS. 
Looking at margins. We've narrowed the margin guidance range for the company, raising the low end by 10 basis points from our prior guidance and now see operating margins to be in the range of 13.3% to 13.4% for the full year. At the business segment level, we now see the operating margin in the range of 12.7% to 12.8% for the full year. 
Before moving on to Page 10. As Tom mentioned earlier, given our year-to-date booking strength and our expectation for a solid fourth quarter, we are now raising our full-year 2016 bookings outlook to $26.5 billion plus or minus $500 million. This $500 million increase to the prior range is driven by strong demand from our global customers and positions us well for 2017. This marks our second consecutive $500 million quarterly increase to our bookings outlook. We expect international to be about 1/3 of total bookings for the year. 
On Page 10, we have provided guidance on how we currently see the fourth quarter for sales, earnings per share and operating cash flow from continuing operations. We still expect fourth quarter sales to be in the range of $6.4 billion to $6.7 billion, consistent with our prior guidance. It's important to note that the fourth quarter of 2016 has 4 fewer workdays than the comparable period last year, which has an impact to sales of approximately $100 million per day. 
EPS from continuing operations is now expected to be in a range of $1.68 to $1.78, reflecting the timing of performance improvements we achieved earlier than previously expected. 
Now turning to next year. As we've done in the past, we intend to provide detailed 2017 guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call in January. As we sit here today, we currently see strong sales growth for 2017 of 3% to 5% over the midpoint of our 2016 outlook. We expect segment margins to be up for 2017 compared to 2016, excluding the CRS transaction in 2016, which contributes about 70 basis points. 
We are well positioned going forward with further margin expansion over time both on the domestic side as new development franchise wins transition to production and on the international side as large production programs move through their life cycle. We expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 30% in 2017. In addition, we expect solid operating cash flow in 2017, slightly lower than 2016 as improvement from the businesses, as expected, is offset by higher cash taxes and required pension contributions. Of course, I want to caveat all this by saying our assumptions are based on the defense budget being approved in Washington before year end, thereby avoiding an extended CR or a government shutdown. 
Before moving on, I want to point out consistent with our public filings, that we plan to early adopt the revenue recognition standard in the first quarter of 2017. We do not expect the impact of adopting the new standard to be material to our results. 
So if you could please move to Page 11. We have provided a FAS/CAS pension adjustment matrix for 2017 as we've been in prior years. As a reminder, the range of outcomes shown are estimates. Actual results will be based on factors that are not determined until year-end; in particular, the final discount rate, the actual asset returns and the long-term return on asset assumption, all of which could impact the estimates on this matrix.
As we sit here today, the discount rate is approximately 75 basis points lower than it was at the end of 2015 and would be roughly 3.75%, and our return on assets through October 25 is a little above 5%. In addition, we have been seeing downward pressure on our long-term return on asset assumption driven by the most recent capital market expectations. Based on this, we currently see a potential reduction from 8% to a range of 7.25% to 7.5%. I would note that for each 25 basis points change in the assumption down to 7.25%, we would expect an additional $55 million reduction for the FAS/CAS Adjustment for 2017 compared to what you see on the chart.
On Page 12, we have provided an updated net cash from pension outlook as well as the prior outlook that we provided to you in January using the same discount rate and return assumption. It's worth noting that the net cash from pension in 2017 is now expected to be better compared to our prior outlook. And given our CAS prepayment balance of nearly $7 billion, we continue to expect CAS recovery to exceed contributions well into the next decade. Said another way, we expect pension to be a net positive contributor to cash flow over the next 10-plus years under current assumptions. Please note that all of these assumptions exclude us making any potential discretionary pension contributions. And just to be clear, the final discount rate, the actual asset returns and the long-term return on asset assumptions won't be known until we close out 2016. We'll provide a more detailed pension outlook on our January year-end call.
In summary, we saw a solid performance in the third quarter. Bookings were strong. Our sales and EPS were at or above our expectations, and our strong cash flow and balance sheet will allow us to continue to drive value for our customers and our shareholders. We are well positioned for continued growth in 2017.
With that, Tom and I will open the call up for questions."

Actually, we're very excited about Forcepoint because we are starting to see some significant moves in the marketplace. I mean they have a solid foundation. They have -- you mentioned it already, they probably have one of the largest federal groups of any of the competitors out there. In fact, I think a lot of the competitors wish they had as much federal access as we do into the cybersecurity market. And we sell in that federal group as a commercial company. That's one. You also did mention the next-generation firewall that they have that is off and running, getting a lot of traction on that. You can see the sales on that is up. And then also, in the core business, the TRITON cloud work is -- we're also starting to see significant movement in that. But the area I was trying to point out in my discussion is one of the other areas where we've taken I would call our defense-grade capabilities into the commercial cybersecurity marketplace. And that's really on the insider threat. And so we took our -- essentially our product which was what we call the SureView product. We're tying that together, integrating that with the data loss prevention capability that Websense brought along and some analytics on top of that, and providing an unbelievable capability to the marketplace relative to the advanced insider threat. And as you've probably been reading in the press, there's quite a bit of insider threat issues that are going on across the commercial industry along different verticals. So we're extremely happy with the performance. Toby's here. He's got the details, and he can just run you through what we saw here in the third quarter and what we're seeing in the future."

So we really saw growth across the entire portfolio with the exception, as we expected, we've been talking about the legacy Web Filtering business, which did continue to decline. Along those lines, I do want to take a second, and as Tom talked about and as we are evolving our strategic position to align with the cybersecurity market where we see the greatest opportunities, the legacy delineation when we've talked in the past about TRITON and the Web Filtering, even though I just kind of gave you some color on it, it is becoming less meaningful to us given our changes in the organization and our go-to-market approach around that. But again, growth across the entire portfolio, where we're focused strategically, if you roll that forward to Q4 from a top line perspective, we'd expect growth rates similar to Q3 on a year-over-year basis and margin that is higher. To your question, we'd be looking at margins in the 16-plus percent range for the fourth quarter. Obviously, we didn't change the outlook for the year, so we feel good that the team has a path forward there."

As I said in my comments, we knew about some certain radar programs and one international communications program that was winding down. So that was what we had assumed going back to the beginning of the year. But we are seeing a little bit of timing impact on a couple international programs but now expect it in late Q4, early Q1. So that's what's driving primarily the change -- what happened in the quarter relative to the revenue, the sales and then also for the total year. 
From a margin point of view, I think what you're seeing is consistent with what we've been saying that -- is that IDS towards the back half of the year has some of the -- and I wouldn't say they're completing, I would say some of the major production programs that we booked over the last couple of years are, from an execution point of view, moving through their life cycles. They're at points where we obviously feel comfortable in increasing the booking rates there. You saw strong margins from IDS back in Q2, excluding the TRS gain. We see it again here in Q3. So I think things -- from our perspective, things are playing out on the margin line at IDS pretty much as we would have expected, and if anything, a little bit more favorable timing. I think some of the improvements we saw in Q2 and 3, if we go back 3 or 6 months, we would have said, would have been in Q4 and 3. So things have maybe been accelerated within the year by about 90 days, but all good news from our perspective."

In terms of terms and conditions, we're really not seeing any changes in our contracting with the department or with the U.S. government. The department, as you know, is pushing more towards a fixed-price incentive fee construct on, I would call, production-type programs than they've had in the past. Something we're used to many years back, it's kind of rotated back in. So I think going through the initial iterations and making sure everybody understands that kind of a construct and then sets it up in a way that provides the contractors an incentive to do well, I think we're going through a little bit of transient on that, but it seems like it's settling out pretty quick. 
On the international side, we -- again, on the FMS contracts, we're not seeing much difference there relative to terms and conditions. Again, there is some issues relative to fixed-price incentive fee on production contracts. That's actually being debated in the halls of Congress. And right now, the NDAA has some language in it about the international production-type contracts, that being firm fixed price versus fixed-price incentive fee. And that's the only area that I see that's different. And our direct commercial sales, no difference there than we've had in the past."

And I think what I want to do is go back to this concept of buckets, and we're seeing these 3 demand areas. One is counterterrorism, counterinsurgency. The other bucket is deterrence, deterring a threat from taking action. And then there's a third bucket out there, which, I'm going to say, it's Third Offset strategy-type stuff, worrying about near-peer nation threats with advanced technologies. In Europe, the big one there is deterrence. We're seeing Eastern Europe very concerned in that area. And so they're looking for systems that will provide them that kind of a deterrence capability, and so we're seeing a lot of action on things like the Patriot System and then also our NASAMS system that we have at the nation's capital. And we had a sale in Oman and several other countries out there. So we're seeing significant pull for those deterrence-type systems in Europe. As we move to the Middle East, you're correct. I would say it's a little different in Middle East. It's a demand from both the counterinsurgency, counterterrorism bucket and then also the deterrence bucket. And on the counterinsurgency, I think you kind of understand that, that's some of the demand off-tempo pull here for precision weapons and some other ground systems that we have. On the deterrence side, I mean, there is a concern -- there is a neighbor of the GCC that the GCC is concerned about, and so you're getting into deterrence there, and therefore, you see the demand for systems like Patriot across the whole region. And so that's the deterrence bucket. 
And if we go over to the Asia-Pacific region, it's clear that it's -- and most of the effort there, demand signal is again coming from this deterrence bucket, looking for solutions like Patriot, advanced weapons, radars to be able to see things, ballistic missiles before they hit them. And so the Asia-Pacific region is in big demand on the deterrence. 
The third bucket is really coming directly from the Department of Defense, obviously, for all regions in the global area to be able to essentially come up from 20 years of fighting wars of insurgency to now dealing with near-peer threats that potentially have capabilities that are at or potentially some cases may be better or perceived to be better than what the U.S. has. And so it's a big catch-up area there. I mentioned -- we did mention on the call about significant increase in classified work. I think it's really addressing that bucket and to help the Department of Defense regain, in some cases, its superior capabilities over near-peer threats. And that's it."

And I don't know that I can really add anything beyond the sensitivity that I gave in my prepared comments. You're right that cash flow is going to continue to be positive from pension. There were a lot of questions earlier this year and concerns about overall cash flow because of the higher required contributions in 2017. That's got better based upon our current estimates by close to $200 million. Our overall cash flow for the company next year, as I mentioned earlier, may be slightly lower than where we're looking at for this year but still very, very strong. And I think if you look out over time, while near term, we may have some headwind on pensions from a P&L point of view. For an EPS point of view in '17, we'd expect that over time, even under those lower rates that I talked about, that we would see improvement in that profile, a pattern that would be similar to what we were seeing in the past where year-over-year, the EPS would improve, all else equal, based upon even revised assumptions in '17, '18 -- beyond '17 into '18 and '19.

And in the fourth quarter, we've got some elevated sales implied by the guidance. And we saw somewhat higher sales last year as well. Can you talk about sort of how much that reflects timing versus how much that reflects sort of a new run rate? And then similarly, it looks like the guidance implies for the fourth quarter sort of a lower margin, but if we just look back over the past couple of years, seasonally, the fourth quarter seems to be fairly strong. So just maybe some of the dynamics around sales and profitability in IDS in Q4."

So when George asked, I told him what kind of happened in Q3 and why we lowered a little bit the range of sales for the year, driven by the timing of some new awards that now we're expecting later in Q4 or early next year. But for Q4, from a sales point of view, even with that narrow guidance, we do expect solid growth in Q4. We have some other awards that we are anticipating will be starting up, which are contributing to that growth as well as some continued ramp on some international Patriot programs that are already in our backlog as they move through their life cycle there. So we have a path forward relative to the growth in IDS on the top line. From a margin perspective, I'll reiterate, we are really pleased with what -- with the margin at IDS both in Q2 and in Q3 here. As we had talked about before, we were expecting an improvement in the margin at IDS, more in the back half of the year. We've accelerated some of that into Q2 and here again in Q3. We did raise our margin guidance by 20 basis points on the high end at IDS to reflect our solid performance to date. And we continue to expect solid operational performance in Q4, about in line where we are year-to-date, okay, if you want to think of it this way, when you adjust for the TRS transaction. The improvements we're seeing, they can be lumpy as well, right, because they're specifically tied to programs, the execution of those programs and the timing of those events, which, in some cases, if not a lot of cases, aren't out of our control. And what we feel that we've done is we've de-risked that fourth quarter and the ramp that -- if you go back 90 days, 180 days, the ramp that we would have had in the fourth quarter."

As we talked about in the past, the balanced approach has worked well for us. We're continuing to use that here today and going forward. The underpinning to being able to do that is obviously strong cash flow generation and a strong balance sheet, both of which we have and we're focused on. So specifically, from kind of a priority perspective, we're always looking to invest in ourselves, in the business, to drive growth where it makes sense. That's not going to change. We'll pursue targeted acquisitions. I think Tom mentioned in his opening comments ones that fill technology market access, market channel type of gaps. I won't comment on rumors out there in the marketplace, but what I will say generically, we don't have as part of our plan to go after big deals, okay? That would be something strategic and opportunistic. We want to provide the right level of return to our shareholders, somewhere -- as we target 80% to 90% of current year cash flow that includes a competitive and sustainable dividend and the buyback. Obviously, to continue to reduce the diluted share count over time. And we do, as you know, make from time to time discretionary pension contributions. That said, let me reiterate because it has come up in the past relative to the thought about any large acquisitions, whether it be on the defense side and/or the commercial cyber side, that is not in our plan. So rumors are rumors that are out there, and I'll leave that at that."

There were also though a number of new centers like air missile defense radar, Next Generation Jammer, et cetera. I wanted to get your perspectives on this. Number one, from where you sit right now, do you see the Pentagon getting sufficient fundings so we can actually have a major recapitalization of military platforms and sensors? And also, as with the trainer, should we be expecting Raytheon to becoming more of a platform prime? Or is that more of an exception and you're thinking about being a major system prime on sensors and weapons? If we're on a long-term trend towards increased defense spending, I'm just trying to get a sense of how you guys are thinking about positioning Raytheon in that area."

Both parties and positions are that they want to remove the Budget Control Act caps, and so -- which will be required to be able to fund this you call it the recapitalization, but also some new capability needs as part of this Third Offset strategy. We are seeing funding going into that area. We did see in '16 the BCA was lifted, and also '17 is looking good in terms of its budget moving forward. The question was what will happen in '18, '19 and beyond, and then if that's really going to be the output of this election. Again, both parties are significantly supporting strong defense moving forward. So as long as the funds are there and that we have Congress supporting it, I see that we'll be able to support most of this recapitalization. It will have to be timed out so that they have enough money to cover it over the multiple years that these new systems take to come on board."

Let me -- I'll address margin, but let me maybe give you and everybody a few comments on '17 a little bit beyond what I mentioned earlier. And if I start at the front end of the business, we do continue to expect to see a solid book-to-bill ratio next year over 1, even on the higher sales volume, as I mentioned, which we see growing in the 3% to 5% range. I will say that this growth is more heavily weighted towards our missiles and SAS business, then followed by IDS and IIS. And we also see growth again both domestically and internationally next year. On the margin comment, I'm kind of going to stick to where I mentioned earlier that in '17, when you adjust for the TRS transaction this year at the segment level, we see segment-level margins improving. That said, obviously, we're not giving details by business at this point, but since you asked about IDS and historically, there's been a lot of focus there, what I will tell you is we do see meaningful improvement in the IDS margin next year, again, excluding the 2016 impact of TRS. Although I will say that for IDS, if you're thinking of 16% or above next year, that's probably too aggressive. And I'll just kind of leave it at that. 
I mentioned cash flow is going to continue to be strong. We do expect higher cash from the businesses, partially offsetting pension and higher cash taxes. On our tax rate, if you recall in '16, our effective tax rate is impacted by the TRS transaction, and the gain on that of just under $160 million was tax-free. So when I look at the tax rate for '17 right now, think of it around 30%, which is more in line where '16 would be, excluding TRS. And then you mentioned Forcepoint. I think what I'll say on Forcepoint, we still expect double-digit growth and double-digit margins from them next year. Obviously, our goal today relative to '17 was just give you a high-level look where we're headed. We're still working through our process internally to finalize our views on '17.

I'm pleased to report that the company had strong operating performance in the third quarter and our growth strategy remains on track. Revenue increased by over 4% and our operational execution was solid across the businesses with overall operating margins above our expectation. As a result, our earnings per share was well ahead of our prior guidance for the quarter. 
Based on the company's performance, we have updated our guidance for the year, Toby will provide more color on this as well as high-level outlook for 2017 in a few moments. 
We continue to see strong demand from our global customers for Advanced Technology. This demand drove third quarter book-to-bill ratio of 1.15 and our year-to-date book-to-bill ratio currently stands at a healthy 1.14. I would note that our year-to-date classified bookings have already surpassed our record annual level. 
Given our booking strength and our expectation for a solid fourth quarter, we have raised our bookings outlook range again for the year by another $500 million to a range of $26 billion to $27 billion. As you know, bookings ultimately drives revenue, but this positions us well for the continued solid top line growth for 2017. 
I'd like to point out that our domestic bookings were particularly strong in the third quarter, driven by classified, training, the joint precision approach and landing systems, Standard Missile 3, Phalanx and several additional missile programs. Classified bookings were very strong, representing 22% of total company bookings in the quarter. For our overall domestic business, it is worth noting that bookings have exceeded revenue in each quarter this year. One key area of focus for team is capturing and renewing franchise programs. These are large, long duration programs that last decades and have both domestic and international potential. 
In the third quarter, we received a key new franchise booking in our naval radar area for the enterprise air surveillance radar or EASR. This competitive award for the initial engineering, manufacturing development phase of the program that will ultimately equip U.S. Navy ships and carriers with the new radar based on our gallium nitride or GaN technology. To recall, we developed GaN as a big bet technology over a decade ago and leveraged it for previous franchise wins on the air missile defense radar and the next generation jammer, both for the U.S. Navy. 
All together, these programs put us in a strong position to support our U.S. Navy and international customers with advanced capabilities to counter emerging threats. The EASR win represents an opportunity of over $1 billion for the company. We see additional opportunities to leverage GaN technology on our ground-based radar franchises as well. 
The Missile Defense Agency recently awarded us a contract to develop a process to incorporate GaN components into existing and future Tippy Two radars. These are long range radars used to detect and track ballistic missiles. And earlier this year, we began showcasing a new GaN based EASR radar for our Patriot integrated air and missile defense system at key industry events such as AUSA and the Farnborough international airshow. 
Customer feedback and interest from these events is strong and we are actively pursuing new opportunities for this radar with key customers. I'm pleased with the progress we're making on these multiple franchise pursuits and with a clear success of our GaN investment, which has positioned us well across both radar and electronic warfare segments. 
As we look to potential future bookings, there are a number of large upcoming opportunities for the company, including an early warning radar system for Qatar as well as Patriot, Standard Missile 2 and radar upgrades across Japan and Taiwan, which combined, represents a multibillion dollar opportunity. Further, we continue to make progress on the Patriot opportunity in Poland. You may have seen that Poland signed a letter of request for integrated air and missile defense system with the U.S. in September based on the Patriot System. We believe Poland will sign a foreign military sales agreement with the U.S. government sometime later this year, early next. 
On this timeline, we would expect in turn a signed contract with the U.S. government and booking awards later in 2017 for initial Patriot capability. I would add that in addition to Poland, we see other emerging Patriot opportunities in the European region. 
Turning to sales. Our third quarter increased by a solid 4.3% as a result of the continued execution of our growth strategy. As we've discussed on past earnings calls, the company is aligned with the needs of our global customers and continues to invest in what we expect to be future growth areas. Internationally, sales were up 7% in the quarter and represented 32% of our total sales. Domestic sales increased by 3% and included classified growth of 5%. 
Forcepoint, our cybersecurity product business, saw sales increase 31% for the third quarter, in which 18% was organic.  I would like to take a minute to update you further on Forcepoint. The business is performing well and on track to meet its 2016 objective. The integration of all acquisitions is essentially complete. Forcepoint's new CEO, Matt Moynahan has been onboard for 5 months now and is making very good progress. We have put in place an updated strategic plan that addresses areas of the cybersecurity market where we believe we have an opportunity for leadership. One of these areas is advanced insider threat that we are providing an integrated system by combining our SureView and data loss prevention capabilities as policy and analytics to capitalize on this rapidly expanding market area. 
We believe this approach will align well with our strategy to further penetrate in the enterprise and very large enterprise customer markets and support Forcepoint's long-term growth. 
Turning to capital deployment. We continue to pursue a balanced capital deployment strategy. Our #1 priority remains investing in organic growth. Beyond that, we remain focused on prudently returning capital to shareholders via competitive, sustainable dividend and share repurchases, market conditions permitting. We continue to use smaller targeted M&A to fill technology or market gaps to augment both our defense business and commercial cybersecurity capability. 
The bottom line, we had a great quarter with strong sales and margin as well as solid bookings which sets the stage for continued top line growth. For that, I would like to thank the entire Raytheon team, our employees are proud of what they do every day for our customers, company and shareholders. With that, let me turn it over to Toby."

During my remarks, I'll be referring to the web slides that we issued earlier this morning. If everyone would please turn to Page 3. 
We are pleased with the strong performance the team delivered in the third quarter with bookings, sales and EPS all at or better than our expectations. We had strong bookings in the third quarter of $6.9 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.15. Sales were $6 billion in the quarter, up 4%, led by missiles, SAS and Forcepoint. Our EPS from continuing operations was $1.79, which I'll give a little more color on in a few minutes. 
We generated solid operating cash flow of $640 million in the third quarter. Third quarter 2016 operating cash flow was lower than last year's third quarter as expected, primarily due to the timing of collections and payments. And on a year-to-date basis, operating cash flow of $1.7 billion was ahead of last year's year-to-date operating cash flow by approximately $200 million. During the quarter, the company repurchased 1.4 million shares of common stock for $198 million, bringing the year-to-date share repurchase to 6.2 million shares for $801 million. I also want to point out that we're raising the EPS guidance that we provided in July, reflecting our strong performance to date. I'll discuss guidance further in just a few minutes. 
Turning now to Page 4. Let me start by providing some detail on our third quarter results. The company bookings continue to be strong. For the third quarter, bookings were $6.9 billion and on the year-to-date basis were $20.3 billion, an increase of approximately $2.9 billion over the same period last year. It's worth noting that on a trailing 4-quarter basis, our book-to-bill ratio was 1.16. For the quarter, international was 21% of our total company bookings and on the year-to-date basis was 26%. 
We booked several significant awards in the third quarter, including $538 million on Standard Missile 3, $376 million for Phalanx Weapon Systems, $286 million on domestic and foreign training programs in support of Warfighter FOCUS activities, $265 million to provide advanced Patriot air and missile defense capabilities for our international customers and $255 million on the joint precision approach and landing system program, an all-weather landing system for land-based and sea based aircraft for the U.S. Navy. Total backlog at the end of third quarter was $35.8 billion, an increase of approximately $2.2 billion compared to the end of the third quarter 2015, and funded backlog was $25.7 billion, an increase of approximately $1.3 billion compared to the end of the third quarter 2015. 
If you now move to Page 5. For the third quarter, 2016 sales were in line with the guidance we set in July. Our international sales were approximately 32% of total sales. Looking now at sales by business. IDS had third quarter 2016 net sales of $1.3 billion. As expected, the change in net sales for the quarter was primarily driven by lower net sales on certain radar production programs and on an international communications program. In the third quarter 2016, IIS had net sales of $1.5 billion, up slightly compared with the same quarter last year. 
Missile Systems had third quarter 2016 net sales of $1.8 billion. The 9% increase from the third quarter 2015 was primarily due to the Paveway and AMRAAM programs. SAS had net sales of $1.6 billion. The 10% increase versus last year was driven by higher sales on an international classified program. And for Forcepoint, the 31% increase was primarily driven by higher sales in federal products and services and the acquisition of Stonesoft, which was completed in the first quarter of 2016. 
Moving ahead to Page 6. Overall, the company continues to perform well. Our operating margin was 13.4% for the total company and 12.5% on a business segment basis. 
So looking now at the business margins. All performed at or above our expectations. The increase in margin at IDS in the third quarter compared to the comparable quarter last year reflects improved program performance. Both IIS and missiles operating margins were in line with last year's third quarter. As expected, SAS margin decreased in the quarter compared with the same period last year, primarily driven by a change in program mix. And at Forcepoint, the third quarter 2016 operating margin was, as expected, lower than last year's comparable quarter, primarily due to an increase in professional services and hardware sales relative to total sales and an increase in commissions due to higher bookings. 
Turning now to Page 7. Third quarter 2016 EPS was $1.79, better than expected, driven by timing of program improvements from the fourth quarter as well as some nonoperating items. 
On Page 8, as I've mentioned earlier, we are updating the company's financial outlook for 2016 to reflect our improved operating performance to date and our expectations for the fourth quarter compared to our prior guidance. We have tightened the range for full-year 2016 net sales, increasing the low end by $200 million. We now expect net sales to be between $24.2 billion and $24.5 billion, up 4% to 5% from 2015. The increase is driven by growth in both our domestic and international business. As we have done in prior year's during the quarter, we updated our actuarial estimates related to our pension plan. As a result of this update, the FAS/CAS adjustment for the year increased by $5 million from $428 million to $433 million for a favorable impact of approximately $0.01 per share. We have increased our full-year 2016 EPS, raising the low end by $0.15 and the high end by $0.05 from our prior guidance and now expect it to be in the range of $7.28 to $7.38. The increase is primarily driven by our improved performance to date as well as slightly higher pension income and lower interest expense. 
Turning to our share repurchase. Through the end of the third quarter, we repurchased 6.2 million shares of common stock for just over $800 million and now see our diluted share count at approximately 297 million shares for 2016, a 3% year-over-year reduction. As a percent of free cash flow, we expect to return approximately 80% of free cash flow to shareholders this year, depending on market conditions. 
And as you can see on Page 9, we've included guidance by business. We've increased and tightened the full-year sales outlook at both missiles and SAS. In addition, we tightened the full year sales range for IDS and IIS. 
Looking at margins. We've narrowed the margin guidance range for the company, raising the low end by 10 basis points from our prior guidance and now see operating margins to be in the range of 13.3% to 13.4% for the full year. At the business segment level, we now see the operating margin in the range of 12.7% to 12.8% for the full year. 
Before moving on to Page 10. As Tom mentioned earlier, given our year-to-date booking strength and our expectation for a solid fourth quarter, we are now raising our full-year 2016 bookings outlook to $26.5 billion plus or minus $500 million. This $500 million increase to the prior range is driven by strong demand from our global customers and positions us well for 2017. This marks our second consecutive $500 million quarterly increase to our bookings outlook. We expect international to be about 1/3 of total bookings for the year. 
On Page 10, we have provided guidance on how we currently see the fourth quarter for sales, earnings per share and operating cash flow from continuing operations. We still expect fourth quarter sales to be in the range of $6.4 billion to $6.7 billion, consistent with our prior guidance. It's important to note that the fourth quarter of 2016 has 4 fewer workdays than the comparable period last year, which has an impact to sales of approximately $100 million per day. 
EPS from continuing operations is now expected to be in a range of $1.68 to $1.78, reflecting the timing of performance improvements we achieved earlier than previously expected. 
Now turning to next year. As we've done in the past, we intend to provide detailed 2017 guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call in January. As we sit here today, we currently see strong sales growth for 2017 of 3% to 5% over the midpoint of our 2016 outlook. We expect segment margins to be up for 2017 compared to 2016, excluding the CRS transaction in 2016, which contributes about 70 basis points. 
We are well positioned going forward with further margin expansion over time both on the domestic side as new development franchise wins transition to production and on the international side as large production programs move through their life cycle. We expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 30% in 2017. In addition, we expect solid operating cash flow in 2017, slightly lower than 2016 as improvement from the businesses, as expected, is offset by higher cash taxes and required pension contributions. Of course, I want to caveat all this by saying our assumptions are based on the defense budget being approved in Washington before year end, thereby avoiding an extended CR or a government shutdown. 
Before moving on, I want to point out consistent with our public filings, that we plan to early adopt the revenue recognition standard in the first quarter of 2017. We do not expect the impact of adopting the new standard to be material to our results. 
So if you could please move to Page 11. We have provided a FAS/CAS pension adjustment matrix for 2017 as we've been in prior years. As a reminder, the range of outcomes shown are estimates. Actual results will be based on factors that are not determined until year-end; in particular, the final discount rate, the actual asset returns and the long-term return on asset assumption, all of which could impact the estimates on this matrix.
As we sit here today, the discount rate is approximately 75 basis points lower than it was at the end of 2015 and would be roughly 3.75%, and our return on assets through October 25 is a little above 5%. In addition, we have been seeing downward pressure on our long-term return on asset assumption driven by the most recent capital market expectations. Based on this, we currently see a potential reduction from 8% to a range of 7.25% to 7.5%. I would note that for each 25 basis points change in the assumption down to 7.25%, we would expect an additional $55 million reduction for the FAS/CAS Adjustment for 2017 compared to what you see on the chart.
On Page 12, we have provided an updated net cash from pension outlook as well as the prior outlook that we provided to you in January using the same discount rate and return assumption. It's worth noting that the net cash from pension in 2017 is now expected to be better compared to our prior outlook. And given our CAS prepayment balance of nearly $7 billion, we continue to expect CAS recovery to exceed contributions well into the next decade. Said another way, we expect pension to be a net positive contributor to cash flow over the next 10-plus years under current assumptions. Please note that all of these assumptions exclude us making any potential discretionary pension contributions. And just to be clear, the final discount rate, the actual asset returns and the long-term return on asset assumptions won't be known until we close out 2016. We'll provide a more detailed pension outlook on our January year-end call.
In summary, we saw a solid performance in the third quarter. Bookings were strong. Our sales and EPS were at or above our expectations, and our strong cash flow and balance sheet will allow us to continue to drive value for our customers and our shareholders. We are well positioned for continued growth in 2017.
With that, Tom and I will open the call up for questions."

Actually, we're very excited about Forcepoint because we are starting to see some significant moves in the marketplace. I mean they have a solid foundation. They have -- you mentioned it already, they probably have one of the largest federal groups of any of the competitors out there. In fact, I think a lot of the competitors wish they had as much federal access as we do into the cybersecurity market. And we sell in that federal group as a commercial company. That's one. You also did mention the next-generation firewall that they have that is off and running, getting a lot of traction on that. You can see the sales on that is up. And then also, in the core business, the TRITON cloud work is -- we're also starting to see significant movement in that. But the area I was trying to point out in my discussion is one of the other areas where we've taken I would call our defense-grade capabilities into the commercial cybersecurity marketplace. And that's really on the insider threat. And so we took our -- essentially our product which was what we call the SureView product. We're tying that together, integrating that with the data loss prevention capability that Websense brought along and some analytics on top of that, and providing an unbelievable capability to the marketplace relative to the advanced insider threat. And as you've probably been reading in the press, there's quite a bit of insider threat issues that are going on across the commercial industry along different verticals. So we're extremely happy with the performance. Toby's here. He's got the details, and he can just run you through what we saw here in the third quarter and what we're seeing in the future."

So we really saw growth across the entire portfolio with the exception, as we expected, we've been talking about the legacy Web Filtering business, which did continue to decline. Along those lines, I do want to take a second, and as Tom talked about and as we are evolving our strategic position to align with the cybersecurity market where we see the greatest opportunities, the legacy delineation when we've talked in the past about TRITON and the Web Filtering, even though I just kind of gave you some color on it, it is becoming less meaningful to us given our changes in the organization and our go-to-market approach around that. But again, growth across the entire portfolio, where we're focused strategically, if you roll that forward to Q4 from a top line perspective, we'd expect growth rates similar to Q3 on a year-over-year basis and margin that is higher. To your question, we'd be looking at margins in the 16-plus percent range for the fourth quarter. Obviously, we didn't change the outlook for the year, so we feel good that the team has a path forward there."

As I said in my comments, we knew about some certain radar programs and one international communications program that was winding down. So that was what we had assumed going back to the beginning of the year. But we are seeing a little bit of timing impact on a couple international programs but now expect it in late Q4, early Q1. So that's what's driving primarily the change -- what happened in the quarter relative to the revenue, the sales and then also for the total year. 
From a margin point of view, I think what you're seeing is consistent with what we've been saying that -- is that IDS towards the back half of the year has some of the -- and I wouldn't say they're completing, I would say some of the major production programs that we booked over the last couple of years are, from an execution point of view, moving through their life cycles. They're at points where we obviously feel comfortable in increasing the booking rates there. You saw strong margins from IDS back in Q2, excluding the TRS gain. We see it again here in Q3. So I think things -- from our perspective, things are playing out on the margin line at IDS pretty much as we would have expected, and if anything, a little bit more favorable timing. I think some of the improvements we saw in Q2 and 3, if we go back 3 or 6 months, we would have said, would have been in Q4 and 3. So things have maybe been accelerated within the year by about 90 days, but all good news from our perspective."

In terms of terms and conditions, we're really not seeing any changes in our contracting with the department or with the U.S. government. The department, as you know, is pushing more towards a fixed-price incentive fee construct on, I would call, production-type programs than they've had in the past. Something we're used to many years back, it's kind of rotated back in. So I think going through the initial iterations and making sure everybody understands that kind of a construct and then sets it up in a way that provides the contractors an incentive to do well, I think we're going through a little bit of transient on that, but it seems like it's settling out pretty quick. 
On the international side, we -- again, on the FMS contracts, we're not seeing much difference there relative to terms and conditions. Again, there is some issues relative to fixed-price incentive fee on production contracts. That's actually being debated in the halls of Congress. And right now, the NDAA has some language in it about the international production-type contracts, that being firm fixed price versus fixed-price incentive fee. And that's the only area that I see that's different. And our direct commercial sales, no difference there than we've had in the past."

And I think what I want to do is go back to this concept of buckets, and we're seeing these 3 demand areas. One is counterterrorism, counterinsurgency. The other bucket is deterrence, deterring a threat from taking action. And then there's a third bucket out there, which, I'm going to say, it's Third Offset strategy-type stuff, worrying about near-peer nation threats with advanced technologies. In Europe, the big one there is deterrence. We're seeing Eastern Europe very concerned in that area. And so they're looking for systems that will provide them that kind of a deterrence capability, and so we're seeing a lot of action on things like the Patriot System and then also our NASAMS system that we have at the nation's capital. And we had a sale in Oman and several other countries out there. So we're seeing significant pull for those deterrence-type systems in Europe. As we move to the Middle East, you're correct. I would say it's a little different in Middle East. It's a demand from both the counterinsurgency, counterterrorism bucket and then also the deterrence bucket. And on the counterinsurgency, I think you kind of understand that, that's some of the demand off-tempo pull here for precision weapons and some other ground systems that we have. On the deterrence side, I mean, there is a concern -- there is a neighbor of the GCC that the GCC is concerned about, and so you're getting into deterrence there, and therefore, you see the demand for systems like Patriot across the whole region. And so that's the deterrence bucket. 
And if we go over to the Asia-Pacific region, it's clear that it's -- and most of the effort there, demand signal is again coming from this deterrence bucket, looking for solutions like Patriot, advanced weapons, radars to be able to see things, ballistic missiles before they hit them. And so the Asia-Pacific region is in big demand on the deterrence. 
The third bucket is really coming directly from the Department of Defense, obviously, for all regions in the global area to be able to essentially come up from 20 years of fighting wars of insurgency to now dealing with near-peer threats that potentially have capabilities that are at or potentially some cases may be better or perceived to be better than what the U.S. has. And so it's a big catch-up area there. I mentioned -- we did mention on the call about significant increase in classified work. I think it's really addressing that bucket and to help the Department of Defense regain, in some cases, its superior capabilities over near-peer threats. And that's it."

It's not a signal one way or the other from my perspective. We're very pleased. The fact that we've been able to, for 2 quarters in a row, effectively, cumulatively, add $1 billion to the outlook for the year further strengthens the bookings and the demand that Tom was talking about. And I think, as we all know, the bookings in any given quarter, we can have some ups and downs or -- not my favorite word, but some lumpiness there. So we're very pleased with what we've seen through the first 9 months and the outlook for the total year and how it positions us going forward."

No. So again, I'll repeat a little bit here, Howard, the estimates that we gave you were to try to provide sensitivity around the variables that affect both the P&L side and the cash flow side of the equation. As a reminder, we will update all of this at year-end based upon how the year plays out. And things could be different compared to what we outlined today. But we did want to be transparent and let everybody know what we were seeing, both between the discount rate where the current year return is and based upon forward-looking relative to capital markets where the longer-term ROA would be. And I don't know that I can really add anything beyond the sensitivity that I gave in my prepared comments. You're right that cash flow is going to continue to be positive from pension. There were a lot of questions earlier this year and concerns about overall cash flow because of the higher required contributions in 2017. That's got better based upon our current estimates by close to $200 million. Our overall cash flow for the company next year, as I mentioned earlier, may be slightly lower than where we're looking at for this year but still very, very strong. And I think if you look out over time, while near term, we may have some headwind on pensions from a P&L point of view. For an EPS point of view in '17, we'd expect that over time, even under those lower rates that I talked about, that we would see improvement in that profile, a pattern that would be similar to what we were seeing in the past where year-over-year, the EPS would improve, all else equal, based upon even revised assumptions in '17, '18 -- beyond '17 into '18 and '19. So I think I'll leave it at that, and we'll move forward here."

So when George asked, I told him what kind of happened in Q3 and why we lowered a little bit the range of sales for the year, driven by the timing of some new awards that now we're expecting later in Q4 or early next year. But for Q4, from a sales point of view, even with that narrow guidance, we do expect solid growth in Q4. We have some other awards that we are anticipating will be starting up, which are contributing to that growth as well as some continued ramp on some international Patriot programs that are already in our backlog as they move through their life cycle there. So we have a path forward relative to the growth in IDS on the top line. From a margin perspective, I'll reiterate, we are really pleased with what -- with the margin at IDS both in Q2 and in Q3 here. As we had talked about before, we were expecting an improvement in the margin at IDS, more in the back half of the year. We've accelerated some of that into Q2 and here again in Q3. We did raise our margin guidance by 20 basis points on the high end at IDS to reflect our solid performance to date. And we continue to expect solid operational performance in Q4, about in line where we are year-to-date, okay, if you want to think of it this way, when you adjust for the TRS transaction. The improvements we're seeing, they can be lumpy as well, right, because they're specifically tied to programs, the execution of those programs and the timing of those events, which, in some cases, if not a lot of cases, aren't out of our control. And what we feel that we've done is we've de-risked that fourth quarter and the ramp that -- if you go back 90 days, 180 days, the ramp that we would have had in the fourth quarter."

As we talked about in the past, the balanced approach has worked well for us. We're continuing to use that here today and going forward. The underpinning to being able to do that is obviously strong cash flow generation and a strong balance sheet, both of which we have and we're focused on. So specifically, from kind of a priority perspective, we're always looking to invest in ourselves, in the business, to drive growth where it makes sense. That's not going to change. We'll pursue targeted acquisitions. I think Tom mentioned in his opening comments ones that fill technology market access, market channel type of gaps. I won't comment on rumors out there in the marketplace, but what I will say generically, we don't have as part of our plan to go after big deals, okay? That would be something strategic and opportunistic. We want to provide the right level of return to our shareholders, somewhere -- as we target 80% to 90% of current year cash flow that includes a competitive and sustainable dividend and the buyback. Obviously, to continue to reduce the diluted share count over time. And we do, as you know, make from time to time discretionary pension contributions. That said, let me reiterate because it has come up in the past relative to the thought about any large acquisitions, whether it be on the defense side and/or the commercial cyber side, that is not in our plan. So rumors are rumors that are out there, and I'll leave that at that."

There were also though a number of new centers like air missile defense radar, Next Generation Jammer, et cetera. I wanted to get your perspectives on this. Number one, from where you sit right now, do you see the Pentagon getting sufficient fundings so we can actually have a major recapitalization of military platforms and sensors? And also, as with the trainer, should we be expecting Raytheon to becoming more of a platform prime? Or is that more of an exception and you're thinking about being a major system prime on sensors and weapons? If we're on a long-term trend towards increased defense spending, I'm just trying to get a sense of how you guys are thinking about positioning Raytheon in that area."

Both parties and positions are that they want to remove the Budget Control Act caps, and so -- which will be required to be able to fund this you call it the recapitalization, but also some new capability needs as part of this Third Offset strategy. We are seeing funding going into that area. We did see in '16 the BCA was lifted, and also '17 is looking good in terms of its budget moving forward. The question was what will happen in '18, '19 and beyond, and then if that's really going to be the output of this election. Again, both parties are significantly supporting strong defense moving forward. So as long as the funds are there and that we have Congress supporting it, I see that we'll be able to support most of this recapitalization. It will have to be timed out so that they have enough money to cover it over the multiple years that these new systems take to come on board."

Let me -- I'll address margin, but let me maybe give you and everybody a few comments on '17 a little bit beyond what I mentioned earlier. And if I start at the front end of the business, we do continue to expect to see a solid book-to-bill ratio next year over 1, even on the higher sales volume, as I mentioned, which we see growing in the 3% to 5% range. I will say that this growth is more heavily weighted towards our missiles and SAS business, then followed by IDS and IIS. And we also see growth again both domestically and internationally next year. On the margin comment, I'm kind of going to stick to where I mentioned earlier that in '17, when you adjust for the TRS transaction this year at the segment level, we see segment-level margins improving. That said, obviously, we're not giving details by business at this point, but since you asked about IDS and historically, there's been a lot of focus there, what I will tell you is we do see meaningful improvement in the IDS margin next year, again, excluding the 2016 impact of TRS. Although I will say that for IDS, if you're thinking of 16% or above next year, that's probably too aggressive. And I'll just kind of leave it at that. 
I mentioned cash flow is going to continue to be strong. We do expect higher cash from the businesses, partially offsetting pension and higher cash taxes. On our tax rate, if you recall in '16, our effective tax rate is impacted by the TRS transaction, and the gain on that of just under $160 million was tax-free. So when I look at the tax rate for '17 right now, think of it around 30%, which is more in line where '16 would be, excluding TRS. And then you mentioned Forcepoint. I think what I'll say on Forcepoint, we still expect double-digit growth and double-digit margins from them next year.
