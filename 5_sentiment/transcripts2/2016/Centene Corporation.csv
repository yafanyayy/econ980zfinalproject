Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Centene's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2015 Earnings Call. I'd like to begin with an update on the status of the Health Net acquisition. We have made significant progress towards completing",1558,"Thank you, Ed. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Centene's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2015 Earnings Call. I'd like to begin with an update on the status of the Health Net acquisition. We have made significant progress towards completing this transaction. We have received all necessary approvals, with the exception in California, which remains pending. On January 22, Centene participated in a public hearing with the California Department of Insurance. We believe the meeting was informative, and there were no surprises. It was conducted in a professional and respectful manner and was part of what has been a fair, thorough process.  We continue to work through the process with the Department of Insurance and the Department of Managed Health Care and are finalizing our mutual agreements. We remain confident of a first quarter close. We have slightly adjusted our 2016 guidance to reflect a March 1 closing date for Health Net. Jeff will provide further details on this. 
I would like to take a moment to remind you of the rationale behind the Health Net acquisition. It is a significant step in our strategy to build critical mass and expertise within the government-sponsored health care category. When the deal closes, Centene will be a $40 billion-plus company. We will be the largest Medicaid managed care organization in the country and the leader in managed long-term support services. The addition of Health Net's Medicare Advantage platform, including its four-star rating, creates numerous opportunities within our existing markets, which we estimate to be in excess of $150 million. Health Net will increase our market presence to 15 states with total membership of approximately 500,000 individuals. There are significant opportunities to deploy Centene's specialty solutions across the Health Net platforms.  Health Net has been an innovator in value-based provider contracting and risk-sharing systems. Finally, the deal is 20% accretive in adjusted EPS in the first year following the close. 
The planning portion of Centene's comprehensive integration process is now largely completed. We have reorganized our management team to facilitate collaboration and efficiency. We will be ready to hit the ground running to begin executing the plan on the day it closes. 
Now shifting to fourth quarter and full year 2015 highlights. Centene ended 2015 in a strong, balanced and secure structural and financial position. What do I mean by this? Several months ago, when I questioned a single contract in one state, Bill Scheffel, our CFO for the next few days, commented, ""We are an aircraft carrier, and you don't throw aircraft carriers off course very easily."" Today, we are in 23 states, soon to be 24 with Nebraska. In these 23 states, we have 231 separate solutions, which are products or contracts. This diversity provides strength and stability. In other words, if one product in one state has an issue, rates, something of that nature, there are more than enough offset. Many of you will recognize that this has been our strategy from the beginning. 
Clearly, 2015 was a banner year for Centene. Our long-term growth strategy is intact. We continue to execute against our pipeline as evidenced by recent wins in Florida and Nebraska. We added over 1 million members, representing growth of 26% to 5.1 million beneficiaries. Premium and Service revenues increased 36% year-over-year to $21.3 billion. The HBR improved 40 basis points year-over-year to 88.9%. We reported diluted earnings per share of $2.89, or $3.03 when excluding $0.14 of Health Net merger-related expenses. This compares to $2.23 reported for full year 2014. The pretax margin, excluding merger costs, improved to 3.4% from 2.9% in 2014 and 2.6% in 2013. We remain committed to margin and future margin expansion with a targeted range of 3% to 5%. Bill will provide further financial details in his prepared remarks. 
A quick note on flu. Current indicators point to a slower start to the 2015-2016 flu season. It is, however, still too early to draw an absolute conclusion. Overall, we continue to see as well as anticipate stable medical cost trends. 
Next, market and product updates. First, we'll discuss recent Medicaid activity. 
Nebraska. We were pleased to be selected last week as 1 of 3 managed care organizations to administer Nebraska's Heritage Health program. Heritage Health is a new health care delivery system that combines the state's current physical health, the Hagel Health and pharmacy programs, into a single comprehensive and coordinated system. This program covers 230 Medicaid and CHIP enrollees. Centene will operate statewide in Nebraska, which marks our 24th state of operations. The contract is expected to commence on January 1, 2017, and we expect a normal margin ramp. This entry point provides future opportunities in the state, such as long-term care. 
Arizona. The fourth quarter was our first full quarter providing services under the expanded contract for Arizona's newly formed southern region. Membership in Arizona doubled over the third quarter of 2015. At December 31, we served approximately 441,000 beneficiaries in the state. 
Mississippi. Mississippi became a $1 billion market for Centene in 2015. In December, we began managing inpatient services for Medicaid and ABD members in the state. We ended the year with 302,000 lives. This compares to 109,000 at the end of 2014. 
Louisiana. Louisiana also became a $1 billion market in 2015. During the year, we executed a successful acquisition and integration in the state. We more than doubled our at-risk membership to 382,000 lives. In December, we further expanded our Louisiana contract to begin including behavioral health benefits. The carving of additional benefits in Mississippi and Louisiana is consistent with Centene's holistic approach to provide integrated care for its members. 
Oregon. The fourth quarter marked the first full quarter of operations for our Trillium subsidiary, which provides Medicaid, Medicare Advantage and marketplace services to Oregon residents. Membership at year-end was approximately 100,000. While it's still early, Trillium is performing in line with our expectations. 
Now on to dual eligibles. We ended the fourth quarter with 26,300 members across our 5 dual demonstration contracts. We continue to work with our state providers in CMS to make these programs successful and sustainable. I'll remind you that we have always taken the view that the dual demonstration programs would not be a significant near-term growth driver for Centene. 
Next, Medicaid expansion. We ended 2015 with almost 450,000 Medicaid expansion members, more than double that at what was at the end of 2014. In January, the Governor of Louisiana signed an executive order to expand Medicaid coverage under ACA by July 1, 2016. This represents a future growth opportunity for Centene, given our status as the largest Medicaid health plan in the state. We have not yet included the Louisiana expansion in our 2016 financial guidance. We will provide an update when additional information becomes available. 
Health Insurance Marketplaces. Our exchange experience continues to be favorable. 92% of our membership is subsidy-eligible, and we are achieving margins within our targeted range. We have taken a disciplined approach to pricing from day 1. In fact, the aggregate in each of Centene's states reflected a payable position for both 2014 and 2015 for the 3Rs program. This approach has allowed us to grow profitably from 75,000 members in 9 states in 2014 to over 146,000 members in 12 states in 2015. Please note we have not been impacted by special enrollment periods. 
For 2016, we expanded into a 13th state, New Hampshire. We have also increased our geographic footprint in certain of our other 12 states. Enrollment so far in 2016 is in line or ahead of expectations. The demographics of these new members are consistent with previous years and over 90% are subsidy-eligible. Our pricing and underwriting is also in line with prior years, and we are not reliant on risk orders. 
Centurion. We continue to successfully expand our correctional health business. Last week, Centurion reached a formal agreement with the Florida Department of Corrections to provide comprehensive health care services to over 70,000 inmates throughout the 3 regions. The contract was awarded to an accelerated gap procurement. It was structured as a cost-plus arrangement with a maximum $267 million in annual revenue. Centurion was the only awardee. This contract is expected to commence in the second quarter of 2016 and runs through January of 2018. 
Shifting gears, our rate outlook. [ph] The 2015 composite rate adjustment was approximately 1%, in line with our expectations. Composite rate adjustments have been consistent for the past few years. We expect a similar composite rate adjustment in 2016. 
In conclusion, our strong 2015 results reaffirm our growth momentum for 2016 and beyond. As we begin this new year, we are at a good place both financially and strategically. With the additional products and capabilities Health Net provides, our [indiscernible] pipeline is bigger than ever. We are well positioned to gain market share in the government-sponsored health care space, the fastest-growing category in the industry. 
Thank you for your interest in Centene. Before I turn the call over to Bill, I want to thank him for his years of dedicated service. As previously announced, he will be retiring at the end of the month after the K is filed. You will now witness part of that turnover. Bill will cover 2015 information, and Jeff will pick up and report information relative to 2016. 
Bill, I turn it over to you."
26273,321591830,928864,"Centene Corp., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2016",2016-02-09,"Earnings Calls","Centene Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. This morning, we will cover both our fourth quarter and full year 2015 results. For the fourth quarter, Premium and Service revenues were $5.9 billion, an increase of 33% over the fourth quarter of 2014, and",889,"Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. This morning, we will cover both our fourth quarter and full year 2015 results. For the fourth quarter, Premium and Service revenues were $5.9 billion, an increase of 33% over the fourth quarter of 2014, and diluted earnings per share, excluding Health Net merger costs, were $0.95 compared to $0.87 last year. And as you will recall, last year's fourth quarter included a $0.24 benefit from recording the health insurer fee reimbursement for Texas for all of 2014 in the fourth quarter. 
Looking at the full year for 2015. Membership was 5.1 million members, an increase of 26% between years. Premium and Service revenues were $21.3 billion, an increase of 36%. Earnings from operations were $705 million, that's an increase of 52% and diluted earnings per share, excluding Health Net merger costs, was $3.03, an increase of 36% between years and well above our most recent guidance numbers of $2.90 [ph] to $2.94. In more detail, Premium and Service revenues grew by $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter year-over-year, primarily as a result of the expansions for new programs in many of our states. During the fourth quarter, [indiscernible] newly added revenue in several areas. We began an expanded contract in the southern region of Arizona on October 1, became health services for a [indiscernible] in Louisiana, beginning December 1. Inpatient services were added Mississippi beginning December 1. And the fourth quarter included a full quarter of operations in Oregon related to our acquisition of [indiscernible] in September. We also benefited from the addition of almost 250,000 more Medicaid expansion members at this year-end compared to last year. 
During 2015, we recognized $344 million in revenue associated with the health insurer fee compared to $195 million in 2014. For both years, the revenue recorded covers virtually all of the health insurer fee on a grossed-up basis for tax purposes. 
Our health benefits ratio was 88.0% in fourth quarter of this year compared to 89.3% in last year's fourth quarter and 89.0% in the third quarter. The 130 basis point decrease year-over-year results from improvement in the overall HBR from higher acuity membership, particularly long-term care, premium increases in adjustments and a milder flu season in the fourth quarter of this year. Sequentially, the 100 basis point improvement in the third quarter reflects rate increases and adjustments received during the third and fourth quarters. For the fourth quarter, 20% of Premium and Service revenues came from new business compared to 30% in the fourth quarter of 2014. The health benefits ratio for new business was 88.2% and existing business was 88.0% in the fourth quarter, both of which are decreases of 120 basis points between years. 
The health insurance marketplace product has performed well for us in 2014 and 2015, reflecting our disciplined strategy to focus on subsidized members familiar with our provider network. This same methodology and process was used for 2016 as well. Similar to last year-end, we continue to be in a payable position for the risk corridor and risk adjustment components of the 3Rs. And we also have a payable at year-end recorded for the minimum loss ratio for the Health Insurance Marketplace business. For the 2014 plan year, we have settled the 3R amounts and paid the rebates related to the minimum loss ratio. 
Our general and administrative expense ratio was 8.8% in Q4 of this year, 8.7% without Health Net merger cost, compared to 8.2% last year and 8.2% in the third quarter, also excluding Health Net merger cost. The increase in the fourth quarter this year, both year-over-year and sequentially, reflects a higher level of seasonal costs related to the open enrollment period for the marketplace exchange product and higher amounts of variable compensation products. Excluding Health Net merger costs, business exchange cost is [indiscernible] in the third [ph] quarter and $0.23 from all of 2015. 
Investment and other income was $8 million for the fourth quarter compared to $10 million last year and $8 million in the third quarter. Interest expense was $11 million this year compared to $10 million last year and $11 million in the third quarter. Our effective income tax rate was 48.4% in the fourth quarter and 48.6% for all of 2015. The relatively high rate reflects the nondeductible nature of the health insurer fee. 
Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the fourth quarter was $0.91, $0.95 excluding the Health Net merger cost. For the full year 2015, our EPS was $2.89, or $3.03 excluding the merger cost. 
Cash and investments totaled almost $4 billion at year-end, including $78 million held by unregulated subsidiaries, and our risk-based capital percentage continues to be in excess of 350% of the authorized control level. 
Debt on December 31 was $1.2 billion, including $225 million of borrowings on our revolver. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 34.7%, excluding our nonrecourse mortgage note compared to 71.7% [ph] at last year-end. Our backup claims liability totaled $2.3 billion at December 31 and represent 44.3 days in claims payable. The cash flow from operations was $201 million in the fourth quarter and $658 million for the full year. Both amounts approximate 1.8x net earnings, which is consistent with our expected range of 1.5 to 2.0x net earnings. 
Now for 2016, Jeffrey Schwaneke will discuss our 2016 guidance number."

I would like to spend a few minutes to discuss our combined guidance for 2016. In our press release this morning reporting our full year results for 2015, we've also included our 2016 annual guidance. The guidance has be",578,"Thank you, Bill, and good morning. I would like to spend a few minutes to discuss our combined guidance for 2016. In our press release this morning reporting our full year results for 2015, we've also included our 2016 annual guidance. The guidance has been adjusted for the following items: first, we have changed our assumption with respect to the closing date of the Health Net transaction. We are now assuming the transaction closes on March 1. While this does not impact our run rate revenues or earnings, it does change the number of months of Health Net we are able to include in the consolidated financial statements for 2016. As mentioned in our December Investor Day, 1 month of Health Net revenue is approximately $1.3 billion. The March 1 closing date is an assumption we have made for guidance purposes, and the transaction remains subject to regulatory approval in California. The actual closing date of the Health Net transaction will determine the number of months and days of Health Net results that will be included in our consolidated financial statements for 2016. 
Second, we recently announced the pricing of $2.4 billion of senior unsecured debt in connection with the Health Net transaction and have updated our assumptions with respect to interest expense. Consistent with what we have done in the past in matching our balance sheet exposure to short-term interest rates, we intend to swap up to approximately $1.6 billion of the senior debt to a floating rate of interest at transaction closing. Since we have not entered into the interest rate swap agreements, the ultimate interest rate of the transaction financing will continue to fluctuate. 
Third, we have adjusted our range on Health Net merger-related expenses, which will continue to change until closing, and have reduced the guidance range for the amortization of intangible assets associated with acquisitions by 1 month to reflect the assumed March 1 closing date. 
And finally, we have updated our guidance to include the recent contract award for Centurion in Florida. 
As a result of all these items for 2016, our combined guidance is as follows: total revenues of $40 billion to $40.8 billion; GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.80 to $3.15; adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.05 to $4.40; adjusted diluted earnings per share excludes the amortization of intangible assets associated with acquisitions, which we estimate to be between $0.50 and $0.55 per share, and Health Net-related merger expenses, which we estimate to be between $0.70 and $0.75 per diluted share, with both items reflecting the revised closing date assumption. We have adjusted the bottom end of our diluted earnings per share guidance range to reflect the 1-month delay in the assumed closing date of the Health Net transaction. For 2016, we expect approximately 45% of our annual adjusted diluted earnings per share to be earned in the first half of the year, and we expect the first quarter to be lower than the second quarter due to seasonality of the business, the extra day from leap year and only including 1 month of Health Net in our consolidated results for the first quarter. Additionally, our guidance assumes no receivables for the risk corridor program and a payable for the risk adjustment program in 2016. We will provide further details on our 2016 guidance after regulatory approval and the closing of the Health Net transaction.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Centene's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2015 Earnings Call. I'd like to begin with an update on the status of the Health Net acquisition. We have made significant progress towards completing",1555,"Thank you, Ed. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Centene's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2015 Earnings Call. I'd like to begin with an update on the status of the Health Net acquisition. We have made significant progress towards completing this transaction. We have received all necessary approvals, with the exception in California, which remains pending. On January 22, Centene participated in a public hearing with the California Department of Insurance. We believe the meeting was informative, and there were no surprises. It was conducted in a professional and respectful manner, and was part of what has been a fair, thorough process. We continue to work through the process with the Department of Insurance and the Department of Managed Health Care and are finalizing our mutual agreements. We remain confident of a first quarter close. We have slightly adjusted our 2016 guidance to reflect a March 1 closing date for Health Net. Jeff will provide further details on this. 
I would like to take a moment to remind you of the rationale behind the Health Net acquisition. It is a significant step in our strategy to build critical mass and expertise within the government-sponsored healthcare category. When the deal closes, Centene will be a $40-plus billion company. We will be the largest Medicaid managed care organization in the country and the leader in managed long-term support services. The addition of Health Net's Medicare Advantage platform, including its four-star rating, creates numerous opportunities within our existing markets, which we estimate to be in excess of $150 million. Health Net will increase our market presence to 15 states with total membership of approximately 500,000 individuals. There are significant opportunities to deploy Centene's specialty solutions across the Health Net platforms. Health Net has been an innovator in value-based provider contracting and risk-sharing systems. Finally, the deal is 20% accretive in adjusted EPS in the first year following the close. 
The planning portion of Centene's comprehensive integration process is now largely completed. We have reorganized our management team to facilitate collaboration and efficiency. We will be ready to hit the ground running to begin executing the plan on the day it closes. 
Now shifting to fourth quarter and full year 2015 highlights. Centene ended 2015 in a strong, balanced and secure structural and financial position. What do I mean by this? Several months ago, when I questioned a single contract in one state, Bill Scheffel, our CFO for the next few days, commented, ""We are an aircraft carrier, and you don't throw aircraft carriers off course very easily."" Today, we are in 23 states, soon to be 24 with Nebraska. In these 23 states, we have 231 separate solutions, which were products for contracts. This diversity provides strength and stability. In other words, if one product in one state has an issue, rate, something of that nature, there are more than enough offset. Many of you will recognize that this has been our strategy from the beginning. 
Clearly, 2015 was a banner year for Centene. Our long-term growth strategy is intact. We continue to execute against our pipeline as evidenced by recent wins in Florida and Nebraska. We added over 1 million members, representing growth of 26% to 5.1 million beneficiaries. Premium and Service revenues increased 36% year-over-year to $21.3 billion. The HBR improved 40 basis points year-over-year to 88.9%. We reported diluted earnings per share of $2.89 or $3.03 when excluding $0.14 of Health Net merger-related expenses. This compares to $2.23 reported for full year 2014. The pretax margin, excluding merger costs, improved to 3.4% from 2.9% in 2014 and 2.6% in 2013. We remain committed to margin and future margin expansion with a targeted range of 3% to 5%. Bill will provide further financial details in his prepared remarks. 
A quick note on flu. Current indicators point to a slower start to the 2015-2016 flu season. It is, however, still too early to draw an absolute conclusion. Overall, we continue to see as well as anticipate stable medical cost trends. 
Next, market and product updates. First, we'll discuss recent Medicaid activity. 
Nebraska. We were pleased to be selected last week as 1 of 3 managed care organizations to administer Nebraska's Heritage Health program. Heritage Health is a new healthcare delivery system that combines the state's current physical health, behavioral Health and pharmacy programs, into a single comprehensive and coordinated system. This program covers 230 Medicaid and CHIP enrollees. Centene will operate statewide in Nebraska, which marks our 24th state of operations. The contract is expected to commence on January 1, 2017, and we expect a normal margin ramp. This entry point provides future opportunities in the state, such as long-term care. 
Arizona. The fourth quarter was our first full quarter providing services under the expanded contract for Arizona's newly formed southern region. Membership in Arizona doubled over the third quarter of 2015. At December 31, we served approximately 441,000 beneficiaries in the state. 
Mississippi. Mississippi became a $1 billion market for Centene in 2015. In December, we began managing inpatient services for Medicaid and ABD members in the state. We ended the year with 302,000 lives. This compares to 109,000 at the end of 2014. 
Louisiana. Louisiana also became a $1 billion market in 2015. During the year, we executed a successful acquisition and integration in the state. We more than doubled our at-risk membership to 382,000 lives. In December, we further expanded our Louisiana contract to begin including behavioral health benefits. The carving of additional benefits in Mississippi and Louisiana is consistent with Centene's holistic approach to provide integrated care for its members. 
Oregon. The fourth quarter marked the first full quarter of operations for our Trillium subsidiary, which provides Medicaid, Medicare Advantage and marketplace services to Oregon residents. Membership at year-end was approximately 100,000. While it's still early, Trillium is performing in line with our expectations. 
Now on to dual eligibles. We ended the fourth quarter with 26,300 members across our 5 dual demonstration contracts. We continue to work with our state providers and CMS to make these programs successful and sustainable. I remind you that we have always taken the view that the dual demonstration programs would not be a significant near-term growth driver for Centene. 
Next, Medicaid expansion. We ended 2015 with almost 450,000 Medicaid expansion members, more than double that at -- of what was at the end of 2014. In January, the Governor of Louisiana signed an executive order to expand Medicaid coverage under ACA by July 1, 2016. This represents a future growth opportunity for Centene, given our status as the largest Medicaid health plan in the state. We have not yet included the Louisiana expansion in our 2016 financial guidance. We will provide an update when additional information becomes available. 
Health Insurance Marketplaces. Our exchange experience continues to be favorable. 92% of our membership is subsidy-eligible, and we are achieving margins within our targeted range. We have taken a disciplined approach to pricing from day 1. In fact, the aggregate in each of Centene's states reflected a payable position for both 2014 and 2015 for the 3Rs program. This approach has allowed us to grow profitably from 75,000 members in 9 states in 2014 to over 146,000 members in 12 states in 2015. Please note we have not been impacted by special enrollment periods. 
For 2016, we expanded into a 13th state, New Hampshire. We have also increased our geographic footprint in certain of our other 12 states. Enrollment so far in 2016 is in line or ahead of expectations. The demographics of these new members are consistent with previous years and over 90% are subsidy-eligible. Our pricing and underwriting is also in line with prior years, and we are not reliant on risk orders. 
Centurion. We continue to successfully expand our correctional health business. Last week, Centurion reached a formal agreement with the Florida Department of Corrections to provide comprehensive healthcare services to over 70,000 inmates throughout the 3 regions. The contract was awarded to an accelerated GAAP procurement. It was structured as a cost-plus arrangement with a maximum $267 million in annual revenue. Centurion was the only awardee. This contract is expected to commence in the second quarter of 2016 and runs through January of 2018. 
Shifting gears, our rate outlook. The 2015 composite rate adjustment was approximately 1%, in line with our expectations. Composite rate adjustments have been consistent for the past few years. We expect a similar composite rate adjustment in 2016. 
In conclusion, our strong 2015 results reaffirm our growth momentum for 2016 and beyond. As we begin this new year, we are at a good grace [ph], both financially and strategically. With the additional products and capabilities Health Net provides, our growth pipeline is bigger than ever. We are well positioned to gain market share in the government-sponsored healthcare space, the fastest-growing category in the industry. 
Thank you for your interest in Centene. Before I turn the call over to Bill, I want to thank him for his years of dedicated service. As previously announced, he will be retiring at the end of the month after the K is filed. You will now witness part of that turnover. Bill will cover 2015 information, and Jeff will pick up and report information relative to 2016. 
Bill, I turn it over to you."
26273,321591830,929225,"Centene Corp., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2016",2016-02-09,"Earnings Calls","Centene Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. This morning, we will cover both our fourth quarter and full year 2015 results. For the fourth quarter, Premium and Service revenues were $5.9 billion, an increase of 33% over the fourth quarter of 2014, and",890,"Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. This morning, we will cover both our fourth quarter and full year 2015 results. For the fourth quarter, Premium and Service revenues were $5.9 billion, an increase of 33% over the fourth quarter of 2014, and diluted earnings per share, excluding Health Net merger costs, were $0.95 compared to $0.87 last year. And as you will recall, last year's fourth quarter included a $0.24 benefit from recording the health insurer fee reimbursement for Texas for all of 2014 in the fourth quarter. 
Looking at the full year for 2015. Membership was 5.1 million members, an increase of 26% between years. Premium and Service revenues were $21.3 billion, an increase of 36%. Earnings from operations were $705 million, with increase of 52% and diluted earnings per share, excluding Health Net merger costs, was $3.03, an increase of 36% between years and well above our most recent guidance numbers of $2.90 [ph] to $2.94. In more detail, Premium and Service revenues grew by $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter year-over-year, primarily as a result of the expansions or new programs in many of our states. During the fourth quarter, [indiscernible] newly added revenue in several areas. We began and expanded contract in the southern region of Arizona on October 1, became health services for [indiscernible] in Louisiana, beginning December 1. Inpatient services were added in Mississippi beginning December 1. And the fourth quarter included a full quarter of operations in Oregon relating to our acquisition of [indiscernible] in September. We also benefited from the addition of almost 250,000 more Medicaid expansion members at this year-end compared to last year. 
During 2015, we recognized $344 million in revenue associated with the health insurer fee compared to $195 million in 2014. For both years, the revenue recorded covers virtually all of the health insurer fee on a grossed-up basis for tax purposes. 
Our health benefits ratio was 88.0% in fourth quarter of this year compared to 89.3% in last year's fourth quarter and 89.0% in the third quarter. The 130 basis point decrease year-over-year results from improvement in the overall HBR from higher acuity membership, particularly long-term care, premium increases in adjustments and a milder flu season in the fourth quarter of this year. Sequentially, the 100 basis point improvement in the third quarter reflects rate increases and adjustments received during the third and fourth quarters. For the fourth quarter, 20% of Premium and Service revenues came from new business compared to 30% in the fourth quarter of 2014. The health benefits ratio of our new business was 88.2% and existing business was 88.0% in the fourth quarter, both of which are decreases of 120 basis points between years. 
The health insurance marketplace product has performed well for us in 2014 and 2015, reflecting our disciplined strategy to focus on subsidized members familiar with our provider network. This same methodology and process was used for 2016 as well. Similar to last year-end, we continue to be in a payable position for the risk corridor and risk adjustment components of the 3Rs. And we also have a payable at year-end recorded for the minimum loss ratio for the Health Insurance Marketplace business. For the 2014 plan year, we have settled the 3R amounts and paid the rebates related to the minimum loss ratio. 
Our general and administrative expense ratio was 8.8% in Q4 of this year, 8.7% without Health Net merger cost, compared to 8.2% last year and 8.2% in the third quarter, also excluding Health Net merger cost. The increase in the fourth quarter of this year, both year-over-year and sequentially, reflects a higher level of seasonal costs related to the open enrollment period for the marketplace exchange product and higher amounts of variable compensation products. Excluding Health Net merger costs, business expansion costs [indiscernible] third and the fourth quarter and $0.23 for all of 2015. 
Investment and other income was $8 million for the fourth quarter compared to $10 million last year and $8 million in the third quarter. Interest expense was $11 million this year compared to $10 million last year and $11 million in the third quarter. Our effective income tax rate was 48.4% in the fourth quarter and 48.6% for all of 2015. The relatively high rate reflects the nondeductible nature of the health insurer fee. 
Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the fourth quarter was $0.91, $0.95 excluding the Health Net merger cost. For the full year 2015, our EPS was $2.89 or $3.03 excluding the merger cost. 
Cash and investments totaled almost $4 billion at year-end, including $78 million held by unregulated subsidiaries, and our risk-based capital percentage continues to be in excess of 350% of the authorized control level. 
Debt on December 31 was $1.2 billion, including $225 million of borrowings on our revolver. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 34.7%, excluding our nonrecourse mortgage note compared to 71.7% at last year-end. Medical claims liability totaled $2.3 billion at December 31 and represent 44.3 days in claims payable. The cash flow from operations was $201 million in the fourth quarter and $658 million for the full year. Both amounts to approximate 1.8x net earnings, which is consistent with our expected range of 1.5 to 2.0x net earnings. 
Now for 2016, Jeff Schwaneke will discuss our 2016 guidance number for you."

I would like to spend a few minutes to discuss our combined guidance for 2016. In our press release this morning reporting our full year results for 2015, we've also included our 2016 annual guidance. The guidance has be",579,"Thank you, Bill, and good morning. I would like to spend a few minutes to discuss our combined guidance for 2016. In our press release this morning reporting our full year results for 2015, we've also included our 2016 annual guidance. The guidance has been adjusted for the following items: First, we have changed our assumption with respect to the closing date of the Health Net transaction. We are now assuming the transaction closes on March 1. While this does not impact our run rate revenues or earnings, it does change the number of months of Health Net we are able to include in the consolidated financial statements for 2016. As mentioned in our December Investor Day, 1 month of Health Net revenue is approximately $1.3 billion. The March 1 closing date is an assumption we have made for guidance purposes, and the transaction remains subject to regulatory approval in California. The actual closing date of the Health Net transaction will determine the number of months and days of Health Net results that will be included in our consolidated financial statements for 2016; second, we recently announced the pricing of $2.4 billion of senior unsecured debt in connection with the Health Net transaction and have updated our assumptions with respect to interest expense. Consistent with what we have done in the past in matching our balance sheet exposure to short-term interest rates, we intend to swap up to approximately $1.6 billion of the senior debt to a floating rate of interest at transaction closing. Since we have not entered into the interest rate swap agreements, the ultimate interest rate of the transaction financing will continue to fluctuate; third, we have adjusted our range on Health Net merger-related expenses, which will continue to change until closing, and have reduced the guidance range for the amortization of intangible assets associated with acquisitions by 1 month to reflect the assumed March 1 closing date. 
And finally, we have updated our guidance to include the recent contract award for Centurion in Florida. 
As a result of all these items for 2016, our combined guidance is as follows: total revenues of $40 billion to $40.8 billion; GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.80 to $3.15; adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.05 to $4.40; adjusted diluted earnings per share excludes the amortization of intangible assets associated with acquisitions, which we estimate to be between $0.50 and $0.55 per share, and Health Net related merger expenses, which we estimate to be between $0.70 and $0.75 per diluted share, with both items reflecting the revised closing date assumption. We have adjusted the bottom end of our diluted earnings per share guidance range to reflect the 1-month delay in the assumed closing date of the Health Net transaction. For 2016, we expect approximately 45% of our annual adjusted diluted earnings per share to be earned in the first half of the year, and we expect the first quarter to be lower than the second quarter due to seasonality of the business, the extra day from leap year and only including 1 month of Health Net in our consolidated results for the first quarter. Additionally, our guidance assumes no receivables for the risk corridor program and a payable for the risk adjustment program in 2016. We will provide further details on our 2016 guidance after regulatory approval and the closing of the Health Net transaction.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Centene's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2015 Earnings Call. I'd like to begin with an update on the status of the Health Net acquisition. We have made significant progress towards completing",1554,"Thank you, Ed. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Centene's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2015 Earnings Call. I'd like to begin with an update on the status of the Health Net acquisition. We have made significant progress towards completing this transaction. We have received all necessary approvals, with the exception in California, which remains pending. On January 22, Centene participated in a public hearing with the California Department of Insurance. We believe the meeting was informative, and there were no surprises. It was conducted in a professional and respectful manner, and was part of what has been a fair, thorough process. We continue to work through the process with the Department of Insurance and the Department of Managed Health Care and are finalizing our mutual agreements. We remain confident of a first quarter close. We have slightly adjusted our 2016 guidance to reflect a March 1 closing date for Health Net. Jeff will provide further details on this. 
I would like to take a moment to remind you of the rationale behind the Health Net acquisition. It is a significant step in our strategy to build critical mass and expertise within the government-sponsored healthcare category. When the deal closes, Centene will be a $40-plus billion company. We will be the largest Medicaid managed care organization in the country and the leader in managed long-term support services. The addition of Health Net's Medicare Advantage platform, including its four-star rating, creates numerous opportunities within our existing markets, which we estimate to be in excess of $150 million. Health Net will increase our market presence to 15 states with total membership of approximately 500,000 individuals. There are significant opportunities to deploy Centene's specialty solutions across the Health Net platforms. Health Net has been an innovator in value-based provider contracting and risk-sharing systems. Finally, the deal is 20% accretive in adjusted EPS in the first year following the close. 
The planning portion of Centene's comprehensive integration process is now largely completed. We have reorganized our management team to facilitate collaboration and efficiency. We will be ready to hit the ground running to begin executing the plan on the day it closes. 
Now shifting to fourth quarter and full year 2015 highlights. Centene ended 2015 in a strong, balanced and secure structural and financial position. What do I mean by this? Several months ago, when I questioned a single contract in one state, Bill Scheffel, our CFO for the next few days, commented, ""We are an aircraft carrier, and you don't throw aircraft carriers off course very easily."" Today, we are in 23 states, soon to be 24 with Nebraska. In these 23 states, we have 231 separate solutions, which are products or contracts. This diversity provides strength and stability. In other words, if one product in one state has an issue, rate, something of that nature, there are more than enough offset. Many of you will recognize that this has been our strategy from the beginning. 
Clearly, 2015 was a banner year for Centene. Our long-term growth strategy is intact. We continue to execute against our pipeline as evidenced by recent wins in Florida and Nebraska. We added over 1 million members, representing growth of 26% to 5.1 million beneficiaries. Premium and Service revenues increased 36% year-over-year to $21.3 billion. The HBR improved 40 basis points year-over-year to 88.9%. We reported diluted earnings per share of $2.89 or $3.03 when excluding $0.14 of Health Net merger-related expenses. This compares to $2.23 reported for full year 2014. The pretax margin, excluding merger costs, improved to 3.4% from 2.9% in 2014 and 2.6% in 2013. We remain committed to margin and future margin expansion with a targeted range of 3% to 5%. Bill will provide further financial details in his prepared remarks. 
A quick note on flu. Current indicators point to a slower start to the 2015-2016 flu season. It is, however, still too early to draw an absolute conclusion. Overall, we continue to see as well as anticipate stable medical cost trends. 
Next, market and product updates. First, we'll discuss recent Medicaid activity. 
Nebraska. We were pleased to be selected last week as 1 of 3 managed care organizations to administer Nebraska's Heritage Health program. Heritage Health is a new healthcare delivery system that combines the state's current physical health, behavioral Health and pharmacy programs, into a single comprehensive and coordinated system. This program covers 230 Medicaid and CHIP enrollees. Centene will operate statewide in Nebraska, which marks our 24th state of operations. The contract is expected to commence on January 1, 2017, and we expect a normal margin ramp. This entry point provides future opportunities in the state, such as long-term care. 
Arizona. The fourth quarter was our first full quarter providing services under the expanded contract for Arizona's newly formed southern region. Membership in Arizona doubled over the third quarter of 2015. At December 31, we served approximately 441,000 beneficiaries in the state. 
Mississippi. Mississippi became a $1 billion market for Centene in 2015. In December, we began managing inpatient services for Medicaid and ABD members in the state. We ended the year with 302,000 lives. This compares to 109,000 at the end of 2014. 
Louisiana. Louisiana also became a $1 billion market in 2015. During the year, we executed a successful acquisition and integration in the state. We more than doubled our at-risk membership to 382,000 lives. In December, we further expanded our Louisiana contract to begin including behavioral health benefits. The carve-in of additional benefits in Mississippi and Louisiana is consistent with Centene's holistic approach to provide integrated care for its members. 
Oregon. The fourth quarter marked the first full quarter of operations for our Trillium subsidiary, which provides Medicaid, Medicare Advantage and marketplace services to Oregon residents. Membership at year-end was approximately 100,000. While it's still early, Trillium is performing in line with our expectations. 
Now on to dual eligibles. We ended the fourth quarter with 26,300 members across our 5 dual demonstration contracts. We continue to work with our state providers and CMS to make these programs successful and sustainable. I remind you that we have always taken the view that the dual demonstration programs would not be a significant near-term growth driver for Centene. 
Next, Medicaid expansion. We ended 2015 with almost 450,000 Medicaid expansion members, more than double that at -- of what was at the end of 2014. In January, the Governor of Louisiana signed an executive order to expand Medicaid coverage under ACA by July 1, 2016. This represents a future growth opportunity for Centene, given our status as the largest Medicaid health plan in the state. We have not yet included the Louisiana expansion in our 2016 financial guidance. We will provide an update when additional information becomes available. 
Health Insurance Marketplaces. Our exchange experience continues to be favorable. 92% of our membership is subsidy-eligible, and we are achieving margins within our targeted range. We have taken a disciplined approach to pricing from day 1. In fact, the aggregate in each of Centene's states reflected a payable position for both 2014 and 2015 for the 3Rs program. This approach has allowed us to grow profitably from 75,000 members in 9 states in 2014 to over 146,000 members in 12 states in 2015. Please note we have not been impacted by special enrollment periods. 
For 2016, we expanded into a 13th state, New Hampshire. We have also increased our geographic footprint in certain of our other 12 states. Enrollment so far in 2016 is in line or ahead of expectations. The demographics of these new members are consistent with previous years and over 90% are subsidy-eligible. Our pricing and underwriting is also in line with prior years, and we are not reliant on risk orders. 
Centurion. We continue to successfully expand our correctional health business. Last week, Centurion reached a formal agreement with the Florida Department of Corrections to provide comprehensive healthcare services to over 70,000 inmates throughout the 3 regions. The contract was awarded through an accelerated GAAP procurement. It was structured as a cost-plus arrangement with a maximum $267 million in annual revenue. Centurion was the only awardee. This contract is expected to commence in the second quarter of 2016 and runs through January of 2018. 
Shifting gears, our rate outlook. The 2015 composite rate adjustment was approximately 1%, in line with our expectations. Composite rate adjustments have been consistent for the past few years. We expect a similar composite rate adjustment in 2016. 
In conclusion, our strong 2015 results reaffirm our growth momentum for 2016 and beyond. As we begin this new year, we are at a good place, both financially and strategically. With the additional products and capabilities Health Net provides, our growth pipeline is bigger than ever. We are well positioned to gain market share in the government-sponsored healthcare space, the fastest-growing category in the industry. 
Thank you for your interest in Centene. Before I turn the call over to Bill, I want to thank him for his years of dedicated service. As previously announced, he will be retiring at the end of the month after the K is filed. You will now witness part of that turnover. Bill will cover 2015 information, and Jeff will pick up and report information relative to 2016. 
Bill, I turn it over to you."
26273,321591830,929374,"Centene Corp., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2016",2016-02-09,"Earnings Calls","Centene Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. This morning, we will cover both our fourth quarter and full year 2015 results. For the fourth quarter, Premium and Service revenues were $5.9 billion, an increase of 33% over the fourth quarter of 2014, and",892,"Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. This morning, we will cover both our fourth quarter and full year 2015 results. For the fourth quarter, Premium and Service revenues were $5.9 billion, an increase of 33% over the fourth quarter of 2014, and diluted earnings per share, excluding Health Net merger costs, were $0.95 compared to $0.87 last year. And as you will recall, last year's fourth quarter included a $0.24 benefit from recording the health insurer fee reimbursement for Texas for all of 2014 in the fourth quarter. 
Looking at the full year for 2015. Membership was 5.1 million members, an increase of 26% between years. Premium and Service revenues were $21.3 billion, an increase of 36%. Earnings from operations were $705 million, with increase of 52% and diluted earnings per share, excluding Health Net merger costs, was $3.03, an increase of 36% between years and well above our most recent guidance numbers of $2.90 to $2.94. In more detail, Premium and Service revenues grew by $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter year-over-year, primarily as a result of the expansions or new programs in many of our states. During the fourth quarter, [indiscernible] newly added revenue in several areas. We began and expanded contract in the southern region of Arizona on October 1, behavioral health services were carved-in in Louisiana, beginning December 1. Inpatient services were added in Mississippi beginning December 1. And the fourth quarter included a full quarter of operations in Oregon relating to our acquisition that closes end of September. We also benefited from the addition of almost 250,000 more Medicaid expansion members at this year-end compared to last year. 
During 2015, we recognized $344 million in revenue associated with the health insurer fee compared to $195 million in 2014. For both years, the revenue recorded covers virtually all of the health insurer fee on a grossed-up basis for tax purposes. 
Our health benefits ratio was 88.0% in fourth quarter of this year compared to 89.3% in last year's fourth quarter and 89.0% in the third quarter. The 130 basis point decrease year-over-year results from improvement in the overall HBR from higher acuity membership, particularly long-term care, premium increases and adjustments and a milder flu season in the fourth quarter of this year. Sequentially, the 100 basis point improvement in the third quarter reflects rate increases and adjustments received during the third and fourth quarters. For the fourth quarter, 20% of Premium and Service revenues came from new business compared to 30% in the fourth quarter of 2014. The health benefits ratio of our new business was 88.2% and existing business was 88.0% in the fourth quarter, both of which are decreases of 120 basis points between years. 
The health insurance marketplace product has performed well for us in 2014 and 2015, reflecting our disciplined strategy to focus on subsidized members familiar with our provider network. This same methodology and process was used for 2016 as well. Similar to last year-end, we continue to be in a payable position for the risk corridor and risk adjustment components of the 3Rs. And we also have a payable at year-end recorded for the minimum loss ratio for the Health Insurance Marketplace business. For the 2014 plan year, we have settled the 3R amounts and paid the rebates related to the minimum loss ratio. 
Our general and administrative expense ratio was 8.8% in Q4 of this year, 8.7% without Health Net merger cost, compared to 8.2% last year and 8.2% in the third quarter, also excluding Health Net merger cost. The increase in the fourth quarter of this year, both year-over-year and sequentially, reflects a higher level of seasonal costs related to the open enrollment period for the marketplace exchange product and higher amounts of variable compensation products. Excluding Health Net merger costs, business expansion costs of $.07 were incurred in the fourth quarter and $0.23 for all of 2015. 
Investment and other income was $8 million for the fourth quarter compared to $10 million last year and $8 million in the third quarter. Interest expense was $11 million this year compared to $10 million last year and $11 million in the third quarter. Our effective income tax rate was 48.4% in the fourth quarter and 48.6% for all of 2015. The relatively high rate reflects the nondeductible nature of the health insurer fee. 
Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the fourth quarter was $0.91, $0.95 excluding the Health Net merger cost. For the full year 2015, our EPS was $2.89 or $3.03 excluding the merger cost. 
Cash and investments totaled almost $4 billion at year-end, including $78 million held by unregulated subsidiaries, and our risk-based capital percentage continues to be in excess of 350% of the authorized control level. 
Debt on December 31 was $1.2 billion, including $225 million of borrowings on our revolver. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 34.7%, excluding our nonrecourse mortgage note compared to 71.7% at last year-end. Medical claims liability totaled $2.3 billion at December 31 and represent 44.3 days in claims payable. The cash flow from operations was $201 million in the fourth quarter and $658 million for the full year. Both amounts to approximate 1.8x net earnings, which is consistent with our expected range of 1.5 to 2.0x net earnings. 
Now for 2016, Jeff Schwaneke will discuss our 2016 guidance number for you."

I would like to spend a few minutes to discuss our combined guidance for 2016. In our press release this morning reporting our full year results for 2015, we've also included our 2016 annual guidance. The guidance has be",579,"Thank you, Bill, and good morning. I would like to spend a few minutes to discuss our combined guidance for 2016. In our press release this morning reporting our full year results for 2015, we've also included our 2016 annual guidance. The guidance has been adjusted for the following items: First, we have changed our assumption with respect to the closing date of the Health Net transaction. We are now assuming the transaction closes on March 1. While this does not impact our run rate revenues or earnings, it does change the number of months of Health Net we are able to include in the consolidated financial statements for 2016. As mentioned in our December Investor Day, 1 month of Health Net revenue is approximately $1.3 billion. The March 1 closing date is an assumption we have made for guidance purposes, and the transaction remains subject to regulatory approval in California. The actual closing date of the Health Net transaction will determine the number of months and days of Health Net results that will be included in our consolidated financial statements for 2016; second, we recently announced the pricing of $2.4 billion of senior unsecured debt in connection with the Health Net transaction and have updated our assumptions with respect to interest expense. Consistent with what we have done in the past in matching our balance sheet exposure to short-term interest rates, we intend to swap up to approximately $1.6 billion of the senior debt to a floating rate of interest at transaction closing. Since we have not entered into the interest rate swap agreements, the ultimate interest rate of the transaction financing will continue to fluctuate; third, we have adjusted our range on Health Net merger-related expenses, which will continue to change until closing, and have reduced the guidance range for the amortization of intangible assets associated with acquisitions by 1 month to reflect the assumed March 1 closing date. 
And finally, we have updated our guidance to include the recent contract award for Centurion in Florida. 
As a result of all these items for 2016, our combined guidance is as follows: total revenues of $40 billion to $40.8 billion; GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.80 to $3.15; adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.05 to $4.40; adjusted diluted earnings per share excludes the amortization of intangible assets associated with acquisitions, which we estimate to be between $0.50 and $0.55 per share, and Health Net related merger expenses, which we estimate to be between $0.70 and $0.75 per diluted share, with both items reflecting the revised closing date assumption. We have adjusted the bottom end of our diluted earnings per share guidance range to reflect the 1-month delay in the assumed closing date of the Health Net transaction. For 2016, we expect approximately 45% of our annual adjusted diluted earnings per share to be earned in the first half of the year, and we expect the first quarter to be lower than the second quarter due to seasonality of the business, the extra day from leap year and only including 1 month of Health Net in our consolidated results for the first quarter. Additionally, our guidance assumes no receivables for the risk corridor program and a payable for the risk adjustment program in 2016. We will provide further details on our 2016 guidance after regulatory approval and the closing of the Health Net transaction.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Centene's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2015 Earnings Call. I'd like to begin with an update on the status of the Health Net acquisition. We have made significant progress towards completing",1554,"Thank you, Ed. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Centene's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2015 Earnings Call. I'd like to begin with an update on the status of the Health Net acquisition. We have made significant progress towards completing this transaction. We have received all necessary approvals, with the exception in California, which remains pending. On January 22, Centene participated in a public hearing with the California Department of Insurance. We believe the meeting was informative, and there were no surprises. It was conducted in a professional and respectful manner, and was part of what has been a fair, thorough process. We continue to work through the process with the Department of Insurance and the Department of Managed Health Care and are finalizing our mutual agreements. We remain confident of a first quarter close. We have slightly adjusted our 2016 guidance to reflect a March 1 closing date for Health Net. Jeff will provide further details on this. 
I would like to take a moment to remind you of the rationale behind the Health Net acquisition. It is a significant step in our strategy to build critical mass and expertise within the government-sponsored healthcare category. When the deal closes, Centene will be a $40-plus billion company. We will be the largest Medicaid managed care organization in the country and the leader in managed long-term support services. The addition of Health Net's Medicare Advantage platform, including its four-star rating, creates numerous opportunities within our existing markets, which we estimate to be in excess of $150 million. Health Net will increase our market presence to 15 states with total membership of approximately 500,000 individuals. There are significant opportunities to deploy Centene's specialty solutions across the Health Net platforms. Health Net has been an innovator in value-based provider contracting and risk-sharing systems. Finally, the deal is 20% accretive in adjusted EPS in the first year following the close. 
The planning portion of Centene's comprehensive integration process is now largely completed. We have reorganized our management team to facilitate collaboration and efficiency. We will be ready to hit the ground running to begin executing the plan on the day it closes. 
Now shifting to fourth quarter and full year 2015 highlights. Centene ended 2015 in a strong, balanced and secure structural and financial position. What do I mean by this? Several months ago, when I questioned a single contract in one state, Bill Scheffel, our CFO for the next few days, commented, ""We are an aircraft carrier, and you don't throw aircraft carriers off course very easily."" Today, we are in 23 states, soon to be 24 with Nebraska. In these 23 states, we have 231 separate solutions, which are products or contracts. This diversity provides strength and stability. In other words, if one product in one state has an issue, rate, something of that nature, there are more than enough offset. Many of you will recognize that this has been our strategy from the beginning. 
Clearly, 2015 was a banner year for Centene. Our long-term growth strategy is intact. We continue to execute against our pipeline as evidenced by recent wins in Florida and Nebraska. We added over 1 million members, representing growth of 26% to 5.1 million beneficiaries. Premium and Service revenues increased 36% year-over-year to $21.3 billion. The HBR improved 40 basis points year-over-year to 88.9%. We reported diluted earnings per share of $2.89 or $3.03 when excluding $0.14 of Health Net merger-related expenses. This compares to $2.23 reported for full year 2014. The pretax margin, excluding merger costs, improved to 3.4% from 2.9% in 2014 and 2.6% in 2013. We remain committed to margin and future margin expansion with a targeted range of 3% to 5%. Bill will provide further financial details in his prepared remarks. 
A quick note on flu. Current indicators point to a slower start to the 2015-2016 flu season. It is, however, still too early to draw an absolute conclusion. Overall, we continue to see as well as anticipate stable medical cost trends. 
Next, market and product updates. First, we'll discuss recent Medicaid activity. 
Nebraska. We were pleased to be selected last week as 1 of 3 managed care organizations to administer Nebraska's Heritage Health program. Heritage Health is a new healthcare delivery system that combines the state's current physical health, behavioral Health and pharmacy programs, into a single comprehensive and coordinated system. This program covers 230 Medicaid and CHIP enrollees. Centene will operate statewide in Nebraska, which marks our 24th state of operations. The contract is expected to commence on January 1, 2017, and we expect a normal margin ramp. This entry point provides future opportunities in the state, such as long-term care. 
Arizona. The fourth quarter was our first full quarter providing services under the expanded contract for Arizona's newly formed southern region. Membership in Arizona doubled over the third quarter of 2015. At December 31, we served approximately 441,000 beneficiaries in the state. 
Mississippi. Mississippi became a $1 billion market for Centene in 2015. In December, we began managing inpatient services for Medicaid and ABD members in the state. We ended the year with 302,000 lives. This compares to 109,000 at the end of 2014. 
Louisiana. Louisiana also became a $1 billion market in 2015. During the year, we executed a successful acquisition and integration in the state. We more than doubled our at-risk membership to 382,000 lives. In December, we further expanded our Louisiana contract to begin including behavioral health benefits. The carve-in of additional benefits in Mississippi and Louisiana is consistent with Centene's holistic approach to provide integrated care for its members. 
Oregon. The fourth quarter marked the first full quarter of operations for our Trillium subsidiary, which provides Medicaid, Medicare Advantage and marketplace services to Oregon residents. Membership at year-end was approximately 100,000. While it's still early, Trillium is performing in line with our expectations. 
Now on to dual eligibles. We ended the fourth quarter with 26,300 members across our 5 dual demonstration contracts. We continue to work with our state providers and CMS to make these programs successful and sustainable. I remind you that we have always taken the view that the dual demonstration programs would not be a significant near-term growth driver for Centene. 
Next, Medicaid expansion. We ended 2015 with almost 450,000 Medicaid expansion members, more than double that at -- of what was at the end of 2014. In January, the Governor of Louisiana signed an executive order to expand Medicaid coverage under ACA by July 1, 2016. This represents a future growth opportunity for Centene, given our status as the largest Medicaid health plan in the state. We have not yet included the Louisiana expansion in our 2016 financial guidance. We will provide an update when additional information becomes available. 
Health Insurance Marketplaces. Our exchange experience continues to be favorable. 92% of our membership is subsidy-eligible, and we are achieving margins within our targeted range. We have taken a disciplined approach to pricing from day 1. In fact, the aggregate in each of Centene's states reflected a payable position for both 2014 and 2015 for the 3Rs program. This approach has allowed us to grow profitably from 75,000 members in 9 states in 2014 to over 146,000 members in 12 states in 2015. Please note we have not been impacted by special enrollment periods. 
For 2016, we expanded into a 13th state, New Hampshire. We have also increased our geographic footprint in certain of our other 12 states. Enrollment so far in 2016 is in line or ahead of expectations. The demographics of these new members are consistent with previous years and over 90% are subsidy-eligible. Our pricing and underwriting is also in line with prior years, and we are not reliant on risk orders. 
Centurion. We continue to successfully expand our correctional health business. Last week, Centurion reached a formal agreement with the Florida Department of Corrections to provide comprehensive healthcare services to over 70,000 inmates throughout the 3 regions. The contract was awarded through an accelerated GAAP procurement. It was structured as a cost-plus arrangement with a maximum $267 million in annual revenue. Centurion was the only awardee. This contract is expected to commence in the second quarter of 2016 and runs through January of 2018. 
Shifting gears, our rate outlook. The 2015 composite rate adjustment was approximately 1%, in line with our expectations. Composite rate adjustments have been consistent for the past few years. We expect a similar composite rate adjustment in 2016. 
In conclusion, our strong 2015 results reaffirm our growth momentum for 2016 and beyond. As we begin this new year, we are at a good place, both financially and strategically. With the additional products and capabilities Health Net provides, our growth pipeline is bigger than ever. We are well positioned to gain market share in the government-sponsored healthcare space, the fastest-growing category in the industry. 
Thank you for your interest in Centene. Before I turn the call over to Bill, I want to thank him for his years of dedicated service. As previously announced, he will be retiring at the end of the month after the K is filed. You will now witness part of that turnover. Bill will cover 2015 information, and Jeff will pick up and report information relative to 2016. 
Bill, I turn it over to you."
26273,321591830,929842,"Centene Corp., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2016",2016-02-09,"Earnings Calls","Centene Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. This morning, we will cover both our fourth quarter and full year 2015 results. For the fourth quarter, Premium and Service revenues were $5.9 billion, an increase of 33% over the fourth quarter of 2014, and",892,"Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. This morning, we will cover both our fourth quarter and full year 2015 results. For the fourth quarter, Premium and Service revenues were $5.9 billion, an increase of 33% over the fourth quarter of 2014, and diluted earnings per share, excluding Health Net merger costs, were $0.95 compared to $0.87 last year. And as you will recall, last year's fourth quarter included a $0.24 benefit from recording the health insurer fee reimbursement for Texas for all of 2014 in the fourth quarter. 
Looking at the full year for 2015. Membership was 5.1 million members, an increase of 26% between years. Premium and Service revenues were $21.3 billion, an increase of 36%. Earnings from operations were $705 million, with increase of 52% and diluted earnings per share, excluding Health Net merger costs, was $3.03, an increase of 36% between years and well above our most recent guidance numbers of $2.90 to $2.94. In more detail, Premium and Service revenues grew by $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter year-over-year, primarily as a result of the expansions or new programs in many of our states. During the fourth quarter, [indiscernible] newly added revenue in several areas. We began and expanded contract in the southern region of Arizona on October 1, behavioral health services were carved-in in Louisiana, beginning December 1. Inpatient services were added in Mississippi beginning December 1. And the fourth quarter included a full quarter of operations in Oregon relating to our acquisition that closes end of September. We also benefited from the addition of almost 250,000 more Medicaid expansion members at this year-end compared to last year. 
During 2015, we recognized $344 million in revenue associated with the health insurer fee compared to $195 million in 2014. For both years, the revenue recorded covers virtually all of the health insurer fee on a grossed-up basis for tax purposes. 
Our health benefits ratio was 88.0% in fourth quarter of this year compared to 89.3% in last year's fourth quarter and 89.0% in the third quarter. The 130 basis point decrease year-over-year results from improvement in the overall HBR from higher acuity membership, particularly long-term care, premium increases and adjustments and a milder flu season in the fourth quarter of this year. Sequentially, the 100 basis point improvement in the third quarter reflects rate increases and adjustments received during the third and fourth quarters. For the fourth quarter, 20% of Premium and Service revenues came from new business compared to 30% in the fourth quarter of 2014. The health benefits ratio of our new business was 88.2% and existing business was 88.0% in the fourth quarter, both of which are decreases of 120 basis points between years. 
The health insurance marketplace product has performed well for us in 2014 and 2015, reflecting our disciplined strategy to focus on subsidized members familiar with our provider network. This same methodology and process was used for 2016 as well. Similar to last year-end, we continue to be in a payable position for the risk corridor and risk adjustment components of the 3Rs. And we also have a payable at year-end recorded for the minimum loss ratio for the Health Insurance Marketplace business. For the 2014 plan year, we have settled the 3R amounts and paid the rebates related to the minimum loss ratio. 
Our general and administrative expense ratio was 8.8% in Q4 of this year, 8.7% without Health Net merger cost, compared to 8.2% last year and 8.2% in the third quarter, also excluding Health Net merger cost. The increase in the fourth quarter of this year, both year-over-year and sequentially, reflects a higher level of seasonal costs related to the open enrollment period for the marketplace exchange product and higher amounts of variable compensation products. Excluding Health Net merger costs, business expansion costs of $.07 were incurred in the fourth quarter and $0.23 for all of 2015. 
Investment and other income was $8 million for the fourth quarter compared to $10 million last year and $8 million in the third quarter. Interest expense was $11 million this year compared to $10 million last year and $11 million in the third quarter. Our effective income tax rate was 48.4% in the fourth quarter and 48.6% for all of 2015. The relatively high rate reflects the nondeductible nature of the health insurer fee. 
Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the fourth quarter was $0.91, $0.95 excluding the Health Net merger cost. For the full year 2015, our EPS was $2.89 or $3.03 excluding the merger cost. 
Cash and investments totaled almost $4 billion at year-end, including $78 million held by unregulated subsidiaries, and our risk-based capital percentage continues to be in excess of 350% of the authorized control level. 
Debt on December 31 was $1.2 billion, including $225 million of borrowings on our revolver. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 34.7%, excluding our nonrecourse mortgage note compared to 71.7% at last year-end. Medical claims liability totaled $2.3 billion at December 31 and represent 44.3 days in claims payable. The cash flow from operations was $201 million in the fourth quarter and $658 million for the full year. Both amounts to approximate 1.8x net earnings, which is consistent with our expected range of 1.5 to 2.0x net earnings. 
Now for 2016, Jeff Schwaneke will discuss our 2016 guidance number for you."

I would like to spend a few minutes to discuss our combined guidance for 2016. In our press release this morning reporting our full year results for 2015, we've also included our 2016 annual guidance. The guidance has be",579,"Thank you, Bill, and good morning. I would like to spend a few minutes to discuss our combined guidance for 2016. In our press release this morning reporting our full year results for 2015, we've also included our 2016 annual guidance. The guidance has been adjusted for the following items: First, we have changed our assumption with respect to the closing date of the Health Net transaction. We are now assuming the transaction closes on March 1. While this does not impact our run rate revenues or earnings, it does change the number of months of Health Net we are able to include in the consolidated financial statements for 2016. As mentioned in our December Investor Day, 1 month of Health Net revenue is approximately $1.3 billion. The March 1 closing date is an assumption we have made for guidance purposes, and the transaction remains subject to regulatory approval in California. The actual closing date of the Health Net transaction will determine the number of months and days of Health Net results that will be included in our consolidated financial statements for 2016; second, we recently announced the pricing of $2.4 billion of senior unsecured debt in connection with the Health Net transaction and have updated our assumptions with respect to interest expense. Consistent with what we have done in the past in matching our balance sheet exposure to short-term interest rates, we intend to swap up to approximately $1.6 billion of the senior debt to a floating rate of interest at transaction closing. Since we have not entered into the interest rate swap agreements, the ultimate interest rate of the transaction financing will continue to fluctuate; third, we have adjusted our range on Health Net merger-related expenses, which will continue to change until closing, and have reduced the guidance range for the amortization of intangible assets associated with acquisitions by 1 month to reflect the assumed March 1 closing date. 
And finally, we have updated our guidance to include the recent contract award for Centurion in Florida. 
As a result of all these items for 2016, our combined guidance is as follows: total revenues of $40 billion to $40.8 billion; GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.80 to $3.15; adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.05 to $4.40; adjusted diluted earnings per share excludes the amortization of intangible assets associated with acquisitions, which we estimate to be between $0.50 and $0.55 per share, and Health Net related merger expenses, which we estimate to be between $0.70 and $0.75 per diluted share, with both items reflecting the revised closing date assumption. We have adjusted the bottom end of our diluted earnings per share guidance range to reflect the 1-month delay in the assumed closing date of the Health Net transaction. For 2016, we expect approximately 45% of our annual adjusted diluted earnings per share to be earned in the first half of the year, and we expect the first quarter to be lower than the second quarter due to seasonality of the business, the extra day from leap year and only including 1 month of Health Net in our consolidated results for the first quarter. Additionally, our guidance assumes no receivables for the risk corridor program and a payable for the risk adjustment program in 2016. We will provide further details on our 2016 guidance after regulatory approval and the closing of the Health Net transaction.

While the company may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so. 
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Michael Neidorff. Michael?"

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Centene's First Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. We are very pleased to have closed the Health Net acquisition within the first quarter, as projected. I would like to begin with a few comments",1496,"Thank you, Ed. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Centene's First Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. We are very pleased to have closed the Health Net acquisition within the first quarter, as projected. 
I would like to begin with a few comments on why the addition of Health Net is transformational. In closing the acquisition, Centene has achieved the following: further critical mass, including additional product diversification within the government-sponsored health care space. We are a $40 billion-plus company. We are the largest Medicaid managed care organization in the country serving 6.7 million Medicaid members at March 31. We are the leader in 3 of the largest Medicaid states: California, Texas and Florida. We are the largest provider of managed long-term support services, one of the fastest-growing segments of the market. We have a 4-star Medicare Advantage product that can be exported to additional markets, and we provide services under contracts with the U.S. Department of Defense and Veterans Affairs. This greater scale enhances the positive view of Centene nationally as well as by state and local governments. It strengthens our ability to help shape sound public health care policy. In addition, it enhances our purchasing power and is beneficial from a balance sheet perspective. 
Centene is now clearly a large-cap company in stock. We recently joined the S&P 500 Index. This is important to us as this index is regarded as the best single gauge of large-cap U.S. equities. Additionally, we will widen our potential investor base and lead to increase liquidity of our stock. Lastly, this acquisition enhances and solidifies the sustainability of Centene's long-term growth rate. 
I would now like to comment on the timing of the approval process and provide an update on integration. While the regulatory process in California was lengthier than expected, it was fair and the undertakings contained no surprises. We will be making investments in certain state-affiliated investment-grade vehicles as well as in a local service center. The placement of a service center in California is consistent with Centene's local approach. We will work with the state to find a suitable location in an economically disadvantaged area where job creation is needed. The investments and charitable contributions associated with these undertakings have been included in our guidance and will be made over a multiple-year period. The planning portion of the integration process was largely completed prior to closing. Our integration team did extensive work to ensure a smooth and seamless combination. We were able to hit the ground running the day of the close, and integration is preceding as expected. 
Before I provide first quarter highlights, I want to remind you that our first quarter results included only 8 days of Health Net's financials as the transaction closed on March 24. Our prior guidance had assumed a March 1 close date. We have updated our 2016 guidance to reflect the later close. This is a timing issue only, and we remain confident that our previously anticipated run rate earnings remain on track. Additionally, we have adjusted our reporting to reflect the increased scale of the business and our new product mix. We believe this provides meaningful information to investors, and it will continue to evolve as we complete the Health Net integration. 
Turning to the first quarter financials. We are pleased with the results of the first quarter. There were many moving parts when combining the 2 companies, including onetime charges and prorating for [indiscernible] 
Total revenues increased 36% year-over-year to $7 billion. Membership at quarter-end was 11.5 million, representing an increase of 7.1 million members or 162% over the first quarter of 2015. The HBR improved 110 basis points year-over-year to 88.7%. The first quarter pretax margin, excluding acquisition-related cost, improved 30 basis points year-over-year to 3%. We reported adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.74. This compares to $0.55 in the first quarter of 2015. Jeff will provide further financial details, including the updated 2016 guidance, in his prepared remarks. 
A quick note on flu. We saw an uptick in flu during the first quarter. The flu appears to have peaked in March, and overall costs were in line with our expectations. Overall, we continue to see as well as anticipate stable medical cost trends. 
Next, market and product updates. First, we will discuss recent Medicaid activity. 
Washington State. In April, Centene commenced operations under the Apple Foster Care contract in Washington as the sole provider for this program. The contract is performing in line with expectations, and we anticipate serving over 20,000 across the state. With the addition of this contract, Centene will serve approximately 100,000 Foster Care beneficiaries across all of our markets. 
Nebraska. Also on April, Centene executed a contract with Nebraska as 1 of 3 managed care organizations to administer the state's new Heritage Health program, which covers 230 Medicaid CHIP and ABD enrollees. This contract is expected to commence in the first quarter of 2017. 
Texas. We expect to start CHIP contract in Texas to commence in the latter part of 2016. Centene is the only managed care organization in Texas to participate in all of the state's Medicaid and Medicaid-related product lines. 
Next, Medicaid expansion. At March 31, we served approximately 985,000 Medicaid expansion members in 9 states. This represents an increase of more than 650,000 [ph] recipients over the first quarter of 2015. This growth was primarily driven by the additional Health Net Medicaid expansion [indiscernible] In January, the Governor of Louisiana signed an Executive Order to expand Medicaid coverage under the ACA. This is expected to be begin in July and is now included in our updated 2016 guidance. 
Now Medicare and duals. At March 31, we served over 303,000 Medicare and dual beneficiaries. We continue to expect to launch additional Medicare Advantage brands in 4 Centene states in 2017. The new Medicare Advantage brands will be launched under our 4-Star Banner, which will give us the benefit of incremental premium revenues. 
Next, Health Insurance Marketplace. Centene's exchange experience continues to be favorable, and we are achieving margins at the higher end of our targeted range. Our market pre-strategy has been and continues to be focused on targeted low-income, subsidized individuals, many of whom were previously Medicaid-eligible. We designed our exchange solution to be able to leverage our Medicaid platform, including provider networks. In the majority of our markets, we have both Medicaid and market-based product offerings. We coined the term churn to reference those members who can retain coverage through a high-quality, affordable Centene product in either Medicaid or the exchange. In the first quarter, over 90% of our exchange members were subsidy-eligible. This is consistent with 2014 and 2015. 
Centene has maintained a disciplined approach to pricing from day 1. In fact, we are in a net payable position for the 3Rs program. At March 31, we served over 680,000 [ph] exchange members across 15 states. At year-end, we expect over 550,000 exchange beneficiaries due to the normal attrition. 
Now Centurion. Our correctional health business continues to successfully expand. At March 31, we served 59,000 correctional members, represent year-over-year growth of 38%. In April, Centurion replaced its existing 1-year contract in Mississippi with a new 3-year contract, which is expected to commence in July. Also in April, we began providing correctional health services in 3 regions in Florida. This marks Centurion's sixth [ph] state population. 
Finally, commercial. We ended the first quarter with over 830,000 commercial members. We are fully committed to the success of the existing business, especially in California. However, we have no plans at this time to expand into additional states. 
Shifting gears to our rate output. For Medicaid, we continue to expect the 2016 composite rate adjustment of between 0 and 1%, consistent with the past 2 [ph] years. We have known rates for our Medicaid business representing approximately 65% of the projected 2016 member bonds. For Medicare Advantage, final 2017 rates were announced on April 4. These were in line with our expectations of an approximate 1%. 
In conclusion, with first quarter results, we're off to a good start in 2016. We expect this momentum to continue throughout the year. We are on track with our integration of Health Net. Our synergy targets remain $75 million for the first 12 months following the close and $150 million in the second 12 months following the close. While we remain committed to long-term margin expansion, we continue to expect the 2016 pretax margins to remain relatively flat compared to 2015 as we focus on integration. Our growth pipeline is bigger than ever with the additional products and capabilities in health care. We are optimistic about the future and our ability to expand Centene's leadership position in government-sponsored health care. 
As a reminder, our Investor Day is on June 17 in New York City. We look forward to seeing you then. We thank you for your continued interest in Centene. 
Jeff will now provide further details on our first quarter financial results. Jeff?"

This morning, I will begin with highlighting the results for the first quarter of 2016 and will provide an update on our 2016 full year guidance, including the acquisition of Health Net. First, I would like to highl",1627,"Thank you, Michael, and good morning. This morning, I will begin with highlighting the results for the first quarter of 2016 and will provide an update on our 2016 full year guidance, including the acquisition of Health Net. 
First, I would like to highlight the effect of the Health Net transaction in the first quarter 2016 results. As previously announced, we completed the acquisition of Health Net on March 24, 2016, for a purchase price of $6 billion, including the assumption of debt. In connection with the completion of the acquisition, we incurred approximately $189 million or $0.83 per diluted share of transaction cost, which includes accelerated stock compensation service, investment banking fees, legal cost and the pertinent value of the $65 million charitable donation under agreements with the U.S. regulatory agencies. Additionally, we had included $8 million [ph] [indiscernible] in our first quarter of 2016 results. The 8 days of activity represents approximately $350 million of revenue and had a minimal effect on our HBR, G&A ratio and adjusted diluted earnings per share. 
Now onto the first quarter highlights. For the first quarter, membership of 11.5 million members, an increase of 162% for 2 years [ph] driven by the Health Net acquisition. Total revenues for the first quarter [ph] of $7 billion, [ph] an increase of 36% over Q1 in 2015. [indiscernible] per share for the first quarter of 2016 compares with [indiscernible] and adjusted diluted earnings per share is $0.74, [indiscernible] Health Net acquisition costs and intangible amortization, compared to $0.55 on an adjusted basis last year. 
In more detail, total revenues grew by $1.8 billion in the first quarter, primarily as a result of expansions [indiscernible] in many of our states for 2015, growth of the Health Insurance Marketplace business and 8 days of revenue from the Health Net acquisition. Our health benefits ratio was 88.7% in the first quarter this year compared to 89.8% in last year's first quarter or 88% [ph] for the fourth quarter. The 110 basis points decrease year-over-year was also an improvement in the overall HBR for [indiscernible] particularly long-term care and growth in the Health Insurance Marketplace membership, which continues to perform well. 
Sequentially, the 70 [ph] basis point increase from the fourth quarter [indiscernible] for the first quarter of 2016. For the first quarter, 18% premium and service revenues [indiscernible] the new business compared to 23% from the first quarter of 2015. The existing business metrics in the quarter [indiscernible] Health Net [indiscernible] acquisition, and we expect the percentage of revenue of new business to decrease to a single-digit percentage by the end of the year due to the larger revenue base and the denominator. The health benefits ratio for new business were 96 -- 90.6% and 88.3% for existing business and the purchase order. 
The Health Insurance Marketplace product continues to perform well in 2016 with over 680,000 members [ph] at March 31. With the addition of Health Net, we continue to be in a net [indiscernible] position for the risk corridor and risk adjustment components of the 3Rs. As part of our initial good valuation procedures associated with the acquisition, we have reduced the [indiscernible] of the Health Net this quarter [indiscernible  Additionally, consistent with our historical accounting practice and guidance, we will not put any risk corridors [indiscernible] 2016 figures. Our general and administrative expense ratio was 11.3% in the first quarter this year or 8.3% without the cost associated with the Health Net acquisition compared to 8.3% last year and 8.7% in the fourth quarter, also excluding Health Net acquisition costs. The decrease from the fourth quarter of 2015 reflects the reduction in cost related to [indiscernible] with the Health Insurance Marketplace [indiscernible  
During the first quarter, we incurred $0.02 [ph] per diluted share of business expansion cost compared to $0.06 [ph] for the year. Investment and other income was $15 billion [ph] in the first quarter compared with $9 million last year and $8 million in the fourth quarter. Interest expense was $33 million for the first quarter of 2016 compared to $10 million for the first quarter last year and $11 million for the fourth quarter last year. The increase is due to the issuance of $2.4 billion of senior notes on February 11, 2016, [indiscernible] integration for the Health Net acquisition. Consistent with what we have been done in the past, [indiscernible] our balance sheet exposure to short-term interest rates, on March 30, 2016, we introduced the interest rate swap agreements for a notional amount of $1.6 million [ph] [indiscernible] substantial portion of senior notes to the floating rate of interest at [indiscernible] LIBOR plus 4.36% [ph] [indiscernible] stock expense of $17 million on a pretax income of $2 million for the first quarter of 2016 due to the non-deductibility of certain Health Net acquisition costs as well as [indiscernible] in the health insurance. GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the first quarter was $0.13. [ph] Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the first quarter was exactly $0.04. Adjusted diluted earnings per share includes $0.83 [ph] associated with the Health Net acquisition costs and $0.04 associated with the [indiscernible] 
Cash and investments totaled almost $8 billion at quarter-end, including $139 million held by unregulated subsidiaries. We estimate our NAIC risk-based capital percentage to be in excess of 350% [ph] [indiscernible] Debt on March 31 was $4.3 billion, including $515 million of borrowings on our revolver. Our debt-to-capital ratio, excluding 12.3%, [ph] excluding our [indiscernible] compared to 34.7% in the fourth quarter 2015. 
Our medical claim liability totaled $3.9 billion in March 31, representing 42 days in claims payable normalizing for Health Net acquisition. During the first quarter, we made provisional estimates for the fair value of the medical claims liability associated with Health Net. We have not completed our fair valuation exercise, and we announced [indiscernible] change. Any change in the provisional estimates would be recorded as an adjustment to the opening balance sheet and will have no effect on net earnings. Cash flow from operations is $195 million [ph] in first quarter compared to $35 million [ph] in the first quarter of 2015. Additionally, you will note that we have adjusted our reporting this quarter to reflect the sale of the business for new product. We believe this provides meaningful information to investors and will continue to involve with the integration to the company. 
This concludes my remarks for the first quarter results. Now I would like to provide you update on our full year guidance. We have adjusted our 2016 guidance to reflect the large [indiscernible] in the Health Net acquisition. We have lowered the top and bottom end of the revenue guidance by $1 billion, lowered both end to our adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance of $0.05 [ph] to reflect the transaction closing shifting to March 1 to 24. Changing closing date does not have an impact on our run rate revenues or earnings. We now expect total revenues to be between $39 billion [ph] and $39.8 billion [ph] which represents an increase of approximately 73% [ph] of the midpoint of our guidance as compared to 2015. Our 2016 guidance for health benefits ratio is 87% to 87.5%, a decrease from 2015 of approximately 160 [ph] basis points at the midpoint of the guidance. 
Production in HBR, year-over-year, is due to the addition of Health Net, which operates in the lower HBR due to the higher mix conversion and growth in the health [indiscernible] marketplace, which operates with lower HBR and higher G&A ratio. 
General and administrative expense ratio is expected to be between 9.4% to 9.9% in 2016. On an adjusted basis, and excluding acquisition costs, the G&A ratio is expected to increase by 75 basis points between years to 9% to 9.5%. This increase is due to the addition of Health Net, which operates at a higher [indiscernible] expense ratio due to the mix of business, offset by additional leverage associated with revenue deals [indiscernible 
Other revenue and expense, interest income is forecasted to be between $90 million and $100 million, and interest expense is estimated to be between $180 million to $190 million. We estimate business expansion cost of $0.25 [ph] and $0.30 [ph] [indiscernible] We estimate that our effective income tax rate for 2016, excluding noncontrolling interest, will be 55% to 57%, relatively high effective tax rate [indiscernible] impact of nondeductible agreement with the health insurer fee and non-deductibility of certain acquisition costs associated with the Health Net acquisition. In 2016, we anticipate the health insurer fee increases to approximately $450 million. We estimate our diluted shares outstanding to be between 162.5 to 163.5 million shares. 2016, we expect GAAP diluted earnings per share to between $2.45 to $2.80, adjusted diluted earnings per share to be between $4 and $4.35. These amounts include Health Net and related synergies for 9 months [ph] and 8 days in 2016. Adjusted diluted earnings per share excludes 2 items: first, the amortization of intangible assets [indiscernible] acquisitions, and we estimate to be between $0.50 and $0.55 per share; and two, Health Net acquisition-related expenses, which we estimate to be between $1 and $1.05 per diluted share. Additionally, our guidance assumes no receivable for the programs and payable [indiscernible] for 2016. 
We believe the guidance we would have provided today are generally [indiscernible] financial information [indiscernible] statement adjusted to include only 9 months and 8 days of Health Net activity due to the March 23 [ph] closing. We continue to expect $75 million of net synergies in the next 12 months, following closing of the transaction. We estimate our operating cash flow to be between 1.5 to 2x net earnings. 
That concludes my remarks. And operator, you may now open the lines for questions."

I think that if they raise their prices, some of the healthier members, we would hope would accrue to us with respect to that. And again, we try to carefully look at the dynamics of how that would affect the actual risk adjustment amount that we might have to reflect related to our acuity, including how the risk adjuster tool works in each state. And I think that we've reflected what we think is an accurate view of the dynamics for 2017. Just back to another comment you mentioned that the reinsurance program is going away in 2017, and that is certainly something that will need to be reflected in our pricing in 2017 and something that we're very mindful of."

26273,322819850,963201,"Centene Corp., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2016",2016-04-26,"Earnings Calls","Centene Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Ed. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Centene's First Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. We are very pleased to have closed the Health Net acquisition within the first quarter, as projected. I would like to begin with a few comments",1493,"Thank you, Ed. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Centene's First Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. We are very pleased to have closed the Health Net acquisition within the first quarter, as projected. 
I would like to begin with a few comments on why the addition of Health Net is transformational. In closing the acquisition, Centene has achieved the following: further critical mass, including additional product diversification within the government-sponsored health care space. We are a $40 billion-plus company. We are the largest Medicaid managed care organization in the country serving 6.7 million Medicaid members at March 31. We are the leader in 3 of the largest Medicaid states: California, Texas and Florida. We are the largest provider of managed long-term support services, one of the fastest-growing segments of the market. We have a 4-star Medicare Advantage product that can be exported to additional markets, and we provide services under contracts with the U.S. Department of Defense and Veterans Affairs. This greater scale enhances the positive view of Centene nationally as well as by state and local governments. It strengthens our ability to help shape sound public health care policy. In addition, it enhances our purchasing power and is beneficial from a balance sheet perspective. 
Centene is now clearly a large-cap company, in stock. We recently joined the S&P 500 Index. This is important to us as this index is regarded as the best single gauge of large-cap U.S. equities. Additionally, it will widen our potential investor base and lead to increased liquidity of our stock. Lastly, this acquisition enhances and solidifies the sustainability of Centene's long-term growth rate. 
I would now like to comment on the timing of the approval process and provide an update on integration. While the regulatory process in California was lengthier than expected, it was fair and the undertakings contained no surprises. We will be making investments in certain state-affiliated investment-grade vehicles as well as in a local service center. The placement of a service center in California is consistent with Centene's local approach. We will work with the state to find a suitable location in an economically disadvantaged area where job creation is needed. The investments and charitable contributions associated with these undertakings have been included in our guidance and will be made over a multiple-year period. The planning portion of the integration process was largely completed prior to closing. Our integration team did extensive work to ensure a smooth and seamless combination. We were able to hit the ground running the day of the close, and the integration is proceeding as expected. 
Before I provide first quarter highlights, I want to remind you that our first quarter results included only 8 days of Health Net's financials as the transaction closed on March 24. Our prior guidance had assumed a March 1 close date. We have updated our 2016 guidance to reflect the later close. This is a timing issue only, and we remain confident that our previously anticipated run rate earnings remain on track. Additionally, we have adjusted our reporting to reflect the increased scale of the business and our new product mix. We believe this provides meaningful information to investors, and it will continue to evolve as we complete the Health Net integration. 
Turning to the first quarter financials. We are pleased with the results of the first quarter. There were many moving parts when combining the 2 companies, including onetime charges and prorating for [indiscernible].
Total revenues increased 36% year-over-year to $7 billion. Membership at quarter-end was 11.5 million, representing an increase of 7.1 million members or 162% over the first quarter of 2015. The HBR improved 110 basis points year-over-year to 88.7%. The first quarter pretax margin, excluding acquisition-related cost, improved 30 basis points year-over-year to 3%. We reported adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.74. This compares to $0.55 in the first quarter of 2015. Jeff will provide further financial details, including the updated 2016 guidance, in his prepared remarks. 
A quick note on flu. We saw an uptick in flu during the first quarter. The flu appears to have peaked in March, and overall costs were in line with our expectations. Overall, we continue to see as well as anticipate stable medical cost trends. 
Next, market and product updates. First, we will discuss recent Medicaid activity. 
Washington State. In April, Centene commenced operations under the Apple Foster Care contract in Washington, as the sole provider for this program. The contract is performing in line with expectations, and we anticipate serving over 20,000 foster children. With the addition of this contract, Centene will serve approximately 100,000 Foster Care beneficiaries across all of our markets. 
Nebraska. Also in April, Centene executed a contract with Nebraska as 1 of 3 managed care organizations to administer the state's new Heritage Health program, which covers 230 Medicaid CHIP and ABD enrollees. This contract is expected to commence in the first quarter of 2017. 
Texas. We expect to start CHIP contract in Texas to commence in the latter part of 2016. Centene is the only managed care organization in Texas to participate in all of the state's Medicaid and Medicaid-related product lines. 
Next, Medicaid expansion. At March 31, we served approximately 985,000 Medicaid expansion members in 9 states. This represents an increase of more than 650,000 recipients over the first quarter of 2015. This growth was primarily driven by the addition of Health Net Medicaid expansion members. In January, the Governor of Louisiana signed an Executive Order to expand Medicaid coverage under the ACA. This is expected to be begin in July, and is now included in our updated 2016 guidance. 
Now Medicare and duals. At March 31, we served over 303,000 Medicare and dual beneficiaries. We continue to expect to launch additional Medicare Advantage brands in 4 Centene states in 2017. The new Medicare Advantage brands will be launched under our 4-Star Banner, which will give us the benefit of incremental premium revenues. 
Next, Health Insurance Marketplace. Centene's exchange experience continues to be favorable, and we are achieving margins at the higher end of our targeted range. Our market pre-strategy has been and continues to be focused on targeted low-income, subsidized individuals, many of whom were previously Medicaid-eligible. We designed our exchange solution to be able to leverage our Medicaid platform, including provider networks. In the majority of our markets, we have both Medicaid and market-based product offerings. We coined the term 'churn' to reference those members who can retain coverage through a high-quality, affordable Centene product in either Medicaid or the exchange. In the first quarter, over 90% of our exchange members were subsidy-eligible, this is consistent with 2014 and 2015. 
Centene has maintained a disciplined approach to pricing from day 1. In fact, we are in a net payable position for the 3Rs program. At March 31, we served over 680,000 exchange members across 15 states. At year-end, we expect over 550,000 exchange beneficiaries due to the normal attrition. 
Now Centurion. Our correctional health business continues to successfully expand. At March 31, we served 59,000 correctional members, represent year-over-year growth of 38%. In April, Centurion replaced its existing 1-year contract in Mississippi with a new 3-year contract, which is expected to commence in July. Also in April, we began providing correctional health services in 3 regions in Florida. This marks Centurion's fixed state population. 
Finally, commercial. We ended the first quarter with over 830,000 commercial members. We are fully committed to the success of the existing business, especially in California. However, we have no plans at this time to expand into additional states. 
Shifting gears to our rate output. For Medicaid, we continue to expect the 2016 composite rate adjustment of between 0 and 1%, consistent with the past 2 years. We have known rates for our Medicaid business representing approximately 65% of the projected 2016 member bonds. For Medicare Advantage, final 2017 rates were announced on April 4. These were in line with our expectations of an approximate 1%. 
In conclusion, with first quarter results, we're off to a good start in 2016. We expect this momentum to continue throughout the year. We are on track with our integration of Health Net. Our synergy targets remain $75 million for the first 12 months following the close, and $150 million in the second 12 months following the close. While we remain committed to long-term margin expansion, we continue to expect the 2016 pretax margin to remain relatively flat compared to 2015 as we focus on integration. Our growth pipeline is bigger than ever with the additional products and capabilities in Health Net. We are optimistic about the future and our ability to expand Centene's leadership position in government-sponsored health care. 
As a reminder, our Investor Day is on June 17 in New York City. We look forward to seeing you then. We thank you for your continued interest in Centene. 
Jeff will now provide further details on our first quarter financial results. Jeff?"
26273,322819850,963201,"Centene Corp., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2016",2016-04-26,"Earnings Calls","Centene Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Michael, and good morning. This morning, I will begin with highlighting the results for the first quarter of 2016, and then provide an update on our 2016 full year guidance, including the acquisition of Health Net. First, I would like to high",1676,"Thank you, Michael, and good morning. This morning, I will begin with highlighting the results for the first quarter of 2016, and then provide an update on our 2016 full year guidance, including the acquisition of Health Net. 
First, I would like to highlight the effect of the Health Net transaction on the first quarter 2016 results. As previously announced, we completed the acquisition of Health Net on March 24, 2016, for a purchase price of $6 billion, including the assumption of debt. In connection with the completion of the acquisition, we incurred approximately $189 million or $0.83 per diluted share of transaction cost, which includes accelerated stock compensation service, investment banking fees, legal costs and the pertinent value of a $65 million charitable donation under agreements with the U.S. regulatory agencies. Additionally, we have included 8 days of Health Net activity in our first quarter of 2016 results. The 8 days of activity represents approximately $350 million of revenue and had a minimal effect on our HBR, G&A ratio and adjusted diluted earnings per share. 
Now onto the first quarter highlights. For the first quarter, membership of 11.5 million members, an increase of 162% for 2 years driven by the Health Net acquisition. Total revenues were approximately $7 billion, an increase of 36% over Q1 in 2015. Diluted loss per share for the first quarter of 2016 was $0.13, and adjusted diluted earnings per share is $0.74, when excluding Health Net acquisition costs and intangible amortization, compared to $0.55 on an adjusted basis last year. 
In more detail, total revenues grew by $1.8 billion in the first quarter, primarily as a result of expansions or new programs in many of our states in 2015, growth of the Health Insurance Marketplace business, and 8 days of revenue from the Health Net acquisition. Our health benefits ratio was 88.7% in the first quarter of this year compared to 89.8% in last year's first quarter or 88% for the fourth quarter. The 110 basis point decrease year-over-year was also an improvement in the overall HBR for higher-achieving membership particularly long-term care, and growth in the Health Insurance Marketplace membership, which continues to perform well. 
Sequentially, the 70 basis point increase from the fourth quarter reflects [indiscernible] of the flu season which was more fragmented in the first quarter of 2016. For the first quarter, 18% of premium in service revenues came from new visits compared to 23% in the first quarter of 2015. The existing business metrics in the quarter includes Health Net since the acquisition date, and we expect the percentage of revenue from new business to decrease to a single-digit percentage by the end of the year due to the larger revenue base and the denominator. The health benefits ratio for new business were 96 -- 90.6% and 88.3% for existing business in the first quarter. 
The Health Insurance Marketplace product continues to perform well in 2016 with over 680,000 members at March 31. With the addition of Health Net, we continue to be in a net stable position for the risk corridor and risk adjustment components of the 3Rs. As part of our initial asset valuation procedures associated with the acquisition, we have reduced the fixed value of the Health Net in this quarter, and this equals to 0. Additionally, consistent with our historical accounting practice and guidance, we will not report any risk corridors from 2016. Our general and administrative expense ratio was 11.3% in the first quarter this year or 8.3% without the cost associated with the Health Net acquisition compared to 8.3% last year and 8.7% in the fourth quarter, also excluding Health Net acquisition costs. The decrease from the fourth quarter of 2015 reflects the reduction in cost related to global [indiscernible] period with the Health Insurance Marketplace product.
During the first quarter, we incurred $0.02 per diluted share of business expansion cost compared to $0.06 from the prior year. Investment and other income was $15 billion in the first quarter compared with $9 million last year and $8 million in the fourth quarter. Interest expense was $33 million for the first quarter of 2016 compared to $10 million for the first quarter last year, and $11 million in the fourth quarter of last year. The increase is due to the issuance of $2.4 billion of senior notes on February 11, 2016, to fund the cash portion of the consideration for the Health Net acquisition. Consistent with what we have done in the past with managing our balance sheet exposure to short-term interest rates, on March 30, 2016, we introduced the interest rate swap agreements for a notional amount of $1.6 billion converting a substantial portion of our senior notes to a floating rate of interest at the three month LIBOR plus 4.36%. We've acquired tax expense of $17 million on pretax income of $2 million for the first quarter of 2016 due to the non-deductibility of certain Health Net acquisition costs as well as the nondeductibility of the health insured fee. GAAP diluted loss per share from continuing operations for the first quarter was $0.13. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the first quarter was $0.74. Adjusted diluted earnings per share excludes $0.83 associated with the Health Net acquisition costs and $0.04 associated with the [indiscernible] litigation.
Cash and investments totaled almost $8 billion at quarter-end, including $139 million held by unregulated subsidiaries. We estimate our NAIC risk-based capital percentage to be in excess of 350% of the Authorized Control Level. Debt on March 31 was $4.3 billion, including $515 million of borrowings on our revolver. Our debt-to-capital ratio is 44.3%, excluding our non-recourse mortgage note compared to 34.7% in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
Our medical claim liability totaled $3.9 million at March 31, representing 42 days in claims payable normalizing with the Health Net acquisition. During the first quarter, we made provisional estimates for the fair value of the medical claims liability associated with Health Net. We have not completed our fair valuation exercise, and we announced this certainly could change. Any change to the provisional estimates will be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance sheet and will have no effect on net earnings. Cash flow from operations is $195 million in the first quarter compared to $45 million in the first quarter of 2015. Additionally, you will note that we have adjusted our reporting this quarter to reflect the scale of the business with the new product. We believe this provides meaningful information to investors and will continue to evolve with the complete integration of Health Net. 
This concludes my remarks for the first quarter results. Now I would like to provide an update on our full year guidance. We have adjusted our 2016 guidance to reflect March 2016 closing with the Health Net acquisition. We have lowered the top and bottom end of the revenue guidance by $1 billion, lowered both ends of our adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance by $0.05 to reflect the transaction closing shifting to March 1 from 24. Change in closing date does not have an impact on our run rate revenues or earnings. We now expect total revenues to be between $39 billion and $39.8 billion which represents an increase of approximately 73% of the midpoint of our guidance numbers as compared to 2015. Our 2016 guidance for health benefits ratio is 87% to 87.5%, a decrease from 2015 of approximately 160 basis points at the midpoint of the guidance numbers. 
Reduction in HBR, year-over-year, is due to the addition of Health Net, which operates in the lower HBR due to the higher mix of commercial business and growth in the health insurance marketplace, which operates with a lower HBR and higher G&A ratio. 
General and administrative expense ratio is expected to be between 9.4% and 9.9% in 2016. On an adjusted basis, when excluding acquisition costs, the G&A ratio is expected to increase by 75 basis points between years to 9% to 9.5%. This increase is due to the addition of Health Net, which operates at a higher general administrative  expense ratio due to the mix of business, offset by additional leverage associated with revenue growth and cost savings. 
Other revenue and expense, interest income is forecasted to be between $90 million and $100 million, and interest expense is estimated to be between $180 million to $190 million. We estimate business expansion cost of $0.25 to $0.30 in 2016. We estimate that our effective income tax rate for 2016, excluding noncontrolling interest, will be 55% to 57%. The relatively high effective tax rate reflects the impact of nondeductibility of the health insurer fee and the nondeductibility of certain acquisition costs associated with the Health Net acquisition. In 2016, we anticipate the health insurer fee increases to approximate $450 million. We estimate our diluted shares outstanding to be between 162.5 to 163.5 million shares. In 2016, we expect GAAP diluted earnings per share to be between $2.45 to $2.80, adjusted diluted earnings per share to be between $4 and $4.35. These amounts include Health Net and related synergies for 9 months and 8 days in 2016. Adjusted diluted earnings per share excludes 2 items: first, the amortization of intangible assets associated with the acquisitions which we estimate to be between $0.50 and $0.55 per share; and two, Health Net acquisition-related expenses, which we estimate to be between $1 and $1.05 per diluted share. Additionally, our guidance assumes no receivables with the Affordable Programs and payables for e risk adjusted premium in 2016. 
We believe the guidance we now provided today are generally for participants the financial information, is like a proxy statement adjusted to include only 9 months and 8 days of Health Net activity due to the March 23 closing. We continue to expect $75 million of net synergies in the next 12 months, following closing of this transaction. We estimate our operating cash flow to be between 1.5 to 2x net earnings. 
That concludes my remarks. And operator, you may now open the lines for questions."

So I mean, realistically, we should only be responsible for 8 days of March, right? So that's the work that we're looking to complete in the second quarter."

26273,322819850,963441,"Centene Corp., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2016",2016-04-26,"Earnings Calls","Centene Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Ed. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Centene's First Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. We are very pleased to have closed the Health Net acquisition within the first quarter, as projected. I would like to begin with a few comments",1493,"Thank you, Ed. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Centene's First Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. We are very pleased to have closed the Health Net acquisition within the first quarter, as projected. 
I would like to begin with a few comments on why the addition of Health Net is transformational. In closing the acquisition, Centene has achieved the following: further critical mass, including additional product diversification within the government-sponsored health care space. We are a $40 billion-plus company. We are the largest Medicaid managed care organization in the country, serving 6.7 million Medicaid members at March 31. We are the leader in 3 of the largest Medicaid states: California, Texas and Florida. We are the largest provider of managed long-term support services, one of the fastest-growing segments of the market. We have a 4-star Medicare Advantage product that can be exported to additional markets, and we provide services under contracts with the U.S. Department of Defense and Veterans Affairs. This greater scale enhances the positive view of Centene nationally as well as by state and local governments. It strengthens our ability to help shape sound public health care policy. In addition, it enhances our purchasing power and is beneficial from a balance sheet perspective. 
Centene is now clearly a large-cap company, in stock. We recently joined the S&P 500 Index. This is important to us as this index is regarded as the best single gauge of large-cap U.S. equities. Additionally, it will widen our potential investor base and lead to increased liquidity of our stock. Lastly, this acquisition enhances and solidifies the sustainability of Centene's long-term growth rate. 
I would now like to comment on the timing of the approval process and provide an update on integration. While the regulatory process in California was lengthier than expected, it was fair and the undertakings contained no surprises. We will be making investments in certain state-affiliated investment-grade vehicles as well as in a local service center. The placement of a service center in California is consistent with Centene's local approach. We will work with the state to find a suitable location in an economically disadvantaged area where job creation is needed. The investments and charitable contributions associated with these undertakings have been included in our guidance and will be made over a multiple-year period. The planning portion of the integration process was largely completed prior to closing. Our integration team did extensive work to ensure a smooth and seamless combination. We were able to hit the ground running the day of the close, and the integration is proceeding as expected. 
Before I provide first quarter highlights, I want to remind you that our first quarter results included only 8 days of Health Net's financials as the transaction closed on March 24. Our prior guidance had assumed a March 1 close date. We have updated our 2016 guidance to reflect the later close. This is a timing issue only, and we remain confident that our previously anticipated run rate earnings remain on track. Additionally, we have adjusted our reporting to reflect the increased scale of the business and our new product mix. We believe this provides meaningful information to investors, and it will continue to evolve as we complete the Health Net integration. 
Turning to the first quarter financials. We are pleased with the results of the first quarter. There were many moving parts when combining the 2 companies, including onetime charges and prorating [indiscernible].
Total revenues increased 36% year-over-year to $7 billion. Membership at quarter-end was 11.5 million, representing an increase of 7.1 million members or 162% over the first quarter of 2015. The HBR improved 110 basis points year-over-year to 88.7%. The first quarter pretax margin, excluding acquisition-related cost, improved 30 basis points year-over-year to 3%. We reported adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.74. This compares to $0.55 in the first quarter of 2015. Jeff will provide further financial details, including the updated 2016 guidance, in his prepared remarks. 
A quick note on flu. We saw an uptick in flu during the first quarter. The flu appears to have peaked in March, and overall costs were in line with our expectations. Overall, we continue to see as well as anticipate stable medical cost trends. 
Next, market and product updates. First, we will discuss recent Medicaid activity. 
Washington State. In April, Centene commenced operations under the Apple foster care contract in Washington, as the sole provider for this program. The contract is performing in line with expectations, and we anticipate serving over 20,000 foster children. With the addition of this contract, Centene will serve approximately 100,000 foster care beneficiaries across all of our markets. 
Nebraska. Also in April, Centene executed a contract with Nebraska as 1 of 3 managed care organizations to administer the state's new Heritage Health program, which covers 230 Medicaid CHIP and ABD enrollees. This contract is expected to commence in the first quarter of 2017. 
Texas. We expect the STAR Kids contract in Texas to commence in the latter part of 2016. Centene is the only managed care organization in Texas to participate in all of the state's Medicaid and Medicaid-related product lines. 
Next, Medicaid expansion. At March 31, we served approximately 985,000 Medicaid expansion members in 9 states. This represents an increase of more than 650,000 recipients over the first quarter of 2015. This growth was primarily driven by the addition of Health Net's Medicaid expansion members. In January, the Governor of Louisiana signed an Executive Order to expand Medicaid coverage under the ACA. This is expected to be begin in July, and is now included in our updated 2016 guidance. 
Now Medicare and duals. At March 31, we served over 303,000 Medicare and dual beneficiaries. We continue to expect to launch additional Medicare Advantage brands in 4 Centene states in 2017. The new Medicare Advantage brands will be launched under our 4-star banner, which will give us the benefit of incremental premium revenues. 
Next, Health Insurance Marketplace. Centene's exchange experience continues to be favorable, and we are achieving margins at the higher end of our targeted range. Our marketplace strategy has been and continues to be focused on targeted low-income, subsidized individuals, many of whom were previously Medicaid-eligible. We designed our exchange solution to be able to leverage our Medicaid platform, including provider networks. In the majority of our markets, we have both Medicaid and market-based product offerings. We coined the term 'churn' to reference those members who can retain coverage through a high-quality, affordable Centene product in either Medicaid or the exchange. In the first quarter, over 90% of our exchange members were subsidy eligible, this is consistent with 2014 and 2015. 
Centene has maintained a disciplined approach to pricing from day 1. In fact, we are in a net payable position for the 3Rs program. At March 31, we served over 680,000 exchange members across 15 states. At year-end, we expect over 550,000 exchange beneficiaries due to the normal attrition. 
Now Centurion. Our correctional health business continues to successfully expand. At March 31, we served 59,000 correctional members, representing year-over-year growth of 38%. In April, Centurion replaced its existing 1-year contract in Mississippi with a new 3-year contract, which is expected to commence in July. Also in April, we began providing correctional health services in 3 regions in Florida. This marks Centurion's 6th state population. 
Finally, commercial. We ended the first quarter with over 830,000 commercial members. We are fully committed to the success of the existing business, especially in California. However, we have no plans at this time to expand into additional states. 
Shifting gears to our rate outlook. For Medicaid, we continue to expect the 2016 composite rate adjustment of between 0 and 1%, consistent with the past 2 years. We have known rates for our Medicaid business representing approximately 65% of the projected 2016 member months. For Medicare Advantage, final 2017 rates were announced on April 4. These were in line with our expectations of an approximate 1%. 
In conclusion, with first quarter results, we're off to a good start in 2016. We expect this momentum to continue throughout the year. We are on track with our integration of Health Net. Our synergy targets remain $75 million for the first 12 months following the close, and $150 million in the second 12 months following the close. While we remain committed to long-term margin expansion, we continue to expect the 2016 pretax margin to remain relatively flat compared to 2015 as we focus on integration. Our growth pipeline is bigger than ever with the additional products and capabilities in Health Net. We are optimistic about the future and our ability to expand Centene's leadership position in government-sponsored health care. 
As a reminder, our Investor Day is on June 17 in New York City. We look forward to seeing you then. We thank you for your continued interest in Centene. 
Jeff will now provide further details on our first quarter financial results. Jeff?"
26273,322819850,963441,"Centene Corp., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2016",2016-04-26,"Earnings Calls","Centene Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Michael, and good morning. This morning, I will begin with highlighting the results for the first quarter of 2016, and then provide an update on our 2016 full year guidance, including the acquisition of Health Net. First, I would like to high",1685,"Thank you, Michael, and good morning. This morning, I will begin with highlighting the results for the first quarter of 2016, and then provide an update on our 2016 full year guidance, including the acquisition of Health Net. 
First, I would like to highlight the effect of the Health Net transaction on the first quarter 2016 results. As previously announced, we completed the acquisition of Health Net on March 24, 2016, for a purchase price of $6 billion, including the assumption of debt. In connection with the completion of the acquisition, we incurred approximately $189 million or $0.83 per diluted share of transaction cost, which includes accelerated stock compensation, severance, investment banking fees, legal costs and the present value of a $65 million charitable donation under agreements with the U.S. regulatory agencies. Additionally, we have included 8 days of Health Net activity in our first quarter of 2016 results. The 8 days of activity represents approximately $350 million of revenue and had a minimal effect on our HBR, G&A ratio and adjusted diluted earnings per share. 
Now onto the first quarter highlights. For the first quarter, membership was 11.5 million members, an increase of 162% between years, driven by the Health Net acquisition. Total revenues were approximately $7 billion, an increase of 36% over Q1 in 2015. Diluted loss per share for the first quarter of 2016 was $0.13, and adjusted diluted earnings per share is $0.74, when excluding Health Net acquisition costs and intangible amortization, compared to $0.55 on an adjusted basis last year. 
In more detail, total revenues grew by $1.8 billion in the first quarter, primarily as a result of expansions or new programs in many of our states in 2015, growth of the Health Insurance Marketplace business, and 8 days of revenue from the Health Net acquisition. Our health benefits ratio was 88.7% in the first quarter of this year compared to 89.8% in last year's first quarter or 88% for the fourth quarter. The 110 basis point decrease year-over-year was lost from the improvement in the overall HBR for higher-achieving membership, particularly long-term care, and growth in the Health Insurance Marketplace membership, which continues to perform well. 
Sequentially, the 70 basis point increase from the fourth quarter reflects a later start to the flu season, which was more fragmented [ph] in the first quarter of 2016. For the first quarter, 18% of premium and service revenues came from new business compared to 23% in the first quarter of 2015. The existing business metrics in the quarter includes Health Net since the acquisition date, and we expect the percentage of revenue from new business to decrease to a single-digit percentage by the end of the year due to the larger revenue base in the denominator. The health benefits ratio for new business were 96 -- 90.6% and 88.3% for existing business in the first quarter. 
The Health Insurance Marketplace product continues to perform well in 2016 with over 680,000 members at March 31. With the addition of Health Net, we continue to be in a net payable position for the risk corridor and risk adjustment components of the 3Rs. As part of our initial fair valuation procedures associated with the acquisition, we have reduced the fixed [ph] value of the Health Net risk corridor receivables to 0. Additionally, consistent with our historical accounting practice and guidance, we will not report any risk corridor receivables from the 2016 benefit year. Our general and administrative expense ratio was 11.3% in the first quarter this year or 8.3% without the cost associated with the Health Net acquisition compared to 8.3% last year and 8.7% in the fourth quarter, also excluding Health Net acquisition costs. The decrease from the fourth quarter of 2015 reflects the reduction in cost related to the open enrollment period for the Health Insurance Marketplace product.
During the first quarter, we incurred $0.02 per diluted share of business expansion cost compared to $0.06 in the prior year. Investment and other income was $15 million in the first quarter compared with $9 million last year and $8 million in the fourth quarter. Interest expense was $33 million for the first quarter of 2016 compared to $10 million for the first quarter last year and $11 million in the fourth quarter of last year. The increase is due to the issuance of $2.4 billion of senior notes on February 11, 2016, to fund the cash portion of the consideration for the Health Net acquisition. Consistent with what we have done in the past with managing our balance sheet exposure to short-term interest rates, on March 30, 2016, we entered into interest rate swap agreements for a notional amount of $1.6 billion, converting a substantial portion of our senior notes to a floating rate of interest at the 3-month LIBOR plus 4.36%. We're reporting tax expense of $17 million on pretax income of $2 million for the first quarter of 2016 due to the nondeductibility of certain Health Net acquisition costs as well as the nondeductibility of the health insurer fee. GAAP diluted loss per share from continuing operations for the first quarter was $0.13. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the first quarter was $0.74. Adjusted diluted earnings per share excludes $0.83 associated with the Health Net acquisition costs and $0.04 associated with the [indiscernible] litigation.
Cash and investments totaled almost $8 billion at quarter-end, including $139 million held by unregulated subsidiaries. We estimate our NAIC risk-based capital percentage to be in excess of 350% of the Authorized Control Level. Debt on March 31 was $4.3 billion, including $515 million of borrowings on our revolver. Our debt-to-capital ratio is 44.3% excluding our non-recourse mortgage note compared to 34.7% in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
Our medical claim liability totaled $3.9 billion at March 31, representing 42 days in claims payable normalizing for the Health Net acquisition. During the first quarter, we made provisional estimates for the fair value of the medical claims liability associated with Health Net. We have not completed our fair valuation exercise, and the amounts we set could change. Any change to the provisional estimates will be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance sheet and will have no effect on net earnings. Cash flow from operations was $195 million in the first quarter compared to $45 million in the first quarter of 2015. Additionally, you will note that we have adjusted our reporting this quarter to reflect the scale of the business with the new product. We believe this provides meaningful information to investors and will continue to evolve as we complete integration of Health Net. 
This concludes my remarks for the first quarter results. Now I would like to provide an update on our full year guidance. We have adjusted our 2016 guidance to reflect the March 24 closing of the Health Net acquisition. We have lowered the top and bottom end of the revenue guidance by $1 billion, lowered both ends of our adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance by $0.05 to reflect the transaction closing shifting from March 1 to the 24. Change in closing date does not have an impact on our run rate revenues or earnings. We now expect total revenues to be between $39 billion and $39.8 billion, which represents an increase of approximately 73% of the midpoint of our guidance numbers as compared to 2015. Our 2016 guidance for our health benefits ratio is 87% to 87.5%, a decrease from 2015 of approximately 160 basis points at the midpoint of the guidance numbers. 
Reduction in HBR, year-over-year, is due to the addition of Health Net, which operates at a lower HBR due to the higher mix of commercial business and growth in the Health Insurance Marketplace, which operates at a lower HBR and higher G&A ratio. 
General and administrative expense ratio is expected to be between 9.4% and 9.9% in 2016. On an adjusted basis, when excluding acquisition costs, the G&A ratio is expected to increase by 75 basis points between years to 9% to 9.5%. This increase is due to the addition of Health Net, which operates at a higher general administrative expense ratio due to the mix of business, offset by additional leverage associated with revenue growth and cost savings. 
Other revenue and expense interest income is forecasted to be between $90 million and $100 million, and interest expense is estimated to be between $180 million to $190 million. We estimate business expansion cost of $0.25 to $0.30 in 2016. We estimate that our effective income tax rate for 2016, excluding noncontrolling interest, will be 55% to 57%. The relatively high effective tax rate reflects the impact of nondeductibility of the health insurer fee and the nondeductibility of certain acquisition costs associated with the Health Net acquisition. In 2016, we anticipate the health insurer fee increases to approximate $450 million. We estimate our diluted shares outstanding to be between 162.5 million to 163.5 million shares. In 2016, we expect GAAP diluted earnings per share to be between $2.45 to $2.80, adjusted diluted earnings per share to be between $4 and $4.35. These amounts include Health Net and related synergies for 9 months and 8 days in 2016. Adjusted diluted earnings per share excludes 2 items: first, the amortization of intangible assets associated with the acquisitions, which we estimate to be between $0.50 and $0.55 per share; and two, Health Net acquisition-related expenses, which we estimate to be between $1 and $1.05 per diluted share. Additionally, our guidance assumes no receivables for the Affordable [ph] Programs and payables for risk-adjusted programs in 2016. 
We believe the guidance we now provided today are generally consistent with the financial information in the [indiscernible] proxy statement, adjusted to include only 9 months and 8 days of Health Net activity due to the March 24 closing date. We continue to expect $75 million of net synergies in the next 12 months following closing of this transaction. We estimate our operating cash flow to be between 1.5 to 2x net earnings. 
That concludes my remarks. And operator, you may now open the lines for questions."

26273,322819850,963763,"Centene Corp., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2016",2016-04-26,"Earnings Calls","Centene Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Ed. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Centene's First Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. We are very pleased to have closed the Health Net acquisition within the first quarter, as projected. I would like to begin with a few comments",1493,"Thank you, Ed. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Centene's First Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. We are very pleased to have closed the Health Net acquisition within the first quarter, as projected. 
I would like to begin with a few comments on why the addition of Health Net is transformational. In closing the acquisition, Centene has achieved the following: further critical mass, including additional product diversification within the government-sponsored health care space. We are a $40 billion-plus company. We are the largest Medicaid managed care organization in the country, serving 6.7 million Medicaid members at March 31. We are the leader in 3 of the largest Medicaid states: California, Texas and Florida. We are the largest provider of managed long-term support services, one of the fastest-growing segments of the market. We have a 4-star Medicare Advantage product that can be exported to additional markets, and we provide services under contracts with the U.S. Department of Defense and Veterans Affairs. This greater scale enhances the positive view of Centene nationally as well as by state and local governments. It strengthens our ability to help shape sound public health care policy. In addition, it enhances our purchasing power and is beneficial from a balance sheet perspective. 
Centene is now clearly a large-cap company, in stock. We recently joined the S&P 500 Index. This is important to us as this index is regarded as the best single gauge of large-cap U.S. equities. Additionally, it will widen our potential investor base and lead to increased liquidity of our stock. Lastly, this acquisition enhances and solidifies the sustainability of Centene's long-term growth rate. 
I would now like to comment on the timing of the approval process and provide an update on integration. While the regulatory process in California was lengthier than expected, it was fair and the undertakings contained no surprises. We will be making investments in certain state-affiliated investment-grade vehicles as well as in a local service center. The placement of a service center in California is consistent with Centene's local approach. We will work with the state to find a suitable location in an economically disadvantaged area where job creation is needed. The investments and charitable contributions associated with these undertakings have been included in our guidance and will be made over a multiple-year period. The planning portion of the integration process was largely completed prior to closing. Our integration team did extensive work to ensure a smooth and seamless combination. We were able to hit the ground running the day of the close, and the integration is proceeding as expected. 
Before I provide first quarter highlights, I want to remind you that our first quarter results included only 8 days of Health Net's financials as the transaction closed on March 24. Our prior guidance had assumed a March 1 close date. We have updated our 2016 guidance to reflect the later close. This is a timing issue only, and we remain confident that our previously anticipated run rate earnings remain on track. Additionally, we have adjusted our reporting to reflect the increased scale of the business and our new product mix. We believe this provides meaningful information to investors, and it will continue to evolve as we complete the Health Net integration. 
Turning to the first quarter financials. We are pleased with the results of the first quarter. There were many moving parts when combining the 2 companies, including onetime charges and prorating [indiscernible].
Total revenues increased 36% year-over-year to $7 billion. Membership at quarter-end was 11.5 million, representing an increase of 7.1 million members or 162% over the first quarter of 2015. The HBR improved 110 basis points year-over-year to 88.7%. The first quarter pretax margin, excluding acquisition-related cost, improved 30 basis points year-over-year to 3%. We reported adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.74. This compares to $0.55 in the first quarter of 2015. Jeff will provide further financial details, including the updated 2016 guidance, in his prepared remarks. 
A quick note on flu. We saw an uptick in flu during the first quarter. The flu appears to have peaked in March, and overall costs were in line with our expectations. Overall, we continue to see as well as anticipate stable medical cost trends. 
Next, market and product updates. First, we will discuss recent Medicaid activity. 
Washington State. In April, Centene commenced operations under the Apple foster care contract in Washington, as the sole provider for this program. The contract is performing in line with expectations, and we anticipate serving over 20,000 foster children. With the addition of this contract, Centene will serve approximately 100,000 foster care beneficiaries across all of our markets. 
Nebraska. Also in April, Centene executed a contract with Nebraska as 1 of 3 managed care organizations to administer the state's new Heritage Health program, which covers 230 Medicaid CHIP and ABD enrollees. This contract is expected to commence in the first quarter of 2017. 
Texas. We expect the STAR Kids contract in Texas to commence in the latter part of 2016. Centene is the only managed care organization in Texas to participate in all of the state's Medicaid and Medicaid-related product lines. 
Next, Medicaid expansion. At March 31, we served approximately 985,000 Medicaid expansion members in 9 states. This represents an increase of more than 650,000 recipients over the first quarter of 2015. This growth was primarily driven by the addition of Health Net's Medicaid expansion members. In January, the Governor of Louisiana signed an Executive Order to expand Medicaid coverage under the ACA. This is expected to be begin in July, and is now included in our updated 2016 guidance. 
Now Medicare and duals. At March 31, we served over 303,000 Medicare and dual beneficiaries. We continue to expect to launch additional Medicare Advantage brands in 4 Centene states in 2017. The new Medicare Advantage brands will be launched under our 4-star banner, which will give us the benefit of incremental premium revenues. 
Next, Health Insurance Marketplace. Centene's exchange experience continues to be favorable, and we are achieving margins at the higher end of our targeted range. Our marketplace strategy has been and continues to be focused on targeted low-income, subsidized individuals, many of whom were previously Medicaid-eligible. We designed our exchange solution to be able to leverage our Medicaid platform, including provider networks. In the majority of our markets, we have both Medicaid and market-based product offerings. We coined the term 'churn' to reference those members who can retain coverage through a high-quality, affordable Centene product in either Medicaid or the exchange. In the first quarter, over 90% of our exchange members were subsidy eligible, this is consistent with 2014 and 2015. 
Centene has maintained a disciplined approach to pricing from day 1. In fact, we are in a net payable position for the 3Rs program. At March 31, we served over 680,000 exchange members across 15 states. At year-end, we expect over 550,000 exchange beneficiaries due to the normal attrition. 
Now Centurion. Our correctional health business continues to successfully expand. At March 31, we served 59,000 correctional members, representing year-over-year growth of 38%. In April, Centurion replaced its existing 1-year contract in Mississippi with a new 3-year contract, which is expected to commence in July. Also in April, we began providing correctional health services in 3 regions in Florida. This marks Centurion's 6th state population. 
Finally, commercial. We ended the first quarter with over 830,000 commercial members. We are fully committed to the success of the existing business, especially in California. However, we have no plans at this time to expand into additional states. 
Shifting gears to our rate outlook. For Medicaid, we continue to expect the 2016 composite rate adjustment of between 0 and 1%, consistent with the past 2 years. We have known rates for our Medicaid business representing approximately 65% of the projected 2016 member months. For Medicare Advantage, final 2017 rates were announced on April 4. These were in line with our expectations of an approximate 1%. 
In conclusion, with first quarter results, we're off to a good start in 2016. We expect this momentum to continue throughout the year. We are on track with our integration of Health Net. Our synergy targets remain $75 million for the first 12 months following the close, and $150 million in the second 12 months following the close. While we remain committed to long-term margin expansion, we continue to expect the 2016 pretax margin to remain relatively flat compared to 2015 as we focus on integration. Our growth pipeline is bigger than ever with the additional products and capabilities in Health Net. We are optimistic about the future and our ability to expand Centene's leadership position in government-sponsored health care. 
As a reminder, our Investor Day is on June 17 in New York City. We look forward to seeing you then. We thank you for your continued interest in Centene. 
Jeff will now provide further details on our first quarter financial results. Jeff?"
26273,322819850,963763,"Centene Corp., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2016",2016-04-26,"Earnings Calls","Centene Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Michael, and good morning. This morning, I will begin with highlighting the results for the first quarter of 2016, and then provide an update on our 2016 full year guidance, including the acquisition of Health Net. First, I would like to high",1685,"Thank you, Michael, and good morning. This morning, I will begin with highlighting the results for the first quarter of 2016, and then provide an update on our 2016 full year guidance, including the acquisition of Health Net. 
First, I would like to highlight the effect of the Health Net transaction on the first quarter 2016 results. As previously announced, we completed the acquisition of Health Net on March 24, 2016, for a purchase price of $6 billion, including the assumption of debt. In connection with the completion of the acquisition, we incurred approximately $189 million or $0.83 per diluted share of transaction cost, which includes accelerated stock compensation, severance, investment banking fees, legal costs and the present value of a $65 million charitable donation under agreements with the U.S. regulatory agencies. Additionally, we have included 8 days of Health Net activity in our first quarter of 2016 results. The 8 days of activity represents approximately $350 million of revenue and had a minimal effect on our HBR, G&A ratio and adjusted diluted earnings per share. 
Now onto the first quarter highlights. For the first quarter, membership was 11.5 million members, an increase of 162% between years, driven by the Health Net acquisition. Total revenues were approximately $7 billion, an increase of 36% over Q1 in 2015. Diluted loss per share for the first quarter of 2016 was $0.13, and adjusted diluted earnings per share is $0.74, when excluding Health Net acquisition costs and intangible amortization, compared to $0.55 on an adjusted basis last year. 
In more detail, total revenues grew by $1.8 billion in the first quarter, primarily as a result of expansions or new programs in many of our states in 2015, growth of the Health Insurance Marketplace business, and 8 days of revenue from the Health Net acquisition. Our health benefits ratio was 88.7% in the first quarter of this year compared to 89.8% in last year's first quarter or 88% for the fourth quarter. The 110 basis point decrease year-over-year was lost from the improvement in the overall HBR for higher-achieving membership, particularly long-term care, and growth in the Health Insurance Marketplace membership, which continues to perform well. 
Sequentially, the 70 basis point increase from the fourth quarter reflects a later start to the flu season, which was more fragmented [ph] in the first quarter of 2016. For the first quarter, 18% of premium and service revenues came from new business compared to 23% in the first quarter of 2015. The existing business metrics in the quarter includes Health Net since the acquisition date, and we expect the percentage of revenue from new business to decrease to a single-digit percentage by the end of the year due to the larger revenue base in the denominator. The health benefits ratio for new business were 96 -- 90.6% and 88.3% for existing business in the first quarter. 
The Health Insurance Marketplace product continues to perform well in 2016 with over 680,000 members at March 31. With the addition of Health Net, we continue to be in a net payable position for the risk corridor and risk adjustment components of the 3Rs. As part of our initial fair valuation procedures associated with the acquisition, we have reduced the fixed [ph] value of the Health Net risk corridor receivables to 0. Additionally, consistent with our historical accounting practice and guidance, we will not report any risk corridor receivables from the 2016 benefit year. Our general and administrative expense ratio was 11.3% in the first quarter this year or 8.3% without the cost associated with the Health Net acquisition compared to 8.3% last year and 8.7% in the fourth quarter, also excluding Health Net acquisition costs. The decrease from the fourth quarter of 2015 reflects the reduction in cost related to the open enrollment period for the Health Insurance Marketplace product.
During the first quarter, we incurred $0.02 per diluted share of business expansion cost compared to $0.06 in the prior year. Investment and other income was $15 million in the first quarter compared with $9 million last year and $8 million in the fourth quarter. Interest expense was $33 million for the first quarter of 2016 compared to $10 million for the first quarter last year and $11 million in the fourth quarter of last year. The increase is due to the issuance of $2.4 billion of senior notes on February 11, 2016, to fund the cash portion of the consideration for the Health Net acquisition. Consistent with what we have done in the past with managing our balance sheet exposure to short-term interest rates, on March 30, 2016, we entered into interest rate swap agreements for a notional amount of $1.6 billion, converting a substantial portion of our senior notes to a floating rate of interest at the 3-month LIBOR plus 4.36%. We're reporting tax expense of $17 million on pretax income of $2 million for the first quarter of 2016 due to the nondeductibility of certain Health Net acquisition costs as well as the nondeductibility of the health insurer fee. GAAP diluted loss per share from continuing operations for the first quarter was $0.13. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the first quarter was $0.74. Adjusted diluted earnings per share excludes $0.83 associated with the Health Net acquisition costs and $0.04 associated with the [indiscernible] litigation.
Cash and investments totaled almost $8 billion at quarter-end, including $139 million held by unregulated subsidiaries. We estimate our NAIC risk-based capital percentage to be in excess of 350% of the Authorized Control Level. Debt on March 31 was $4.3 billion, including $515 million of borrowings on our revolver. Our debt-to-capital ratio is 44.3% excluding our non-recourse mortgage note compared to 34.7% in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
Our medical claim liability totaled $3.9 billion at March 31, representing 42 days in claims payable normalizing for the Health Net acquisition. During the first quarter, we made provisional estimates for the fair value of the medical claims liability associated with Health Net. We have not completed our fair valuation exercise, and the amounts we set could change. Any change to the provisional estimates will be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance sheet and will have no effect on net earnings. Cash flow from operations was $195 million in the first quarter compared to $45 million in the first quarter of 2015. Additionally, you will note that we have adjusted our reporting this quarter to reflect the scale of the business with the new product. We believe this provides meaningful information to investors and will continue to evolve as we complete integration of Health Net. 
This concludes my remarks for the first quarter results. Now I would like to provide an update on our full year guidance. We have adjusted our 2016 guidance to reflect the March 24 closing of the Health Net acquisition. We have lowered the top and bottom end of the revenue guidance by $1 billion, lowered both ends of our adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance by $0.05 to reflect the transaction closing shifting from March 1 to the 24. Change in closing date does not have an impact on our run rate revenues or earnings. We now expect total revenues to be between $39 billion and $39.8 billion, which represents an increase of approximately 73% of the midpoint of our guidance numbers as compared to 2015. Our 2016 guidance for our health benefits ratio is 87% to 87.5%, a decrease from 2015 of approximately 160 basis points at the midpoint of the guidance numbers. 
Reduction in HBR, year-over-year, is due to the addition of Health Net, which operates at a lower HBR due to the higher mix of commercial business and growth in the Health Insurance Marketplace, which operates at a lower HBR and higher G&A ratio. 
General and administrative expense ratio is expected to be between 9.4% and 9.9% in 2016. On an adjusted basis, when excluding acquisition costs, the G&A ratio is expected to increase by 75 basis points between years to 9% to 9.5%. This increase is due to the addition of Health Net, which operates at a higher general administrative expense ratio due to the mix of business, offset by additional leverage associated with revenue growth and cost savings. 
Other revenue and expense interest income is forecasted to be between $90 million and $100 million, and interest expense is estimated to be between $180 million to $190 million. We estimate business expansion cost of $0.25 to $0.30 in 2016. We estimate that our effective income tax rate for 2016, excluding noncontrolling interest, will be 55% to 57%. The relatively high effective tax rate reflects the impact of nondeductibility of the health insurer fee and the nondeductibility of certain acquisition costs associated with the Health Net acquisition. In 2016, we anticipate the health insurer fee increases to approximate $450 million. We estimate our diluted shares outstanding to be between 162.5 million to 163.5 million shares. In 2016, we expect GAAP diluted earnings per share to be between $2.45 to $2.80, adjusted diluted earnings per share to be between $4 and $4.35. These amounts include Health Net and related synergies for 9 months and 8 days in 2016. Adjusted diluted earnings per share excludes 2 items: first, the amortization of intangible assets associated with the acquisitions, which we estimate to be between $0.50 and $0.55 per share; and two, Health Net acquisition-related expenses, which we estimate to be between $1 and $1.05 per diluted share. Additionally, our guidance assumes no receivables for the Affordable [ph] Programs and payables for risk-adjusted programs in 2016. 
We believe the guidance we now provided today are generally consistent with the financial information in the [indiscernible] proxy statement, adjusted to include only 9 months and 8 days of Health Net activity due to the March 24 closing date. We continue to expect $75 million of net synergies in the next 12 months following closing of this transaction. We estimate our operating cash flow to be between 1.5 to 2x net earnings. 
That concludes my remarks. And operator, you may now open the lines for questions."

During the course of this morning's call, we will discuss our second quarter results and provide updates on Centene's markets and products. Additio",1311,"Thank you, Ed. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Centene Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. During the course of this morning's call, we will discuss our second quarter results and provide updates on Centene's markets and products. Additionally, we will bring you up to date on the Health Net integration and the fair value analysis of legacy Health Net's balance sheet. 
Let me begin with a few comments on second quarter results. The second quarter marks Centene's first full quarter with Health Net. Overall, we are pleased with our operating performance, which is marked by strong top and bottom line growth. We recognize there have been questions regarding the Health Net balance sheet and underlying operations. Let me pause here. Are there some background problems with some of you? There were [indiscernible] consistent with our previous comments, we continued to make progress on the fair valuation of the Health Net balance sheet. Importantly, there has been no unfavorable development of the medical claims liability established at March 24. We did increase reserves for medical claims associated with disputed substance abuse treatment center cost. Additionally, we recorded premium deficiency reserves primarily associated with Arizona and California individual PPO business. We believe we have effectively address these concerns with the purchase accounting adjustments. We also believe the opening balance sheet is appropriately estimated at fair value and the PDR offset losses for certain contracts in 2016. While there are some moving parts, it is important to note these issues are not unusual in a large acquisition, and we believe they are manageable. We are addressing them in a manner consistent with Centene's approach and have taken significant actions to improve these operating results in 2017 and beyond. These include price increases, planned design changes and a significant reduction in our Arizona commercial book. Jeff will provide further details on this topic in his prepared remarks. 
Turning to second quarter financials. Total revenues increased 98% year-over-year to $10.9 billion. Membership at quarter-end was 11.4 million, representing an increase of 6.8 million beneficiaries over the second quarter of 2015. The HBR improved 250 basis points year-over-year to 86.6%. This was mainly attributable to the product mix shift from Health Net. 
Importantly, we continue to see's as well as anticipate stable medical cost trend. Lastly, we reported adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.29, which includes a $0.19 benefit related to 2015 risk adjustment and reinsurance reconciliation under the ACA. This compares to $0.76 reported in the second quarter of 2015. Jeff will provide further financial details, including updated 2016 guidance. 
Now on to the Health Net integration. As we discussed at our June Investor Day, the integration is on track or ahead of schedule in many areas. Our integration team continues to closely monitor financial and operational matrix. We have now completed the actions needed to capture over 90% of the $75 million first year synergy target. As a reminder, this target is for the first 12 months following the March 24 close of the deal. 
Additionally, we continue to believe we will achieve over $50 million [ph] in synergies in 2016 or approximately 70% of the first 12 months target. 
We have begun to transition Health Net's to Centene reserving methodology and anticipate this will be completed by the beginning of 2017. We are also on track to begin the conversion of the California plans in the Centene's medical management system in the third quarter of 2016. 
Next, market and product updates. First, we will discuss recent Medicaid activity. In Pennsylvania, in April, Centene was selected to serve Medicaid recipients enrolled in Pennsylvania's Health Choices program in 3 zones in the state. This contract was expected to commence on January 1, 2017. However, on July 21, the state reissued the RFP with a 30-day response period And an anticipated start date of April 1, 2017. We are confident in the value we demonstrated in our response to the first RFP and look forward to this potential opportunity. 
Moreover, in May, Centene specialty solutions division [indiscernible] was selected by [indiscernible] to provide health plan management services for its managed Medicaid operations effective July 1, 2017. This award highlights Centene's depth and breadth of management services packaged under the ENVOLVE brand. 
Indiana. In June, we successfully re-procured our contract in Indiana to serve Medicaid beneficiaries in the state. This new contract is expected to commence on January 1, 2017. 
Now Medicaid expansion. At June 30, we served over 1 million medicated expansion members in 9 states. This represents an increase of more than 630,000 recipients over the second quarter 2015 and is primarily driven by the acquisition of Health Net's Medicaid expansion members. In July, Centene began serving Medicaid expansion beneficiaries in Louisiana under the state's newly implemented expansion program. We currently serve over 60,000 expansion members in Louisiana. 
Moving into Medicare and duals. On June 30, we served over 300,000 Medicare and dual beneficiaries. We expect to launch additional Medicare Advantage brands in 4 Centene states in 2017. As a reminder, the new plans will be launched under our four-star banner, which will give us the benefit of incremental premium revenue. 
I would also like to reiterate that we are focused on designing and Medicare Advantage products to meet the needs of low income fees. 
Next, Health Insurance Marketplaces. Centene's exchange experience continues to be favorable, and we are achieving margins at the high end of our targeted range. I would like to remind you that Centene's exchange approach differs from most of our managed care peers. Our marketplace strategy has been and continues to be focused on targeted low-income subsidized individuals. We designed our exchange solutions to be able to leverage our Medicaid platform, including provider networks. In the second quarter, over 90% of our exchange members was subsidy-eligible. This is consistent with 2014, 2015 and the first quarter of 2016. We ended the second quarter with approximately 618,000 exchange members across 15 states. We continue to anticipate serving approximately 550,000 exchange members at year-end due to normal attrition. 
Now Centurion. Our correctional health care business continues to successfully expand. In May, Centurion was selected to provide correctional medical services as well as pharmacy services to over 7,000 inmates in New Mexico. These 2 separate contracts both commenced on June 1 and are operating in line with our expectations. New Mexico marks Centurion's 7th state of operation. At June 30, we served over 136,000 correctional members, nearly tripling the membership on a year-to-year basis. 
Turning to commercial. We ended the second quarter with over 805,000 commercial members. We remain fully committed to the success of the existing business in California. 
Finally, federal services. Last week, we were awarded a new contract with the Tri-care West region to manage their health care needs of active and retired military personnel and families. Centene will serve approximately 2.9 million eligible beneficiaries in 19 states [indiscernible] We are currently the managed care contractor for the Tri-care North region. 
The Department of Defense has reduced the number of regions from 3 to 2 as part of this procurement process. We expect the new contract to commence in the middle of 2017. 
Shifting gears to rate outlook. For Medicaid, we continue to expect a 2016 composite rate adjustment of between 0% and 1%, consistent with the past 3 years. 
In conclusion, the second quarter was significant as it was our first full quarter as a combined company. And we demonstrated our ability to execute on multiple fronts. We posted strong results. We increased full-year guidance. We won new RFPs. And the Health Net integration remains firmly on track. We continue to be optimistic about our future and our ability to extend Centene's leadership position in government-sponsored health care. 
Thank you for your interest in Centene. Jeff will now provide further details on our second quarter financial results. Jeff?"

This morning, I will begin with highlighting the results for the second quarter of 2016 and provide an update on our acquisition accounting and 2016 full year guidance. 
We had a strong second quarter of 2016. Membership was 11.4 million members, an increase of 148% between years, driven by the Health Net acquisition. Total revenues were $10.9 billion, an increase of 98% over Q2 of 2015. Diluted earnings per share for the second quarter on 2016 was $0.98. Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.29, when exuding Health Net acquisition cost and intangible amortization, compared to $0.76 on an adjusted basis last year. Diluted earnings per share and adjusted diluted earnings per share includes $0.19 per share benefit related to the reconciliation of the 2015 reinsurance and risk-adjusted provisions of the marketplace business. In more detail, total revenues grew by $5.4 billion in the second quarter, primarily as a result of a new full quarter revenue from Health Net acquisition, expansions of our new programs in many of our states in 2015 and growth in the health insurance marketplace business in 2016. Our health benefits ratio was 86.6% in the second quarter this year compared to 89.1% in last year's second quarter and 88.7% in the first quarter 2016. The 250 basis point decrease year-over-year results from including a full quarter of the Health Net acquisition and growth in the Health Insurance Marketplace business, both of which operate at lower HBR. Sequentially, the 210 basis point decrease from the first quarter reflects the effect of the Health Net acquisition, the reconciliation of the 2015 reinsurance and risk-adjusted provisions of the health insurance marketplace business and lower flu costs, which were more prevalent in the first quarter of 2016. 
And health insurance marketplace business continues to perform well in 2016 with over 618,000 members at June 30. During the second quarter, CMS released additional information related to the reinsurance and risk-adjustment provisions of the business. The reconciliation of both of these provisions for 2015 improved our pretax operating results for the second quarter by approximately $70 million or $0.19 per diluted share. This is after considering the risk-sharing contracts, primarily in California, the risk corridor and the minimum MLR. 
For 2016, we continue to record reinsurance at the 50% [ph] coinsurance rate and record the risk-adjustment utilizing the information we received from the data aggregators, consistent with 2015. 
Our general administrative expense ratio was 9.2% in the second quarter this year, or 9% without the costs associated with the Health Net acquisition, compared to 8.4% last year and 8.3% in the first quarter, also excluding Health Net acquisition costs. 
The increase year-over-year and from the first quarter of 2016 reflects a full quarter effect of the Health Net acquisition. During the second quarter, we incurred $0.04 per diluted share of business expansion costs compared to $0.05 in the prior year. Investment and other income was $32 million in the second quarter compared to $10 million last year and $15 million in the first quarter. The increase is the result of larger investment balances associated with the Health Net acquisition. 
Interest expense was $52 million for the second quarter of 2016, compared to $11 million for the second quarter last year and $33 million in the first quarter of this year. The increase is due to the full quarter effect of the transaction financing and the issuance of $500 million of additional senior notes in June of 2016. Our tax rate for the quarter was 52.7% compared to 48.8% in the prior year. The higher tax rate is driven by the acquisition on Health Net. 
GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the second quarter was $0.98, including $0.19 of additional earnings associated with the reconciliation of the reinsurance and risk adjustment provisions of the marketplace business. 
Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the second quarter was $1.29. Adjusted diluted earnings per share excludes $0.16 associated with the Health Net acquisition costs and $0.15 associated with intangible amortization. 
Cash and investments totaled $7.5 billion at quarter-end, including $196 million held by unregulated subsidiaries. We estimate our risk-based capital percentage for NAIC filers to be in excess of 350% of the authorized control level. 
Debt on June 30 was $4.5 billion, including $185 million of borrowings on our revolver. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 44.4%, excluding our nonrecourse mortgage note, compared to 44.3% at the first quarter of 2016. 
Our medical claim lability totaled $4 billion at June 30, representing 43 days in claims payable. 
Cash flow used in operations was $420 million in the second quarter. The cash flow from operations was impacted by the delay in our premium payments from several of our states as a result of their fiscal year-ends. Those payment delays decreased our operating cash flows by approximately $600 million. We subsequently have received substantially all of the delayed payments. 
Next, I want to provide an update on the Health Net acquisition accounting. During the quarter, we have made progress in updating several fair value estimates as of the acquisition date. Although we have not experienced any unfavorable development on the medical claim liabilities established at March 24, 2016, we have increased reserves by approximately $90 million during the quarter associated with disputed substance abuse treatment center claims. We expect to continue to review the reserves for the substance abuse treatment facility claims. However, we have finalized our fair valuation of the remaining medical claims lability. 
Additionally, we've recorded premium deficiency reserves of approximately $300 million, representing the fair value of underperforming contracts for the period from March 24 through December 31, 2016. The premium deficiency reserves are primarily associated with unfavorable expected performance in the following areas: first, losses in the individual commercial business, largely in California, driven by increased utilization of substance abuse treatment facilities; second, unfavorable performance in the Arizona Commercial business, reflecting the unfavorable risk pool caused by the grandmother-ing of non-ACA-compliant policies, further compounded by the lack of risk corridor benefit; and third, unfavorable performance in the Medicare business, primarily in Oregon and Arizona. We expect to continue to review the premium deficiency reserve for the substance abuse treatment facility utilization estimates. However, we have finalized our fair valuation of the remaining premium deficiency reserve liabilities. 
It's important to note we have taken steps to improve the performance of these businesses for 2017. Specifically, we have filed for rate adjustments in the individual commercial business in California more in line with our cost. And we believe the outcome of the 2017 Medicare bid process will improve the margins in Oregon. We have taken steps to mitigate the substance abuse treatment center costs in the individual Commercial business in California, including modifications to plan design. We have accelerated the integration of the Arizona Medicaid business and taken actions to reduce our exposure to the individual commercial product in that state in 2017. And we are actively working with the California Department of Insurance to ensure we maintain a competitive individual commercial product in 2017. We believe the actions we have taken will improve the operating margins in 2017. 
We have now completed our fair valuation exercise associated with intangible losses, certain tax matters and the substance abuse claims and the related PDR. I would refer you to the Form 10-Q for more extensive disclosure. 
Lastly, an update on our 2016 full year guidance. We expect total revenues of $39.4 billion to $40 billion. GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.65 to $3. Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.20 to $4.55. A consolidated health benefits ratio of 87% to 87.5%. General and administrative expense ratio of 9.4% to 9.9%. The G&A ratio, excluding transaction cost, of 9% to 9.5%. And effective income tax rate of 54.5% to 56.5%. Diluted shares outstanding of 162.5 million to 163.5 million shares. We estimate our operating cash flow to be between 1.5 to 2x net earnings. This can be influenced by the timing of payments from our states as well as the payment to states associated with minimum HBR and other return of premium programs. We estimate business expansion cost of $0.25 to $0.30 in 2016. 
That concludes my remarks. And operator, you may now open the line for questions."

During the course of this morning's call, we will discuss our second quarter results and provide updates on Centene's markets and products. Additio",1306,"Thank you, Ed. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Centene Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. During the course of this morning's call, we will discuss our second quarter results and provide updates on Centene's markets and products. Additionally, we will bring you up-to-date on the Health Net integration and the fair value analysis of legacy Health Net's balance sheet. 
Let me begin with a few comments on second quarter results. The second quarter marks Centene's first full quarter with Health Net. Overall, we are pleased with our operating performance, which is marked by strong top and bottom line growth. We recognize there have been questions regarding the Health Net balance sheet and underlying operations. Let me pause here. Are there some background problems with some of you? There were [indiscernible] consistent with our previous comments, we continue to make progress on the fair valuation of the Health Net balance sheet. Importantly, there has been no unfavorable development on the medical claims liability established at March 24. We did increase reserves for medical claims associated with disputed substance abuse treatment center cost. Additionally, we recorded premium deficiency reserves primarily associated with Arizona and California individual PPO business. We believe, we have effectively address these concerns with the purchase accounting adjustments. We also believe the opening balance sheet is appropriately estimated at fair value and the PDR's offset losses for certain contracts in 2016. While there are some moving parts, it is important to note these issues are not unusual in a large acquisition, and we believe they are manageable. We are addressing them in a manner consistent with Centene's approach and have taken significant actions to improve these operating results in 2017 and beyond. These include price increases, planned design changes, and a significant reduction in our Arizona commercial book. Jeff will provide further details on this topic in his prepared remarks. 
Turning to second quarter financials. Total revenues increased 98% year-over-year to $10.9 billion. Membership at quarter-end was 11.4 million, representing an increase of 6.8 million beneficiaries over the second quarter of 2015. The HBR improved 250 basis points year-over-year to 86.6%. This was mainly attributable to the product mix shift from Health Net. 
Importantly, we continue to see as well as anticipate stable medical cost trend. Lastly, we reported adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.29, which includes a $0.19 benefit related to 2015 risk adjustments and reinsurance reconciliation under the ACA. This compares to $0.76 reported in the second quarter of 2015. Jeff will provide further financial details, including updated 2016 guidance. 
Now on to the Health Net integration. As we discussed at our June Investor Day, the integration is on track or ahead of schedule in many areas. Our integration team continues to closely monitor financial and operational matrix. We have now completed the actions needed to capture over 90% of the $75 million first year synergy target. As a reminder, this target is for the first 12 months following the March 24 close of the deal. 
Additionally, we continue to believe we will achieve over $50 million in synergies in 2016 or approximately 70% of the first 12 months target. 
We have begun to transition Health Net to Centene reserving methodology and anticipate this will be completed by the beginning of 2017. We are also on track to begin the conversion of the California plan in the Centene's medical management system in the third quarter of 2016. 
Next, market and product updates. First, we will discuss recent Medicaid activity. In Pennsylvania, in April, Centene was selected to serve Medicaid recipients enrolled in Pennsylvania's HealthChoices program in 3 zones in the state. This contract was expected to commence on January 1, 2017. However, on July 21, the state reissued the RFP with a 30-day response period and an anticipated start date of April 1, 2017. We are confident in the value we demonstrated in our response to the first RFP and look forward to this potential opportunity. 
Moreover, in May, Centene specialty solutions division, Envolve, was selected by Maryland Care to provide health plan management services for its managed Medicaid operations effective July 1, 2017. This award highlights Centene's depth and breadth of management services packaged under the Envolve brand. 
Indiana. In June, we successfully re-procured our contract in Indiana to serve Medicaid beneficiaries in the state. This new contract is expected to commence on January 1, 2017. 
Now Medicaid expansion. At June 30, we served over 1 million Medicaid expansion members in 9 states. This represents an increase of more than 630,000 recipients over the second quarter 2015 and is primarily driven by the acquisition of Health Net's Medicaid expansion members. In July, Centene began serving Medicaid expansion beneficiaries in Louisiana under the state's newly implemented expansion program. We currently serve over 60,000 expansion members in Louisiana. 
Moving into Medicare and Duals. At June 30, we served over 300,000 Medicare and Dual beneficiaries. We expect to launch additional Medicare Advantage brands in 4 Centene states in 2017. As a reminder, the new plans will be launched under our four-star banner, which will give us the benefit of incremental premium revenue. 
I would also like to reiterate that we are focused on designing Medicare Advantage products to meet the needs of low-income seniors. 
Next, Health Insurance Marketplaces. Centene's exchange experience continues to be favorable, and we are achieving margins at the high end of our targeted range. I would like to remind you that Centene's exchange approach differs from most of our managed care peers. Our Marketplace strategy has been and continues to be focused on targeted low-income subsidized individuals. We designed our exchange solutions to be able to leverage our Medicaid platform, including provider networks. In the second quarter, over 90% of our exchange members was subsidy-eligible. This is consistent with 2014, 2015 and the first quarter of 2016. We ended the second quarter with approximately 618,000 exchange members across 15 states. We continue to anticipate serving approximately 550,000 Exchange members at year-end due to normal attrition. 
Now Centurion. Our correctional healthcare business continues to successfully expand. In May, Centurion was selected to provide correctional medical services as well as pharmacy services to over 7,000 inmates in New Mexico. These 2 separate contracts both commenced on June 1 and are operating in line with our expectations. New Mexico marks Centurion's 7th state of operation. At June 30, we served over 136,000 correctional members, nearly tripling the membership on a year-over-year basis. 
Turning to commercial. We ended the second quarter with over 805,000 commercial members. We remain fully committed to the success of the existing business in California. 
Finally, federal services. Last week, we were awarded a new contract with the TRICARE West region to manage their health care needs of active and retired military personnel and their families. Centene will serve approximately 2.9 million eligible beneficiaries in 19 states. We are currently the managed care contractor for the TRICARE North region. 
The Department of Defense has reduced the number of regions from 3 to 2 as part of this procurement process. We expect the new contract to commence in the middle of 2017. 
Shifting gears to the rate outlook. For Medicaid, we continue to expect a 2016 composite rate adjustment of between 0% and 1%, consistent with the past 3 years. 
In conclusion, the second quarter was significant as it was our first full quarter as a combined company. And we demonstrated our ability to execute on multiple fronts. We posted strong results. We increased full-year guidance. We won new RFPs. And the Health Net integration remains firmly on track. We continue to be optimistic about our future and our ability to extend Centene's leadership position in government-sponsored health care. 
Thank you for your interest in Centene. Jeff will now provide further details on our second quarter financial results. Jeff?"

This morning, I will begin with highlighting the results for the second quarter of 2016 and provide an update on our acquisition accounting and 2016 full year guidance. We had a strong second quarter of 2016. Member",1388,"Thank you, Michael, and good morning. This morning, I will begin with highlighting the results for the second quarter of 2016 and provide an update on our acquisition accounting and 2016 full year guidance. 
We had a strong second quarter of 2016. Membership was 11.4 million members, an increase of 148% between years, driven by the Health Net acquisition. Total revenues were $10.9 billion, an increase of 98% over Q2 of 2015. Diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of 2016 was $0.98. Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.29 when excluding exuding Health Net acquisition cost and intangible amortization, compared to $0.76 on an adjusted basis last year. Diluted earnings per share and adjusted diluted earnings per share includes $0.19 per share benefit related to the reconciliation of the 2015 reinsurance and risk adjustment provisions of the Marketplace business. In more detail, total revenues grew by $5.4 billion in the second quarter, primarily as a result of a full quarter of revenue from the Health Net acquisition, expansions or new programs in many of our states in 2015 and growth in the health insurance Marketplace business in 2016. 
Our health benefits ratio was 86.6% in the second quarter this year compared to 89.1% in last year second quarter and 88.7% in the first quarter 2016. The 250 basis point decrease year-over-year results from including a full quarter of the Health Net acquisition and growth in the Health Insurance Marketplace business, both of which operate at a lower HBR. Sequentially, the 210 basis point decrease from the first quarter reflects the effect of the Health Net acquisition, the reconciliation of the 2015 reinsurance and risk adjustment provisions of the Health Insurance Marketplace business and lower flu costs, which were more prevalent in the first quarter of 2016. 
The Health Insurance Marketplace business continues to perform well in 2016 with over 618,000 members at June 30. During the second quarter, CMS released additional information related to the reinsurance and risk adjustment provisions of the business. The reconciliation of both of these provisions for 2015 improved our pretax operating results for the second quarter by approximately $70 million or $0.19 per diluted share. This is after considering the risk-sharing contracts, primarily in California, the risk corridor and the minimum MLR. 
For 2016, we continue to record reinsurance at the 50% coinsurance rate and record the risk adjustment, utilizing the information we received from the data aggregators, consistent with 2015. 
Our general and administrative expense ratio was 9.2% in the second quarter this year, or 9% without the costs associated with the Health Net acquisition, compared to 8.4% last year and 8.3% in the first quarter, also excluding Health Net acquisition cost. 
The increase year-over-year and from the first quarter of 2016 reflects a full quarter effect of the Health Net acquisition. During the second quarter, we incurred $0.04 per diluted share of business expansion costs compared to $0.05 in the prior year. Investment and other income was $32 million in the second quarter compared to $10 million last year and $15 million in the first quarter. The increase is the result of larger investment balances associated with the Health Net acquisition. 
Interest expense was $52 million for the second quarter of 2016, compared to $11 million for the second quarter last year and $33 million in the first quarter of this year. The increase is due to the full quarter effect of the transaction financing and the issuance of $500 million of additional senior notes in June of 2016. Our tax rate for the quarter was 52.7% compared to 48.8% in the prior year. The higher tax rate is driven by the acquisition of Health Net. 
GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the second quarter was $0.98, including $0.19 of additional earnings associated with the reconciliation of the reinsurance and risk adjustment provisions of the Marketplace business. 
Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the second quarter was $1.29. Adjusted diluted earnings per share excludes $0.16 associated with the Health Net acquisition cost and $0.15 associated with intangible amortization. 
Cash and investments totaled $7.5 billion at quarter end, including $196 million held by unregulated subsidiaries. We estimate our risk-based capital percentage for NAIC filers to be in excess of 350% of the authorized control level. 
Debt on June 30 was $4.5 billion, including $185 million of borrowings on our revolver. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 44.4%, excluding our nonrecourse mortgage note, compared to 44.3% at the first quarter 2016. Our medical claim liability totaled $4 billion at June 30, representing 43 days in claims payable. 
Cash flow used in operations was $420 million in the second quarter. The cash flow from operations was impacted by the delay in our premium payments from several of our states as a result of their fiscal year ends. Those payment delays decreased our operating cash flows by approximately $600 million. We subsequently have received substantially all of the delayed payments. 
Next, I want to provide an update on the Health Net acquisition accounting. During the quarter, we have made progress in updating several fair value estimates as of the acquisition date. Although we have not experienced any unfavorable development on the medical claim liabilities established at March 24, 2016, we have increased reserves by approximately $90 million during the quarter associated with disputed substance abuse treatment center claims. We expect to continue to review the reserves for the substance abuse treatment facility claims. However, we have finalized our fair valuation of the remaining medical claims liability. 
Additionally, we recorded premium deficiency reserves of approximately $300 million, representing the fair value of underperforming contracts for the period from March 24 through December 31, 2016. The premium deficiency reserves are primarily associated with unfavorable expected performance in the following areas: first, losses in the individual commercial business, largely in California, driven by increased utilization of substance abuse treatment facilities; second, unfavorable performance in the Arizona Commercial business, reflecting the unfavorable risk pool caused by the grandmother-ing of non-ACA-compliant policies, further compounded by the lack of risk corridor benefit; and third, unfavorable performance in the Medicare business, primarily in Oregon and Arizona. We expect to continue to review the premium deficiency reserve for the substance abuse treatment facility utilization estimates. However, we have finalized our fair valuation of the remaining premium deficiency reserve liabilities. 
It's important to note we have taken steps to improve the performance of these businesses for 2017. Specifically, we have filed for rate adjustments in the individual commercial business in California more in line with our cost. And we believe the outcome of the 2017 Medicare bid process will improve the margins in Oregon. We have taken steps to mitigate the substance abuse treatment center costs in the individual Commercial business in California, including modifications to plan design. We have accelerated the integration of the Arizona Medicaid business and taken actions to reduce our exposure to the individual commercial product in that state in 2017. And we are actively working with the California Department of Insurance to ensure we maintain a competitive individual commercial product in 2017. We believe the actions we have taken will improve the operating margins in 2017. 
We have not completed our fair valuation exercise associated with intangible assets, certain tax matters and the substance abuse facility claims and the related PDR. I would refer you to the Form 10-Q for a more expansive disclosure. 
Lastly, an update on our 2016 full year guidance. We expect total revenues of $39.4 billion to $40 billion; GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.65 to $3; adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.20 to $4.55; a consolidated health benefits ratio of 87% to 87.5%; general and administrative expense ratio of 9.4% to 9.9%, the G&A ratio excluding transaction cost of 9% to 9.5%; and effective income tax rate of 54.5% to 56.5%; diluted shares outstanding of 162.5 million to 163.5 million shares. We estimate our operating cash flow to be between 1.5 to 2x net earnings. This can be influenced by the timing of payments from our states as well as the payment to states associated with minimum HBR and other return of premium programs. We estimate business expansion cost of $0.25 to $0.30 in 2016. 
That concludes my remarks. And Operator, you may now open the line for questions."

The actuaries are looking at the right pricing and doing it the way Centene has priced things. And it's still -- we're taking the same approach we have with the market priced products, though you go at it, you design the product, you look at the -- you work with your actuaries and you get your pricing right.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Centene Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. During the course of this morning's call, we will discuss our second quarter results and provide updates on Centene's markets and products. Additio",1307,"Thank you, Ed. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Centene Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. During the course of this morning's call, we will discuss our second quarter results and provide updates on Centene's markets and products. Additionally, we will bring you up-to-date on the Health Net integration and the fair value analysis of legacy Health Net's balance sheet. 
Let me begin with a few comments on second quarter results. The second quarter marks Centene's first full quarter with Health Net. Overall, we are pleased with our operating performance, which is marked by strong top and bottom line growth. We recognize there have been questions regarding the Health Net balance sheet and underlying operations. Let me pause here. Are there some background problems with some of you? There were [indiscernible] the phone. Consistent with our previous comments, we continue to make progress on the fair valuation of the Health Net balance sheet. Importantly, there has been no unfavorable development on the medical claims liability established at March 24. We did increase reserves for medical claims associated with disputed substance abuse treatment center cost. Additionally, we recorded premium deficiency reserves primarily associated with Arizona and California individual PPO business. We believe we have effectively addressed these concerns with the purchase accounting adjustments. We also believe the opening balance sheet is appropriately estimated at fair value and the PDR's offset losses for certain contracts in 2016.
While there are some moving parts, it is important to note these issues are not unusual in a large acquisition, and we believe they are manageable. We are addressing them in a manner consistent with Centene's approach and have taken significant actions to improve these operating results in 2017 and beyond. These include price increases, planned design changes, and a significant reduction in our Arizona commercial book. Jeff will provide further details on this topic in his prepared remarks. 
Turning to second quarter financials. Total revenues increased 98% year-over-year to $10.9 billion. Membership at quarter-end was 11.4 million, representing an increase of 6.8 million beneficiaries over the second quarter of 2015. The HBR improved 250 basis points year-over-year to 86.6%. This was mainly attributable to the product mix shift from Health Net. 
Importantly, we continue to see as well as anticipate stable medical cost trends. Lastly, we reported adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.29, which includes a $0.19 benefit related to 2015 risk adjustments and reinsurance reconciliation under the ACA. This compares to $0.76 reported in the second quarter of 2015. Jeff will provide further financial details, including updated 2016 guidance. 
Now on to the Health Net integration. As we discussed at our June Investor Day, the integration is on track or ahead of schedule in many areas. Our integration team continues to closely monitor financial and operational matrix. We have now completed the actions needed to capture over 90% of the $75 million first year synergy target. As a reminder, this target is for the first 12 months following the March 24 close of the deal. 
Additionally, we continue to believe we will achieve over $50 million in synergies in 2016 or approximately 70% of the first 12 months target.
We have begun to transition Health Net to Centene reserving methodology and anticipate this will be completed by the beginning of 2017. We are also on track to begin the conversion of the California plan into Centene's medical management system in the third quarter of 2016. 
Next, market and product updates. First, we will discuss recent Medicaid activity. In Pennsylvania, in April, Centene was selected to serve Medicaid recipients enrolled in Pennsylvania's HealthChoices program in 3 zones in the state. This contract was expected to commence on January 1, 2017. However, on July 21, the state reissued the RFP with a 30-day response period and an anticipated start date of April 1, 2017. We are confident in the value we demonstrated in our response to the first RFP and look forward to this potential opportunity.
Maryland. In May, Centene specialty solutions division, Envolve, was selected by Maryland Care to provide health plan management services for its managed Medicaid operations effective July 1, 2017. This award highlights Centene's depth and breadth of management services packaged under the Envolve brand. 
Indiana. In June, we successfully re-procured our contract in Indiana to serve Medicaid beneficiaries in the state. This new contract is expected to commence on January 1, 2017. 
Now Medicaid expansion. At June 30, we served over 1 million Medicaid expansion members in 9 states. This represents an increase of more than 630,000 recipients over the second quarter 2015 and is primarily driven by the acquisition of Health Net's Medicaid expansion members. In July, Centene began serving Medicaid expansion beneficiaries in Louisiana under the state's newly implemented expansion program. We currently serve over 60,000 expansion members in Louisiana. 
Moving into Medicare and Duals. At June 30, we served over 300,000 Medicare and Dual beneficiaries. We expect to launch additional Medicare Advantage brands in 4 Centene states in 2017. As a reminder, the new plans will be launched under our four-star banner, which will give us the benefit of incremental premium revenue. 
I would also like to reiterate that we are focused on designing Medicare Advantage products to meet the needs of low-income seniors. 
Next, Health Insurance Marketplaces. Centene's exchange experience continues to be favorable, and we are achieving margins at the high end of our targeted range. I would like to remind you that Centene's exchange approach differs from most of our managed care peers. Our Marketplace strategy has been and continues to be focused on targeted low-income subsidized individuals. We designed our exchange solutions to be able to leverage our Medicaid platform, including provider networks. In the second quarter, over 90% of our exchange members were subsidy-eligible. This is consistent with 2014, 2015 and the first quarter of 2016. We ended the second quarter with approximately 618,000 exchange members across 15 states. We continue to anticipate serving approximately 550,000 Exchange members at year-end due to normal attrition. 
Now Centurion. Our correctional healthcare business continues to successfully expand. In May, Centurion was selected to provide correctional medical services as well as pharmacy services to over 7,000 inmates in New Mexico. These 2 separate contracts both commenced on June 1 and are operating in line with our expectations. New Mexico marks Centurion's seventh state of operation. At June 30, we served over 136,000 correctional members, nearly tripling the membership on a year-over-year basis. 
Turning to commercial. We ended the second quarter with over 805,000 commercial members. We remain fully committed to the success of the existing business in California. 
Finally, federal services. Last week, we were awarded a new contract for the TRICARE West region to manage the health care needs of active and retired military personnel and their families. Centene will serve approximately 2.9 million eligible beneficiaries in 19 states. We are currently the managed care contractor for the TRICARE North region. 
The Department of Defense has reduced the number of regions from 3 to 2 as part of this procurement process. We expect the new contract to commence in the middle of 2017. 
Shifting gears to the rate outlook. For Medicaid, we continue to expect a 2016 composite rate adjustment of between 0% and 1%, consistent with the past 3 years. 
In conclusion, the second quarter was significant as it was our first full quarter as a combined company. And we demonstrated our ability to execute on multiple fronts. We posted strong results. We increased full-year guidance. We won new RFPs. And the Health Net integration remains firmly on track. We continue to be optimistic about our future and our ability to extend Centene's leadership position in government-sponsored health care. 
Thank you for your interest in Centene. Jeff will now provide further details on our second quarter financial results. Jeff?"

This morning, I will begin with highlighting the results for the second quarter of 2016 and provide an update on our acquisition accounting and 2016 full year guidance. We had a strong second quarter of 2016. Member",1388,"Thank you, Michael, and good morning. This morning, I will begin with highlighting the results for the second quarter of 2016 and provide an update on our acquisition accounting and 2016 full year guidance. 
We had a strong second quarter of 2016. Membership was 11.4 million members, an increase of 148% between years, driven by the Health Net acquisition. Total revenues were $10.9 billion, an increase of 98% over Q2 of 2015. Diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of 2016 was $0.98. Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.29 when excluding Health Net acquisition cost and intangible amortization, compared to $0.76 on an adjusted basis last year. Diluted earnings per share and adjusted diluted earnings per share includes $0.19 per share benefit related to the reconciliation of the 2015 reinsurance and risk adjustment provisions of the Marketplace business. In more detail, total revenues grew by $5.4 billion in the second quarter, primarily as a result of a full quarter of revenue from the Health Net acquisition, expansions or new programs in many of our states in 2015 and growth in the health insurance Marketplace business in 2016. 
Our health benefits ratio was 86.6% in the second quarter this year compared to 89.1% in last year second quarter and 88.7% in the first quarter 2016. The 250 basis point decrease year-over-year results from including a full quarter of the Health Net acquisition and growth in the Health Insurance Marketplace business, both of which operate at a lower HBR. Sequentially, the 210 basis point decrease from the first quarter reflects the effect of the Health Net acquisition, the reconciliation of the 2015 reinsurance and risk adjustment provisions of the Health Insurance Marketplace business and lower flu costs, which were more prevalent in the first quarter of 2016. 
The Health Insurance Marketplace business continues to perform well in 2016 with over 618,000 members at June 30. During the second quarter, CMS released additional information related to the reinsurance and risk adjustment provisions of the business. The reconciliation of both of these provisions for 2015 improved our pretax operating results for the second quarter by approximately $70 million or $0.19 per diluted share. This is after considering the risk-sharing contracts, primarily in California, the risk corridor and the minimum MLR. 
For 2016, we continue to record reinsurance at the 50% coinsurance rate and record the risk adjustment, utilizing the information we received from the data aggregators, consistent with 2015. 
Our general and administrative expense ratio was 9.2% in the second quarter this year, or 9% without the costs associated with the Health Net acquisition, compared to 8.4% last year and 8.3% in the first quarter, also excluding Health Net acquisition cost. 
The increase year-over-year and from the first quarter of 2016 reflects a full quarter effect of the Health Net acquisition. During the second quarter, we incurred $0.04 per diluted share of business expansion costs compared to $0.05 in the prior year. Investment and other income was $32 million in the second quarter compared to $10 million last year and $15 million in the first quarter. The increase is the result of larger investment balances associated with the Health Net acquisition. 
Interest expense was $52 million for the second quarter of 2016, compared to $11 million for the second quarter last year and $33 million in the first quarter of this year. The increase is due to the full quarter effect of the transaction financing and the issuance of $500 million of additional senior notes in June of 2016. Our tax rate for the quarter was 52.7% compared to 48.8% in the prior year. The higher tax rate is driven by the acquisition of Health Net. 
GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the second quarter was $0.98, including $0.19 of additional earnings associated with the reconciliation of the reinsurance and risk adjustment provisions of the Marketplace business. 
Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the second quarter was $1.29. Adjusted diluted earnings per share excludes $0.16 associated with the Health Net acquisition cost and $0.15 associated with intangible amortization. 
Cash and investments totaled $7.5 billion at quarter end, including $196 million held by unregulated subsidiaries. We estimate our risk-based capital percentage for NAIC filers to be in excess of 350% of the authorized control level. 
Debt on June 30 was $4.5 billion, including $185 million of borrowings on our revolver. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 44.4%, excluding our nonrecourse mortgage note, compared to 44.3% at the first quarter of 2016. Our medical claim liability totaled $4 billion at June 30, representing 43 days in claims payable. 
Cash flow used in operations was $420 million in the second quarter. The cash flow from operations was impacted by the delay in our premium payments from several of our states as a result of their fiscal year ends. Those payment delays decreased our operating cash flows by approximately $600 million. We subsequently have received substantially all of the delayed payments. 
Next, I want to provide an update on the Health Net acquisition accounting. During the quarter, we have made progress in updating several fair value estimates as of the acquisition date. Although we have not experienced any unfavorable development on the medical claim liabilities established at March 24, 2016, we have increased reserves by approximately $90 million during the quarter associated with disputed substance abuse treatment center claims. We expect to continue to review the reserves for the substance abuse treatment facility claims. However, we have finalized our fair valuation of the remaining medical claims liability. 
Additionally, we recorded premium deficiency reserves of approximately $300 million, representing the fair value of underperforming contracts for the period from March 24 through December 31, 2016. The premium deficiency reserves are primarily associated with unfavorable expected performance in the following areas: first, losses in the individual commercial business, largely in California, driven by increased utilization of substance abuse treatment facilities; second, unfavorable performance in the Arizona Commercial business, reflecting the unfavorable risk pool caused by the grandmother-ing of non-ACA-compliant policies, further compounded by the lack of risk corridor benefit; and third, unfavorable performance in the Medicare business, primarily in Oregon and Arizona. We expect to continue to review the premium deficiency reserve for the substance abuse treatment facility utilization estimates. However, we have finalized our fair valuation of the remaining premium deficiency reserve liabilities. 
It's important to note we have taken steps to improve the performance of these businesses for 2017. Specifically, we have filed for rate adjustments in the individual commercial business in California more in line with our cost. And we believe the outcome of the 2017 Medicare bid process will improve the margins in Oregon. We have taken steps to mitigate the substance abuse treatment center costs in the individual Commercial business in California, including modifications to plan design. We have accelerated the integration of the Arizona Medicaid business and taken actions to reduce our exposure to the individual commercial product in that state in 2017. And we are actively working with the California Department of Insurance to ensure we maintain a competitive individual commercial product in 2017. We believe the actions we have taken will improve the operating margins in 2017. 
We have not completed our fair valuation exercise associated with intangible assets, certain tax matters and the substance abuse facility claims and the related PDR. I would refer you to the Form 10-Q for a more expansive disclosure. 
Lastly, an update on our 2016 full year guidance. We expect total revenues of $39.4 billion to $40 billion; GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.65 to $3; adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.20 to $4.55; a consolidated health benefits ratio of 87% to 87.5%; general and administrative expense ratio of 9.4% to 9.9%, the G&A ratio excluding transaction cost of 9% to 9.5%; and effective income tax rate of 54.5% to 56.5%; diluted shares outstanding of 162.5 million to 163.5 million shares. We estimate our operating cash flow to be between 1.5 to 2x net earnings. This can be influenced by the timing of payments from our states as well as the payment to states associated with minimum HBR and other return of premium programs. We estimate business expansion cost of $0.25 to $0.30 in 2016. 
That concludes my remarks. And Operator, you may now open the line for questions."

One, the behavioral side of things, the benefit certificates have been redone, have been approved by the states and now effectively, we believe take care of that going forward. There is always a potential for somebody to try some fraud, which we will always go after very aggressively. We have a fraud and abuse program that identifies and goes after that very effectively. So I see that, as a '17 issue, not there. On the individual plan, on the PPO product, I believe, we have now the right design. The actuaries are looking at the right pricing and doing it the way Centene has priced things. And it's still -- we're taking the same approach we have with the marketplace products. You go at it, you design the product, you look at the -- you work with your actuaries and you get your pricing right. So on a going-forward basis, I expect that, that issue in '17 to be gone. And that's why it was appropriate to do the PDR for this year because this is something we inherited and it was prior to the 24th for those things we set. We see the impact on the year, we dealt with it that way. But most importantly, we have been -- we're comfortable that the changes being made will minimize and eliminate this in '17.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Centene Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. During the course of this morning's call, we will discuss our second quarter results and provide updates on Centene's markets and products. Additionally, we will bring you up-to-date on the Health Net integration and the fair value analysis of legacy Health Net's balance sheet. 
Let me begin with a few comments on second quarter results. The second quarter marks Centene's first full quarter with Health Net. Overall, we are pleased with our operating performance, which is marked by strong top and bottom line growth. We recognize there have been questions regarding the Health Net balance sheet and underlying operations. Let me pause here. Are there some background problems with some of you? There were [indiscernible] the phone. Consistent with our previous comments, we continue to make progress on the fair valuation of the Health Net balance sheet. Importantly, there has been no unfavorable development on the medical claims liability established at March 24. We did increase reserves for medical claims associated with disputed substance abuse treatment center cost. Additionally, we recorded premium deficiency reserves primarily associated with Arizona and California individual PPO business. We believe we have effectively addressed these concerns with the purchase accounting adjustments. We also believe the opening balance sheet is appropriately estimated at fair value and the PDR's offset losses for certain contracts in 2016.
While there are some moving parts, it is important to note these issues are not unusual in a large acquisition, and we believe they are manageable. We are addressing them in a manner consistent with Centene's approach and have taken significant actions to improve these operating results in 2017 and beyond. These include price increases, planned design changes, and a significant reduction in our Arizona commercial book. Jeff will provide further details on this topic in his prepared remarks. 
Turning to second quarter financials. Total revenues increased 98% year-over-year to $10.9 billion. Membership at quarter-end was 11.4 million, representing an increase of 6.8 million beneficiaries over the second quarter of 2015. The HBR improved 250 basis points year-over-year to 86.6%. This was mainly attributable to the product mix shift from Health Net. 
Importantly, we continue to see as well as anticipate stable medical cost trends. Lastly, we reported adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.29, which includes a $0.19 benefit related to 2015 risk adjustments and reinsurance reconciliation under the ACA. This compares to $0.76 reported in the second quarter of 2015. Jeff will provide further financial details, including updated 2016 guidance. 
Now on to the Health Net integration. As we discussed at our June Investor Day, the integration is on track or ahead of schedule in many areas. Our integration team continues to closely monitor financial and operational matrix. We have now completed the actions needed to capture over 90% of the $75 million first year synergy target. As a reminder, this target is for the first 12 months following the March 24 close of the deal. 
Additionally, we continue to believe we will achieve over $50 million in synergies in 2016 or approximately 70% of the first 12 months target.
We have begun to transition Health Net to Centene reserving methodology and anticipate this will be completed by the beginning of 2017. We are also on track to begin the conversion of the California plan into Centene's medical management system in the third quarter of 2016. 
Next, market and product updates. First, we will discuss recent Medicaid activity. In Pennsylvania, in April, Centene was selected to serve Medicaid recipients enrolled in Pennsylvania's HealthChoices program in 3 zones in the state. This contract was expected to commence on January 1, 2017. However, on July 21, the state reissued the RFP with a 30-day response period and an anticipated start date of April 1, 2017. We are confident in the value we demonstrated in our response to the first RFP and look forward to this potential opportunity.
Maryland. In May, Centene specialty solutions division, Envolve, was selected by Maryland Care to provide health plan management services for its managed Medicaid operations effective July 1, 2017. This award highlights Centene's depth and breadth of management services packaged under the Envolve brand. 
Indiana. In June, we successfully re-procured our contract in Indiana to serve Medicaid beneficiaries in the state. This new contract is expected to commence on January 1, 2017. 
Now Medicaid expansion. At June 30, we served over 1 million Medicaid expansion members in 9 states. This represents an increase of more than 630,000 recipients over the second quarter 2015 and is primarily driven by the acquisition of Health Net's Medicaid expansion members. In July, Centene began serving Medicaid expansion beneficiaries in Louisiana under the state's newly implemented expansion program. We currently serve over 60,000 expansion members in Louisiana. 
Moving into Medicare and Duals. At June 30, we served over 300,000 Medicare and Dual beneficiaries. We expect to launch additional Medicare Advantage brands in 4 Centene states in 2017. As a reminder, the new plans will be launched under our four-star banner, which will give us the benefit of incremental premium revenue. 
I would also like to reiterate that we are focused on designing Medicare Advantage products to meet the needs of low-income seniors. 
Next, Health Insurance Marketplaces. Centene's exchange experience continues to be favorable, and we are achieving margins at the high end of our targeted range. I would like to remind you that Centene's exchange approach differs from most of our managed care peers. Our Marketplace strategy has been and continues to be focused on targeted low-income subsidized individuals. We designed our exchange solutions to be able to leverage our Medicaid platform, including provider networks. In the second quarter, over 90% of our exchange members were subsidy-eligible. This is consistent with 2014, 2015 and the first quarter of 2016. We ended the second quarter with approximately 618,000 exchange members across 15 states. We continue to anticipate serving approximately 550,000 Exchange members at year-end due to normal attrition. 
Now Centurion. Our correctional healthcare business continues to successfully expand. In May, Centurion was selected to provide correctional medical services as well as pharmacy services to over 7,000 inmates in New Mexico. These 2 separate contracts both commenced on June 1 and are operating in line with our expectations. New Mexico marks Centurion's seventh state of operation. At June 30, we served over 136,000 correctional members, nearly tripling the membership on a year-over-year basis. 
Turning to commercial. We ended the second quarter with over 805,000 commercial members. We remain fully committed to the success of the existing business in California. 
Finally, federal services. Last week, we were awarded a new contract for the TRICARE West region to manage the health care needs of active and retired military personnel and their families. Centene will serve approximately 2.9 million eligible beneficiaries in 19 states. We are currently the managed care contractor for the TRICARE North region. 
The Department of Defense has reduced the number of regions from 3 to 2 as part of this procurement process. We expect the new contract to commence in the middle of 2017. 
Shifting gears to the rate outlook. For Medicaid, we continue to expect a 2016 composite rate adjustment of between 0% and 1%, consistent with the past 3 years. 
In conclusion, the second quarter was significant as it was our first full quarter as a combined company. And we demonstrated our ability to execute on multiple fronts. We posted strong results. We increased full-year guidance. We won new RFPs. And the Health Net integration remains firmly on track. We continue to be optimistic about our future and our ability to extend Centene's leadership position in government-sponsored health care. 
Thank you for your interest in Centene. Jeff will now provide further details on our second quarter financial results. Jeff?"

This morning, I will begin with highlighting the results for the second quarter of 2016 and provide an update on our acquisition accounting and 2016 full year guidance. We had a strong second quarter of 2016. Member",1388,"Thank you, Michael, and good morning. This morning, I will begin with highlighting the results for the second quarter of 2016 and provide an update on our acquisition accounting and 2016 full year guidance. 
We had a strong second quarter of 2016. Membership was 11.4 million members, an increase of 148% between years, driven by the Health Net acquisition. Total revenues were $10.9 billion, an increase of 98% over Q2 of 2015. Diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of 2016 was $0.98. Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.29 when excluding Health Net acquisition cost and intangible amortization, compared to $0.76 on an adjusted basis last year. Diluted earnings per share and adjusted diluted earnings per share includes $0.19 per share benefit related to the reconciliation of the 2015 reinsurance and risk adjustment provisions of the Marketplace business. In more detail, total revenues grew by $5.4 billion in the second quarter, primarily as a result of a full quarter of revenue from the Health Net acquisition, expansions or new programs in many of our states in 2015 and growth in the health insurance Marketplace business in 2016. 
Our health benefits ratio was 86.6% in the second quarter this year compared to 89.1% in last year second quarter and 88.7% in the first quarter 2016. The 250 basis point decrease year-over-year results from including a full quarter of the Health Net acquisition and growth in the Health Insurance Marketplace business, both of which operate at a lower HBR. Sequentially, the 210 basis point decrease from the first quarter reflects the effect of the Health Net acquisition, the reconciliation of the 2015 reinsurance and risk adjustment provisions of the Health Insurance Marketplace business and lower flu costs, which were more prevalent in the first quarter of 2016. 
The Health Insurance Marketplace business continues to perform well in 2016 with over 618,000 members at June 30. During the second quarter, CMS released additional information related to the reinsurance and risk adjustment provisions of the business. The reconciliation of both of these provisions for 2015 improved our pretax operating results for the second quarter by approximately $70 million or $0.19 per diluted share. This is after considering the risk-sharing contracts, primarily in California, the risk corridor and the minimum MLR. 
For 2016, we continue to record reinsurance at the 50% coinsurance rate and record the risk adjustment, utilizing the information we received from the data aggregators, consistent with 2015. 
Our general and administrative expense ratio was 9.2% in the second quarter this year, or 9% without the costs associated with the Health Net acquisition, compared to 8.4% last year and 8.3% in the first quarter, also excluding Health Net acquisition cost. 
The increase year-over-year and from the first quarter of 2016 reflects a full quarter effect of the Health Net acquisition. During the second quarter, we incurred $0.04 per diluted share of business expansion costs compared to $0.05 in the prior year. Investment and other income was $32 million in the second quarter compared to $10 million last year and $15 million in the first quarter. The increase is the result of larger investment balances associated with the Health Net acquisition. 
Interest expense was $52 million for the second quarter of 2016, compared to $11 million for the second quarter last year and $33 million in the first quarter of this year. The increase is due to the full quarter effect of the transaction financing and the issuance of $500 million of additional senior notes in June of 2016. Our tax rate for the quarter was 52.7% compared to 48.8% in the prior year. The higher tax rate is driven by the acquisition of Health Net. 
GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the second quarter was $0.98, including $0.19 of additional earnings associated with the reconciliation of the reinsurance and risk adjustment provisions of the Marketplace business. 
Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the second quarter was $1.29. Adjusted diluted earnings per share excludes $0.16 associated with the Health Net acquisition cost and $0.15 associated with intangible amortization. 
Cash and investments totaled $7.5 billion at quarter end, including $196 million held by unregulated subsidiaries. We estimate our risk-based capital percentage for NAIC filers to be in excess of 350% of the authorized control level. 
Debt on June 30 was $4.5 billion, including $185 million of borrowings on our revolver. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 44.4%, excluding our nonrecourse mortgage note, compared to 44.3% at the first quarter of 2016. Our medical claim liability totaled $4 billion at June 30, representing 43 days in claims payable. 
Cash flow used in operations was $420 million in the second quarter. The cash flow from operations was impacted by the delay in our premium payments from several of our states as a result of their fiscal year ends. Those payment delays decreased our operating cash flows by approximately $600 million. We subsequently have received substantially all of the delayed payments. 
Next, I want to provide an update on the Health Net acquisition accounting. During the quarter, we have made progress in updating several fair value estimates as of the acquisition date. Although we have not experienced any unfavorable development on the medical claim liabilities established at March 24, 2016, we have increased reserves by approximately $90 million during the quarter associated with disputed substance abuse treatment center claims. We expect to continue to review the reserves for the substance abuse treatment facility claims. However, we have finalized our fair valuation of the remaining medical claims liability. 
Additionally, we recorded premium deficiency reserves of approximately $300 million, representing the fair value of underperforming contracts for the period from March 24 through December 31, 2016. The premium deficiency reserves are primarily associated with unfavorable expected performance in the following areas: first, losses in the individual commercial business, largely in California, driven by increased utilization of substance abuse treatment facilities; second, unfavorable performance in the Arizona Commercial business, reflecting the unfavorable risk pool caused by the grandmother-ing of non-ACA-compliant policies, further compounded by the lack of risk corridor benefit; and third, unfavorable performance in the Medicare business, primarily in Oregon and Arizona. We expect to continue to review the premium deficiency reserve for the substance abuse treatment facility utilization estimates. However, we have finalized our fair valuation of the remaining premium deficiency reserve liabilities. 
It's important to note we have taken steps to improve the performance of these businesses for 2017. Specifically, we have filed for rate adjustments in the individual commercial business in California more in line with our cost. And we believe the outcome of the 2017 Medicare bid process will improve the margins in Oregon. We have taken steps to mitigate the substance abuse treatment center costs in the individual Commercial business in California, including modifications to plan design. We have accelerated the integration of the Arizona Medicaid business and taken actions to reduce our exposure to the individual commercial product in that state in 2017. And we are actively working with the California Department of Insurance to ensure we maintain a competitive individual commercial product in 2017. We believe the actions we have taken will improve the operating margins in 2017. 
We have not completed our fair valuation exercise associated with intangible assets, certain tax matters and the substance abuse facility claims and the related PDR. I would refer you to the Form 10-Q for a more expansive disclosure. 
Lastly, an update on our 2016 full year guidance. We expect total revenues of $39.4 billion to $40 billion; GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.65 to $3; adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.20 to $4.55; a consolidated health benefits ratio of 87% to 87.5%; general and administrative expense ratio of 9.4% to 9.9%, the G&A ratio excluding transaction cost of 9% to 9.5%; and effective income tax rate of 54.5% to 56.5%; diluted shares outstanding of 162.5 million to 163.5 million shares. We estimate our operating cash flow to be between 1.5 to 2x net earnings. This can be influenced by the timing of payments from our states as well as the payment to states associated with minimum HBR and other return of premium programs. We estimate business expansion cost of $0.25 to $0.30 in 2016. 
That concludes my remarks. And Operator, you may now open the line for questions."

I think that’s something that Centene is well experienced at and we've been working with the states, at the highest levels, to redesign the PPO product. There were major flaws in it.

We never designed anything to be one-sided or just get healthies but it's -- we want to make sure we get a balanced book. And we definitely want to make sure we're not selected against adversely relative to the competitors. And I think the design we've come up with using our experience modeling systems capability has put us in a strong position to do that. And the rate adjustments will be important. And staying competitive rate-wise and having a product that can be competitive is part of getting a balanced book of business. So I can say, I've personally been involved in pushing and discussing, and I'm very comfortable that we're going to move in the right direction very quickly there starting January 1.

The actuaries are looking at the right pricing and doing it the way Centene has priced things. And it's still -- we're taking the same approach we have with the marketplace products. You go at it, you design the product, you look at the -- you work with your actuaries and you get your pricing right. So on a going-forward basis, I expect that, that issue in '17 to be gone.

During the course of this morning's call, we will discuss our third quarter results and provide an update on Centene's markets and products. Addit",1853,"Thank you, Ed. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Centene's Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. During the course of this morning's call, we will discuss our third quarter results and provide an update on Centene's markets and products. Additionally, we will bring you up-to-date on the Health Net integration.
Let me begin with a few comments on Health Net. As part of our ongoing fair value analysis, during the second quarter, we recorded a premium deficiency reserve of approximately $300 million due to unfavorable performance in some of Health Net's business operations. The PDR covers the period March 24 to December 31, 2016. We have taken significant actions over the past few months to improve the business operations through 2017 and beyond. These include price increases, plan design changes and certain market exits. We fully believe we have now dealt with all the factors that contributed to the PDR.
During the third quarter, we reduced the $300 million PDR to $285 million as the outlook of substance abuse claims liability in California has improved. Please note this had no effect on third quarter earnings. The largest component of the PDR is $110 million related to the California commercial business. We negotiated with the California Department of Insurance the necessary benefit changes. On October 3, we submitted our filings to the CDI called the 2017 plan designs and rate adjustments. These substantial benefit design changes allowed us to reduce our original 23% rate increase to 9.9%. Some of the key benefit changes included: the first-time inclusion of an out-of-network deductible for platinum and gold plans, $5000 for an individual and $10,000 for a family; a significant increase in the out-of-network maximum out-of-pocket level to $25,000 for an individual and $50,000 for a family; the elimination of non-emergent out-of-state coverage and travel network access; the elimination of the default rate of 75% of billed charges for out-of-network services that do not have a Medicare rate; the reduction of reimbursement for out-of-network physicians and other services and supplies to 100% of the Medicare rate from the 85the percentile of FAIR Health and 190% of the Medicare rate, respectively; and restrictions on third-party premium payments, which were not included the original 2016 offering. We believe these subsequent changes will significantly strengthen our control of out-of-network utilization, which was the main driver of the PPO cost issues. In addition, we expect to further improve the operating performance of these products with the implementation of Centene's medical management tools as well as network enhancements. We appreciate the collaboration efforts of the CDI through the process. We expect the rate and benefit design changes to create a more competitive product in 2017 and allow for a balanced book of business.
Let me now go through the remaining components of the PDR and the corrective actions we have taken outside of California. First, $70 million related to Arizona individual commercial. We were exit the Arizona individual PPO business effective January 1, 2017. This exit represents $32 million of the $70 million loss. The remaining $38 million of the loss is associated with the individual HMO exchange product in Arizona. We have reconfigured our geographic presence, increased rates and redesign benefits. We will remain in Pima County and in Maricopa County as the only carrier. We expect the Arizona exchange to generate $500 million in incremental revenue and operate within our normal marketplace margins in 2017.
Second, $15 million related to Arizona Medicaid. As of July 1, this business has been fully transitioned to Centene's operating platform. We expect Arizona Medicaid to be profitable next year.
Third, $20 million related to other smaller items, including the Arizona small group and Oregon individual business. We have applied for rate increases and benefit design changes to address these issues.
And lastly, $70 million related to Medicare Advantage. We submitted bids in June and are taking actions on unit cost and medical management initiatives to achieve profitability next year.
Next, let's talk about Health Net integration. The integration process continues to go well, and we remain on track or ahead of schedule in many areas. We have now completed the actions needed to capture all the $75 million first year synergy target.
During the third quarter, we began the conversion of Health Net's California plan on to Centene's medical management system. We expect this conversion to help drive better operating performance through the application of Centene's award-winning case management tools and programs.
Turning to third quarter financials. Membership at quarter end was 11.4 million members, representing an increase of 6.6 million beneficiaries over the third quarter of 2015. Total revenue increased 86% year-over-year to $10.8 billion. On a sequential basis, total revenues declined by $50 million due to exchange membership attrition and the eligibility redetermine process in California Medicaid. This is partially offset by a commencement of Medicaid expansion in Louisiana, and all of these were expected. Note the redetermine results in a sequential loss of approximately 61,000 Medicaid beneficiaries in this state. It has now been completed and roughly 16,000 members were added in October. The HBR improved 200 basis points year-over-year to 87%. This was primarily attributable to the commercial product mix shift from Health Net. Importantly, we continue to see stable medical cost trends and systems with our expectations in the low single digits.
Lastly, on a GAAP basis, we reported diluted earnings per share of $0.84. We reported adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.11 or $1.16 when excluding a $0.05 expense related to the 2015 risk adjustment and reinsurance reconciliation under the Affordable Care Act. Recall that in the second quarter, we recorded a $0.19 diluted EPS benefit related to this reconciliation. Thus, the net benefit we have recorded in the past 2 months is actually $0.14. Jeff will provide further financial details, including updated 2016 guidance. 
Now on to market and product update. First, we will discuss recent Medicaid activity. In August, Centene was 1 of 3 brands selected to serve long-term care recipients in Northern Pennsylvania's Healthy -- HealthChoice program statewide. This program covers more than 420,000 individuals who are duly eligible and those with physical disabilities. This contract will be rolled out in 3 tranches. The Southwest zone will be the first to go live with an expected start date of July 1, 2017. The Southeast zone is expected to commence January of 2018, and the remainder of the state is expected to begin on January 1, 2019. Pennsylvania marks Centene's 10th state managing long-term care for long-term care beneficiaries. We are the largest provider of long-term care support services. We are the fastest-growing segment of the managed care market. Where the contract has been -- not been finalized, we expect it will ramp up and be profitable within a normal time frame. 
Alabama. In September, the Alabama legislation approved the funding needed to create its regional care organization structure. Centene's specialty solutions division involved has contracted with 5 nonprofit RCOs in the state to provide management services. Operations are expected to commence July 1, 2017. This award highlights Centene's depth and breadth of management services under our involved plan. 
Missouri. Last week, we were pleased to be selected to provide managed care services to Medicaid recipients in all 114 counties in Missouri. This award is a successful reprocurement and expansion of Centene's presence in the state. This expanded program covers over 240,000 additional Medicaid beneficiaries in Missouri, bringing the total number of individuals covered to over 740,000 [indiscernible] [ph]. The program is expected to commence May 1, 2017. 
Next, Medicare and duals. At quarter end, we served over 300,000 Medicare and dual beneficiaries. We continue to move forward with our growth plan to expand our Medicare Advantage footprint into Centene's Medicaid states next year. We are launching new MA plan in Texas, Florida and Mississippi. These new plans will be launched under our 4-STAR plan [ph] rating and are eligible for a 5% premium bonus. In Georgia, we're using our existing special needs plans to launch Medicare Advantage. This plan will also be eligible through quality bonus. Consistent with Centene's overall strategy, we will focus on low-income Medicare beneficiaries. We fully expect to have a profitable MA business in 2017.
Let me make a brief comment on the recently announced 2018 Medicare Advantage STAR ratings. We are pleased to have maintained our 4-STAR plan [ph] rating. 7 of our plans are an improved -- have improvement in STAR ratings and 7 plan STAR ratings stayed the same. Our Oregon plan STAR rating declined from 4 to 3.5 stars, primarily due to a reduction in Part D scores. This was the result of the addition of a deductible to our prescription drug benefit, which was done to improve profitability. This issue was limited to the Oregon market. Maintaining a high-quality STAR rating is a top priority for Centene. 
Now Health Insurance Marketplace. Centene's exchange experience continues to be favorable, and we are achieving margins at the high end of our targeted range. Our marketplace strategy is different from most of our peers. We design our exchange solutions to be able to leverage our Medicaid platform, including provider networks, as we are focused on low-income subsidized individuals. In the third quarter, over 90% of our exchange revenues were subsidy-eligible. This is consistent with our prior experience. We ended the quarter with over 580,000 exchange members in 15 states. We continue to anticipate serving approximately 550 exchange members at year-end through the normal attrition. Overall, we continue to expect our marketplace offerings to be profitable next year. 
Shifting gears to our rate outlook. For Medicaid, we continue to expect in 2016 composite rate adjustment of between 0% and 1%, consistent with the past few years.
In summary, we are optimistic about the future of our ability to expand Centene's leadership position in government-sponsored health care. We are on track with the integration of Health Net. We have taken the necessary actions to substantially improve the underperforming markets and products covered by the 2016 PDR. Our growth pipeline is bigger than ever, and we have continued to expand our Medicare Advantage market. We remain committed to long-term margin expansion and continue to make the necessary investments in systems and infrastructure to successfully execute our strategy. As a reminder, our next Investor Day is on December 16 in New York City. As is our custom, we will provide full first-time 2017 financial guidance. 
I would like to make a couple of comments on our expectations for 2017. At this time, we believe total revenues will be approximately $46 billion at a minimum. This represents a $1 billion increase over the estimate we provided at the June Investor Day and a 15% increase over 2016. Importantly, the outlook continues to be favorable despite the fact that the denominator is significantly larger. Equally, while we are still finalizing our annual operating plan for '17, we have no reason to believe that the consensus estimate for '17 will be outside our target range.
Thank you for your interest in Centene. Jeff will now provide further details on our third quarter financial results."
26273,322820122,1060014,"Centene Corp., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2016",2016-10-25,"Earnings Calls","Centene Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Michael, and good morning. This morning, I will begin with highlighting the results for the third quarter of 2016 and provide an update on our 2016 full year guidance.For the third quarter 2016, Centene's membership was 11.4 million members,",1652,"Thank you, Michael, and good morning. This morning, I will begin with highlighting the results for the third quarter of 2016 and provide an update on our 2016 full year guidance.
For the third quarter 2016, Centene's membership was 11.4 million members, an increase of 137% between years, driven by the Health Net acquisition. Total revenues were $10.8 billion, an increase of 86% over Q3 of 2015. Diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2016 was $0.84 compared to $0.75 last year, and adjusted diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2016 was $1.11 compared to $0.87 last year.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share include the charge of $0.05 per diluted share associated with the Arizona risk adjustment program. During the third quarter, we received information from CMS that some of the participants in the Arizona risk adjustment program were unable to pay the amounts owed to the federal government associated with the 2015 risk adjustment reconciliation. As a result, the uncollected risk adjustment amount was prorated to all insurers in the market. Accordingly, we recorded a charge of $0.05 per diluted share, recognizing our portion of the risk adjustment that will not be collected, which reduces the $0.19 per diluted share benefit we recorded in the second quarter of 2016.
Now for some more specifics. Total revenues grew year-over-year by $5 billion in the third quarter, primarily as a result of the Health Net acquisition, expansions or new programs in many of our states in 2015 and '16 and growth in the Health Insurance Marketplace business in 2016. Sequentially, our revenues were slightly lower than the second quarter due to lower commercial membership, primarily as a result of the expected attrition in the Health Insurance Marketplace business and lower membership in the California Medicaid program as a result of annual eligibility redeterminations completed by the state. This was partially offset by growth in other markets, specifically in Louisiana Medicaid expansion. Our health benefits ratio was 87% in the third quarter this year compared to 89% in last year's third quarter and 86.6% in the second quarter of 2016. The 200 basis point decrease year-over-year results from the addition of Health Net as well as the growth in the Health Insurance Marketplace business, both of which operate at a lower HBR. Sequentially, the 40 basis point increase in the second quarter reflects normal seasonality in the business.
We continue to deliver strong membership and margins in the Health Insurance Marketplace business during the third quarter. The product continues to achieve margins at the high end of our targeted range, and we now have over $329 million accrued as a risk adjustment payable for services provided in 2016. For 2016, we continue to record reinsurance at the 50% coinsurance rate, record no risk corridor receivable and record the risk adjustment utilizing the information we received from the data aggregators consistent with 2015. Our general and administrative expense ratio was 9.2% in the third quarter of this year or 9.1% excluding the cost associated with the Health Net acquisition compared to 8.4% in the third quarter of last year and 9% in the second quarter of this year, also excluding Health Net acquisition cost. The increase year-over-year reflects the addition of the Health Net business, which operates at a higher G&A ratio due to a greater mix of commercial business. Sequentially, the 10 basis point increase is due to lower revenue in the third quarter. During the third quarter, we incurred $0.07 per diluted share of business expansion costs, primarily associated with the Texas STAR Kids award and the 2017 Medicare expansion, compared to $0.05 per diluted share in the prior year.
Investment and other income was $33 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared to $8 million for the third quarter last year and $32 million in the second quarter of this year. The increase year-over-year is a result of the larger investment balances associated with the Health Net acquisition. Interest expense was $57 million for the third quarter of 2016 compared to $11 million for the third quarter last year and $52 million in the second quarter of this year. The increase year-over-year is primarily due to the financing associated with the Health Net transaction. The sequential increase is due to the full quarter effect of the $500 million of additional senior notes we issued in June of 2016. Our tax rate for the quarter was 53.8% compared to 48.3% in the prior year. The higher tax rate is driven by the acquisition of Health Net.
During the third quarter, we received approval of a refund in connection with our tax position with respect to 162(m)(6) or the limitation on the deductibility of certain executive compensation. As a reminder, we expect to be subject to 162(m)(6) limitation in 2017 as a result of the Health Net acquisition.
GAAP diluted earnings per share for continuing operations for the third quarter was $0.84, and adjusted diluted earnings per share for the third quarter was $1.11. Both amounts include a $0.05 diluted earnings per share charge associated with the Arizona risk adjustment program previously discussed. As a reminder, adjusted diluted earnings per share excludes $0.12 associated with the Health Net acquisition cost and $0.15 associated with intangible amortization.
Cash and investments totaled $8.1 billion at quarter end, including $268 million held by unregulated subsidiaries. We estimate our risk-based capital percentage for NAIC filers to be in excess of 350% of the authorized control level.
Debt on September 30 was $4.6 billion, including $300 million of borrowings on our revolver. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 44.1%, excluding our nonrecourse mortgage note compared to 44.4% at the second quarter of 2016.
Our medical claim liability totaled $3.8 billion at September 30, representing 41 days in claims payable. The days and claims payable decreased during the third quarter due to annual provider risk share settlements of approximately $115 million in our California market as well as the timing of the claims payments at the end of the quarter.
We had strong operating cash flow for the third quarter of $480 million or 3.3x net earnings. This was primarily driven by net earnings, collection of outstanding capitation payments and prepayment of amounts from CMS associated with the Medicare product. This was partially offset by payment of the health insurer fee of $513 million at quarter end. 
A quick update on the substance abuse claims. During the third quarter, we revised our estimate of the level of substance abuse cost we anticipated to incur between the acquisition date and the end of the year. As you recall, we established a reserve of $50 million in our acquisition accounting in the second quarter as an estimate of the liability associated with these claims for the period from March 24 through December 31, 2016. Based on the level of incurred and projected claims through the third quarter, we have lowered our estimate from $50 million to $35 million. This adjustment had no effect on earnings. We continue to evaluate the fair valuation associated with the substance abuse claims and expect to complete that analysis in the fourth quarter.
As Michael mentioned in his comments, we have taken actions associated with products that were included in the PDR, including product design, premium rates, product exits and numerous medical management and network initiatives. Based on the action we have taken, we believe we have resolved the issues associated with the 2016 premium deficiency reserve for 2017. We look forward to providing more details and full 2017 guidance in our normal December Investor Day.
Lastly, an update on our 2016 full year guidance. As described in our press release this morning, we are adjusting our guidance for the risk adjustment charge related to the Arizona recognized in the third quarter. As we previously disclosed, during the second quarter of 2016, we recorded a benefit of $0.19 per diluted share and increased our full year guidance for the 2015 reconciliation of the risk adjustment and reinsurance provisions of the marketplace business at that time. As a result of the information received from CMS in the third quarter, the benefit recorded in the second quarter was reduced by $0.05 per diluted share to $0.14 when combining both quarters. We have updated our 2016 guidance accordingly. Our updated annual guidance is as follows: total revenues of $39.4 billion to $40 billion; GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.73 to $2.83; adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.28 to $4.38; G&A ratio of 9.4% to 9.9%; the G&A ratio excluding the transaction cost of 9% to 9.5%; and effective income tax rate of 54.5% to 56.5%; and diluted shares outstanding of 162.5 million to 163.5 million shares. The guidance above implies a fourth quarter GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.83 to $0.93 and an adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.05 to $1.15. This range now includes business expansion costs, which we expect to be at the high end of our guidance range of $0.25 to $0.30 in the fourth quarter, driven by increased costs associated with our expected Health Insurance Marketplace growth in 2017. We continue to estimate our operating cash flow on a long-term basis to be between 1.5 and 2x net earnings. As previously highlighted in the second quarter, we do anticipate that there will be variability in our cash flow from quarter-to-quarter, depending on the timing of payments to certain states associated with minimum MLR programs, primarily in California. Subsequent to quarter end, we received amendments to our California contracts with the Department of Health Care Services to amend the Medicaid expansion Medical Loss Ratio definition. All reconciliation periods remain open. However, we expect the amendment to reduce our minimum MLR liability and are currently working with the state to evaluate the impact in the amendment.
That concludes my remarks. And operator, you may now open the line for questions."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Centene's Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. During the course of this morning's call, we will discuss our third quarter results and provide an update on Centene's markets and products. Addit",1851,"Thank you, Ed. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Centene's Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. During the course of this morning's call, we will discuss our third quarter results and provide an update on Centene's markets and products. Additionally, we will bring you up-to-date on the Health Net integration.
Let me begin with a few comments on Health Net. As part of our ongoing fair value analysis, during the second quarter, we recorded a premium deficiency reserve of approximately $300 million due to unfavorable performance in some of Health Net's business operations. The PDR covers the period March 24 to December 31, 2016. We have taken significant actions over the past few months to improve the business operations through 2017 and beyond. These include price increases, plan design changes and certain market exits. We fully believe we have now dealt with all the factors that contributed to the PDR.
During the third quarter, we reduced the $300 million PDR to $285 million as the outlook of substance abuse claims liability in California has improved. Please note this had no effect on third quarter earnings. The largest component of the PDR is $110 million related to the California commercial business. We negotiated with the California Department of Insurance the necessary benefit changes. On October 3, we submitted our filings to the CDI called the 2017 plan designs and rate adjustments. These substantial benefit design changes allowed us to reduce our original 23% rate increase to 9.9%. Some of the key benefit changes included: the first-time inclusion of an out-of-network deductible for platinum and gold plans, $5000 for an individual and $10,000 for a family; a significant increase in the out-of-network maximum out-of-pocket level to $25,000 for an individual and $50,000 for a family; the elimination of non-emergent out-of-state coverage and travel network access; the elimination of the default rate of 75% of billed charges for out-of-network services that do not have a Medicare rate; the reduction of reimbursement for out-of-network physicians and other services and supplies to 100% of the Medicare rate from the 85the percentile of FAIR Health and 190% of the Medicare rate, respectively; and restrictions on third-party premium payments, which were not included the original 2016 offering. We believe these subsequent changes will significantly strengthen our control of out-of-network utilization, which was the main driver of the PPO cost issues. In addition, we expect to further improve the operating performance of these products with the implementation of Centene's medical management tools as well as network enhancements. We appreciate the collaboration efforts of the CDI through the process. We expect the rate and benefit design changes to create a more competitive product in 2017 and allow for a balanced book of business.
Let me now go through the remaining components of the PDR and the corrective actions we have taken outside of California. First, $70 million related to Arizona individual commercial. We were exit the Arizona individual PPO business effective January 1, 2017. This exit represents $32 million of the $70 million loss. The remaining $38 million of the loss is associated with the individual HMO exchange product in Arizona. We have reconfigured our geographic presence, increased rates and redesign benefits. We will remain in Pima County and in Maricopa County as the only carrier. We expect the Arizona exchange to generate $500 million in incremental revenue and operate within our normal marketplace margins in 2017.
Second, $15 million related to Arizona Medicaid. As of July 1, this business has been fully transitioned to Centene's operating platform. We expect Arizona Medicaid to be profitable next year.
Third, $20 million related to other smaller items, including the Arizona small group and Oregon individual business. We have applied for rate increases and benefit design changes to address these issues.
And lastly, $70 million related to Medicare Advantage. We submitted bids in June and are taking actions on unit cost and medical management initiatives to achieve profitability next year.
Next, let's talk about Health Net integration. The integration process continues to go well, and we remain on track or ahead of schedule in many areas. We have now completed the actions needed to capture all the $75 million first year synergy target.
During the third quarter, we began the conversion of Health Net's California plan on to Centene's medical management system. We expect this conversion to help drive better operating performance through the application of Centene's award-winning case management tools and programs.
Turning to third quarter financials. Membership at quarter end was 11.4 million members, representing an increase of 6.6 million beneficiaries over the third quarter of 2015. Total revenue increased 86% year-over-year to $10.8 billion. On a sequential basis, total revenues declined by $50 million due to exchange membership attrition and the eligibility redetermine process in California Medicaid. This is partially offset by a commencement of Medicaid expansion in Louisiana, and all of these were expected. Note the redetermine results in a sequential loss of approximately 61,000 Medicaid beneficiaries in this state. It has now been completed and roughly 16,000 members were added in October. The HBR improved 200 basis points year-over-year to 87%. This was primarily attributable to the commercial product mix shift from Health Net. Importantly, we continue to see stable medical cost trends and systems with our expectations in the low single digits.
Lastly, on a GAAP basis, we reported diluted earnings per share of $0.84. We reported adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.11 or $1.16 when excluding a $0.05 expense related to the 2015 risk adjustment and reinsurance reconciliation under the Affordable Care Act. Recall that in the second quarter, we recorded a $0.19 diluted EPS benefit related to this reconciliation. Thus, the net benefit we have recorded in the past 2 months is actually $0.14. Jeff will provide further financial details, including updated 2016 guidance. 
Now on to market and product update. First, we will discuss recent Medicaid activity. In August, Centene was 1 of 3 brands selected to serve long-term care recipients in Northern Pennsylvania's Healthy -- HealthChoice program statewide. This program covers more than 420,000 individuals who are duly eligible and those with physical disabilities. This contract will be rolled out in 3 tranches. The Southwest zone will be the first to go live with an expected start date of July 1, 2017. The Southeast zone is expected to commence January of 2018, and the remainder of the state is expected to begin on January 1, 2019. Pennsylvania marks Centene's 10th state managing long-term care for long-term care beneficiaries. We are the largest provider of long-term care support services. We are the fastest-growing segment of the managed care market. Where the contract has been -- not been finalized, we expect it will ramp up and be profitable within a normal time frame. 
Alabama. In September, the Alabama legislation approved the funding needed to create its regional care organization structure. Centene's specialty solutions division involved has contracted with 5 nonprofit RCOs in the state to provide management services. Operations are expected to commence July 1, 2017. This award highlights Centene's depth and breadth of management services under our involved plan. 
Missouri. Last week, we were pleased to be selected to provide managed care services to Medicaid recipients in all 114 counties in Missouri. This award is a successful reprocurement and expansion of Centene's presence in the state. This expanded program covers over 240,000 additional Medicaid beneficiaries in Missouri, bringing the total number of individuals covered to over 740,000. The program is expected to commence May 1, 2017. 
Next, Medicare and duals. At quarter end, we served over 300,000 Medicare and dual beneficiaries. We continue to move forward with our growth plan to expand our Medicare Advantage footprint into Centene's Medicaid states next year. We are launching new MA plan in Texas, Florida and Mississippi. These new plans will be launched under our 4-STAR parent [ph] rating and are eligible for a 5% premium bonus. In Georgia, we're using our existing special needs plans to launch Medicare Advantage. This plan will also be eligible through quality bonus. Consistent with Centene's overall strategy, we will focus on low-income Medicare beneficiaries. We fully expect to have a profitable MA business in 2017.
Let me make a brief comment on the recently announced 2018 Medicare Advantage STAR ratings. We are pleased to have maintained our 4-STAR parent [ph] rating. 7 of our plans are an improved -- have improvement in STAR ratings and 7 plan STAR ratings stayed the same. Our Oregon plan STAR rating declined from 4 to 3.5 stars, primarily due to a reduction in Part D scores. This was the result of the addition of a deductible to our prescription drug benefit, which was done to improve profitability. This issue was limited to the Oregon market. Maintaining a high-quality STAR rating is a top priority for Centene. 
Now Health Insurance Marketplace. Centene's exchange experience continues to be favorable, and we are achieving margins at the high end of our targeted range. Our marketplace strategy is different from most of our peers. We design our exchange solutions to be able to leverage our Medicaid platform, including provider networks, as we are focused on low-income subsidized individuals. In the third quarter, over 90% of our exchange revenues were subsidy-eligible. This is consistent with our prior experience. We ended the quarter with over 580,000 exchange members in 15 states. We continue to anticipate serving approximately 550 exchange members at year-end through the normal attrition. Overall, we continue to expect our marketplace offerings to be profitable next year. 
Shifting gears to our rate outlook. For Medicaid, we continue to expect in 2016 composite rate adjustment of between 0% and 1%, consistent with the past few years.
In summary, we are optimistic about the future of our ability to expand Centene's leadership position in government-sponsored health care. We are on track with the integration of Health Net. We have taken the necessary actions to substantially improve the underperforming markets and products covered by the 2016 PDR. Our growth pipeline is bigger than ever, and we have continued to expand our Medicare Advantage market. We remain committed to long-term margin expansion and continue to make the necessary investments in systems and infrastructure to successfully execute our strategy. As a reminder, our next Investor Day is on December 16 in New York City. As is our custom, we will provide full first-time 2017 financial guidance. 
I would like to make a couple of comments on our expectations for 2017. At this time, we believe total revenues will be approximately $46 billion at a minimum. This represents a $1 billion increase over the estimate we provided at the June Investor Day and a 15% increase over 2016. Importantly, the outlook continues to be favorable despite the fact that the denominator is significantly larger. Equally, while we are still finalizing our annual operating plan for '17, we have no reason to believe that the consensus estimate for '17 will be outside our target range.
Thank you for your interest in Centene. Jeff will now provide further details on our third quarter financial results."
26273,322820122,1060360,"Centene Corp., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2016",2016-10-25,"Earnings Calls","Centene Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Michael, and good morning. This morning, I will begin with highlighting the results for the third quarter of 2016 and provide an update on our 2016 full year guidance.For the third quarter 2016, Centene's membership was 11.4 million members,",1652,"Thank you, Michael, and good morning. This morning, I will begin with highlighting the results for the third quarter of 2016 and provide an update on our 2016 full year guidance.
For the third quarter 2016, Centene's membership was 11.4 million members, an increase of 137% between years, driven by the Health Net acquisition. Total revenues were $10.8 billion, an increase of 86% over Q3 of 2015. Diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2016 was $0.84 compared to $0.75 last year, and adjusted diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2016 was $1.11 compared to $0.87 last year.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share include the charge of $0.05 per diluted share associated with the Arizona risk adjustment program. During the third quarter, we received information from CMS that some of the participants in the Arizona risk adjustment program were unable to pay the amounts owed to the federal government associated with the 2015 risk adjustment reconciliation. As a result, the uncollected risk adjustment amount was prorated to all insurers in the market. Accordingly, we recorded a charge of $0.05 per diluted share, recognizing our portion of the risk adjustment that will not be collected, which reduces the $0.19 per diluted share benefit we recorded in the second quarter of 2016.
Now for some more specifics. Total revenues grew year-over-year by $5 billion in the third quarter, primarily as a result of the Health Net acquisition, expansions or new programs in many of our states in 2015 and '16 and growth in the Health Insurance Marketplace business in 2016. Sequentially, our revenues were slightly lower than the second quarter due to lower commercial membership, primarily as a result of the expected attrition in the Health Insurance Marketplace business and lower membership in the California Medicaid program as a result of annual eligibility redeterminations completed by the state. This was partially offset by growth in other markets, specifically in Louisiana Medicaid expansion. Our health benefits ratio was 87% in the third quarter this year compared to 89% in last year's third quarter and 86.6% in the second quarter of 2016. The 200 basis point decrease year-over-year results from the addition of Health Net as well as the growth in the Health Insurance Marketplace business, both of which operate at a lower HBR. Sequentially, the 40 basis point increase in the second quarter reflects normal seasonality in the business.
We continue to deliver strong membership and margins in the Health Insurance Marketplace business during the third quarter. The product continues to achieve margins at the high end of our targeted range, and we now have over $329 million accrued as a risk adjustment payable for services provided in 2016. For 2016, we continue to record reinsurance at the 50% coinsurance rate, record no risk corridor receivable and record the risk adjustment utilizing the information we received from the data aggregators consistent with 2015. Our general and administrative expense ratio was 9.2% in the third quarter of this year or 9.1% excluding the cost associated with the Health Net acquisition compared to 8.4% in the third quarter of last year and 9% in the second quarter of this year, also excluding Health Net acquisition cost. The increase year-over-year reflects the addition of the Health Net business, which operates at a higher G&A ratio due to a greater mix of commercial business. Sequentially, the 10 basis point increase is due to lower revenue in the third quarter. During the third quarter, we incurred $0.07 per diluted share of business expansion costs, primarily associated with the Texas STAR Kids award and the 2017 Medicare expansion, compared to $0.05 per diluted share in the prior year.
Investment and other income was $33 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared to $8 million for the third quarter last year and $32 million in the second quarter of this year. The increase year-over-year is a result of the larger investment balances associated with the Health Net acquisition. Interest expense was $57 million for the third quarter of 2016 compared to $11 million for the third quarter last year and $52 million in the second quarter of this year. The increase year-over-year is primarily due to the financing associated with the Health Net transaction. The sequential increase is due to the full quarter effect of the $500 million of additional senior notes we issued in June of 2016. Our tax rate for the quarter was 53.8% compared to 48.3% in the prior year. The higher tax rate is driven by the acquisition of Health Net.
During the third quarter, we received approval of a refund in connection with our tax position with respect to 162(m)(6) or the limitation on the deductibility of certain executive compensation. As a reminder, we expect to be subject to 162(m)(6) limitation in 2017 as a result of the Health Net acquisition.
GAAP diluted earnings per share for continuing operations for the third quarter was $0.84, and adjusted diluted earnings per share for the third quarter was $1.11. Both amounts include a $0.05 diluted earnings per share charge associated with the Arizona risk adjustment program previously discussed. As a reminder, adjusted diluted earnings per share excludes $0.12 associated with the Health Net acquisition cost and $0.15 associated with intangible amortization.
Cash and investments totaled $8.1 billion at quarter end, including $268 million held by unregulated subsidiaries. We estimate our risk-based capital percentage for NAIC filers to be in excess of 350% of the authorized control level.
Debt on September 30 was $4.6 billion, including $300 million of borrowings on our revolver. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 44.1%, excluding our nonrecourse mortgage note compared to 44.4% at the second quarter of 2016.
Our medical claim liability totaled $3.8 billion at September 30, representing 41 days in claims payable. The days and claims payable decreased during the third quarter due to annual provider risk share settlements of approximately $115 million in our California market as well as the timing of the claims payments at the end of the quarter.
We had strong operating cash flow for the third quarter of $480 million or 3.3x net earnings. This was primarily driven by net earnings, collection of outstanding capitation payments and prepayment of amounts from CMS associated with the Medicare product. This was partially offset by payment of the health insurer fee of $513 million at quarter end. 
A quick update on the substance abuse claims. During the third quarter, we revised our estimate of the level of substance abuse cost we anticipated to incur between the acquisition date and the end of the year. As you recall, we established a reserve of $50 million in our acquisition accounting in the second quarter as an estimate of the liability associated with these claims for the period from March 24 through December 31, 2016. Based on the level of incurred and projected claims through the third quarter, we have lowered our estimate from $50 million to $35 million. This adjustment had no effect on earnings. We continue to evaluate the fair valuation associated with the substance abuse claims and expect to complete that analysis in the fourth quarter.
As Michael mentioned in his comments, we have taken actions associated with products that were included in the PDR, including product design, premium rates, product exits and numerous medical management and network initiatives. Based on the action we have taken, we believe we have resolved the issues associated with the 2016 premium deficiency reserve for 2017. We look forward to providing more details and full 2017 guidance in our normal December Investor Day.
Lastly, an update on our 2016 full year guidance. As described in our press release this morning, we are adjusting our guidance for the risk adjustment charge related to the Arizona recognized in the third quarter. As we previously disclosed, during the second quarter of 2016, we recorded a benefit of $0.19 per diluted share and increased our full year guidance for the 2015 reconciliation of the risk adjustment and reinsurance provisions of the marketplace business at that time. As a result of the information received from CMS in the third quarter, the benefit recorded in the second quarter was reduced by $0.05 per diluted share to $0.14 when combining both quarters. We have updated our 2016 guidance accordingly. Our updated annual guidance is as follows: total revenues of $39.4 billion to $40 billion; GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.73 to $2.83; adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.28 to $4.38; G&A ratio of 9.4% to 9.9%; the G&A ratio excluding the transaction cost of 9% to 9.5%; and effective income tax rate of 54.5% to 56.5%; and diluted shares outstanding of 162.5 million to 163.5 million shares. The guidance above implies a fourth quarter GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.83 to $0.93 and an adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.05 to $1.15. This range now includes business expansion costs, which we expect to be at the high end of our guidance range of $0.25 to $0.30 in the fourth quarter, driven by increased costs associated with our expected Health Insurance Marketplace growth in 2017. We continue to estimate our operating cash flow on a long-term basis to be between 1.5 and 2x net earnings. As previously highlighted in the second quarter, we do anticipate that there will be variability in our cash flow from quarter-to-quarter, depending on the timing of payments to certain states associated with minimum MLR programs, primarily in California. Subsequent to quarter end, we received amendments to our California contracts with the Department of Health Care Services to amend the Medicaid expansion Medical Loss Ratio definition. All reconciliation periods remain open. However, we expect the amendment to reduce our minimum MLR liability and are currently working with the state to evaluate the impact in the amendment.
That concludes my remarks. And operator, you may now open the line for questions."

And then rate and benefit design are what you're using to attack the other $75 million? Is that the right way to think about it, or is there a blurry your line?"

And the other issues where it was a percent of billed charges, they could be out-of-network. Providers could do what they wanted. And we're LIBOR at the time for 75% of billed charges till they change the certificate it covers. So virtually putting in the changes that I discussed during my formal remarks eliminate the incentives that put people into that product at the same level. And we already see a material drop-off of that taking place. It was a bad design before. The state everybody recognized that. It's been fully fixed, and there's other steps taking place that let the legal authorities deal with as it relates to it. So that affects that. It also affects the normal PPO. I cited before the same principle applies. We now have a product that will have great appeal, the people who want to use our in-network and who are in some [indiscernible] on that is out of network. I mean, they now have an exposure of $25,000 maximum out of pocket, which is significantly greater than what it was but very competitive. So it's really -- we now have the right PPO design. And PPOs have always been intended for in-network use without a network being exception. Before, virtually all the utilization was out of network. So we believe that, that together with the lower rate increase will be more attractive to the balanced book of business. These are things we've done successfully for many years and will really -- will turn this around. And when it has and will put us where we want to be."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Centene's third quarter 2016 earnings call. During the course of this morning's call, we will discuss our third quarter results and provide an update on Centene's markets and products. Additionally, we will bring you up-to-date on the Health Net integration.
Let me begin with a few comments on Health Net. As part of our ongoing fair value analysis, during the second quarter, we recorded a premium deficiency reserve of approximately $300 million due to unfavorable performance in some of Health Net's business operations. The PDR covers the period March 24 to December 31, 2016. We have taken significant actions over the past few months to improve the business operations for 2017 and beyond. These include price increases, plan design changes and certain market exits. We fully believe we have now dealt with all the factors that contributed to the PDR.
During the third quarter, we reduced the $300 million PDR to $285 million as the outlook of substance abuse claims liability in California has improved. Please note this had no effect on third quarter earnings. The largest component of the PDR is $110 million related to the California commercial business. We negotiated with the California Department of Insurance the necessary benefit changes. On October 3, we submitted our filings to the CDI for the 2017 plan designs and rate adjustments. These substantial benefit design changes allowed us to reduce our original 23% rate increase to 9.9%. Some of the key benefit changes included: the first-time inclusion of an out-of-network deductible for platinum and gold plans of $5000 for an individual and $10,000 for a family; a significant increase in the out-of-network maximum out-of-pocket level to $25,000 for an individual and $50,000 for a family; the elimination of non-emergent out-of-state coverage and travel network access; the elimination of the default rate of 75% of billed charges for out-of-network services that do not have a Medicare rate; the reduction of reimbursement for out-of-network physicians and other services and supplies to 100% of the Medicare rate from the 85th percentile of FAIR Health and 190% of the Medicare rate, respectively; and restrictions on third-party premium payments, which were not included the original 2016 offering. We believe these substantive changes will significantly strengthen our control of out-of-network utilization, which was the main driver of the PPO cost issues. In addition, we expect to further improve the operating performance of these products with the implementation of Centene's medical management tools as well as network enhancements. We appreciate the collaboration efforts of the CDI through the process. We expect the rate and benefit design changes to create a more competitive product in 2017 and allow for a balanced book of business.
Let me now go through the remaining components of the PDR and the corrective actions we have taken outside of California. First, $70 million related to Arizona individual commercial. We will exit the Arizona individual PPO business effective January 1, 2017. This exit represents $32 million of the $70 million loss. The remaining $38 million of the loss is associated with the individual HMO exchange product in Arizona. We have reconfigured our geographic presence, increased rates and redesigned benefits. We will remain in Pima County and enter Maricopa County as the only carrier. We expect the Arizona exchange to generate $500 million in incremental revenue and operate within our normal marketplace margins in 2017.
Second, $15 million related to Arizona Medicaid. As of July 1, this business has been fully transitioned to Centene's operating platform. We expect Arizona Medicaid to be profitable next year.
Third, $20 million related to other smaller items, including the Arizona small group and Oregon individual business. We have applied for rate increases and benefit design changes to address these issues.
And lastly, $70 million related to Medicare Advantage. We submitted bids in June and are taking actions on unit costs and medical management initiatives to achieve profitability next year.
Next, let's talk about Health Net integration. The integration process continues to go well, and we remain on track or ahead of schedule in many areas. We have now completed the actions needed to capture all of the $75 million first year synergy target.
During the third quarter, we began the conversion of Health Net's California plan on to Centene's medical management system. We expect this conversion to help drive better operating performance through the application of Centene's award-winning case management tools and programs.
Turning to third quarter financials. Membership at quarter end was 11.4 million members, representing an increase of 6.6 million beneficiaries over the third quarter of 2015. Total revenue increased 86% year-over-year to $10.8 billion. On a sequential basis, total revenues declined by $50 million due to exchange membership attrition and the eligibility redetermine process in California Medicaid. This is partially offset by a commencement of Medicaid expansion in Louisiana, and all of these were expected. Note the redetermine results in a sequential loss of approximately 61,000 Medicaid beneficiaries in this state. It has now been completed, and roughly 16,000 members were added in October. The HBR improved 200 basis points year-over-year to 87%. This was primarily attributable to the commercial product mix shift from Health Net. Importantly, we continue to see stable medical cost trends consistent with our expectations in the low single digits.
Lastly, on a GAAP basis, we reported diluted earnings per share of $0.84. We reported adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.11 or $1.16 when excluding a $0.05 expense related to the 2015 risk adjustment and reinsurance reconciliation under the Affordable Care Act. Recall that in the second quarter, we recorded a $0.19 diluted EPS benefit related to this reconciliation. Thus, the net benefit we have recorded in the past 2 months is actually $0.14. Jeff will provide further financial details, including updated 2016 guidance. 
Now on to market and product updates. First, we will discuss recent Medicaid activity. In August, Centene was 1 of 3 brands selected to serve long-term care recipients enrolled in Pennsylvania's Healthy -- or HealthChoice program statewide. This program covers more than 420,000 individuals who are duly eligible and those with physical disabilities. This contract will be rolled out in 3 tranches. The Southwest zone will be the first to go live with an expected start date of July 1, 2017. The Southeast zone is expected to commence January of 2018, and the remainder of the state is expected to begin on January 1, 2019. Pennsylvania marks Centene's 10th state managing long-term care for long-term care beneficiaries. We are the largest provider of long-term care support services, one of the fastest-growing segments of the managed care market. While the contract has been -- not been finalized, we expect that it will ramp up and be profitable within a normal time frame. 
Alabama. In September, the Alabama legislature approved the funding needed to create its regional care organization structure. Centene's specialty solutions division involved has contracted with 5 nonprofit RCOs in the state to provide management services. Operations are expected to commence July 1, 2017. This award highlights Centene's depth and breadth of management services under our involved plan. 
Missouri. Last week, we were pleased to be selected to provide managed care services to Medicaid recipients in all 114 counties in Missouri. This award is a successful reprocurement and expansion of Centene's presence in the state. This expanded program covers over 240,000 additional Medicaid beneficiaries in Missouri, bringing the total number of individuals covered to over 740,000 lives. The program is expected to commence May 1, 2017. 
Next, Medicare and duals. At quarter end, we served over 300,000 Medicare and dual beneficiaries. We continue to move forward with our growth plan to expand our Medicare Advantage footprint into Centene's Medicaid states next year. We are launching new MA plans in Texas, Florida and Mississippi. These new plans will be launched under our 4-STAR parent [ph] rating and are eligible for a 5% premium bonus. In Georgia, we're using our existing special needs plans to launch Medicare Advantage. This plan will also be eligible for a quality bonus. Consistent with Centene's overall strategy, we will focus on low-income Medicare beneficiaries. We fully expect to have a profitable MA business in 2017.
Let me make a brief comment on the recently announced 2018 Medicare Advantage STAR ratings. We are pleased to have maintained our 4-STAR parent [ph] rating. 7 of our plans saw an improved -- an improvement in STAR ratings, and 7 plans' STAR ratings stayed the same. Our Oregon plan STAR rating declined from 4 to 3.5 stars, primarily due to a reduction in Part D scores. This was the result of the addition of a deductible to our prescription drug benefit, which was done to improve profitability. This issue was limited to the Oregon market. Maintaining a high-quality STAR rating is a top priority for Centene. 
Now Health Insurance Marketplaces. Centene's exchange experience continues to be favorable, and we are achieving margins at the high end of our targeted range. Our marketplace strategy is different from most of our peers. We design our exchange solutions to be able to leverage our Medicaid platform, including provider networks, as we are focused on low-income subsidized individuals. In the third quarter, over 90% of our exchange revenues were subsidy-eligible. This is consistent with our prior experience. We ended the quarter with over 580,000 exchange members in 15 states. We continue to anticipate serving approximately 550,000 exchange members at year-end due to normal attrition. Overall, we continue to expect our marketplace offerings to be profitable next year. 
Shifting gears to our rate outlook. For Medicaid, we continue to expect a 2016 composite rate adjustment of between 0% and 1%, consistent with the past few years.
In summary, we are optimistic about the future of our ability to extend Centene's leadership position in government-sponsored health care. We are on track with the integration of Health Net. We have taken the necessary actions to substantially improve the underperforming markets and products covered by the 2016 PDR. Our growth pipeline is bigger than ever, and we have continued to expand our Medicare Advantage market. We remain committed to long-term margin expansion and continue to make the necessary investments in systems and infrastructure to successfully execute our strategy. As a reminder, our next Investor Day is on December 16 in New York City. As is our custom, we will provide full first-time 2017 financial guidance. 
I would like to make a couple comments on our expectations for 2017. At this time, we believe total revenues will be approximately $46 billion at a minimum. This represents a $1 billion increase over the estimate we provided at the June Investor Day and a 15% increase over 2016. Importantly, the outlook continues to be favorable despite the fact that the denominator is significantly larger. Equally, while we are still finalizing our AOP, or annual operating plan, for '17, we have no reason to believe that the consensus estimate for '17 will be outside our target range.
Thank you for your interest in Centene. Jeff will now provide further details on our third quarter financial results."
26273,322820122,1060562,"Centene Corp., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2016",2016-10-25,"Earnings Calls","Centene Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Michael, and good morning. This morning, I will begin with highlighting the results for the third quarter of 2016 and provide an update on our 2016 full year guidance.For the third quarter 2016, Centene's membership was 11.4 million members,",1649,"Thank you, Michael, and good morning. This morning, I will begin with highlighting the results for the third quarter of 2016 and provide an update on our 2016 full year guidance.
For the third quarter 2016, Centene's membership was 11.4 million members, an increase of 137% between years, driven by the Health Net acquisition. Total revenues were $10.8 billion, an increase of 86% over Q3 of 2015. Diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2016 was $0.84 compared to $0.75 last year, and adjusted diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2016 was $1.11 compared to $0.87 last year.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share include the charge of $0.05 per diluted share associated with the Arizona risk adjustment program. During the third quarter, we received information from CMS that some of the participants in the Arizona risk adjustment program were unable to pay the amounts owed to the federal government associated with the 2015 risk adjustment reconciliation. As a result, the uncollected risk adjustment amount was prorated to all insurers in the market. Accordingly, we recorded a charge of $0.05 per diluted share, recognizing our portion of the risk adjustment that will not be collected, which reduces the $0.19 per diluted share benefit we recorded in the second quarter of 2016.
Now for some more specifics. Total revenues grew year-over-year by $5 billion in the third quarter, primarily as a result of the Health Net acquisition, expansions or new programs in many of our states in 2015 and '16 and growth in the Health Insurance Marketplace business in 2016. Sequentially, our revenues were slightly lower than the second quarter due to lower commercial membership, primarily as a result of expected attrition in the Health Insurance Marketplace business and lower membership in the California Medicaid program as a result of annual eligibility redeterminations completed by the state. This was partially offset by growth in other markets, specifically in Louisiana Medicaid expansion. Our health benefits ratio was 87% in the third quarter this year compared to 89% in last year's third quarter and 86.6% in the second quarter of 2016. The 200 basis point decrease year-over-year results from the addition of Health Net as well as the growth in the Health Insurance Marketplace business, both of which operate at a lower HBR. Sequentially, the 40 basis point increase in the second quarter reflects normal seasonality in the business.
We continue to deliver strong membership and margins in the Health Insurance Marketplace business during the third quarter. The product continues to achieve margins at the high end of our targeted range, and we now have over $329 million accrued as a risk adjustment payable for services provided in 2016. For 2016, we continue to record reinsurance at the 50% coinsurance rate, record no risk corridor receivable and record the risk adjustment utilizing the information we received from the data aggregators consistent with 2015. Our general and administrative expense ratio was 9.2% in the third quarter of this year or 9.1% excluding the cost associated with the Health Net acquisition compared to 8.4% in the third quarter of last year and 9% in the second quarter of this year, also excluding Health Net acquisition cost. The increase year-over-year reflects the addition of the Health Net business, which operates at a higher G&A ratio due to a greater mix of commercial business. Sequentially, the 10 basis point increase is due to lower revenue in the third quarter. During the third quarter, we incurred $0.07 per diluted share of business expansion costs, primarily associated with the Texas STAR Kids award and the 2017 Medicare expansion, compared to $0.05 per diluted share in the prior year.
Investment and other income was $33 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared to $8 million for the third quarter last year and $32 million in the second quarter of this year. The increase year-over-year is a result of the larger investment balances associated with the Health Net acquisition. Interest expense was $57 million for the third quarter of 2016 compared to $11 million for the third quarter last year and $52 million in the second quarter of this year. The increase year-over-year is primarily due to the financing associated with the Health Net transaction. The sequential increase is due to the full quarter effect of the $500 million of additional senior notes we issued in June of 2016. Our tax rate for the quarter was 53.8% compared to 48.3% in the prior year. The higher tax rate is driven by the acquisition of Health Net.
During the third quarter, we received approval of our refund in connection with our tax position with respect to 162(m)(6) or the limitation on the deductibility of certain executive compensation. As a reminder, we expect to be subject to 162(m)(6) limitation in 2017 as a result of the Health Net acquisition.
GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the third quarter was $0.84, and adjusted diluted earnings per share for the third quarter was $1.11. Both amounts include a $0.05 diluted earnings per share charge associated with the Arizona risk adjustment program previously discussed. As a reminder, adjusted diluted earnings per share excludes $0.12 associated with the Health Net acquisition cost and $0.15 associated with intangible amortization.
Cash and investments totaled $8.1 billion at quarter end, including $268 million held by unregulated subsidiaries. We estimate our risk-based capital percentage for NAIC filers to be in excess of 350% of the authorized control level.
Debt on September 30 was $4.6 billion, including $300 million of borrowings on our revolver. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 44.1%, excluding our nonrecourse mortgage note, compared to 44.4% at the second quarter of 2016.
Our medical claim liability totaled $3.8 billion at September 30, representing 41 days in claims payable. The days and claims payable decreased during the third quarter due to annual provider risk share settlements of approximately $115 million in our California market as well as the timing of claims payments at the end of the quarter.
We had strong operating cash flow for the third quarter of $480 million or 3.3x net earnings. This was primarily driven by net earnings, collection of outstanding capitation payments and prepayment of amounts from CMS associated with the Medicare product. This was partially offset by payment of the health insurer fee of $513 million at quarter end. 
A quick update on the substance abuse claims. During the third quarter, we revised our estimate of the level of substance abuse cost we anticipated to incur between the acquisition date and the end of the year. As you recall, we established a reserve of $50 million in our acquisition accounting in the second quarter as an estimate of the liability associated with these claims for the period from March 24 through December 31, 2016. Based on the level of incurred and projected claims through the third quarter, we have lowered our estimate from $50 million to $35 million. This adjustment had no effect on earnings. We continue to evaluate the FAIR valuation associated with the substance abuse claims and expect to complete that analysis in the fourth quarter.
As Michael mentioned in his comments, we have taken actions associated with products that were included in the PDR, including product design, premium rates, product exits and numerous medical management and network initiatives. Based on the action we have taken, we believe we have resolved the issues associated with the 2016 premium deficiency reserve for 2017. We look forward to providing more details and full 2017 guidance at our normal December Investor Day.
Lastly, an update on our 2016 full year guidance. As described in our press release this morning, we are adjusting our guidance for the risk adjustment charge related to the Arizona recognized in third quarter. As we previously disclosed, during the second quarter of 2016, we recorded a benefit of $0.19 per diluted share and increased our full year guidance for the 2015 reconciliation of the risk adjustment and reinsurance provisions of the marketplace business at that time. As a result of the information received from CMS in the third quarter, the benefit recorded in the second quarter was reduced by $0.05 per diluted share to $0.14 when combining both quarters. We have updated our 2016 guidance accordingly. Our updated annual guidance is as follows: total revenues of $39.4 billion to $40 billion; GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.73 to $2.83; adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.28 to $4.38; G&A ratio of 9.4% to 9.9%; the G&A ratio excluding the transaction cost of 9% to 9.5%; an effective income tax rate of 54.5% to 56.5%; and diluted shares outstanding of 162.5 million to 163.5 million shares. The guidance above implies a fourth quarter GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.83 to $0.93 and an adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.05 to $1.15. This range now includes business expansion costs, which we expect to be at the high end of our guidance range of $0.25 to $0.30 in the fourth quarter, driven by increased costs associated with our expected Health Insurance Marketplace growth in 2017. We continue to estimate our operating cash flow on a long-term basis to be between 1.5 and 2x net earnings. As previously highlighted in the second quarter, we do anticipate that there will be variability in our cash flow from quarter-to-quarter, depending on the timing of payments to certain states associated with minimum MLR programs, primarily in California. Subsequent to quarter end, we received amendments to our California contracts with the Department of Health Care Services to amend the Medicaid expansion Medical Loss Ratio definition. All reconciliation periods remain open. However, we expect the amendment to reduce our minimum MLR liability and are currently working with the state to evaluate the impact in the amendment.
That concludes my remarks. And operator, you may now open the line for questions."

And we were liable at the time for 75% of billed charges till they change the certificate of coverage. So virtually putting in the changes that I discussed during my formal remarks eliminates the incentives that put people into that product at the same level. And we already see a material drop-off of that taking place. It was a bad design before. The state, everybody recognized it. It's been fully fixed, and there's other steps taking place that I'll let the legal authorities deal with as it relates to it. So that affects that. It also affects the normal PPO outside the pay bar [ph]. The same principle applies. We now have a product that will have great appeal. The people who want to use our in-network and who are in some rare occasions want to go out of network. I mean, they now have an exposure of $25,000 maximum out of pocket, which is significantly greater than what it was but very competitive. So it's really -- we now have the right PPO design. And PPOs have always been intended for in-network use with out-of-network being the exception. Before, virtually all the utilization was out of network.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Centene's third quarter 2016 earnings call. During the course of this morning's call, we will discuss our third quarter results and provide an update on Centene's markets and products. Additionally, we will bring you up-to-date on the Health Net integration.
Let me begin with a few comments on Health Net. As part of our ongoing fair value analysis, during the second quarter, we recorded a premium deficiency reserve of approximately $300 million due to unfavorable performance in some of Health Net's business operations. The PDR covers the period March 24 to December 31, 2016. We have taken significant actions over the past few months to improve the business operations for 2017 and beyond. These include price increases, plan design changes and certain market exits. We fully believe we have now dealt with all the factors that contributed to the PDR.
During the third quarter, we reduced the $300 million PDR to $285 million as the outlook of substance abuse claims liability in California has improved. Please note this had no effect on third quarter earnings. The largest component of the PDR is $110 million related to the California commercial business. We negotiated with the California Department of Insurance the necessary benefit changes. On October 3, we submitted our filings to the CDI for the 2017 plan designs and rate adjustments. These substantial benefit design changes allowed us to reduce our original 23% rate increase to 9.9%. Some of the key benefit changes included: the first-time inclusion of an out-of-network deductible for platinum and gold plans of $5000 for an individual and $10,000 for a family; a significant increase in the out-of-network maximum out-of-pocket level to $25,000 for an individual and $50,000 for a family; the elimination of non-emergent out-of-state coverage and travel network access; the elimination of the default rate of 75% of billed charges for out-of-network services that do not have a Medicare rate; the reduction of reimbursement for out-of-network physicians and other services and supplies to 100% of the Medicare rate from the 85th percentile of FAIR Health and 190% of the Medicare rate, respectively; and restrictions on third-party premium payments, which were not included the original 2016 offering. We believe these substantive changes will significantly strengthen our control of out-of-network utilization, which was the main driver of the PPO cost issues. In addition, we expect to further improve the operating performance of these products with the implementation of Centene's medical management tools as well as network enhancements. We appreciate the collaboration efforts of the CDI through the process. We expect the rate and benefit design changes to create a more competitive product in 2017 and allow for a balanced book of business.
Let me now go through the remaining components of the PDR and the corrective actions we have taken outside of California. First, $70 million related to Arizona individual commercial. We will exit the Arizona individual PPO business effective January 1, 2017. This exit represents $32 million of the $70 million loss. The remaining $38 million of the loss is associated with the individual HMO exchange product in Arizona. We have reconfigured our geographic presence, increased rates and redesigned benefits. We will remain in Pima County and enter Maricopa County as the only carrier. We expect the Arizona exchange to generate $500 million in incremental revenue and operate within our normal marketplace margins in 2017.
Second, $15 million related to Arizona Medicaid. As of July 1, this business has been fully transitioned to Centene's operating platform. We expect Arizona Medicaid to be profitable next year.
Third, $20 million related to other smaller items, including the Arizona small group and Oregon individual business. We have applied for rate increases and benefit design changes to address these issues.
And lastly, $70 million related to Medicare Advantage. We submitted bids in June and are taking actions on unit costs and medical management initiatives to achieve profitability next year.
Next, let's talk about Health Net integration. The integration process continues to go well, and we remain on track or ahead of schedule in many areas. We have now completed the actions needed to capture all of the $75 million first year synergy target.
During the third quarter, we began the conversion of Health Net's California plan on to Centene's medical management system. We expect this conversion to help drive better operating performance through the application of Centene's award-winning case management tools and programs.
Turning to third quarter financials. Membership at quarter end was 11.4 million members, representing an increase of 6.6 million beneficiaries over the third quarter of 2015. Total revenue increased 86% year-over-year to $10.8 billion. On a sequential basis, total revenues declined by $50 million due to exchange membership attrition and the eligibility redetermine process in California Medicaid. This is partially offset by a commencement of Medicaid expansion in Louisiana, and all of these were expected. Note the redetermine results in a sequential loss of approximately 61,000 Medicaid beneficiaries in this state. It has now been completed, and roughly 16,000 members were added in October. The HBR improved 200 basis points year-over-year to 87%. This was primarily attributable to the commercial product mix shift from Health Net. Importantly, we continue to see stable medical cost trends consistent with our expectations in the low single digits.
Lastly, on a GAAP basis, we reported diluted earnings per share of $0.84. We reported adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.11 or $1.16 when excluding a $0.05 expense related to the 2015 risk adjustment and reinsurance reconciliation under the Affordable Care Act. Recall that in the second quarter, we recorded a $0.19 diluted EPS benefit related to this reconciliation. Thus, the net benefit we have recorded in the past 2 months is actually $0.14. Jeff will provide further financial details, including updated 2016 guidance. 
Now on to market and product updates. First, we will discuss recent Medicaid activity. In August, Centene was 1 of 3 brands selected to serve long-term care recipients enrolled in Pennsylvania's Healthy -- or HealthChoice program statewide. This program covers more than 420,000 individuals who are duly eligible and those with physical disabilities. This contract will be rolled out in 3 tranches. The Southwest zone will be the first to go live with an expected start date of July 1, 2017. The Southeast zone is expected to commence January of 2018, and the remainder of the state is expected to begin on January 1, 2019. Pennsylvania marks Centene's 10th state managing long-term care for long-term care beneficiaries. We are the largest provider of long-term care support services, one of the fastest-growing segments of the managed care market. While the contract has been -- not been finalized, we expect that it will ramp up and be profitable within a normal time frame. 
Alabama. In September, the Alabama legislature approved the funding needed to create its regional care organization structure. Centene's specialty solutions division involved has contracted with 5 nonprofit RCOs in the state to provide management services. Operations are expected to commence July 1, 2017. This award highlights Centene's depth and breadth of management services under our involved plan. 
Missouri. Last week, we were pleased to be selected to provide managed care services to Medicaid recipients in all 114 counties in Missouri. This award is a successful reprocurement and expansion of Centene's presence in the state. This expanded program covers over 240,000 additional Medicaid beneficiaries in Missouri, bringing the total number of individuals covered to over 740,000 lives. The program is expected to commence May 1, 2017. 
Next, Medicare and duals. At quarter end, we served over 300,000 Medicare and dual beneficiaries. We continue to move forward with our growth plan to expand our Medicare Advantage footprint into Centene's Medicaid states next year. We are launching new MA plans in Texas, Florida and Mississippi. These new plans will be launched under our 4-STAR parent [ph] rating and are eligible for a 5% premium bonus. In Georgia, we're using our existing special needs plans to launch Medicare Advantage. This plan will also be eligible for a quality bonus. Consistent with Centene's overall strategy, we will focus on low-income Medicare beneficiaries. We fully expect to have a profitable MA business in 2017.
Let me make a brief comment on the recently announced 2018 Medicare Advantage STAR ratings. We are pleased to have maintained our 4-STAR parent [ph] rating. 7 of our plans saw an improved -- an improvement in STAR ratings, and 7 plans' STAR ratings stayed the same. Our Oregon plan STAR rating declined from 4 to 3.5 stars, primarily due to a reduction in Part D scores. This was the result of the addition of a deductible to our prescription drug benefit, which was done to improve profitability. This issue was limited to the Oregon market. Maintaining a high-quality STAR rating is a top priority for Centene. 
Now Health Insurance Marketplaces. Centene's exchange experience continues to be favorable, and we are achieving margins at the high end of our targeted range. Our marketplace strategy is different from most of our peers. We design our exchange solutions to be able to leverage our Medicaid platform, including provider networks, as we are focused on low-income subsidized individuals. In the third quarter, over 90% of our exchange revenues were subsidy-eligible. This is consistent with our prior experience. We ended the quarter with over 580,000 exchange members in 15 states. We continue to anticipate serving approximately 550,000 exchange members at year-end due to normal attrition. Overall, we continue to expect our marketplace offerings to be profitable next year. 
Shifting gears to our rate outlook. For Medicaid, we continue to expect a 2016 composite rate adjustment of between 0% and 1%, consistent with the past few years.
In summary, we are optimistic about the future of our ability to extend Centene's leadership position in government-sponsored health care. We are on track with the integration of Health Net. We have taken the necessary actions to substantially improve the underperforming markets and products covered by the 2016 PDR. Our growth pipeline is bigger than ever, and we have continued to expand our Medicare Advantage market. We remain committed to long-term margin expansion and continue to make the necessary investments in systems and infrastructure to successfully execute our strategy. As a reminder, our next Investor Day is on December 16 in New York City. As is our custom, we will provide full first-time 2017 financial guidance. 
I would like to make a couple comments on our expectations for 2017. At this time, we believe total revenues will be approximately $46 billion at a minimum. This represents a $1 billion increase over the estimate we provided at the June Investor Day and a 15% increase over 2016. Importantly, the outlook continues to be favorable despite the fact that the denominator is significantly larger. Equally, while we are still finalizing our AOP, or annual operating plan, for '17, we have no reason to believe that the consensus estimate for '17 will be outside our target range.
Thank you for your interest in Centene. Jeff will now provide further details on our third quarter financial results."
26273,322820122,1061013,"Centene Corp., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2016",2016-10-25,"Earnings Calls","Centene Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Michael, and good morning. This morning, I will begin with highlighting the results for the third quarter of 2016 and provide an update on our 2016 full year guidance.For the third quarter 2016, Centene's membership was 11.4 million members,",1649,"Thank you, Michael, and good morning. This morning, I will begin with highlighting the results for the third quarter of 2016 and provide an update on our 2016 full year guidance.
For the third quarter 2016, Centene's membership was 11.4 million members, an increase of 137% between years, driven by the Health Net acquisition. Total revenues were $10.8 billion, an increase of 86% over Q3 of 2015. Diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2016 was $0.84 compared to $0.75 last year, and adjusted diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2016 was $1.11 compared to $0.87 last year.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share include the charge of $0.05 per diluted share associated with the Arizona risk adjustment program. During the third quarter, we received information from CMS that some of the participants in the Arizona risk adjustment program were unable to pay the amounts owed to the federal government associated with the 2015 risk adjustment reconciliation. As a result, the uncollected risk adjustment amount was prorated to all insurers in the market. Accordingly, we recorded a charge of $0.05 per diluted share, recognizing our portion of the risk adjustment that will not be collected, which reduces the $0.19 per diluted share benefit we recorded in the second quarter of 2016.
Now for some more specifics. Total revenues grew year-over-year by $5 billion in the third quarter, primarily as a result of the Health Net acquisition, expansions or new programs in many of our states in 2015 and '16 and growth in the Health Insurance Marketplace business in 2016. Sequentially, our revenues were slightly lower than the second quarter due to lower commercial membership, primarily as a result of expected attrition in the Health Insurance Marketplace business and lower membership in the California Medicaid program as a result of annual eligibility redeterminations completed by the state. This was partially offset by growth in other markets, specifically in Louisiana Medicaid expansion. Our health benefits ratio was 87% in the third quarter this year compared to 89% in last year's third quarter and 86.6% in the second quarter of 2016. The 200 basis point decrease year-over-year results from the addition of Health Net as well as the growth in the Health Insurance Marketplace business, both of which operate at a lower HBR. Sequentially, the 40 basis point increase in the second quarter reflects normal seasonality in the business.
We continue to deliver strong membership and margins in the Health Insurance Marketplace business during the third quarter. The product continues to achieve margins at the high end of our targeted range, and we now have over $329 million accrued as a risk adjustment payable for services provided in 2016. For 2016, we continue to record reinsurance at the 50% coinsurance rate, record no risk corridor receivable and record the risk adjustment utilizing the information we received from the data aggregators consistent with 2015. Our general and administrative expense ratio was 9.2% in the third quarter of this year or 9.1% excluding the cost associated with the Health Net acquisition compared to 8.4% in the third quarter of last year and 9% in the second quarter of this year, also excluding Health Net acquisition cost. The increase year-over-year reflects the addition of the Health Net business, which operates at a higher G&A ratio due to a greater mix of commercial business. Sequentially, the 10 basis point increase is due to lower revenue in the third quarter. During the third quarter, we incurred $0.07 per diluted share of business expansion costs, primarily associated with the Texas STAR Kids award and the 2017 Medicare expansion, compared to $0.05 per diluted share in the prior year.
Investment and other income was $33 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared to $8 million for the third quarter last year and $32 million in the second quarter of this year. The increase year-over-year is a result of the larger investment balances associated with the Health Net acquisition. Interest expense was $57 million for the third quarter of 2016 compared to $11 million for the third quarter last year and $52 million in the second quarter of this year. The increase year-over-year is primarily due to the financing associated with the Health Net transaction. The sequential increase is due to the full quarter effect of the $500 million of additional senior notes we issued in June of 2016. Our tax rate for the quarter was 53.8% compared to 48.3% in the prior year. The higher tax rate is driven by the acquisition of Health Net.
During the third quarter, we received approval of our refund in connection with our tax position with respect to 162(m)(6) or the limitation on the deductibility of certain executive compensation. As a reminder, we expect to be subject to 162(m)(6) limitation in 2017 as a result of the Health Net acquisition.
GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the third quarter was $0.84, and adjusted diluted earnings per share for the third quarter was $1.11. Both amounts include a $0.05 diluted earnings per share charge associated with the Arizona risk adjustment program previously discussed. As a reminder, adjusted diluted earnings per share excludes $0.12 associated with the Health Net acquisition cost and $0.15 associated with intangible amortization.
Cash and investments totaled $8.1 billion at quarter end, including $268 million held by unregulated subsidiaries. We estimate our risk-based capital percentage for NAIC filers to be in excess of 350% of the authorized control level.
Debt on September 30 was $4.6 billion, including $300 million of borrowings on our revolver. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 44.1%, excluding our nonrecourse mortgage note, compared to 44.4% at the second quarter of 2016.
Our medical claim liability totaled $3.8 billion at September 30, representing 41 days in claims payable. The days and claims payable decreased during the third quarter due to annual provider risk share settlements of approximately $115 million in our California market as well as the timing of claims payments at the end of the quarter.
We had strong operating cash flow for the third quarter of $480 million or 3.3x net earnings. This was primarily driven by net earnings, collection of outstanding capitation payments and prepayment of amounts from CMS associated with the Medicare product. This was partially offset by payment of the health insurer fee of $513 million at quarter end. 
A quick update on the substance abuse claims. During the third quarter, we revised our estimate of the level of substance abuse cost we anticipated to incur between the acquisition date and the end of the year. As you recall, we established a reserve of $50 million in our acquisition accounting in the second quarter as an estimate of the liability associated with these claims for the period from March 24 through December 31, 2016. Based on the level of incurred and projected claims through the third quarter, we have lowered our estimate from $50 million to $35 million. This adjustment had no effect on earnings. We continue to evaluate the FAIR valuation associated with the substance abuse claims and expect to complete that analysis in the fourth quarter.
As Michael mentioned in his comments, we have taken actions associated with products that were included in the PDR, including product design, premium rates, product exits and numerous medical management and network initiatives. Based on the action we have taken, we believe we have resolved the issues associated with the 2016 premium deficiency reserve for 2017. We look forward to providing more details and full 2017 guidance at our normal December Investor Day.
Lastly, an update on our 2016 full year guidance. As described in our press release this morning, we are adjusting our guidance for the risk adjustment charge related to the Arizona recognized in third quarter. As we previously disclosed, during the second quarter of 2016, we recorded a benefit of $0.19 per diluted share and increased our full year guidance for the 2015 reconciliation of the risk adjustment and reinsurance provisions of the marketplace business at that time. As a result of the information received from CMS in the third quarter, the benefit recorded in the second quarter was reduced by $0.05 per diluted share to $0.14 when combining both quarters. We have updated our 2016 guidance accordingly. Our updated annual guidance is as follows: total revenues of $39.4 billion to $40 billion; GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.73 to $2.83; adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.28 to $4.38; G&A ratio of 9.4% to 9.9%; the G&A ratio excluding the transaction cost of 9% to 9.5%; an effective income tax rate of 54.5% to 56.5%; and diluted shares outstanding of 162.5 million to 163.5 million shares. The guidance above implies a fourth quarter GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.83 to $0.93 and an adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.05 to $1.15. This range now includes business expansion costs, which we expect to be at the high end of our guidance range of $0.25 to $0.30 in the fourth quarter, driven by increased costs associated with our expected Health Insurance Marketplace growth in 2017. We continue to estimate our operating cash flow on a long-term basis to be between 1.5 and 2x net earnings. As previously highlighted in the second quarter, we do anticipate that there will be variability in our cash flow from quarter-to-quarter, depending on the timing of payments to certain states associated with minimum MLR programs, primarily in California. Subsequent to quarter end, we received amendments to our California contracts with the Department of Health Care Services to amend the Medicaid expansion Medical Loss Ratio definition. All reconciliation periods remain open. However, we expect the amendment to reduce our minimum MLR liability and are currently working with the state to evaluate the impact in the amendment.
That concludes my remarks. And operator, you may now open the line for questions."

And the other issues where it was a percent of billed charges, they could be out-of-network. Providers could bill what they wanted. And we were liable at the time for 75% of billed charges till they change the certificate of coverage. So virtually putting in the changes that I discussed during my formal remarks eliminates the incentives that put people into that product at the same level. And we already see a material drop-off of that taking place. It was a bad design before. The state, everybody recognized it. It's been fully fixed, and there's other steps taking place that I'll let the legal authorities deal with as it relates to it. So that affects that. It also affects the normal PPO outside the pay bar [ph]. The same principle applies. We now have a product that will have great appeal. The people who want to use our in-network and who are in some rare occasions want to go out of network. I mean, they now have an exposure of $25,000 maximum out of pocket, which is significantly greater than what it was but very competitive. So it's really -- we now have the right PPO design. And PPOs have always been intended for in-network use with out-of-network being the exception. Before, virtually all the utilization was out of network.
