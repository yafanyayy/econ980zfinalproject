Good morning, everyone, and thanks, of course, for joining us today for our Q4 and year-end call. As you saw in our press release, we ended the year on a very strong note, delivering excellent fourth quarter results. Our teams identified and",2690,"Thanks, Ken. Good morning, everyone, and thanks, of course, for joining us today for our Q4 and year-end call. As you saw in our press release, we ended the year on a very strong note, delivering excellent fourth quarter results. Our teams identified and capitalized on year-end opportunities, delivered our value proposition to help our customers meet their objectives and executed well to achieve our goals for the year. I think our performance demonstrates that no matter what we're facing in the macro environment, we have many opportunities to gain share. At the same time, we're steadily expanding our capabilities in line with our growth strategy and this gives us even more potential to create value for all of our key stakeholders, customers, employees and shareholders. I'll cover some of our business highlights of the quarter and the year later on in my remarks, but first, I'll give you a summary of our financial performance, discuss our growth relative to our key end markets and wrap up with an overview of our annual guidance for 2016. 
So starting with the quarter. We grew our adjusted earnings per share by 7% to $2.12, continuing our long track record of strong adjusted EPS performance. Our revenue in Q4 grew 4% year-over-year. Our adjusted operating income increased 5% and we expanded our adjusted operating margin by 40 basis points to 23.2%. 
Looking at our Q4 performance in the context of our key end markets, I'm pleased to say that we did a great job of capitalizing on year-end opportunities to deliver strong growth overall. Starting with industrial and applied, our performance were similar to what we've seen all year with very low single-digit growth. Our industrial businesses remain soft while our businesses serving applied markets continued to perform well, particularly our Analytical Instruments used for environmental and food safety applications. As an example, I'm very pleased to -- I'm very pleased with the performance of our chromatography business. Some of this is due to the success of the vanquished UHPLC system we launched a little over a year ago, but fundamentally, the benefits of the Dionex acquisition in 2011 are really playing out. We're seeing strength across our entire portfolio from HPLC to GC to ion chromatography as well as software and consumables. 
Turning to diagnostics and health care. It was good to see stronger results in this end market in Q4. We delivered mid-single-digit growth with especially strong performance in our clinical diagnostics and immunodiagnostics businesses. In academic and government, conditions in this end market were the strongest we've seen all year. We executed well to take advantage of strong spending at the year -- at the end of the year in the U.S. and Europe and we delivered mid-single-digit growth. It's good to see positive momentum in this end market and we're encouraged about our prospects here given the more favorable funding environment in the U.S. in 2016. 
Last, I'm pleased to say that we capped off a very strong year in pharma and biotech with another outstanding quarter with growth in the mid-teens. We're clearly benefiting from the underlying strength of this end market and the power of our customer value proposition, which is creating a significant competitive advantage for us and drove strong performance across our businesses that serve this end market.
Our results show that in this economic environment, our customers turn to us to help them be successful, whether they're driving more innovation or increasing productivity to fund those R&D investments. Our scale and depth of capabilities is a key differentiator that creates value for our customers across our end markets. 
So in summary, we took full advantage of the year-end opportunities, executed well and delivered very strong Q4 performance that led to a great year overall.
Now I'll transition to our full year results. The main takeaway is very clear. We achieved all the goals we set out to achieve. It wasn't the easiest of environments, but with thoughtful planning, great operational execution and intense focus on our customers, we delivered another strong year. Among our key objectives in 2015, we focused on meeting or exceeding our financial commitments, making good progress in advancing our growth strategy, capturing the synergies from the Life Technologies acquisition and strengthening our balance sheet. I'm pleased to report that we accomplished each of these objectives and I'll cover them in a bit more detail starting with the financials. 
Obviously, with a challenging environment from an FX perspective and the strengthening of the dollar impacted every multinational company. But we effectively navigate those headwinds, which Steven will discuss later in his remarks and achieve what I feel was a very solid year. We delivered $7.39 of adjusted EPS, which was a 6% increase year-over-year despite an 11% headwind from foreign exchange. We grew revenues to a record $16.97 billion for the full year. Adjusted operating income increased 3% and we achieved adjusted operating income margin of 60 basis points to 22.5%. 
Let me take a moment here to give you some insight into how we're thinking about margin expansion. As you know, we've been able to steadily expand our operating margins over the years. We do this by leveraging our PPI business system in all the levers we have to drive margins, whether it's pricing, sourcing or footprint optimization. You can see in our results that we did a great job of expanding margins despite a very significant FX headwind. Given that we will continue to face FX challenges in 2016, we remain very focused on driving productivity by continuing to use our operational levers. We've also decided to take some additional actions that will help us further down the road. We will fund those additional productivity actions through the benefits we gain from the temporary repeal of the medical device tax. This will enable us to further strengthen our operating margins going into 2017. We have a substantial opportunity to expand our margins and we still think it's reasonable to take them to the 24% to 26% range by 2018.
So we delivered solid performance for the year by staying true to our growth strategy and making sure that every decision we made put us in a stronger position in the eyes of our customers. 
Now let me hit some of the highlights and accomplishments from the year and from the quarter in the context of our growth strategy. As you know, it's based on 3 elements: developing high-impact innovative new products; capitalizing on our scale in Asia Pacific and emerging markets; and leveraging our unique customer value proposition. The success of this strategy creates significant competitive advantage for us, and that gives us many opportunities to gain share. 
Starting with innovation. 2015 was another very strong year for us. I covered our new product highlights during the course of the year, so I'm not going to get into much detail today. We did have strong launches serving the research scientists as well as for our customers working in clinical and applied markets. 
Starting with the research community. The big news last year was our launch of the Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Tribrid mass spectrometer for proteomics. We actually just learned yesterday the Lumos was voted by customers who read SelectScience Magazine as the best new drug discovery product of 2015. Our industry-leading Orbitrap platform gives us a foundation for expansion into a range of applications and we continue to fully leverage that capability. 
We also had a number of exciting products launched in genetic analysis, but let me just mention a couple of them. One was our cloud-enabled QuantStudio 3 and 5 real-time qPCR systems, which support our increasing focus on oncology. The other was the new INS 5 and S5 XL product line, which makes targeted next-gen sequencing more accessible for a range of research applications. 
Moving to the clinic. We introduced a number of new immunoassays during the year as well as a new [indiscernible] instrument that effectively leverages our customers' capital investment by running tests for both allergy and autoimmunity. One example from the quarter that I do want to highlight is our collaboration with the Karolinska Institute of Sweden on a groundbreaking clinical study aimed at developing a more effective test for prostate cancer. Using our proteomic, genomic and assay technologies, this test can predict or more precisely distinguish between benign and aggressive cancers thus reducing a number of biopsies required without compromising the number of actual cancers diagnosed. These are early days and there's still much more work here to be done, but it's very exciting and may be an alternative to the PSA test. This development would not have happened without the ability to leverage all of these capabilities across our company
Turning to applied markets. Our new Q Exactive Focus LC-MS created a powerful alternative to Q-TOF technology for a number of applications including toxicology, pharma QAQC, food and environmental analysis as well. The focus is really gaining traction and significantly contributed to our growth in our Analytical Instruments business in Q4. 
So as you can see, 2015 was another outstanding year for innovation. We put our R&D dollars and expertise to work to deliver high-impact products that help our customers achieve their goals. I look forward to discussing the exciting innovations we plan to launch during 2016 as the year unfolds.
Let me now turn to the second element of our growth strategy, which is about using our scale as a competitive advantage in Asia Pacific and emerging markets. You saw in our press release that we highlighted China growth. Well, I have to steal Stephen's thunder a little it by telling you that we achieved high teens growth in China in Q4, really outstanding performance by the team. The question I get a lot on with China is how we've been doing so well given the magnitude of change taking place in that country. Well, from my perspective, I think it boils down to 2 things. First, China has challenges that we are in the best position to help our customers address, like poor air and water quality, unsafe food supplies and strains on their health care system. The second reason is that we've taken advantage of our scale but also have a very localized approach to running our business there. We have a team that understands the markets and where the funding is and has executed very well. 
Let me give you one example from the quarter which is a new product we launched from our China Innovation Center in Shanghai. Contaminated water is a big issue there and some important new regulations were being put in place by the government to control various water pollutants. We worked closely with our customers to understand their requirements and launched the Orion 3106 COD water analyzer in Q4. And in addition to detecting pollutants, this new product will also help our customers lower their operating cost by reducing maintenance and reagent consumption. 
During the year, we also expanded our capabilities to capture opportunities in other emerging markets such as Southeast Asia. Our most recent development was the November opening of a new GMP biopharma clinical services facility in Singapore to serve the growing needs of pharma and biotech customers in the region. Our strong performance in 2015 shows that we're effectively leveraging our global scale to best serve our customers and drive growth.
Turning to our customer value proposition, the third element of our growth strategy. I think the best example here is our successful integration of Life Technologies. We had high expectations for this business when we acquired it 2 years ago and it's been a home run for us, not only in terms of the financial benefits but also in strengthening our customer offering and the strategic position of our company. 
Regarding the financials -- the metrics we laid out in early 2015, which were higher than the original deal model, were $115 million of additional cost synergies and $60 million or revenue synergies for the year. I'm very pleased to report that in 2015, we delivered $130 million of cost synergies and ended the year at our target year 3 run rate. 
In terms of revenue synergies, we really gained early traction here and achieved approximately $90 million of revenue synergies in 2015, much faster than we anticipated. This performance puts us in a great position to achieve our 2016 revenue synergy goals.
From a customer perspective, we have a clear advantage as a result of combining our capabilities across the company. Our bioproduction and biosciences businesses are now growing faster than they were independently. Having genetic and protein analysis technologies in one company is creating exciting new opportunities like the prostate cancer test I mentioned earlier. And the commercial presence we now have by combining our channel and e-commerce capabilities is really starting to drive growth.
In terms of our strategic position, at our Analyst Meeting last May, we said we expected Life Sciences Solutions to grow organically at 3% or better for the year, and I'm very pleased to report that the business grew organically at 5% in 2015, which contributed to our strong performance for the company overall. This is a great example of how we put our capital to work to create value for our customers and our shareholders.
Let me now give you a quick update on our balance sheet. Know that last year we were focused on delevering following the Life Technologies acquisition. I'm pleased to tell you that we achieved our target leverage ratio of 3x leverage at the end of 2015. This timing is slightly ahead of what we expected when we announced the transaction and we accomplished this while repurchasing $500 million of our stock early last year and paying about $240 million of dividends as well as spending $700 million on 2 complementary bolt-on acquisitions. To remind you, ASI strengthened our capabilities, serving the high-growth bioproduction market and Alfa Aesar expanded our offering of chemicals for the research laboratory. 
So we put ourselves in a great position from a balance sheet perspective as we begin 2016 and we're able to kick off the year by announcing our agreement to acquire Affymetrix. Many of you are familiar with this business, which is a leader in cellular and genetic analysis. Affymetrix has a strong position in flow cytometry and antibodies, which will strengthen our biosciences offering. It was also the pioneer of micro-array technology that will be a nice complement to our genetic sciences business. This transaction also offers attractive financial benefits. We expect $0.10 of adjusted EPS accretion in the first full year of ownership and we also expect to generate $70 million of synergies by year 3 following the close. So good financial returns and also a very good fit for our Life Sciences Solutions business.
Let me now turn to our guidance for 2016. Stephen will cover the details and outline all of the assumptions for our revenue and earnings guidance, but I'd like to make a couple of comments. Our 2016 guidance reflects the fact that foreign exchange will continue to have a negative impact on our top and bottom line performance, although we anticipate to a lesser degree than it did in 2015 based on where rates are today. So we're guiding to adjusted EPS in the range of $7.80 to $7.96. This would result in 6% to 8% growth over the $7.39 we delivered in 2015. 
In terms of revenues, we expect to deliver between $17.36 billion and $17.56 billion in 2016. So before I turn the call over to Stephen, let me leave you with a few takeaways. We focused on our customers and effectively navigated the macro environment to achieve our goals for the year. We continue to innovate, expand our global reach and enhance our customer value proposition in line with our growth strategy. We also strengthened our balance sheet so we can resume our normal capital deployment in 2016 and identify new opportunities to create shareholder value. 
With that, I'll now hand over the call to Stephen Williamson, our CFO. Stephen?"
97023,321212628,922183,"Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2016",2016-01-28,"Earnings Calls","Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Marc. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin with an overview of our Q4 and full year 2015 financial performance for the total company. Then I'll provide some color on our 4 segments and conclude with a detailed review of our 2016 guidance. So start",2837,"Thanks, Marc. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin with an overview of our Q4 and full year 2015 financial performance for the total company. Then I'll provide some color on our 4 segments and conclude with a detailed review of our 2016 guidance. 
So starting with our overall financial performance for the fourth quarter. As you saw in our press release, we grew adjusted EPS by 7% to $2.12. For the full year, adjusted EPS was $7.39, up 6% from 2014. The midpoint of our guidance that we gave you at the end of Q3 was $7.37 adjusted EPS for the full year 2015. Subsequent to this guidance, the negative foreign exchange impact on Q4 increased significantly, resulting in a further $0.06 of headwind in the quarter. I'm pleased to say that we're able to offset all of this and still able to deliver $7.39 for the full year, $0.02 more than the midpoint of our last guidance.
GAAP EPS was $1.10 in Q4, up 1% from $1.49 in the prior year's quarter and $4.92 for full year 2015, up 4% from $4.71 in 2014. On the top line, we delivered 7% organic revenue growth this quarter and our reported revenue increased 4% year-over-year. Q4 reported revenue includes 1% growth from acquisitions and a 4% headwind from foreign exchange. For the full year 2015, reported revenue was flat year-over-year and organic revenue growth was 5%. Full year reported revenue includes 1% growth from acquisitions net of divestitures and a 6% negative impact from foreign exchange.
Looking at the growth by geography in Q4. North America grew in the mid-single digits and Europe grew in the high-single digits. Asia Pacific grew in the low double digits, and as Marc mentioned, China was growing in the high teens. And rest of the world declined in the high single digits. For the full year, both North America and Europe grew in the mid-single digits. Asia Pacific grew in the high single digits and China growing in the mid-teens and the rest of the world declined in the low single digits. 
So looking at our operational performance. Q4 adjusted operating income increased 5% and adjusted operating margin was 23.2%, up 40 basis points from Q4 last year despite an 80 basis points headwind from foreign exchange. For the full year, adjusted operating income increased 3% and adjusted operating margin was 22.5%, up 60 basis points from 2014 despite the 90 basis points headwind from foreign exchange.
At a high level, our adjusted operating margin expansion from the quarter and the full year was driven by continued strong contribution from the PPI Business System productivity levers including pricing, global sourcing and footprint optimization as well as the continued contribution from cost synergies. 
In Q4, we realized $18 million of cost synergy benefits from the Life Technologies acquisition. That's just $130 million for the full year 2015. And as Marc said, we were able to accelerate the capture of revenue synergies and realized $40 million during Q4 and $90 million for the full year 2015. This puts us in a great position to deliver on the 3-year run rate target of $150 million of revenue synergies in 2016. We took advantage of our strong performance in Q4 to make additional strategic investments primarily to spend from the commercial capabilities and to accelerate growth.
Moving on to the details of the P&. L total company adjusted gross margin came in at 47.7% in Q4, down 130 basis points from the prior year. For the full year, adjusted gross margin was 48.3%, down 50 basis points from 2014. The decreases in gross margin in both Q4 and the full year are primarily attributed to foreign exchange and unfavorable business mix.
Adjusted SG&A in Q4 was 20.6% of revenue, which is 150 basis points favorable to Q4 2014, driven primarily by foreign exchange, cost synergies and our productivity actions. For the full year, adjusted SG&A was 21.7%, 120 basis points favorable to 2014. And finally, R&D expense came in at 3.9% of revenue in Q4, 20 basis points favorable to Q4 2014 and full year R&D expense was 4.1%, flat to full year 2014. And R&D as a percent of our manufacturing revenue for full year 2015 was 6.4%. Both were flat for the full year 2014. 
So looking at our results below the line. Net interest expense in Q4 was $94 million, down $13 million from Q4 last year as a result of reducing our debt over the past 12 months. Net interest expense for the full year was $384 million, a decrease of $48 million from 2014. Adjusted other income for Q4 was negative $7 million, $60 million lower than Q4 2014. And for the full year, it was $6 million, which is $7 million lower than last year, both driven primarily by nonoperating foreign exchange net losses in 2015 compared to net gains in 2014. 
Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 13%, 20 basis points below last year. Our full year rate was 13.7%, down from 14.5% in 2014, primarily as a result of realizing our benefits of our acquisition tax planning. And average diluted shares were 402.4 million in Q4, down 1.7 million year-over-year, primarily as a result of the share buybacks we completed in Q1, partially offset by option dilution. For the full year, average diluted shares were 401.9 million, down 0.4 million from 2014. 
Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Cash flow from continuing operations for the year was $2.83 billion and free cash flow was $2.42 billion after deducting net capital expenditure of $405 million. This is slightly lower than our previous guidance due to additional investments in working capital. We ended the year with $455 million in cash and investments. During 2015, we've continued to return capital to shareholders with $500 million of share buybacks in Q1 and $240 million of dividends including $60 million of dividends in Q4. We also continue to make strategic acquisitions in 2015, spending $300 million in Q1 to acquire ASI and $400 million in Q4 to acquire Alfa Aesar. 
Our total debt at the end of Q4 was $12.5 billion, down $800 million sequentially from Q3 and we achieved our year-end target leverage ratio at 3x total debt to adjusted EBITDA. 
And wrapping up my comments in our total company performance, we continue to make progress on our ROIC. Our trailing 12 months adjusted ROIC in Q4 was 9.5%, up 20 basis points sequentially from Q3 and up 60 basis points from Q1 2015 when the Life Technologies acquisition was fully included in the average investment base.
So with that, I'll now provide you with some color on the performance of our 4 business segments. As I highlighted for the total company, foreign exchange continued to be a significant headwind for the top line for our segments and impacted our year-over-year revenue growth and adjusted operating margins to varying degrees. 
Starting with Life Sciences Solutions segment. Reported revenue increased 2% in Q4 and organic revenue grew 5%. In the quarter, we continued to see strong growth in our bioproduction and biosciences businesses. For the full year, reported revenue grew 6% on organic growth of 5%. Q4 adjusted operating income in Life Sciences Solutions increased 5% and adjusted operating margin was 31.6%, up 80 basis points, benefiting from very strong productivity and incremental cost synergies, partially offset by some unfavorable product mix, significantly unfavorable foreign exchange and strategic growth investments. For the full year 2015, adjusted operating margin was 30.1%, 110 basis points higher than the prior year. 
In the Analytical Instruments segment, reported revenue increased 3% in Q4 and organic revenue growth was 7%. In the quarter, we have strong growth in our chromatography and mass spectrometry businesses, partially offset by weaknesses that we continued to see in some of our core industrial markets. For the full year, reported revenue declined 1% and organic growth was 4%. Q4 adjusted operating income in Analytical Instruments increased 13% and adjusted operating margin was 22.1%, up 190 basis points. We delivered very strong productivity in this segment partially offset by foreign exchange, unfavorable mix and strategic growth investments. For the full year 2015, adjusted operating income increased 5% and adjusted operating margin was 19.1%, 120 basis points higher than 2014. 
Turning to the Specialty Diagnostics segment. In Q4, total revenue grew slightly and organic revenue growth was 4%. This was driven by good growth in our immunodiagnostics and clinical diagnostics businesses, partially offset by the expiration of the OEM contract that I mentioned on our Q3 call. For the full year, reported revenue declined 3% and organic growth was 3%. Adjusted operating income in the segment decreased 3% in Q4 and adjusted operating margin was 26.2%, down 90 basis points from the prior year. In the segment, we drove very good productivity. However, this is more than offset by the expiration of the OEM contract, unfavorable foreign exchange and strategic growth investments. For the full year 2015, adjusted operating income decreased 5% and adjusted operating margin was 26.9%, down 50 basis points from 2014.
And finally, in our Laboratory Products and Services segment, Q4 reported revenue increased 8% and organic revenue growth was 10%. This segment continues to benefit from our strong performance in the pharma and biotech end market with our biopharma services, channel and laboratory products businesses all delivering very strong growth. For the full year, reported revenue grew 1% and organic revenue grew 7%. Adjusted operating income in the segment increased 9% and adjusted operating margin was 14.7%, up 20 basis points from the prior year. Margin expansion in the quarter was driven by productivity improvements partially offset by strategic growth investments. For full year 2015, adjusted operating margin -- income increased 2% and adjusted operating margin was 15%, up 10 basis points from the prior year. 
So with that, I'd like to review the details of our 2016 guidance. Consistent with our usual practice, our guidance does not include any future acquisitions or divestitures. As a result, it does not include the impact of our recently announced Affymetrix acquisition, which we expect to close by the end of Q2. We will update our guidance after that deal closes. As Marc mentioned, we're initiating a 2016 adjusted EPS guidance range of $7.80 to $7.96, which represents growth of 6% to 8% over our 2015 adjusted EPS of $7.39.
In terms of revenue, our guidance range is $17.36 billion to $17.56 billion, which represents growth of about 2.5% to 3.5% versus our reported revenue of $16.97 billion in 2015. On an organic basis, our revenue range assumes an organic growth midpoint of about 4%.
As Marc mentioned, we're seeing another year of negative impact on both the top and bottom line as a result of the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus major foreign currencies. As always, we're focused on our reported numbers, but I thought I'd give you a bit more color on the foreign exchange to give you some perspective on how it's impacting our guidance. On the top line, foreign exchange is lowering our revenue by approximately $290 million, which equates to just under a 2% revenue headwind. Foreign currency is reducing our adjusted EPS growth by $0.19 or just over 2.5%. If you look at our 2015 guidance or our 2016 guidance on an FX-neutral business, adjusted EPS growth would be in the range of 8% to 10%, which represents another strong year of underlying operating performance. Consistent with past practice, our guidance assumes currency foreign exchange rates and we have not attempted to forecast future changes in rates. 
Moving on to the details of our guidance. Acquisitions completed in 2015 are expected to contribute about $100 million or 60 basis points to our reported revenue growth in 2016. Giving some color on our assumptions on growth by end market starting with pharma and biotech. We expect strong performance in this market, this end market in 2016 and assume mid to high single digit growth over our very strong low teens growth in 2015. In academic and government, with a better funding environment in the U.S. we expect growth in this end market to improve to around the company average, and we expect growth in diagnostics and health care to be slightly better in 2016 as well, also growing around company average. And in industrial and applied, we don't expect any improvement year-over-year with growth remaining flat to 2015.
Turning to adjusted operating margins. We're expecting around 60 to 70 basis points expansion year-over-year. Strong productivity and acquisition synergies will be partially offset by strategic growth investments and the impact of foreign exchange. I'll walk you through how each of these elements of our margin expansion starting with productivity. Here, we will continue to use the proven productivity levers of our PPI business system including pricing, volume leverage, global sourcing and footprint optimization. These will continue to have a very positive impact on our margin profile. In terms of synergies, in our Life Technologies acquisition, we expect to deliver $55 million of year-over-year cost synergy benefit in 2016, and we expect to realize a further $60 million of revenue synergies which will yield approximately $20 million of adjusted operating income benefit. This will enable us to deliver the 3-year goal of $350 million of total cost in revenue synergies in 2016.
During the year, we will continue to make strategic investments to continue to drive growth, enhance the impact of innovation and to improve our customer experience. It was good to see the repeal of the medical device tax in the recently approved federal budget, and unfortunately, it's only a repeal for 2 years and not eliminated entirely. However, as Marc mentioned, we can take advantage of this opportunity and plan to reinvest the approximately $15 million of annual impact of the repeal back into the business. The majority will go towards accelerating our long-term productivity initiatives to help counteract some of the impact that foreign exchange has had on our operating margins in terms of pull-through on the foreign exchange headwind, we're expecting an unfavorable impact on the bottom line totaling $90 million or 30% average margin. This creates 10 basis points of adjusted operating margin dilution.
If you look at our 2016 adjusted operating margin guidance on an FX-neutral basis, our margin expansion would be 70 to 80 basis points. We will continue to look for ways to minimize the impact of foreign exchange on our P&L.
Moving below the line. We expect net interest expense to be in the range of $370 million to $380 million, about $10 million lower than 2015, primarily as a result of the debt reduction actions taken in 2015. For 2016, we're assuming that we will refinance our debt as it matures. We are not planning any further paydown of debt during the year. We're expecting our adjusted income tax rate to be about 14%, slightly higher than 2015. And in terms of capital deployment, we're assuming that we'll return approximately $240 million of capital to shareholders this year through dividends. The guidance assumes a total of $500 million of share buybacks in 2016, which we've already completed the January. There is no other capital deployment assumed in this guidance.
Full year average diluted shares are estimated to be in the range of 401 million to 402 million, down slightly from 2015 with the impact of the buybacks offsetting option dilution. We're assuming net capital expenditures to be approximately $440 million. And finally, in terms of full year 2016 free cash flow, we're expecting between $2.68 billion -- expecting about $2.68 billion, up $260 million compared to 2015. 
As a final note on guidance, I wanted to highlight the calendar timing within 2016. Our Q1 2016 fiscal calendar has 4 more days than the Q1 2015 and our Q4 2016 fiscal calendar has 4 less days than Q4 2015 with no net overall impact for the year. As you know, we do not give quarterly guidance. But given the scale of the day's difference, I thought it would be helpful to give you some insight on what we're expecting for Q1 2016.
With about 4% organic growth for the full year 2016, we're assuming about 7% growth in Q1. In terms of margin expansion, because we have 4 extra days of cost in Q1 2016, we're assuming that margins will be flat versus Q1 2015. As always, in interpreting our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance ranges, you should focus on the midpoint of the most likely view and how we see things playing out. Results above or below the midpoint will depend on the relative strength of our markets as well as foreign exchange rate fluctuations during the rest of the year. 
So in summary, we're pleased to deliver a strong finish to the year and that positions us well to achieve our financial goals for 2016. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Ken."

I think the things that I would take away so that you can look to the future is one, when we started out 2015 and you looked at our guidance range, we said the following. We would do all of our best without damaging the bright future that the company has to offset the FX headwinds last year. Last year, we picked up 2% incremental EPS headwinds after our original guidance. We offset all of it and we're able to deliver the high end of our original guidance. When we look at this year, we have a number of actions that we're taking to chip away at FX, which is why Stephen and I talk a little bit about we don't just stop. We're actually taking other actions that ensure that if we continue to live in a tough FX environment that 2017 will also be a fantastic year for the company. So we're very proactively managing the business. In terms of the capital deployment, hey, we spent or committed $1.8 billion in the  4 -- or first 2 weeks of the year. I think we're being pretty aggressive. It doesn't matter, which months these different things happen. We're using our competitive position to create value for shareholders.

So we're seeing it across a wide range of customers, whether it's conservatism. And as the year unfolds and bad things really haven't happened, there's a much stronger year-end money and we're very well positioned to capture it. Our team did a great job. When we look at the first quarter, because customers do a lot of activity late in the year, their demand is going to be a little bit softer, but it's been a little bit softer in each of the previous few quarters. So I think as Stephen laid out the outlook for the year, that reflects the fact that customers start out conservatively and then build their spend as the year goes on. So I think we've got that world characterized."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks, of course, for joining us today for our Q4 and year-end call. As you saw in our press release, we ended the year on a very strong note, delivering excellent fourth quarter results. Our teams identified and capitalized on year-end opportunities, delivered our value proposition to help our customers meet their objectives, and executed well to achieve our goals for the year. I think our performance demonstrates that no matter what we're facing in the macro environment, we have many opportunities to gain share. At the same time, we're steadily expanding our capabilities in line with our growth strategy and this gives us even more potential to create value for all of our key stakeholders, customers, employees and shareholders. I'll cover some of my business highlights of the quarter and the year later on in my remarks, but first, I'll give you a summary of our financial performance, discuss our growth relative to our key end markets and wrap up with an overview of our annual guidance for 2016. 
So starting with the quarter. We grew our adjusted earnings per share by 7% to $2.12, continuing our long track record of strong adjusted EPS performance. Our revenue in Q4 grew 4% year-over-year. Our adjusted operating income increased 5% and we expanded our adjusted operating margin by 40 basis points to 23.2%. 
Looking at our Q4 performance in the context of our key end markets, I'm pleased to say that we did a great job of capitalizing on year-end opportunities to deliver strong growth overall. Starting with industrial and applied, our performance was similar to what we've seen all year with very low single-digit growth. Our industrial businesses remain soft, while our businesses serving applied markets continued to perform well; particularly, our Analytical Instruments used for environmental and food safety applications. As an example, I'm very pleased to -- I'm very pleased with the performance of our chromatography business. Some of this is due to the success of the Vanquish UHPLC system we launched a little over a year ago, but fundamentally, the benefits of the Dionex acquisition in 2011 are really playing out. We're seeing strength across our entire portfolio from HPLC to GC to ion chromatography, as well as software and consumables. 
Turning to diagnostics and health care. It was good to see stronger results in this end market in Q4. We delivered mid-single-digit growth with especially strong performance in our clinical diagnostics and immunodiagnostics businesses. In academic and government, conditions in this end market were the strongest we've seen all year. We executed well to take advantage of strong spending at the year -- at the end of the year in the U.S. and Europe, and we delivered mid-single-digit growth. It's good to see positive momentum in this end market and we're encouraged about our prospects here given the more favorable funding environment in the U.S. in 2016. 
Last, I'm pleased to say that we capped off a very strong year in pharma and biotech with another outstanding quarter with growth in the mid-teens. We're clearly benefiting from the underlying strength of this end market and the power of our customer value proposition, which is creating a significant competitive advantage for us and drove strong performance across our businesses that serve this end market.
Our results show that in this economic environment, our customers turn to us to help them be successful, whether they're driving more innovation or increasing productivity to fund those R&D investments. Our scale and depth of capabilities is a key differentiator that creates value for our customers across our end markets. 
So in summary, we took full advantage of the year-end opportunities, executed well and delivered very strong Q4 performance that led to a great year overall.
Now, I'll transition to our full year results. The main takeaway is very clear. We achieved all the goals we set out to achieve. It wasn't the easiest of environments, but with thoughtful planning, great operational execution and intense focus on our customers, we delivered another strong year. Among our key objectives in 2015, we focused on meeting or exceeding our financial commitments, making good progress in advancing our growth strategy, capturing the synergies from the Life Technologies acquisition and strengthening our balance sheet. I'm pleased to report that we accomplished each of these objectives and I'll cover them in a bit more detail starting with the financials. 
Obviously, with a challenging environment from an FX perspective and the strengthening of the dollar impacted every multinational company, but we effectively navigated those headwinds, which Stephen will discuss later in his remarks, and achieve what I feel was a very solid year. We delivered $7.39 of adjusted EPS, which was a 6% increase year-over-year, despite an 11% headwind from foreign exchange. We grew revenues to a record $16.97 billion for the full year. Adjusted operating income increased 3% and we achieved adjusted operating income margin of 60 basis points to 22.5%. 
Let me take a moment here to give you some insight into how we're thinking about margin expansion. As you know, we've been able to steadily expand our operating margins over the years. We do this by leveraging our PPI Business System in all the levers we have to drive margins, whether it's pricing, sourcing or footprint optimization. You can see in our results that we did a great job of expanding margins despite a very significant FX headwind. Given that we will continue to face FX challenges in 2016, we remain very focused on driving productivity by continuing to use our operational levers. We've also decided to take some additional actions that will help us further down the road. We will fund those additional productivity actions through the benefits we gain from the temporary repeal of the medical device tax. This will enable us to further strengthen our operating margins going into 2017. We have a substantial opportunity to expand our margins and we still think it's reasonable to take them to the 24% to 26% range by 2018.
So we delivered solid performance for the year by staying true to our growth strategy and making sure that every decision we made put us in a stronger position in the eyes of our customers. 
Now let me hit some of the highlights and accomplishments from the year and from the quarter in the context of our growth strategy. As you know, it's based on 3 elements: Developing high-impact innovative new products; capitalizing on our scale in Asia Pacific and emerging markets; and leveraging our unique customer value proposition. The success of this strategy creates significant competitive advantage for us, and that gives us many opportunities to gain share. 
Starting with innovation. 2015 was another very strong year for us. I covered our new product highlights during the course of the year, so I'm not going to get into much detail today. We did have strong launches serving the research scientists as well as for our customers working in clinical and applied markets. 
Starting with the research community. The big news last year was our launch of the Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Tribrid mass spectrometer for proteomics. We actually just learned yesterday that the Lumos was voted by customers, who read SelectScience Magazine, as the best new drug discovery product of 2015. Our industry-leading Orbitrap platform gives us a foundation for expansion into a range of applications and we continue to fully leverage that capability. 
We also had a number of exciting products launched in genetic analysis, but let me just mention a couple of them. One was our cloud-enabled QuantStudio 3 and 5 real-time qPCR systems, which support our increasing focus on oncology. The other was the new Ion S5 and S5 XL product line, which makes targeted next-gen sequencing more accessible for a range of research applications. 
Moving to the clinic. We introduced number of a new immunoassays during the year, as well as a new Phadia instrument that effectively leverages our customers' capital investment by running tests for both allergy and autoimmunity. One example from the quarter that I do want to highlight is our collaboration with the Karolinska Institute of Sweden on a groundbreaking clinical study aimed at developing a more effective test for prostate cancer. Using our proteomic, genomic and assay technologies, this test can predict or more precisely distinguish between benign and aggressive cancers, thus reducing a number of biopsies required without compromising the number of actual cancers diagnosed. These are early days and there's still much more work here to be done, but it's very exciting and may be an alternative to the PSA test. This development would not have happened without the ability to leverage all of these capabilities across our company
Turning to applied markets. Our new Q Exactive Focus LC-MS created a powerful alternative to Q-TOF technology for a number of applications including toxicology, pharma QA/QC, food and environmental analysis as well. The focus is really gaining traction and significantly contributed to our growth in our Analytical Instruments business in Q4. 
So as you can see, 2015 was another outstanding year for innovation. We put our R&D dollars and expertise to work to deliver high-impact products that help our customers achieve their goals. I look forward to discussing the exciting innovations we plan to launch during 2016 as the year unfolds.
Let me now turn to the second element of our growth strategy, which is about using our scale as a competitive advantage in Asia Pacific and emerging markets. You saw in our press release that we highlighted China growth. Well, I have to steal Stephen's thunder a little by telling you that we achieved high teens growth in China in Q4, really outstanding performance by the team. The question I get a lot on with China is how we've been doing so well given the magnitude of change taking place in that country. Well, from my perspective, I think it boils down to 2 things. First, China has challenges that we are in the best position to help our customers address, like poor air and water quality, unsafe food supplies and strains on their healthcare system. The second reason is that we've taken advantage of our scale, but also have a very localized approach to running our business there. We have a team that understands the markets and where the funding is and has executed very well. 
Let me give you one example from the quarter, which is a new product we launched from our China Innovation Center in Shanghai. Contaminated water is a big issue there and some important new regulations were put in place by the government to control various water pollutants. We worked closely with our customers to understand their requirements and launched the Orion 3106 COD Water Analyzer in Q4. In addition to detecting pollutants, this new product will also help our customers lower their operating cost by reducing maintenance and reagent consumption. 
During the year, we also expanded our capabilities to capture opportunities in other emerging markets, such as Southeast Asia. Our most recent development was the November opening of a new GMP biopharma clinical services facility in Singapore to serve the growing needs of pharma and biotech customers in the region. Our strong performance in 2015 shows that we're effectively leveraging our global scale to best serve our customers and drive growth.
Turning to our customer value proposition, the third element of our growth strategy. I think the best example here is our successful integration of Life Technologies. We had high expectations for this business when we acquired it 2 years ago, and it's been a home run for us, not only in terms of the financial benefits, but also in strengthening our customer offering and the strategic position of our company. 
Regarding the financials, the metrics we laid out in early 2015, which were higher than the original deal model, were $115 million of additional cost synergies and $60 million of revenue synergies for the year. I'm very pleased to report that in 2015, we delivered $130 million of cost synergies and ended the year at our target year 3 run rate. 
In terms of revenue synergies, we really gained early traction here and achieved approximately $90 million of revenue synergies in 2015, much faster than we anticipated. This performance puts us in a great position to achieve our 2016 revenue synergy goals.
From a customer perspective, we have a clear advantage as a result of combining our capabilities across the company. Our bioproduction and biosciences businesses are now growing faster than they were independently. Having genetic and protein analysis technologies in one company, is creating exciting new opportunities, like the prostate cancer test I mentioned earlier. And the commercial presence we now have by combining our channel and e-commerce capabilities is really starting to drive growth.
In terms of our strategic position, at our analyst meeting last May, we said we expected Life Sciences Solutions to grow organically at 3% or better for the year, and I'm very pleased to report that the business grew organically at 5% in 2015, which contributed to our strong performance for the company overall. This is a great example of how we put our capital to work to create value for our customers and our shareholders.
Let me now give you a quick update on our balance sheet. You know that last year we were focused on delevering following the Life Technologies acquisition. I'm pleased to tell you that we achieved our target leverage ratio of 3x leverage at the end of 2015. This timing is slightly ahead of what we expected when we announced the transaction, and we accomplished this while repurchasing $500 million of our stock early last year and paying about $240 million of dividends, as well as spending $700 million on 2 complementary bolt-on acquisitions. To remind you, ASI strengthened our capabilities, serving the high-growth bioproduction market and Alfa Aesar expanded our offering of chemicals for the research laboratory. 
So we put ourselves in a great position from a balance sheet perspective as we begin 2016 and we're able to kick off the year by announcing our agreement to acquire Affymetrix. Many of you are familiar with this business, which is a leader in cellular and genetic analysis. Affymetrix has a strong position in flow cytometry and antibodies, which will strengthen our biosciences offering. It was also the pioneer of microarray technology and will be a nice complement to our genetic sciences business. This transaction also offers attractive financial benefits. We expect $0.10 of adjusted EPS accretion in the first full year of ownership and we also expect to generate $70 million of synergies by year 3 following the close. So good financial returns and also a very good fit for our Life Sciences Solutions business.
Let me now turn to our guidance for 2016. Stephen will cover the details and outline all of the assumptions for our revenue and earnings guidance, but I'd like to make a couple of comments. Our 2016 guidance reflects the fact that foreign exchange will continue to have a negative impact on our top and bottom line performance, although we anticipate to a lesser degree than it did in 2015 based on where rates are today. So we're guiding to adjusted EPS in the range of $7.80 to $7.96. This would result in 6% to 8% growth over the $7.39 we delivered in 2015. 
In terms of revenues, we expect to deliver between $17.36 billion and $17.56 billion in 2016. So before I turn the call over to Stephen, let me leave you with a few takeaways. We focused on our customers and effectively navigated the macro environment to achieve our goals for the year. We continue to innovate, expand our global reach and enhance our customer value proposition in line with our growth strategy. We also strengthened our balance sheet so we can resume our normal capital deployment in 2016 and identify new opportunities to create shareholder value. 
With that, I'll now hand over the call to Stephen Williamson, our CFO. Stephen?"

I'll begin with an overview of our Q4 and full year 2015 financial performance for the total company. Then I'll provide some color on our 4 segments and conclude with a detailed review of our 2016 guidance. So s",2838,"Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with an overview of our Q4 and full year 2015 financial performance for the total company. Then I'll provide some color on our 4 segments and conclude with a detailed review of our 2016 guidance. 
So starting with our overall financial performance for the fourth quarter. As you saw in our press release, we grew adjusted EPS by 7% to $2.12. For the full year, adjusted EPS was $7.39, up 6% from 2014. The midpoint of our guidance that we gave you at the end of Q3 was $7.37 of adjusted EPS for the full year 2015. Subsequent to this guidance, the negative foreign exchange impact on Q4 increased significantly, resulting in a further $0.06 of headwind in the quarter. I'm pleased to say that we're able to offset all of this and still able to deliver $7.39 for the full year, $0.02 more than the midpoint of our last guidance.
GAAP EPS was $1.50 in Q4, up 1% from $1.49 in the prior year's quarter, and $4.92 for full year 2015, up 4% from $4.71 in 2014. On the top line, we delivered 7% organic revenue growth this quarter and our reported revenue increased 4% year-over-year. Q4 reported revenue includes 1% growth from acquisitions and a 4% headwind from foreign exchange. For the full year 2015, reported revenue was flat year-over-year and organic revenue growth was 5%. Full year reported revenue includes 1% growth from acquisitions, net of divestitures and a 6% negative impact from foreign exchange.
Looking at the growth by geography in Q4. North America grew in the mid-single digits and Europe grew in the high single digits. Asia Pacific grew in the low double digits, and as Marc mentioned, China was growing in the high teens. And rest of the world declined in the high single digits. For the full year, both North America and Europe grew in the mid-single digits, Asia Pacific grew in the high single digits and China growing in the mid-teens, and the rest of the world declined in the low single digits. 
So looking at our operational performance. Q4 adjusted operating income increased 5% and adjusted operating margin was 23.2%, up 40 basis points from Q4 last year, despite an 80 basis points headwind from foreign exchange. For the full year, adjusted operating income increased 3% and adjusted operating margin was 22.5%, up 60 basis points from 2014, despite the 90 basis points headwind from foreign exchange.
At a high level, our adjusted operating margin expansion from the quarter and the full year was driven by continued strong contribution from the PPI Business System productivity levers, including pricing, global sourcing and footprint optimization, as well as the continued contribution from cost synergies. 
In Q4, we realized $18 million of cost synergy benefits from the Life Technologies acquisition, but just $130 million for the full year 2015. And as Marc said, we were able to accelerate the capture of revenue synergies and realized $40 million during Q4 and $90 million for the full year 2015. This puts us in great position to deliver on the 3-year run rate target of $150 million of revenue synergies in 2016. We took advantage of our strong performance in Q4 to make additional strategic investments primarily to spend from our commercial capabilities and to accelerate growth.
Moving on to the details of the P&L. Total company adjusted gross margin came in at 47.7% in Q4, down 130 basis points from the prior year. For the full year, adjusted gross margin was 48.3%, down 50 basis points from 2014. The decreases in gross margin in both Q4 and the full year are primarily attributed to foreign exchange and unfavorable business mix.
Adjusted SG&A in Q4 was 20.6% of revenue, which is 150 basis points favorable to Q4 2014, driven primarily by foreign exchange, cost synergies and our productivity actions. For the full year, adjusted SG&A was 21.7%, 120 basis points favorable to 2014. And finally, R&D expense came in at 3.9% of revenue in Q4, 20 basis points favorable to Q4 2014 and full year R&D expense was 4.1%, flat to full year 2014. And R&D, as a percent of our manufacturing revenue, for full year 2015 was 6.4%, also flat to the full year 2014. 
So looking at our results below the line. Net interest expense in Q4 was $94 million, down $13 million from Q4 last year as a result of reducing our debt over the past 12 months. Net interest expense for the full year was $384 million, a decrease of $48 million from 2014. Adjusted other income for Q4 was negative $7 million, $16 million lower than Q4 2014. And for the full year, it was $6 million, which is $7 million lower than last year, both driven primarily by nonoperating foreign exchange net losses in 2015 compared to net gains in 2014. 
Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 13%, 20 basis points below last year. Our full year rate was 13.7%, down from 14.5% in 2014, primarily as a result of realizing our benefits of our acquisition tax planning. And average diluted shares were 402.4 million in Q4, down 1.7 million year-over-year, primarily as a result of the share buybacks we completed in Q1, partially offset by option dilution. For the full year, average diluted shares were 401.9 million, down 0.4 million from 2014. 
Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Cash flow from continuing operations for the year was $2.83 billion and free cash flow was $2.42 billion after deducting net capital expenditure of $405 million. This is slightly lower than our previous guidance due to additional investments in working capital. We ended the year with $455 million in cash and investments. During 2015, we've continued to return capital to shareholders with $500 million of share buybacks in Q1 and $240 million of dividends, including $60 million of dividends in Q4. We also continue to make strategic acquisitions in 2015, spending $300 million in Q1 to acquire ASI and $400 million in Q4 to acquire Alfa Aesar. 
Our total debt at the end of Q4 was $12.5 billion, down $800 million sequentially from Q3, and we achieved our year-end target leverage ratio at 3x total debt to adjusted EBITDA. 
And wrapping up my comments in our total company performance, we continue to make progress on our ROIC. Our trailing 12 months adjusted ROIC in Q4 was 9.5%, up 20 basis points sequentially from Q3 and up 60 basis points from Q1 2015 when the Life Technologies acquisition was fully included in the average investment base.
So with that, I'll now provide you with some color on the performance of our 4 business segments. As I highlighted for the total company, foreign exchange continued to be a significant headwind for the top line for our segments and impacted the year-over-year revenue growth and adjusted operating margins to varying degrees. 
Starting with Life Sciences Solutions segment. Reported revenue increased 2% in Q4 and organic revenue grew 5%. In the quarter, we continued to see strong growth in our bioproduction and biosciences businesses. For the full year, reported revenue grew 6% on organic growth of 5%. Q4 adjusted operating income in Life Sciences Solutions increased 5% and adjusted operating margin was 31.6%, up 80 basis points, benefiting from very strong productivity and incremental cost synergies, partially offset by some unfavorable product mix, significantly unfavorable foreign exchange and strategic growth investments. For the full year 2015, adjusted operating margin was 30.1%, 110 basis points higher than the prior year. 
In the Analytical Instruments segment, reported revenue increased 3% in Q4 and organic revenue growth was 7%. In the quarter, we had strong growth in our chromatography and mass spectrometry businesses, partially offset by weaknesses that we continued to see in some of our core industrial markets. For the full year, reported revenue declined 1% and organic growth was 4%. Q4 adjusted operating income in Analytical Instruments increased 13% and adjusted operating margin was 22.1%, up 190 basis points. We delivered very strong productivity in this segment, partially offset by foreign exchange, unfavorable mix and strategic growth investments. For the full year 2015, adjusted operating income increased 5% and adjusted operating margin was 19.1%, 120 basis points higher than 2014. 
Turning to Specialty Diagnostics segment. In Q4, total revenue grew slightly and organic revenue growth was 4%. This was driven by good growth in our immunodiagnostics and clinical diagnostics businesses, partially offset by the expiration of the OEM contract that I mentioned on our Q3 call. For the full year, reported revenue declined 3% and organic growth was 3%. Adjusted operating income in the segment decreased 3% in Q4 and adjusted operating margin was 26.2%, down 90 basis points from the prior year. In the segment, we drove very good productivity. However, this is more than offset by the expiration of the OEM contract, unfavorable foreign exchange and strategic growth investments. For the full year 2015, adjusted operating income decreased 5% and adjusted operating margin was 26.9%, down 50 basis points from 2014.
And finally in the Laboratory Products and Services segment, Q4 reported revenue increased 8% and organic revenue growth was 10%. This segment continues to benefit from our strong performance in the pharma and biotech end market with our BioPharma Services channel and Laboratory Products businesses, all delivering very strong growth. For the full year, reported revenue grew 1% and organic revenue grew 7%. Adjusted operating income in the segment increased 9% and adjusted operating margin was 14.7%, up 20 basis points from the prior year. Margin expansion in the quarter was driven by productivity improvements, partially offset by strategic growth investments. For full year 2015, adjusted operating margin -- income increased 2% and adjusted operating margin was 15%, up 10 basis points from the prior year. 
So with that, I'd like to review the details of our 2016 guidance. Consistent with our usual practice, our guidance does not include any future acquisitions or divestitures. As a result, it does not include the impact of our recently announced Affymetrix acquisition, which we expect to close by the end of Q2. We will update our guidance after that deal closes. As Marc mentioned, we're initiating a 2016 adjusted EPS guidance range of $7.80 to $7.96, which represents growth of 6% to 8% over our 2015 adjusted EPS of $7.39.
In terms of revenue, our guidance range is $17.36 billion to $17.56 billion, which represents growth of about 2.5% to 3.5% versus our reported revenue of $16.97 billion in 2015. On an organic basis, our revenue range assumes an organic growth midpoint of about 4%.
As Marc mentioned, we're seeing another year of negative impact on both the top and bottom line as a result of the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus major foreign currencies. As always, we're focused on our reported numbers, but I thought I'll give you a bit more color on the foreign exchange to give you some perspective on how it's impacting our guidance. On the top line, foreign exchange is lowering our revenue by approximately $290 million, which equates to just under a 2% revenue headwind. Foreign currency is reducing our adjusted EPS growth by $0.19 or just over 2.5%. If you to look at our 2015 guidance -- 2016 guidance on an FX-neutral business, adjusted EPS growth would be in the range of 8% to 10%, which represents another strong year of underlying operating performance. Consistent with past practice, our guidance assumes current foreign currency exchange rates and we have not attempted to forecast future changes in rates. 
Moving on to the details of our guidance. Acquisitions completed in 2015 are expected to contribute about $100 million or 60 basis points to our reported revenue growth in 2016. Giving some color on our assumptions on growth by end market, starting with pharma and biotech, we expect strong performance in this market -- end market in 2016 and assume mid- to high single-digit growth over our very strong low teens growth in 2015. In academic and government, with a better funding environment in the U.S., we expect growth in this end market to improve to around the company average, and we expect growth in diagnostics and health care to be slightly better in 2016 as well, also growing around the company average. And in industrial and applied, we don't expect any improvement year-over-year with growth remaining flat to 2015.
Turning to adjusted operating margins. We're expecting around 60 to 70 basis points of expansion year-over-year. Strong productivity and acquisition synergies will be partially offset by strategic growth investments and the impact of foreign exchange. I'll walk you through how each of these elements of our margin expansion, starting with productivity. Here we will continue to use the proven productivity levers of our PPI Business System, including pricing, volume leverage, global sourcing and footprint optimization. These will continue to have a very positive impact on our margin profile. In terms of synergies in the Life Technologies acquisition, we expect to deliver $55 million of year-over-year cost synergy benefit in 2016, and we expect to realize a further $60 million of revenue synergies, which will yield approximately $20 million of adjusted operating income benefit. This will enable us to deliver the 3-year goal of $350 million of total cost in revenue synergies in 2016.
During the year, we will continue to make strategic investments to continue to drive growth, enhance the impact of innovation and to improve our customer experience. It was good to see the repeal of the medical device tax in the recently approved federal budget; unfortunately, it's only a repeal for 2 years and not eliminated entirely. However, as Marc mentioned, we can take advantage of this opportunity and plan to reinvest the approximately $15 million of annual impact of the repeal back into the business. The majority will go towards accelerating our long-term productivity initiatives to help counteract some of the impact that foreign exchange has had on our operating margins. In terms of pull-through on the foreign exchange headwind, we're expecting an unfavorable impact on the bottom line totaling $90 million or 30% average margin. This creates 10 basis points of adjusted operating margin dilution.
So if you look at our 2016 adjusted operating margin guidance on an FX-neutral basis, our margin expansion would be 70 to 80 basis points. We will continue to look for ways to minimize the impact of foreign exchange on our P&L.
Moving below the line, we expect net interest expense to be in the range of $370 million to $380 million, about $10 million lower than 2015, primarily as a result of the debt reduction actions taken in 2015. For 2016, we're assuming that we will refinance our debt as it matures. We are not planning any further paydown of debt during the year. We're expecting our adjusted income tax rate to be about 14%, slightly higher than 2015. And in terms of capital deployment, we're assuming that we'll return approximately $240 million of capital to shareholders this year through dividends. The guidance assumes a total of $500 million of share buybacks in 2016, which we've already completed in January. There is no other capital deployment assumed in this guidance.
Full year average diluted shares are estimated to be in the range of 401 million to 402 million, down slightly from 2015 with the impact of the buybacks offsetting option dilution. We're assuming net capital expenditures to be approximately $440 million. And finally, in terms of full year 2016 free cash flow, we're expecting between $2.68 billion -- expecting about $2.68 billion, up $260 million compared to 2015. 
As a final note on guidance, I wanted to highlight the calendar timing within 2016. Our Q1 2016 fiscal calendar has 4 more days than the Q1 2015 and our Q4 2016 fiscal calendar has 4 less days than Q4 2015 with no net overall impact for the year. As you know, we do not give quarterly guidance. But given the scale of the day's difference, I thought it would be helpful to give you some insight on what we're expecting for Q1 2016.
With about 4% organic growth for the full year 2016, we're assuming about 7% growth in Q1. In terms of margin expansion, because we have 4 extra days of cost in Q1 2016, we're assuming that margins will be flat versus Q1 2015. As always, in interpreting our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance ranges, you should focus on the midpoint of the most likely view and how we see things playing out. Results above or below the midpoint will depend on the relative strength of our markets as well as foreign exchange rate fluctuations during the rest of the year. 
So in summary, we're pleased to deliver a strong finish to the year and that positions us well to achieve our financial goals for 2016. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Ken."

I think the things that I would take away so that you can look to the future is one, when we started out 2015, and you looked at our guidance range, we said the following; we would do all of our best without damaging the bright future that the company has to offset the FX headwinds. Last year, we picked up 2% incremental EPS headwinds after our original guidance. We offset all of it and we're able to deliver the high end of our original guidance. When we look at this year, we have a number of actions that we're taking to chip away at FX, but which is why Stephen and I talked a little bit about we don't just stop. We're actually taking other actions that ensure that if we continue to live in a tough FX environment, that 2017 will also be a fantastic year for the company. So we're very proactively managing the business. In terms of the capital deployment, hey, we spent or committed $1.8 billion in the 4 -- or first 2 weeks of the year. I think we're being pretty aggressive, and it doesn't matter, which month these different things happen. We're using our competitive position to create value for shareholders.

So that's the swing factor on the upside to it and the team has done a good job over the last 5, 6, 7 years of executing in that segment, and we'll keep you posted on how we do. So, I think, it gives you a good sense of how we're thinking about the world."

So as I look at the model and I say, okay, there's a guide for 7% organic in the first quarter, 4% for the full year, it applied some slowing over the balance of the year.

And as the year unfolds and bad things really haven't happened, there's a much stronger year-end money and we're very well positioned to capture it. Our team did a great job. When we look at the first quarter, because customers do a lot of activity late in the year, their demand is going to be a little bit softer, but it's been a little bit softer in each of the previous few quarters.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks, of course, for joining us today for our Q4 and year-end call. As you saw in our press release, we ended the year on a very strong note, delivering excellent fourth quarter results. Our teams identified and",2689,"Thanks, Ken. Good morning, everyone, and thanks, of course, for joining us today for our Q4 and year-end call. As you saw in our press release, we ended the year on a very strong note, delivering excellent fourth quarter results. Our teams identified and capitalized on year-end opportunities, delivered our value proposition to help our customers meet their objectives, and executed well to achieve our goals for the year. I think our performance demonstrates that no matter what we're facing in the macro environment, we have many opportunities to gain share. At the same time, we're steadily expanding our capabilities in line with our growth strategy and this gives us even more potential to create value for all of our key stakeholders, customers, employees and shareholders. I'll cover some of my business highlights of the quarter and the year later on in my remarks, but first, I'll give you a summary of our financial performance, discuss our growth relative to our key end markets and wrap up with an overview of our annual guidance for 2016. 
So starting with the quarter. We grew our adjusted earnings per share by 7% to $2.12, continuing our long track record of strong adjusted EPS performance. Our revenue in Q4 grew 4% year-over-year. Our adjusted operating income increased 5% and we expanded our adjusted operating margin by 40 basis points to 23.2%. 
Looking at our Q4 performance in the context of our key end markets, I'm pleased to say that we did a great job of capitalizing on year-end opportunities to deliver strong growth overall. Starting with industrial and applied, our performance was similar to what we've seen all year with very low single-digit growth. Our industrial businesses remain soft, while our businesses serving applied markets continued to perform well; particularly, our analytical instruments used for environmental and food safety applications. As an example, I'm very pleased to -- I'm very pleased with the performance of our chromatography business. Some of this is due to the success of the Vanquish UHPLC system we launched a little over a year ago, but fundamentally, the benefits of the Dionex acquisition in 2011 are really playing out. We're seeing strength across our entire portfolio from HPLC to GC to ion chromatography, as well as software and consumables. 
Turning to diagnostics and health care. It was good to see stronger results in this end market in Q4. We delivered mid-single-digit growth with especially strong performance in our clinical diagnostics and immunodiagnostics businesses. In academic and government, conditions in this end market were the strongest we've seen all year. We executed well to take advantage of strong spending at the year -- at the end of the year in the U.S. and Europe, and we delivered mid-single-digit growth. It's good to see positive momentum in this end market and we're encouraged about our prospects here given the more favorable funding environment in the U.S. in 2016. 
Last, I'm pleased to say that we capped off a very strong year in pharma and biotech with another outstanding quarter with growth in the mid-teens. We're clearly benefiting from the underlying strength of this end market and the power of our customer value proposition, which is creating a significant competitive advantage for us and drove strong performance across our businesses that serve this end market.
Our results show that in this economic environment, our customers turn to us to help them be successful, whether they're driving more innovation or increasing productivity to fund those R&D investments. Our scale and depth of capabilities is a key differentiator that creates value for our customers across our end markets. 
So in summary, we took full advantage of the year-end opportunities, executed well and delivered very strong Q4 performance that led to a great year overall.
Now, I'll transition to our full year results. The main takeaway is very clear. We achieved all the goals we set out to achieve. It wasn't the easiest of environments, but with thoughtful planning, great operational execution and intense focus on our customers, we delivered another strong year. Among our key objectives in 2015, we focused on meeting or exceeding our financial commitments, making good progress in advancing our growth strategy, capturing the synergies from the Life Technologies acquisition and strengthening our balance sheet. I'm pleased to report that we accomplished each of these objectives and I'll cover them in a bit more detail starting with the financials. 
Obviously, it was a challenging environment from an FX perspective and the strengthening of the dollar impacted every multinational company, but we effectively navigated those headwinds, which Stephen will discuss later in his remarks, and achieve what I feel was a very solid year. We delivered $7.39 of adjusted EPS, which was a 6% increase year-over-year, despite an 11% headwind from foreign exchange. We grew revenues to a record $16.97 billion for the full year. Adjusted operating income increased 3% and we achieved adjusted operating income margin of 60 basis points to 22.5%. 
Let me take a moment here to give you some insight into how we're thinking about margin expansion. As you know, we've been able to steadily expand our operating margins over the years. We do this by leveraging our PPI Business System in all the levers we have to drive margins, whether it's pricing, sourcing or footprint optimization. You can see in our results that we did a great job of expanding margins despite a very significant FX headwind. Given that we will continue to face FX challenges in 2016, we remain very focused on driving productivity by continuing to use our operational levers. We've also decided to take some additional actions that will help us further down the road. We will fund those additional productivity actions through the benefits we gain from the temporary repeal of the medical device tax. This will enable us to further strengthen our operating margins going into 2017. We have a substantial opportunity to expand our margins and we still think it's reasonable to take them to the 24% to 26% range by 2018.
So we delivered solid performance for the year by staying true to our growth strategy and making sure that every decision we made put us in a stronger position in the eyes of our customers. 
Now let me hit some of the highlights and accomplishments from the year and from the quarter in the context of our growth strategy. As you know, it's based on 3 elements: Developing high-impact innovative new products; capitalizing on our scale in Asia Pacific and emerging markets; and leveraging our unique customer value proposition. The success of this strategy creates significant competitive advantage for us, and that gives us many opportunities to gain share. 
Starting with innovation. 2015 was another very strong year for us. I covered our new product highlights during the course of the year, so I'm not going to get into much detail today. We did have strong launches serving the research scientists as well as for our customers working in clinical and applied markets. 
Starting with the research community. The big news last year was our launch of the Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Tribrid mass spectrometer for proteomics. We actually just learned yesterday that the Lumos was voted by customers, who read SelectScience Magazine, as the best new drug discovery product of 2015. Our industry-leading Orbitrap platform gives us a foundation for expansion into a range of applications and we continue to fully leverage that capability. 
We also had a number of exciting products launch in genetic analysis, but let me just mention a couple of them. One was our cloud-enabled QuantStudio 3 and 5 real-time qPCR systems, which support our increasing focus on oncology. The other was the new Ion S5 and S5 XL product line, which makes targeted next-gen sequencing more accessible for a range of research applications. 
Moving to the clinic. We introduced number of a new immunoassays during the year, as well as a new Phadia instrument that effectively leverages our customers' capital investment by running tests for both allergy and autoimmunity. One example from the quarter that I do want to highlight is our collaboration with the Karolinska Institute of Sweden on a groundbreaking clinical study aimed at developing a more effective test for prostate cancer. Using our proteomic, genomic and assay technologies, this test can predict or more precisely distinguish between benign and aggressive cancers, thus reducing a number of biopsies required without compromising the number of actual cancers diagnosed. These are early days and there's still much more work here to be done, but it's very exciting and may be an alternative to the PSA test. This development would not have happened without the ability to leverage all of these capabilities across our company
Turning to applied markets. Our new Q Exactive Focus LC-MS created a powerful alternative to Q-TOF technology for a number of applications including toxicology, pharma QA/QC, food and environmental analysis as well. The focus is really gaining traction and significantly contributed to our growth in our Analytical Instruments business in Q4. 
So as you can see, 2015 was another outstanding year for innovation. We put our R&D dollars and expertise to work to deliver high-impact products that help our customers achieve their goals. I look forward to discussing the exciting innovations we plan to launch during 2016 as the year unfolds.
Let me now turn to the second element of our growth strategy, which is about using our scale as a competitive advantage in Asia Pacific and emerging markets. You saw in our press release that we highlighted China growth. Well, I have to steal Stephen's thunder a little by telling you that we achieved high teens growth in China in Q4, really outstanding performance by the team. The question I get a lot on -- with China is how we've been doing so well given the magnitude of change taking place in that country. Well, from my perspective, I think it boils down to 2 things. First, China has challenges that we are in the best position to help our customers address, like poor air and water quality, unsafe food supplies and strains on their healthcare system. The second reason is that we've taken advantage of our scale, but also have a very localized approach to running our business there. We have a team that understands the markets and where the funding is and has executed very well. 
Let me give you one example from the quarter, which is a new product we launched from our China Innovation Center in Shanghai. Contaminated water is a big issue there and some important new regulations were put in place by the government to control various water pollutants. We worked closely with our customers to understand their requirements and launched the Orion 3106 COD Water Analyzer in Q4. In addition to detecting pollutants, this new product will also help our customers lower their operating cost by reducing maintenance and reagent consumption. 
During the year, we also expanded our capabilities to capture opportunities in other emerging markets, such as Southeast Asia. Our most recent development was the November opening of a new GMP biopharma clinical services facility in Singapore to serve the growing needs of pharma and biotech customers in the region. Our strong performance in 2015 shows that we're effectively leveraging our global scale to best serve our customers and drive growth.
Turning to our customer value proposition, the third element of our growth strategy. I think the best example here is our successful integration of Life Technologies. We had high expectations for this business when we acquired it 2 years ago, and it's been a home run for us, not only in terms of the financial benefits, but also in strengthening our customer offering and the strategic position of our company. 
Regarding the financials, the metrics we laid out in early 2015, which were higher than the original deal model, were $115 million of additional cost synergies and $60 million of revenue synergies for the year. I'm very pleased to report that in 2015, we delivered $130 million of cost synergies and ended the year at our target year 3 run rate. 
In terms of revenue synergies, we really gained early traction here and achieved approximately $90 million of revenue synergies in 2015, much faster than we anticipated. This performance puts us in a great position to achieve our 2016 revenue synergy goals.
From a customer perspective, we have a clear advantage as a result of combining our capabilities across the company. Our bioproduction and biosciences businesses are now growing faster than they were independently. Having genetic and protein analysis technologies in one company, is creating exciting new opportunities, like the prostate cancer test I mentioned earlier. And the commercial presence we now have by combining our channel and e-commerce capabilities is really starting to drive growth.
In terms of our strategic position, at our analyst meeting last May, we said we expected Life Sciences Solutions to grow organically at 3% or better for the year, and I'm very pleased to report that the business grew organically at 5% in 2015, which contributed to our strong performance for the company overall. This is a great example of how we put our capital to work to create value for our customers and our shareholders.
Let me now give you a quick update on our balance sheet. You know that last year we were focused on delevering following the Life Technologies acquisition. I'm pleased to tell you that we achieved our target leverage ratio of 3x leverage at the end of 2015. This timing is slightly ahead of what we expected when we announced the transaction, and we accomplished this while repurchasing $500 million of our stock early last year and paying about $240 million of dividends, as well as spending $700 million on 2 complementary bolt-on acquisitions. To remind you, ASI strengthened our capabilities, serving the high-growth bioproduction market and Alfa Aesar expanded our offering of chemicals for the research laboratory. 
So we put ourselves in a great position from a balance sheet perspective as we begin 2016 and we're able to kick off the year by announcing our agreement to acquire Affymetrix. Many of you are familiar with this business, which is a leader in cellular and genetic analysis. Affymetrix has a strong position in flow cytometry and antibodies, which will strengthen our biosciences offering. It was also the pioneer of microarray technology and will be a nice complement to our genetic sciences business. This transaction also offers attractive financial benefits. We expect $0.10 of adjusted EPS accretion in the first full year of ownership and we also expect to generate $70 million of synergies by year 3 following the close. So good financial returns and also a very good fit for our Life Sciences Solutions business.
Let me now turn to our guidance for 2016. Stephen will cover the details and outline all of the assumptions for our revenue and earnings guidance, but I'd like to make a couple of comments. Our 2016 guidance reflects the fact that foreign exchange will continue to have a negative impact on our top and bottom line performance, although we anticipate to a lesser degree than it did in 2015 based on where rates are today. So we're guiding to adjusted EPS in the range of $7.80 to $7.96. This would result in 6% to 8% growth over the $7.39 we delivered in 2015. 
In terms of revenues, we expect to deliver between $17.36 billion and $17.56 billion in 2016. 
So before I turn the call over to Stephen, let me leave you with a few takeaways. We focused on our customers and effectively navigated the macro environment to achieve our goals for the year. We continue to innovate, expand our global reach and enhance our customer value proposition in line with our growth strategy. We also strengthened our balance sheet so we can resume our normal capital deployment in 2016 and identify new opportunities to create shareholder value. 
With that, I'll now hand over the call to Stephen Williamson, our CFO. Stephen?"
97023,321212628,922816,"Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2016",2016-01-28,"Earnings Calls","Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with an overview of our Q4 and full year 2015 financial performance for the total company. Then I'll provide some color on our 4 segments and conclude with a detailed review of our 2016 guidance. So s",2840,"Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with an overview of our Q4 and full year 2015 financial performance for the total company. Then I'll provide some color on our 4 segments and conclude with a detailed review of our 2016 guidance. 
So starting with our overall financial performance for the fourth quarter. As you saw in our press release, we grew adjusted EPS by 7% to $2.12. For the full year, adjusted EPS was $7.39, up 6% from 2014. The midpoint of our guidance that we gave you at the end of Q3 was $7.37 of adjusted EPS for the full year 2015. Subsequent to this guidance, the negative foreign exchange impact on Q4 increased significantly, resulting in a further $0.06 of headwind in the quarter. I'm pleased to say that we are able to offset all of this and still able to deliver $7.39 for the full year, $0.02 more than the midpoint of our last guidance.
GAAP EPS was $1.50 in Q4, up 1% from $1.49 in the prior year's quarter, and $4.92 for full year 2015, up 4% from $4.71 in 2014. On the top line, we delivered 7% organic revenue growth this quarter and our reported revenue increased 4% year-over-year. Q4 reported revenue includes 1% growth from acquisitions and a 4% headwind from foreign exchange. For the full year 2015, reported revenue was flat year-over-year and organic revenue growth was 5%. Full year reported revenue includes 1% growth from acquisitions, net of divestitures and a 6% negative impact from foreign exchange.
Looking at the growth by geography in Q4. North America grew in the mid-single digits and Europe grew in the high single digits. Asia Pacific grew in the low double digits, and as Marc mentioned, China was growing in the high teens. And rest of the world declined in the high single digits. For the full year, both North America and Europe grew in the mid-single digits, Asia Pacific grew in the high single digits and China growing in the mid-teens, and the rest of the world declined in the low single digits. 
So looking at our operational performance. Q4 adjusted operating income increased 5% and adjusted operating margin was 23.2%, up 40 basis points from Q4 last year, despite an 80 basis points headwind from foreign exchange. For the full year, adjusted operating income increased 3% and adjusted operating margin was 22.5%, up 60 basis points from 2014, despite the 90 basis points headwind from foreign exchange.
At a high level, our adjusted operating margin expansion from the quarter and the full year was driven by continued strong contribution from the PPI Business System productivity levers, including pricing, global sourcing and footprint optimization, as well as the continued contribution from cost synergies. 
In Q4, we realized $18 million of cost synergy benefits from the Life Technologies acquisition, but just $130 million for the full year 2015. And as Marc said, we were able to accelerate the capture of revenue synergies and realized $40 million during Q4 and $90 million for the full year 2015. This puts us in great position to deliver on the 3-year run rate target of $150 million of revenue synergies in 2016. We took advantage of our strong performance in Q4 to make additional strategic investments primarily to strengthen our commercial capabilities and to accelerate growth.
Moving on to the details of the P&L. Total company adjusted gross margin came in at 47.7% in Q4, down 130 basis points from the prior year. For the full year, adjusted gross margin was 48.3%, down 50 basis points from 2014. The decreases in gross margin in both Q4 and the full year are primarily attributed to foreign exchange and unfavorable business mix.
Adjusted SG&A in Q4 was 20.6% of revenue, which is 150 basis points favorable to Q4 2014, driven primarily by foreign exchange, cost synergies and our productivity actions. For the full year, adjusted SG&A was 21.7%, 120 basis points favorable to 2014. And finally, R&D expense came in at 3.9% of revenue in Q4, 20 basis points favorable to Q4 2014 and full year R&D expense was 4.1%, flat to full year 2014. And R&D, as a percent of our manufacturing revenue, for full year 2015 was 6.4%, also flat to the full year 2014. 
So looking at our results below the line. Net interest expense in Q4 was $94 million, down $13 million from Q4 last year as a result of reducing our debt over the past 12 months. Net interest expense for the full year was $384 million, a decrease of $48 million from 2014. Adjusted other income for Q4 was negative $7 million, $16 million lower than Q4 2014. And for the full year, it was $6 million, which is $7 million lower than last year, both driven primarily by nonoperating foreign exchange net losses in 2015 compared to net gains in 2014. 
Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 13%, 20 basis points below last year. Our full year rate was 13.7%, down from 14.5% in 2014, primarily as a result of realizing our benefits of our acquisition tax planning. And average diluted shares were 402.4 million in Q4, down 1.7 million year-over-year, primarily as a result of the share buybacks we completed in Q1, partially offset by option dilution. For the full year, average diluted shares were 401.9 million, down 0.4 million from 2014. 
Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Cash flow from continuing operations for the year was $2.83 billion and free cash flow was $2.42 billion after deducting net capital expenditure of $405 million. This is slightly lower than our previous guidance due to additional investments in working capital. We ended the year with $455 million in cash and investments. During 2015, we've continued to return capital to shareholders with $500 million of share buybacks in Q1 and $240 million of dividends, including $60 million of dividends in Q4. We also continue to make strategic acquisitions in 2015, spending $300 million in Q1 to acquire ASI and $400 million in Q4 to acquire Alfa Aesar. 
Our total debt at the end of Q4 was $12.5 billion, down $800 million sequentially from Q3, and we achieved our year-end target leverage ratio at 3x total debt to adjusted EBITDA. 
And wrapping up my comments in our total company performance, we continue to make progress on our ROIC. Our trailing 12 months adjusted ROIC in Q4 was 9.5%, up 20 basis points sequentially from Q3 and up 60 basis points from Q1 2015 when the Life Technologies acquisition was fully included in the average investment base.
So with that, I'll now provide you with some color on the performance of our 4 business segments. As I highlighted for the total company, foreign exchange continued to be a significant headwind for the top line for our segments and impacted the year-over-year revenue growth and adjusted operating margins to varying degrees. 
Starting with Life Sciences Solutions segment. Reported revenue increased 2% in Q4 and organic revenue grew 5%. In the quarter, we continued to see strong growth in our bioproduction and biosciences businesses. For the full year, reported revenue grew 6% on organic growth of 5%. Q4 adjusted operating income in Life Sciences Solutions increased 5% and adjusted operating margin was 31.6%, up 80 basis points, benefiting from very strong productivity and incremental cost synergies, partially offset by some unfavorable product mix, significantly unfavorable foreign exchange and strategic growth investments. For the full year 2015, adjusted operating margin was 30.1%, 110 basis points higher than the prior year. 
In the Analytical Instruments segment, reported revenue increased 3% in Q4 and organic revenue growth was 7%. In the quarter, we had strong growth in our chromatography and mass spectrometry businesses, partially offset by weaknesses that we continued to see in some of our core industrial markets. For the full year, reported revenue declined 1% and organic growth was 4%. Q4 adjusted operating income in Analytical Instruments increased 13% and adjusted operating margin was 22.1%, up 190 basis points. We delivered very strong productivity in this segment, partially offset by foreign exchange, unfavorable mix and strategic growth investments. For the full year 2015, adjusted operating income increased 5% and adjusted operating margin was 19.1%, 120 basis points higher than 2014. 
Turning to Specialty Diagnostics segment. In Q4, total revenue grew slightly and organic revenue growth was 4%. This was driven by good growth in our immunodiagnostics and clinical diagnostics businesses, partially offset by the expiration of the OEM contract that I mentioned on our Q3 call. For the full year, reported revenue declined 3% and organic growth was 3%. Adjusted operating income in the segment decreased 3% in Q4 and adjusted operating margin was 26.2%, down 90 basis points from the prior year. In the segment, we drove very good productivity. However, this was more than offset by the expiration of the OEM contract, unfavorable foreign exchange and strategic growth investments. For the full year 2015, adjusted operating income decreased 5% and adjusted operating margin was 26.9%, down 50 basis points from 2014.
And finally in the Laboratory Products and Services segment, Q4 reported revenue increased 8% and organic revenue growth was 10%. This segment continues to benefit from our strong performance in the pharma and biotech end market with our BioPharma Services channel and Laboratory Products businesses, all delivering very strong growth. For the full year, reported revenue grew 1% and organic revenue grew 7%. Adjusted operating income in the segment increased 9% and adjusted operating margin was 14.7%, up 20 basis points from the prior year. Margin expansion in the quarter was driven by productivity improvements, partially offset by strategic growth investments. For full year 2015, adjusted operating margin -- income increased 2% and adjusted operating margin was 15%, up 10 basis points from the prior year. 
So with that, I'd like to review the details of our 2016 guidance. Consistent with our usual practice, our guidance does not include any future acquisitions or divestitures. As a result, it does not include the impact of our recently announced Affymetrix acquisition, which we expect to close by the end of Q2. We will update our guidance after that deal closes. As Marc mentioned, we're initiating a 2016 adjusted EPS guidance range of $7.80 to $7.96, which represents growth of 6% to 8% over our 2015 adjusted EPS of $7.39.
In terms of revenue, our guidance range is $17.36 billion to $17.56 billion, which represents growth of about 2.5% to 3.5% versus our reported revenue of $16.97 billion in 2015. On an organic basis, our revenue range assumes an organic growth midpoint of about 4%.
As Marc mentioned, we're seeing another year of negative impact on both the top and bottom line as a result of the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus major foreign currencies. As always, we're focused on our reported numbers, but I thought I'll give you a bit more color on the foreign exchange to give you some perspective on how it's impacting our guidance. On the top line, foreign exchange is lowering our revenue by approximately $290 million, which equates to just under a 2% revenue headwind. Foreign currency is reducing our adjusted EPS growth by $0.19 or just over 2.5%. If you were to look at our 2015 guidance -- 2016 guidance on an FX-neutral business, adjusted EPS growth would be in the range of 8% to 10%, which represents another strong year of underlying operating performance. Consistent with past practice, our guidance assumes current foreign currency exchange rates and we have not attempted to forecast future changes in rates. 
Moving on to the details of our guidance. Acquisitions completed in 2015 are expected to contribute about $100 million or 60 basis points to our reported revenue growth in 2016. Giving some color on our assumptions on growth by end market, starting with pharma and biotech, we expect strong performance in this market -- end market in 2016 and assume mid- to high single-digit growth over our very strong low teens growth in 2015. In academic and government, with a better funding environment in the U.S., we expect growth in this end market to improve to around the company average, and we expect growth in diagnostics and health care to be slightly better in 2016 as well, also growing around the company average. And in industrial and applied, we don't expect any improvement year-over-year with growth remaining flat to 2015.
Turning to adjusted operating margins. We're expecting around 60 to 70 basis points of expansion year-over-year. Strong productivity and acquisition synergies will be partially offset by strategic growth investments and the impact of foreign exchange. I'll walk you through how each of these elements of our margin expansion, starting with productivity. Here we will continue to use the proven productivity levers of our PPI Business System, including pricing, volume leverage, global sourcing and footprint optimization. These will continue to have a very positive impact on our margin profile. In terms of synergies in the Life Technologies acquisition, we expect to deliver $55 million of year-over-year cost synergy benefit in 2016, and we expect to realize a further $60 million of revenue synergies, which will yield approximately $20 million of adjusted operating income benefit. This will enable us to deliver the 3-year goal of $350 million of total cost in revenue synergies in 2016.
During the year, we will continue to make strategic investments to continue to drive growth, enhance the impact of innovation and to improve our customer experience. It was good to see the repeal of the medical device tax in the recently approved federal budget; unfortunately, it's only a repeal for 2 years and not eliminated entirely. However, as Marc mentioned, we can take advantage of this opportunity and plan to reinvest the approximately $15 million of annual impact of the repeal back into the business. The majority will go towards accelerating our long-term productivity initiatives to help counteract some of the impact that foreign exchange has had on our operating margins. In terms of pull-through on the foreign exchange headwind, we're expecting an unfavorable impact on the bottom line totaling $90 million or a 30% average margin. This creates 10 basis points of adjusted operating margin dilution.
So if you look at our 2016 adjusted operating margin guidance on an FX-neutral basis, our margin expansion would be 70 to 80 basis points. We will continue to look for ways to minimize the impact of foreign exchange on our P&L.
Moving below the line, we expect net interest expense to be in the range of $370 million to $380 million, about $10 million lower than 2015, primarily as a result of the debt reduction actions taken in 2015. For 2016, we're assuming that we will refinance our debt as it matures. We are not planning any further paydown of debt during the year. We're expecting our adjusted income tax rate to be about 14%, slightly higher than 2015. And in terms of capital deployment, we're assuming that we'll return approximately $240 million of capital to shareholders this year through dividends. The guidance assumes a total of $500 million of share buybacks in 2016, which we've already completed in January. There is no other capital deployment assumed in this guidance.
Full year average diluted shares are estimated to be in the range of 401 million to 402 million, down slightly from 2015 with the impact of the buybacks offsetting option dilution. We're assuming net capital expenditures to be approximately $440 million. And finally, in terms of full year 2016 free cash flow, we're expecting between $2.68 billion -- expecting about $2.68 billion, up $260 million compared to 2015. 
As a final note on guidance, I wanted to highlight the calendar timing within 2016. Our Q1 2016 fiscal calendar has 4 more days than the Q1 2015 and our Q4 2016 fiscal calendar has 4 less days than Q4 2015 with no net overall impact for the year. As you know, we do not give quarterly guidance. But given the scale of the day's difference, I thought it would be helpful to give you some insight on what we're expecting for Q1 2016.
With about 4% organic growth for the full year 2016, we're assuming about 7% growth in Q1. In terms of margin expansion, because we have 4 extra days of cost in Q1 2016, we're assuming that margins will be flat versus Q1 2015. As always, in interpreting our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance ranges, you should focus on the midpoint as the most likely view in how we see things playing out. Results above or below the midpoint will depend on the relative strength of our markets as well as foreign exchange rate fluctuations during the rest of the year. 
So in summary, we're pleased to deliver a strong finish to the year and that positions us well to achieve our financial goals for 2016. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Ken."

I think the things that I would take away so that you can look to the future is one, when we started out 2015, and you looked at our guidance range, we said the following; we would do all of our best without damaging the bright future that the company has to offset the FX headwinds. Last year, we picked up 2% incremental EPS headwinds after our original guidance. We offset all of it and we're able to deliver the high end of our original guidance. When we look at this year, we have a number of actions that we're taking to chip away at FX, but which is why Stephen and I talked a little bit about we don't just stop. We're actually taking other actions that ensure that if we continue to live in a tough FX environment, that 2017 will also be a fantastic year for the company. So we're very proactively managing the business. 
In terms of the capital deployment, hey, we spent or committed $1.8 billion in the 4 -- or first 2 weeks of the year. I think we're being pretty aggressive, and it doesn't matter, which month these different things happen. We're using our competitive position to create value for shareholders.

So the way the world's playing out over the last few years is that customers generally are being conservative early in the year, and I don't mean just one quarter, but literally in the first 3 quarters of the year to deal with kind of unexpected adverse events, whether they're macroeconomic or geopolitical. So we're seeing it across a wide range of customers, where there's a conservatism. And as the year unfolds and bad things really haven't happened, there's a much stronger year-end money and we're very well positioned to capture it. Our team did a great job. When we look at the first quarter, because customers do a lot of activity late in the year, their demand is going to be a little bit softer, but it's been a little bit softer in each of the previous few quarters. So I think as Stephen laid out, the outlook for the year, that reflects the fact that customers start out conservatively and then build their spend as the year goes on.

We delivered excellent growth in both revenue and adjusted EPS. Our great top and bottom line performance was the result of a few key factors: good growth across all of our major geographies, strong operational execution by our team plus the added revenue benefit of 4 extra days in the quarter. We said last quarter that we expect to come out of the gate strong, and we did. In addition to great operational execution in Q1, we were also very active in capital deployment. We completed $1 billion of stock buybacks in the quarter and we also closed on our acquisition of Affymetrix at the end of March, which is a quarter sooner than we originally planned. We're excited about the new opportunities we'll have with those added capabilities, and I'll talk a bit more about that later. I'll follow our usual format this morning, starting with the financial results and some commentary on our performance by end market, then I'll cover a few business highlights for the quarter, provide an update on capital deployment and wrap up with our revised guidance outlook. 
So starting with the financials. Revenue in Q1 grew 10% to $4.29 billion. Adjusted operating income was up 9%. In terms of our earnings performance, we continued our long track record of consistently delivering strong adjusted EPS with a 10% increase to $1.80 per share. Let me give you a high level view of our Q1 performance in the context of our end markets. After a strong year-end finish, we typically see a weaker start in Q1, but that was obviously not the case this year even if you normalize for the 4 extra days we had versus last year. In our key end markets, pharma and biotech was our strongest again this quarter as it has been for some time. This was driven by excellent growth in our bioproduction, biopharma services and biosciences businesses. Health care diagnostics grew around the company average. Academic and government was slightly below the company average and performance overall in industrial and applied remain muted, with continued weakness in industrial end markets and ongoing strength in applied. In aggregate, the dynamics across our end markets were good, with no material change from what we saw in 2015. Our strong results in Q1 reinforce that our scale and depth of capabilities are clear differentiators across our end markets. 
Let me now highlight some of our key accomplishments from the quarter which show that we continue to position Thermo Fisher for an even stronger future. As you know, our growth strategy is based on developing high impact innovative products, leveraging our scale in the Asia-Pacific and emerging markets and delivering our unique customer value proposition to gain share. So starting with innovation. We kicked off the year, as we always do with a strong showing at Pittcon, which you know is a major event in the U.S. for the analytical instruments industry. Over the past couple of years, Pittcon has really evolved into an opportunity for us to showcase our Thermo Scientific technologies for applied markets. 
Let me give you2  quick examples, first in our mass spectrometry business and then in chromatography. In mass spec, we've been adapting the advanced capabilities of our Orbitrap platform for customers working outside the research labs in applications the just food safety, forensic toxicology and sports [indiscernible]. Our recently launched Q Exactive Orbitrap GC-MS/MS is a great example of how we've combined gas chromatography with our Orbitrap capabilities so customers can perform comprehensive sample analysis in a single run. In our chromatography business, the big help line at Pittcon this year was our new Integrion system, a real breakthrough in high-pressure ion chromatography. It gives customers working in busy environmental, food and beverage and pharmaceutical laboratories a flexible system for creating highly efficient and accurate workflows. Integrion significantly raises the bar on productivity and performance in applied markets. It was nice to learn that our new ion chromatography portfolio was recognized at the show as the instrument of the year by readers of SelectScience magazine. This was a great endorsement by our customers and speaks to the strength of this business. I'll make one more comment on innovation because it's a great example of how we innovate to fulfill our mission, which is to enable our customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer. 
We all know about the Zika virus because it's been in the news a lot lately. As you'd expect, when Zika first broke out, we quickly mobilized our teams to begin working with government labs in Brazil as well as the CDC in the U.S. Our Life Sciences Solutions business has been developing a QPCR-based test to detect the virus which is currently undergoing validation process. We're also offering an immunoassay in the U.S. for research use in partnership with a diagnostics company, EUROIMMUN, and we've already begun selling this through our channel business. This is a good example of how it is seen by our customers as a thought leader who could help them solve these pressing issues. 
In terms of emerging markets, our second growth driver, let me first say that we saw good growth across all of our key geographies in Q1 with strong performance in North America and Europe as well as very strong performance in Asia Pacific and emerging markets. The standout contributors were China and India. I'll give you a little more color on what we saw in those regions during the quarter. Starting with India, our commercial teams there are doing an outstanding job of capturing growth opportunities in biopharma, health care and food safety markets. In China, we performed very well in Q1. Our key focus markets, biopharma, health care and environmental remain robust. As you know, the new 5-year plan was announced in March, and much of it is the continuation of the goal set forth in the previous plan, which is great for Thermo Fisher. The plan outlines investment and innovation, health care and the environment. And given the industry-leading presence we built a China, we continue to be well positioned in this important growth market. 
In terms of our customer value proposition, the third element of our growth strategy, you can think of our approach here in 2 parts. First, we continue to enhance our offering for our customers to make our value proposition even stronger. And second, we'll focus on strengthening our commercial capabilities to best leverage our scale and depth of capabilities. 
Let me give you an example of each in the quarter. We enhanced our customer offering by completing our acquisition of Affymetrix at the end of March for $1.3 billion. It was great to be out with the team at Santa Clara for the day 1 activities and we're excited about the opportunities we have to leverage our complementary offerings. To remind you, Affymetrix is now part of our Life Sciences Solutions Segment. The business has a strong position in flow cytometry and antibodies, which will strengthen our biosciences offering. Its innovative micro-array technologies will also open up new growth avenues for us in genetic sciences, particularly in reproductive health and ag bio. This transaction also offers attractive financial benefits. We expect to generate $70 million of operating income synergies by year 3 following the close, $55 million from cost and $15 million from revenue. So good financial returns and a hand and glove fit our Life Science Solutions business. 
The next example I want to share is the investment we made in our e-commerce capabilities to help our customers take full advantage of our comprehensive portfolio. As I've mentioned in the past, when we acquire our business, we always look to adapt -- adopt best practices that will make our company even stronger. When we acquire Life Technologies, we gained a gold standard e-commerce platform. We since moved our Thermo Scientific products to that platform. Now our customers can go to one website for our entire self-manufacture offering which features rich scientific content and we'll continuing enhancing it with added e-commerce functionality over time. The new website complements our fishersci.com website which customers can order products as well as those in third-party suppliers. We think of our web presence as a highly valuable tool to drive incremental revenue and we're pleased with our progress today. 
Before I cover our guidance, I'll make a quick comment on capital deployment. As you know, we have an excellent track record of creating shareholder value through our capital deployment strategy and it's been an active first quarter. We mentioned on our last call that we have already bought back $500 million of shares in January. As you saw in our press release, we bough back an additional $500 million of shares later in the quarter as well. So including our stock buybacks, the dividend and strategic M&A, we've deployed $2.4 billion of capital so far this year. 
Now let me give you a quick update on our guidance for 2016. As you saw in our press release, we're raising both our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance for the year. Stephen will get into the details, but at a high level, the increased guidance is driven by 4 factors: the completion of the Affymetrix acquisition in late March; a less adverse foreign exchange environment; the additional $500 million of stock buybacks; and stronger operational performance by our team. Based on these factors, we're raising our revenue guidance for the year to a new range of $17.86 billion to $18.04 billion. This would result in 5% to 6% growth over 2015. We're also raising our adjusted EPS guidance to a new range of $8.05 to $8.19 for strong growth of 9% to 11% year-over-year. 
Before I turn the call over to Stephen, let me sum up my remarks with a couple of takeaways. We're starting the year with excellent top and bottom line performance. We closed the acquisition of Affymetrix and we're excited about the new capabilities it brings. We're performing very well in all key geographies and have many opportunities across our businesses to gain share. All of this positions us to achieve another strong year. 
With that, I'll now hand the call over to Stephen."
97023,330014756,965504,"Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2016",2016-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with an overview of our first quarter financial performance of the total company and I'll provide some color on the 4 segments and conclude with our updated 2016 guidance.

I'll begin with an overview of our first quarter financial performance of the total company and I'll provide some color on the 4 segments and conclude with our updated 2016 guidance. So starting with the overall financial performance for Q1. As you saw in our press release, we grew adjusted EPS by 10% to $1.80. GAAP EPS was $1.01, up 5% from Q1 last year. On the top line, our reported revenue grew 10% year-over-year. The Q1 reported revenue includes 10% organic growth, 1% growth from acquisitions and a 2% headwind from foreign exchange. Please note the components of the Q1 change do not sell in Q2 rounding. 
As I mentioned on the last earnings call, the way our fiscal calendar falls in 2016, we have 4 extra billing days in Q1 and 4 less in Q4. We estimate that we receive just under a 5% benefit to our organic growth in Q1 from the impact of days. The consumables revenue getting most of the impact of the extra days while the capital equipment revenue was only marginally affected. We expect to see the opposite effect of revenue in Q4 when we have 4 less billing days and there has no impact in the year as a whole. So normalizing Q1 minus the extra days, the estimate that our organic growth was approximately 5% during the quarter. 
Looking at growth by geography in Q1. I'll provide some color based on the 5% normalized organic growth to provide you with an understanding of the relative performance by region. Based on that, North America and Europe grew in the mid-single digits. Asia Pacific grew in the high single digits with another strong contribution from China and the rest of the world which represents less than 5% of our revenues declined in the high single digits. 
Looking at our operational performance. Q1 adjusted operating income increased 9% and adjusted operating margin was 21.7%, down 20 basis points from Q1 of last year. Our margin performance in Q1 was in line with our expectations. We received good expansion from our organic growth, driven by strong contributions from our PPI business system and the benefit of acquisition cost synergies, but this is more than offset by 30 basis point negative impact from the extra calendar days and a 30 basis point headwind from foreign exchange. The impact of the extra days on margins is not that intuitive, so I thought it would be helpful to take a minute to summarize it for you. There were 66 billing days in Q1 2016 versus 62 in Q1 2015, a 6.5% increase. As I mentioned earlier, this had a positive impact on organic growth of approximately 5%. However, since the level of cost is directly correlated to the number of days, the impact on cost was a full 6.5%. So that means that cost went up more than our revenue because of the days impact. The net effect from this on our operating margin is the headwind of approximately 30 basis points in Q1 that I just mentioned. It's important to note that we have corresponding positive impact of margins as in Q4 when we have 4 less billing days. 
Moving on to the details of the P&L. Total company adjusted gross margin came in at 48.2% in Q1, down 110 basis points from the prior year. The decrease in gross margin in Q1 is primarily attributed to headwinds from unfavorable business mix, the impact of 4 extra days and foreign exchange. Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 22.4% of revenue which is 80 basis points favorable to Q1 2015 and R&D expense came in at 4.1% of revenue, down 10 basis points versus Q1 last year. R&D as a percent of our manufacturing revenue in Q1 was 6.4%. 
Looking at our results below the line. Net interest expense was $95 million, down $6 million from Q1 last year mainly as a result of lower average debt levels. Adjusted other income and expense was negative $1 million, which is $8 million lower than 2015, driven primarily by changes in nonoperating foreign exchange. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 14% flat to last year and average diluted shares were 398.7 million, down 2.7 million year-over-year mainly as a result of the share buybacks completed in Q1 approximately offset by option dilution. 
Turning to cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow from continuing operations through Q1 was $290 million and free cash flow was $180 million after deducting net capital expenditures of $110 million. Free cash flow is $195 million favorable to Q1 2015. We ended the quarter with $830 million in cash and investments. We also returned significant capital to shareholders during the quarter. On our Q4 call, I mentioned we already completed the $500 million in share buybacks in January. We also bought an incremental $500 million later in the quarter for a total of $1 billion in buybacks during Q1. And as I am sure you're aware, we deployed $1.3 billion to acquire Affymetrix right at the end of Q1. And we also returned $60 million to shareholders during the quarter through our dividend. 
So all in all, as Marc mentioned, we deployed $2.4 billion of capital in Q1. Our total debt at the end of Q1 was $15 billion, up $2.5 billion sequentially from Q4, mainly driven by the increase in short-term debt relating to the acquisition of Affymetrix and the share buyback. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3.5x total debt to adjusted EBITDA. And wrapping up my comments on total company performance. ROIC improved in the quarter. Our trailing 12 months adjusted ROIC at the end of Q1 was 9.6%, up 10 basis points sequentially from Q4. 
So with that, I'll provide you with some color on the performance of our 4 business segments. As a I highlighted for the total company, foreign exchange continue to be a headwind for the top line for our segments, an impact of that year-over-year revenue growth, adjusted operating margin to varying degrees. The 4 extra calendar days impact the segment revenue and margins to varying degrees as well. 
So starting with Life Sciences Solutions segment. Reported revenue increased 11% in Q1 and organic revenue also grew 11%. In the quarter, we continue to see strong growth in our bioproduction, biosciences and next-gen sequencing business. Q1 adjusted operating income and life science solutions increased 10% and adjusted operating margin was 29.1%, down 20 basis points year-over-year. Operating margin was positively affected by volume pull-through, strong productivity and the impact of days, but this is more than offset by unfavorable business mix, strategic investments and unfavorable foreign exchange. 
In the Analytical Instruments segment, reported revenue increased 4% in Q1 and organic revenue growth was 6%. In the quarter, we have strong growth in our chromatography and services businesses partially offset by continued weakness in some of our core industrial markets. Q1 adjusted operating income in Analytical Instruments decreased 8% and adjusted operating margin was 14.7%, down 200 basis points year-over-year. Strong productivity was more than offset by the impact of the extra days in the quarter as well as the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange and strategic investments. The days impact is very material for the segment approximately 200 basis points. Given the low consumables mix in this segment, the extra days have little impact from the top line, but they have a full impact on the cost base causing significant margin compression. This will revert in Q4 when we have 4 less days. 
Turning to the Specialty Diagnostics segments. In Q1, total revenue grew 9% and organic revenue growth was 10%. This was driven by solid growth across all our businesses in this segment. Adjusted operating income increased 7% in Q1 and adjusted operating margin was 26.9%, down 40 basis points from the prior year. Operating margin was positively impacted by good productivity and volume pull-through but this is more than offset by strategic investments, unfavorable business mix and unfavorable foreign exchange. 
Finally, in the Lab Products and Services segment, Q1 reported revenue increased 14% and organic revenue growth was also 14%. This segment continues to benefit from our strong performance in the pharma and biotech end markets for our biopharma services, research and safety market channel and lab products businesses all delivering very stronger. Adjusted operating income in the segment increased 16% and adjusted operating margin was 15%, up 30 basis points from the prior year. Margin expansion in the quarter was driven by volume pull-through and good productivity partially offset from strategic investments and the headwind of additional days in the quarter. 
So now I will review the details of our full year 2016 guidance. As you saw in the press release, I'm pleased to report significant increases in both our top and bottom line guidance. The improved guidance is due to several factors: the acquisition of Affymetrix; more favorable foreign exchange rates relative to our prior guidance; additional stock buybacks completed in Q1; and stronger operational performance. We'll take you through the impact of each of these 4 items in turn. 
The first change relates to guidance reflects the acquisition of Affymetrix. We expect this to deliver $275 million of revenue and $40 million of adjusted operating income over the remaining 9 months of the year, and that includes our synergies, so and all that will translate to $0.06 of adjusted earnings per share in 2016. The accretion impact of Affymetrix is very back-end loaded given the phasing of their revenue and the strong ramp of synergies towards the end of the year. Affymetrix is dilutive to the total company operating margin in 2016 by approximately 10 basis points. 
The second change to guidance relates to foreign exchange. We've increased our guidance to reflect the less adverse FX environment, increasing revenue by $200 million and adjusted earnings per share by $0.11. As you know, we've seen tremendous amounts the volatility in FX rates this year, so we use an average of rates over the past couple of months for our revised guidance. Our revised 2016 guidance now assumes a year-over-year FX headwind of $90 million of revenue, $32 million of adjusted operating income and 7.5 cents of adjusted earnings per share. It's still a headwind for the year but much lower than our initial guidance. 
The third change to guidance reflects the impact of the stock buybacks we completed in Q1. In total, we bought back $1 billion of stock in Q1. Half of this was already in our initial guidance. So the revised guidance includes an additional $0.06 for the second $500 million of buybacks we completed in the quarter. 
The fourth change to guidance reflects improved operational performance. Given the strong start to the year, we're raising the low end of revenue guidance by $25 million and raising the low end of adjusted EPS guidance by $0.02. 
So to sum all this up, the revised 2016 revenue guidance range is $17.86 billion to $18.04 billion which would represent 5% to 6% growth versus 2015. The $490 million increase to the midpoint comes from 3 factors: $275 million relates to Affymetrix; $200 million from the improved foreign exchange environment; and $15 million at higher organic growth. We're still expecting to deliver organic growth of about 4% for the full year consistent with our previous guidance. 
In terms of phasing for the remainder of the year, given the days impact and the strong comp from last year, we expect Q4 organic growth to be essentially flat. And as a reminder, the organic growth comp in Q2 is more challenging than the organic growth comp in Q3. Acquisitions are now expected to contribute about 2% to our quarter revenue growth in '16 and FX is expected to be 0.5% headwind. 
In terms of our adjusted EPS, our revised guidance range is $8.05 to $8.19. It represents growth of 9% to 11% over our 2015 adjusted earnings per share of $7.39 for the 1% headwind from foreign exchange. So bridge the $0.24 increase in the midpoint of our adjusted EPS guidance, we gained $0.11 from the more favorable foreign exchange, $0.06 from Affymetrix, $0.06 from additional Q1 share buybacks and $0.01 from operational improvements. 
A few other details behind the revised 2016 guidance. We are now expecting 50 to 70 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion year-over-year, and this includes the 10 basis points dilution from Affymetrix. We're expecting net interest expense to be about $390 million versus the $380 million in our previous guidance as a result of the incremental debt relating to the Affymetrix acquisition. We're forecasting our adjusted income tax rate to be about 14% consistent with our previous guidance. And in terms of capital deployment, we're still assuming we'll return approximately $240 million of capital to shareholders through dividends. Our guidance does not include any future acquisitions, divestitures or stock buybacks. This is consistent with our past practice of not forecasting incremental capital deployment beyond dividends. 
Full year average diluted shares are estimated to be in the range of 398 million to 399 million, down about 3 million from our previous guidance as a result of the stock buybacks we completed in Q1, and we're expecting net capital expenditure to be approximately $440 million, up slightly from the previous guidance due to the Affymetrix acquisition. 
In terms of free cash flow for 2016, we now expect this to be about $2.72 billion, slightly higher than the prior guidance with the increase in our earnings outlook related to FX and. Our operational performance. There is no net free cash flow impact in 2016 from adding Affymetrix as the operating cash flow for the 9 months is offset by the cost to achieve synergies, deal fees and the capital expenditures related to the business. 
In Q1, we used short-term borrowings for the acquisition of Affymetrix and stock buybacks. Absent any other need, our attention to pay this down during the course of the year with the cash flow we generate from operations. As always, in interpreting our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance ranges, we should focus on the midpoints of the most likely view of how we see results playing out. 
So in summary, we have a number significant achievements this quarter while delivering solid operational results which positions us really well to achieve our financial goals for the year. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Ken"

So we actually pay very close attention to tax regulations and changes in those regulations there that caused [indiscernible] domestically and we have a very great tax team. Recently, the treasury department laid out 2 new tax regulations, one very -- one  is that regulation is very concentrated to reduce the impact, the benefit of inversions. And that simply don't apply to the company. The second set of regulations were targeted at limiting U.S. companies' ability to tax efficiently repatriate cash from overseas. And when thinking about that impact from our company, our existing tax structures which aren't impacted by these regulations, provide pretty substantial cash repatriation capacity in a very tax efficient way. So at this point, I don't see any immaterial impact from the regulatory changes on the company for the foreseeable future. So more in line we're comfortable with that tax rate and the corporate tax planning strategies we have in place across the company. When I think about the tax rate going forward, we'll talk more about this at the analyst day. Just to remind you kind of the messaging from last year is the tax rate, the earnings accrete going forward over and above the earnings we have to date generally come in at the higher margin tax rate in the 14% that we have in place on average for the company. So absent any of the changes in terms of asset restructuring, the tax rate will creep up the strong slightly. We've done a pretty good job of making sure it doesn't happen over time. As we look back over the past 3 years, I think we've effectively navigated through that. Part of that comes from some structures that we can put in place with acquisitions that we do, but the rest of it really comes from just good management of our tax strategies and just thinking about the regulatory changes. So more to come with the Analyst Day but that's kind of a recap on how we've seen it for the last couple of years."

And it's kind of the combination of larger type of restructurings where you're consolidating the footprint of the organization in terms of manufacturing operations in the back office and also the micro aspect of PPI so day in day out, we're just being better at leaning out the operations and the back office functions and kind of the way that we work. So the combination of all of that is kind of the continual set of efforts. So there's nothing -- no major shift in terms of [indiscernible] region place that we're doing the footprint optimization and the use of sourcing and pricing the levers, those are kind of continuing. But the one new thing this year, as I said on the last earnings call, is that we're looking to reinvest the benefit of the medical device tax into some longer-term projects. And one set of projects around the footprint and more complex footprint changes in terms of manufacturing and then being more efficient in our financial back office. Those projects are underway and they're progressing well. So I think it's just a continuum in terms of the impact of the PPI Business System and then kind of stepping it up a little bit in terms of using the opportunity to reinvest in medical device tax."

And they not only run the business [indiscernible] but they're actually looking at how do you maximize the impact with our customer base on the competitive position. I'd break it into 2 different themes. One is a product theme and one is a geographic theme. The geographic theme is quite easy, right? Where we'll be looking for upside is really the commercial reach around the world. Thermo Fisher has incredible reach and Affymetrix was a much narrow company. So that will help over time focusing on accelerating growth and capturing revenue synergies. And over time, will obviously drive to the upside to the most extent possible. For the product fit, the reason the acquisition is so compelling is really the way you frame it, which is it was a whole company but really it is 2 great product line that fit so incredibly tightly with our Life Sciences Solutions business. And we're able to combine our flow cytometry and antibody businesses in the biosciences businesses which gives us a much stronger competitive position and we're able to add the micro-array technologies to our large genetic sciences business, which really puts us in a very unique position because we will be truly technology-agnostic for solving customers' problems because we will be the only company that has next-gen sequencing, Sanger Sequencing, microarrays and QPCR with leading position across that array of technology. So that customer would say, here's the channel we have and will give them the optimal workflow. These are very complementary fits. So with good execution, we'll obviously focus on delivering what we committed to and then always looking for the upside. So from an accretion perspective, as we announced when we announced the deal in January, it was in the $0.10 in the first full year, which translates to basically $0.06 this year, $0.04 in Q1 of 2017. But as you know, as time unfolds, we'll be looking for opportunities to drive to the upside, and that's probably more of the '17 benefit than a '16 benefit."

We delivered excellent growth in both revenue and adjusted EPS. Our great top and bottom line performance was the result of a few key factors: Good growth across all of our major geographies, strong operational execution by our team plus the added revenue benefit of 4 extra days in the quarter.
We said last quarter that we expect to come out of the gate strong and we did. In addition to great operational execution in Q1, we were also very active in capital deployment. We completed $1 billion of stock buybacks in the quarter and we also closed on our acquisition of Affymetrix at the end of March, which was a quarter sooner than we originally planned. We're excited about the new opportunities we'll have with those added capabilities, and I'll talk a bit more about that later. I'll follow our usual format this morning, starting with the financial results and some commentary on our performance by end market, then I'll cover a few of the business highlights from the quarter, provide an update on capital deployment and wrap up with our revised guidance outlook.
So starting with the financials. Revenue in Q1 grew 10% to $4.29 billion. Adjusted operating income was up 9%. In terms of our earnings performance, we continued our long track record of consistently delivering strong adjusted EPS with a 10% increase to $1.80 per share.
Let me give you a high level view of our Q1 performance in the context of our end markets. After a strong year-end finish, we've typically seen a weaker start in Q1, but that was obviously not the case this year even if you normalize for the 4 extra days we had versus last year. In our key end markets, pharma and biotech was our strongest again this quarter as it has been for some time. This was driven by excellent growth in our bioproduction, biopharma services and biosciences businesses.
Health care diagnostics grew around the company average, academic and government was slightly below the company average and performance overall in industrial and applied remain muted, with continued weakness in industrial end markets and ongoing strength in applied. In aggregate, the dynamics across our end markets were good with no material change from what we saw in 2015. Our strong results in Q1 reinforce that our scale and depth of capabilities are clear differentiators across our end markets.
Let me now highlight some of our key accomplishments from the quarter which show that we continue to position Thermo Fisher for an even stronger future. As you know, our growth strategy is based on developing high-impact innovative new products, leveraging our scale in Asia Pacific and emerging markets and delivering our unique customer value proposition to gain share. So starting with innovation. We kicked off the year, as we always do, with a strong showing at Pittcon, which you know is a major event in the U.S. for the analytical instruments industry. Over the past couple of years, Pittcon has really evolved into an opportunity for us to showcase our Thermo Scientific technologies for applied markets.
Let me give you 2 quick examples, first, in our mass spectrometry business and then chromatography. In mass spec, we've been adapting the advanced capabilities of our Orbitrap platform for customers working outside the research lab in applications such as food safety, forensic toxicology and sports doping. Our recently launched Q Exactive Orbitrap GC-MS/MS is a great example of how we've combined gas chromatography with our Orbitrap capabilities so customers can perform comprehensive sample analysis in a single run.
In our chromatography business, the big headline at Pittcon this year was our new Integrion system, a real breakthrough in high-pressure ion chromatography. It gives customers working in busy environmental, food and beverage and pharmaceutical laboratories a flexible system for creating highly efficient and accurate workflows. Integrion significantly raises the bar on productivity and performance in applied markets. It was nice to learn that our new ion chromatography portfolio was recognized at the show as the Instrument of the Year by readers of SelectScience magazine. This was a great endorsement by our customers and speaks to the strength of this business.
I'll make one more comment on innovation because it's a great example of how we innovate to fulfill our mission, which is to enable our customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer.
We all know about the Zika virus because it's been in the news a lot lately. As you'd expect, when Zika first broke out, we quickly mobilized our teams to begin working with government labs in Brazil as well as the CDC in the U.S. Our Life Sciences Solutions business has been developing a qPCR-based test to detect the virus, which is currently undergoing a validation process. We're also offering an immunoassay in the U.S. for researchers in partnership with a diagnostics company, EUROIMMUN, and we've already begun selling this through our channel business. This is a good example of how we're seen by our customers as a thought leader who could help them solve these pressing issues.
In terms of emerging markets, our second growth driver, let me first say that we saw good growth across all of our key geographies in Q1 with strong performance in North America and Europe as well as very strong performance in Asia Pacific and emerging markets. The standout contributors were China and India, and I'll give you a little more color on what we saw in those regions during the quarter.
Starting with India, our commercial teams there are doing an outstanding job of capturing growth opportunities in biopharma, health care and food safety markets. In China, we performed very well in Q1. Our key focus markets, biopharma, health care and environmental remain robust. As you know, the new 5-year plan was announced in March, and much of it is the continuation of the goal set forth in the previous plan, which is great for Thermo Fisher. The plan outlines investments in innovation, health care and the environment. And given the industry-leading presence we built in China, we continue to be well positioned in this important growth market.
In terms of our customer value proposition, the third element of our growth strategy, you can think of our approach here in 2 parts. First, we continue to enhance our offering for our customers to make our value proposition even stronger. And second, we're focused on strengthening our commercial capabilities to best leverage our scale and depth of capabilities. Let me give you an example of each in the quarter.
We enhanced our customer offering by completing our acquisition of Affymetrix at the end of March for $1.3 billion. It was great to be out with the team in Santa Clara for the day 1 activities, and we're excited about the opportunities we have to leverage our complementary offerings. To remind you, Affymetrix is now part of our Life Sciences Solutions segment. The business has a strong position in flow cytometry in antibodies, which will strengthen our biosciences offering. Its innovative microarray technologies will also open up new growth avenues for us in genetic sciences, particularly in reproductive health and ag bio. This transaction also offers attractive financial benefits. We expect to generate $70 million of operating income synergies by year 3 following the close, $55 million from cost and $15 million from revenue. So good financial returns and a hands-in-glove fit with our Life Science Solutions business.
The next example I want to share is the investment that we made in our e-commerce capabilities to help our customers take full advantage of our comprehensive portfolio. As I've mentioned in the past, when we acquire our business, we always look to adapt -- adopt best practices that will make our company even stronger. When we acquire Life Technologies, we gained a gold standard e-commerce platform. We since moved our Thermo Scientific products to that platform. Now our customers go -- can go to one website for our entire self-manufacture offering, which features rich scientific content and will continue enhancing with added e-commerce functionality over time. The new website complements our fishersci.com website where customers can order our products as well as those in third-party suppliers. We think of our web presence as a highly valuable tool to drive incremental revenue and we're pleased with our progress today.
Before I cover our guidance, I'll make a quick comment on capital deployment. As you know, we have an excellent track record of creating shareholder value through our capital deployment strategy, and it's been an active first quarter. We mentioned on our last call that we have already bought back $500 million of shares in January. As you saw in our press release, we bought back an additional $500 million of shares later in the quarter as well. So including our stock buybacks, the dividend and strategic M&A, we've deployed $2.4 billion of capital so far this year.
Now let me give you a quick update on our guidance for 2016. As you saw in our press release, we're raising both our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance for the year. Stephen will get into the details, but at a high level, the increased guidance is driven by 4 factors: The completion of the Affymetrix acquisition in late March, a less adverse foreign exchange environment, the additional $500 million of stock buybacks and stronger operational performance by our team. Based on these factors, we're raising our revenue guidance for the year to a new range of $17.86 billion to $18.04 billion. This would result in 5% to 6% growth over 2015. We're also raising our adjusted EPS guidance to a new range of $8.05 to $8.19 for strong growth of 9% to 11% year-over-year.
Before I turn the call over to Stephen, let me sum up my remarks with a couple of takeaways. We're starting the year with excellent top and bottom line performance. We closed the acquisition of Affymetrix and we're excited about the new capabilities it brings. We're performing very well in all key geographies and have many opportunities across our businesses to gain share. All of this positions us to achieve another strong year.
With that, I'll now hand the call over to Stephen."
97023,330014756,965913,"Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2016",2016-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with an overview of our first quarter financial performance of the total company, and I'll provide some color on the 4 segments and conclude with our updated 2016 guidance.So starting with the overall",2420,"Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with an overview of our first quarter financial performance of the total company, and I'll provide some color on the 4 segments and conclude with our updated 2016 guidance.
So starting with the overall financial performance for Q1. As you saw in our press release, we grew adjusted EPS by 10% to $1.80. GAAP EPS was $1.01, up 5% from Q1 last year. On the top line, our reported revenue grew 10% year-over-year. The Q1 reported revenue includes 10% organic growth, 1% growth from acquisitions and a 2% headwind from foreign exchange. Please note, the components of the Q1 change do not sum due to rounding.
As I mentioned on the last earnings call, the way our fiscal calendar falls in 2016, we have 4 extra billing days in Q1 and 4 less in Q4. We estimate that we receive just under a 5% benefit to our organic growth in Q1 from the impact of days. The consumables revenue getting most of the impact of the extra days while the capital equipment revenue was only marginally affected. We expect to see the opposite effect on revenue in Q4 when we have 4 less billing days and there's no impact in the year as a whole. So normalizing Q1 minus the extra days, we estimate that our organic growth was approximately 5% during the quarter.
Looking at growth by geography in Q1. I'll provide some color based on the 5% normalized organic growth to provide you with an understanding of the relative performance by region. Based on that, North America and Europe grew in the mid-single digits. Asia Pacific grew in the high single digits with another strong contribution from China and the rest of the world, which represents less than 5% of our revenue, declined in the high single digits.
Looking at our operational performance. Q1 adjusted operating income increased 9% and adjusted operating margin was 21.7%, down 20 basis points from Q1 of last year. Our margin performance in Q1 was in line with our expectations. We received good expansions from our organic growth, driven by strong contributions from our PPI business system and the benefit of acquisition cost synergies, but this is more than offset by a 30 basis point negative impact from the extra calendar days and a 30 basis point headwind from foreign exchange.
The impact of the extra days on margins is not that intuitive, so I thought it would be helpful to take a minute to summarize it for you. There were 66 billing days in Q1 2016 versus 62 in Q1 2015, a 6.5% increase. As I mentioned earlier, this had a positive impact on organic growth of approximately 5%. However, since the level of cost is directly correlated to the number of days, the impact on cost was a full 6.5%. So that means that cost went up more than our revenue because of the days impact. The net effect from this on our operating margin is a headwind of approximately 30 basis points in Q1 that I just mentioned. It's important to note there'll be a corresponding positive impact to margins in Q4 when we have 4 less billing days.
Moving on to the details of the P&L. Total company adjusted gross margin came in at 48.2% in Q1, down 110 basis points from the prior year. The decrease in gross margin in Q1 is primarily attributed to headwinds from unfavorable business mix, the impact of 4 extra days and foreign exchange. Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 22.4% of revenue, which is 80 basis points favorable to Q1 2015 and R&D expense came in at 4.1% of revenue, down 10 basis points versus Q1 last year. R&D as a percent of our manufacturing revenue in Q1 was 6.4%.
Looking at our results below the line. Net interest expense was $95 million, down $6 million from Q1 last year, mainly as a result of lower average debt levels. Adjusted other income and expense was negative $1 million, which is $8 million lower than 2015, driven primarily by changes in nonoperating foreign exchange. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 14% flat to last year and average diluted shares were 398.7 million, down 2.7 million year-over-year, mainly as a result of the share buybacks completed in Q1, partially offset by option dilution.
Turning to cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow from continuing operations through Q1 was $290 million and free cash flow was $180 million after deducting net capital expenditures of $110 million. Free cash flow is $195 million favorable to Q1 2015. We ended the quarter with $830 million in cash and investments. We also returned significant capital to shareholders during the quarter. On our Q4 call, I mentioned we already completed the $500 million in share buybacks in January. We also bought an incremental $500 million later in the quarter for a total of $1 billion in buybacks during Q1. And as I am sure you're aware, we deployed $1.3 billion to acquire Affymetrix right at the end of Q1. And we also returned $60 million to shareholders during the quarter through our dividend.
So all in all, as Marc mentioned, we deployed $2.4 billion of capital in Q1. Our total debt at the end of Q1 was $15 billion, up $2.5 billion sequentially from Q4, mainly driven by the increase in short-term debt relating to the acquisition of Affymetrix and the share buyback. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3.5x total debt to adjusted EBITDA. And wrapping up my comments on total company performance. ROIC improved in the quarter. Our trailing 12-month adjusted ROIC at the end of Q1 was 9.6%, up 10 basis points sequentially from Q4.
So with that, I'll provide you with some color on the performance of our 4 business segments. As I highlighted for the total company, foreign exchange continue to be a headwind for the top line for our segments, an impact of the year-over-year revenue growth and adjusted operating margin to varying degrees. The 4 extra calendar days impacted segment revenue and margins to varying degrees as well.
So starting with Life Sciences Solutions segment. Reported revenue increased 11% in Q1 and organic revenue also grew 11%. In the quarter, we continue to see strong growth in our bioproduction, biosciences and next-gen sequencing business. Q1 adjusted operating income in Life Science Solutions increased 10%, and adjusted operating margin was 29.1%, down 20 basis points year-over-year. Operating margin was positively affected by volume pull-through, strong productivity and the impact of days, but this is more than offset by unfavorable business mix, strategic investments and unfavorable foreign exchange.
In the Analytical Instruments segment, reported revenue increased 4% in Q1 and organic revenue growth was 6%. In the quarter, we have strong growth in our chromatography and services businesses, partially offset by continued weakness in some of our core industrial markets. Q1 adjusted operating income in Analytical Instruments decreased 8% and adjusted operating margin was 14.7%, down 200 basis points year-over-year. Strong productivity was more than offset by the impact of the extra days in the quarter as well as the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange and strategic investments. The days impact is very material for the segment, approximately 200 basis points. Given the low consumables mix in this segment, the extra days have little impact on the top line, but they have a full impact on the cost base, causing significant margin compression. This will revert in Q4 when we have 4 less days.
Turning to the Specialty Diagnostics segment. In Q1, total revenue grew 9% and organic revenue growth was 10%. This is driven by solid growth across all our businesses in this segment. Adjusted operating income increased 7% in Q1 and adjusted operating margin was 26.9%, down 40 basis points from the prior year. Operating margin was positively impacted by good productivity and volume pull-through, but this is more than offset by strategic investments, unfavorable business mix and unfavorable foreign exchange.
Finally, in the Lab Products and Services segment, Q1 reported revenue increased 14% and organic revenue growth was also 14%. This segment continues to benefit from our strong performance in the pharma and biotech end markets. For our biopharma services, research and safety market channel and lab products businesses, all delivering very stronger. Adjusted operating income in the segment increased 16% and adjusted operating margin was 15%, up 30 basis points from the prior year. Margin expansion in the quarter was driven by volume pull-through and good productivity with partial offset from strategic investments and the headwind of additional days in the quarter.
So now I'll review the details of our full year 2016 guidance. As you saw in the press release, I'm pleased to report significant increases in both our top and bottom line guidance. The improved guidance is due to several factors: The acquisition of Affymetrix, more favorable foreign exchange rates relative to our prior guidance, additional stock buybacks completed in Q1 and stronger operational performance. We'll take you through the impact of each of these 4 items in turn.
The first change relates to -- to guidance reflects the acquisition of Affymetrix. We expect this to deliver $275 million of revenue and $40 million of adjusted operating income over the remaining 9 months of the year and that includes our synergies. So and all that will translate to $0.06 of adjusted earnings per share in 2016. The accretion impact of Affymetrix is very back end loaded given the phasing of their revenue and the strong ramp of synergies towards the end of the year. Affymetrix is dilutive to the total company operating margin in 2016 by approximately 10 basis points.
The second change to guidance relate to foreign exchange. We've increased our guidance to reflect the less adverse FX environment, increasing revenue by $200 million and adjusted earnings per share by $0.11. As you know, we've seen tremendous amounts of volatility in FX rates this year, so we used an average of rates over the past couple of months for our revised guidance. Our revised 2016 guidance now assumes a year-over-year FX headwind of $90 million of revenue, $32 million of adjusted operating income and $0.075 of adjusted earnings per share. There's still a headwind for the year but much lower than our initial guidance.
The third change to guidance reflects the impact of the stock buybacks we completed in Q1. In total, we bought back $1 billion of stock in Q1. Half of this was already in our initial guidance. So the revised guidance includes an additional $0.06 for the second $500 million of buybacks we completed in the quarter.
The fourth change to guidance reflects improved operational performance. Given the strong start to the year, we're raising the low end of revenue guidance by $25 million and raising the low end of adjusted EPS guidance by $0.02.
So to sum all this up, the revised 2016 revenue guidance range is $17.86 billion to $18.04 billion, which would represent 5% to 6% growth versus 2015. The $490 million increase to the midpoint comes from 3 factors: $275 million relates to Affymetrix, $200 million from the improved foreign exchange environment and $15 million at higher organic growth. We're still expecting to deliver organic growth of about 4% for the full year, consistent with our previous guidance.
In terms of phasing for the remainder of the year, given the days impact and the strong comp from last year, we expect Q4 organic growth to be essentially flat. And as a reminder, the organic growth comp in Q2 is more challenging than the organic growth comp in Q3. Acquisitions are now expected to contribute about 2% to our reported revenue growth in '16 and FX is expected to be a 0.5% headwind.
In terms of our adjusted EPS, our revised guidance range is $8.05 to $8.19. It represents growth of 9% to 11% over our 2015 adjusted earnings per share of $7.39 for the 1% headwind from foreign exchange. To bridge the $0.24 increase in the midpoint of our adjusted EPS guidance, we gained $0.11 from the more favorable foreign exchange, $0.06 from Affymetrix, $0.06 from additional Q1 share buyback and $0.01 from operational improvements.
A few other details behind the revised 2016 guidance. We are now expecting 50 to 70 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion year-over-year, and this includes the 10 basis point dilution from Affymetrix. We're expecting net interest expense to be about $390 million versus the $380 million in our previous guidance as a result of the incremental debt relating to the Affymetrix acquisition. We're forecasting our adjusted income tax rate to be about 14%, consistent with our previous guidance. In terms of capital deployment, we're still assuming we'll return approximately $240 million of capital to shareholders through dividends. Our guidance does not include any future acquisitions, divestitures or stock buybacks. This is consistent with our past practice of not forecasting incremental capital deployment beyond dividends.
Full year average diluted shares are estimated to be in the range of 398 million to 399 million, down about 3 million from our previous guidance as a result of the stock buybacks we completed in Q1, and we're expecting net capital expenditure to be approximately $440 million, up slightly from the previous guidance due to the Affymetrix acquisition.
In terms of free cash flow for 2016, we now expect this to be about $2.72 billion, slightly higher than the prior guidance due to the increase in our earnings outlook related to FX and our operational performance. There is no net free cash flow impact in 2016 from adding Affymetrix as the operating cash flow for the 9 months is offset by the cost to achieve synergies, deal fees and the capital expenditures related to the business.
In Q1, we used short-term borrowings for the acquisition of Affymetrix and the stock buybacks. Absent any other need, our intention is to pay this down during the course of the year with the cash flow we generate from operations. As always, in interpreting our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance ranges, we should focus on the midpoints of the most likely view of how we see results playing out.
So in summary, we had a number significant achievements this quarter while delivering solid operational results, which positions us really well to achieve our financial goals for the year.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Ken."

If you take another lens on the same question, which is more a product look or a business segment look, that's an area we pay a lot of attention to, a very strong start to the year. In all my comments -- and this is really normalizing for the days as well so that you're getting kind of apples-to-apples look. Our lab products business and our channel business, very strong performance. Certainly, our bioproduction business not only benefits from a really good end market, but the business is performing extraordinarily well. So that clearly has been above market growth.

And I know the low tax rate of the company has always been one of the things that people have always asked questions about Thermo. So can you talk us through the changes that are going on and the impact on the company, number one? And then how sustainable is the 14% tax rate and how should we thinking about that over the next few years?
  I'll take the question. So actually, we pay very close attention to tax regulations and changes there and those regulations across the world as well as domestically. And we have a very great tax team. Recently, the Treasury Department laid out kind of 2 new tax regulations, one very -- one of those regulations is very concentrated to reduce the impact -- the benefit of inversions, and that exposure [ph] simply don't apply to the company. The second set of regulations were targeted at limiting U.S. companies' ability to tax efficiently repatriate cash from overseas. And when thinking about that impact from our company, our existing tax structures, which aren't impacted by these regulations, provide pretty substantial cash repatriation capacity in a very tax efficient way. So at this point, I don't see any material impact from the regulated changes on the company for the foreseeable future. So the bottom line is we're comfortable with the tax rate and the corporate tax planning strategies we have in place across the company. When I think about the tax rate going forward, we'll probably talk more about this at the Analyst Day. Just to remind you kind of the messaging from last year is the tax rate -- the earnings accrete going forward over and above the earnings we have to date generally come in at a higher margin of [ph] tax rate than the 14% that we have in place on average for the company. So absent any other changes in terms of asset structuring, the tax rate will creep up slightly. We've done a pretty good job of making sure that doesn't happen over time. if we look back over the past 3 years, I think we've effectively navigated through that. Part of that comes from some structures that we can put in place with acquisitions that we do. But the rest of it really comes from just good management of our tax strategies and just thinking about just regulatory changes. So more to come at the Analyst Day, but that's kind of a recap on how we've seen it for the last couple of years."

So yes, particularly about the PPI drivers of productivity, so it's a group of levers that we use and we continually use since I've been with the company. And it's kind of a combination of larger type of restructurings where you're consolidating the footprint of the organization in terms of the manufacturing operations in the back office. It's also the micro aspect of PPI. So we're -- day in day out, we're just being better at leaning out the operations and the back office functions and kind of the way that we work. So the combination of all of that is kind of the continual set of efforts. So there's nothing -- no major shift in terms of the look of [ph] region plays that we're doing, the footprint optimization and the use of sourcing and pricing levers. Those are kind of continuing. But the one new thing this year, as I said on the last earnings call, is that we're looking to reinvest the benefit of the medical device tax into some longer-term projects. And one set of projects around the footprint and more complex footprint changes in terms of manufacturing and then being more efficient in our financial back office. Those projects are underway and they're progressing well. So I think it's just a continuum in terms of the impact of the PPI Business System, and then we're kind of stepping it up a little bit in terms of using the opportunity to reinvest in medical device tax."

So John, we're really excited to have the business as part of Thermo Fisher and welcome our new colleagues. And they're not only running the business well but actively looking at how do you maximize the impact with our customer base on the competitive position. I'd break it into 2 different themes. One is a product theme and one is a geographic theme. The geographic theme is quite easy, right? Where we'll be looking for upside is really the commercial reach around the world. Thermo Fisher has incredible reach and Affymetrix was a much narrow company. So that will help over time focusing on accelerating growth and capturing revenue synergies. And over time, we'll obviously drive to the upside to the most extent [ph] possible. From a product fit, the reason the acquisition is so compelling is it's really the way you framed it, which is -- it was a whole company, but really, it is 2 great product lines that fit so incredibly tightly with our Life Sciences Solutions business. And we're able to combine our flow cytometry and antibody businesses in the biosciences business which gives us a much stronger competitive position. And we're able to add the microarray technologies to our large genetic sciences business, which really puts us in a very unique position because we will be truly technology-agnostic for solving customers' problems because we will be the only company that has next-gen sequencing, Sanger Sequencing, microarrays and qPCR with leading positions across that array of technology. So the customer would say, ""Here's the channel that I have,"" and we will give them the optimal workflow. And these are very complementary fits. So with good execution, we'll obviously focus on delivering what we committed to and then always looking for the upside. So from an accretion perspective, as we announced when we announced the deal in January, it was in the $0.10 in the first full year, which translates to basically $0.06 this year, $0.04 in Q1 of 2017. But as you know, as time unfolds, we'll be looking for opportunities to drive to the upside, and that's probably more of a '17 benefit than a '16 benefit."

Chromatography is a pretty good-sized business growing rapidly.

The combination is a very strong business, and the 2 businesses together are growing faster than what the individual businesses were growing as standalone.

We're pleased you could join us today for our Q1 call. As you saw in our press release, we're off to a strong start to the year. We delivered excellent growth in both revenue and adjusted EPS. Our great top and",1743,"Thank you, Ken, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased you could join us today for our Q1 call. As you saw in our press release, we're off to a strong start to the year. We delivered excellent growth in both revenue and adjusted EPS. Our great top and bottom line performance was the result of a few key factors: Good growth across all of our major geographies, strong operational execution by our team plus the added revenue benefit of 4 extra days in the quarter.
We said last quarter that we expected to come out of the gate strong and we did. In addition to great operational execution in Q1, we were also very active in capital deployment. We completed $1 billion of stock buybacks in the quarter and we also closed on our acquisition of Affymetrix at the end of March, which was a quarter sooner than we originally planned. We're excited about the new opportunities we'll have with those added capabilities, and I'll talk a bit more about that later. I'll follow our usual format this morning, starting with the financial results and some commentary on our performance by end market, then I'll cover a few of the business highlights from the quarter, provide an update on capital deployment and wrap up with our revised guidance outlook.
So starting with the financials. Revenue in Q1 grew 10% to $4.29 billion. Adjusted operating income was up 9%. In terms of our earnings performance, we continued our long track record of consistently delivering strong adjusted EPS with a 10% increase to $1.80 per share.
Let me give you a high level view of our Q1 performance in the context of our end markets. After a strong year-end finish, we've typically seen a weaker start in Q1, but that was obviously not the case this year even if you normalize for the 4 extra days we had versus last year. In our key end markets, pharma and biotech was our strongest again this quarter as it has been for some time. This was driven by excellent growth in our bioproduction, biopharma services and biosciences businesses.
Health care diagnostics grew around the company average, academic and government was slightly below the company average and performance overall in industrial and applied remain muted, with continued weakness in industrial end markets and ongoing strength in applied. In aggregate, the dynamics across our end markets were good with no material change from what we saw in 2015. Our strong results in Q1 reinforce that our scale and depth of capabilities are clear differentiators across our end markets.
Let me now highlight some of our key accomplishments from the quarter which show that we continue to position Thermo Fisher for an even stronger future. As you know, our growth strategy is based on developing high-impact innovative new products, leveraging our scale in Asia Pacific and emerging markets and delivering our unique customer value proposition to gain share. So starting with innovation. We kicked off the year, as we always do, with a strong showing at Pittcon, which you know is a major event in the U.S. for the analytical instruments industry. Over the past couple of years, Pittcon has really evolved into an opportunity for us to showcase our Thermo Scientific technologies for applied markets.
Let me give you 2 quick examples, first, in our mass spectrometry business and then chromatography. In mass spec, we've been adapting the advanced capabilities of our Orbitrap platform for customers working outside the research lab in applications such as food safety, forensic toxicology and sports doping. Our recently launched Q Exactive Orbitrap GC-MS/MS is a great example of how we've combined gas chromatography with our Orbitrap capabilities so customers can perform comprehensive sample analysis in a single run.
In our chromatography business, the big headline at Pittcon this year was our new Integrion system, a real breakthrough in high-pressure ion chromatography. It gives customers working in busy environmental, food and beverage and pharmaceutical laboratories a flexible system for creating highly efficient and accurate workflows. Integrion significantly raises the bar on productivity and performance in applied markets. It was nice to learn that our new ion chromatography portfolio was recognized at the show as the Instrument of the Year by readers of SelectScience magazine. This was a great endorsement by our customers and speaks to the strength of this business.
I'll make one more comment on innovation because it's a great example of how we innovate to fulfill our mission, which is to enable our customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer.
We all know about the Zika virus because it's been in the news a lot lately. As you'd expect, when Zika first broke out, we quickly mobilized our teams to begin working with government labs in Brazil as well as the CDC in the U.S. Our Life Sciences Solutions business has been developing a qPCR-based test to detect the virus, which is currently undergoing a validation process. We're also offering an immunoassay in the U.S. for researchers in partnership with a diagnostics company, EUROIMMUN, and we've already begun selling this through our channel business. This is a good example of how we're seen by our customers as a thought leader who could help them solve these pressing issues.
In terms of emerging markets, our second growth driver, let me first say that we saw good growth across all of our key geographies in Q1 with strong performance in North America and Europe as well as very strong performance in Asia Pacific and emerging markets. The standout contributors were China and India, and I'll give you a little more color on what we saw in those regions during the quarter.
Starting with India, our commercial teams there are doing an outstanding job of capturing growth opportunities in biopharma, health care and food safety markets. In China, we performed very well in Q1. Our key focus markets, biopharma, health care and environmental remain robust. As you know, the new 5-year plan was announced in March, and much of it is the continuation of the goal set forth in the previous plan, which is great for Thermo Fisher. The plan outlines investments in innovation, health care and the environment. And given the industry-leading presence we've built in China, we continue to be well positioned in this important growth market.
In terms of our customer value proposition, the third element of our growth strategy, you can think of our approach here in 2 parts. First, we continue to enhance our offering for our customers to make our value proposition even stronger. And second, we're focused on strengthening our commercial capabilities to best leverage our scale and depth of capabilities. Let me give you an example of each in the quarter.
We enhanced our customer offering by completing our acquisition of Affymetrix at the end of March for $1.3 billion. It was great to be out with the team in Santa Clara for the day 1 activities, and we're excited about the opportunities we have to leverage our complementary offerings. To remind you, Affymetrix is now part of our Life Sciences Solutions segment. The business has a strong position in flow cytometry in antibodies, which will strengthen our biosciences offering. Its innovative microarray technologies will also open up new growth avenues for us in genetic sciences, particularly in reproductive health and ag bio. This transaction also offers attractive financial benefits. We expect to generate $70 million of operating income synergies by year 3 following the close, $55 million from cost and $15 million from revenue. So good financial returns and a hand-in-glove fit with our Life Science Solutions business.
The next example I want to share is the investment that we made in our e-commerce capabilities to help our customers take full advantage of our comprehensive portfolio. As I've mentioned in the past, when we acquire a business, we always look to adapt -- adopt best practices that will make our company even stronger. When we acquired Life Technologies, we gained a gold standard e-commerce platform. We since moved our Thermo Scientific products to that platform. Now our customers go -- can go to one website for our entire self-manufacture offering, which features rich scientific content and will continue enhancing with added e-commerce functionality over time. The new website complements our fishersci.com website where customers can order our products as well as those in third-party suppliers. We think of our web presence as a highly valuable tool to drive incremental revenue and we're pleased with our progress to date.
Before I cover our guidance, I'll make a quick comment on capital deployment. As you know, we have an excellent track record of creating shareholder value through our capital deployment strategy, and it's been an active first quarter. We mentioned on our last call that we have already bought back $500 million of shares in January. As you saw in our press release, we bought back an additional $500 million of shares later in the quarter as well. So including our stock buybacks, the dividend and strategic M&A, we've deployed $2.4 billion of capital so far this year.
Now let me give you a quick update on our guidance for 2016. As you saw in our press release, we're raising both our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance for the year. Stephen will get into the details, but at a high level, the increased guidance is driven by 4 factors: The completion of the Affymetrix acquisition in late March, a less adverse foreign exchange environment, the additional $500 million of stock buybacks and stronger operational performance by our team. Based on these factors, we're raising our revenue guidance for the year to a new range of $17.86 billion to $18.04 billion. This would result in 5% to 6% growth over 2015. We're also raising our adjusted EPS guidance to a new range of $8.05 to $8.19 for strong growth of 9% to 11% year-over-year.
Before I turn the call over to Stephen, let me sum up my remarks with a couple of takeaways. We're starting the year with excellent top and bottom line performance. We closed the acquisition of Affymetrix and we're excited about the new capabilities it brings. We're performing very well in all key geographies and have many opportunities across our businesses to gain share. All of this positions us to achieve another strong year.
With that, I'll now hand the call over to Stephen."

I'll begin with an overview of our first quarter financial performance of the total company, and I'll provide some color on the 4 segments and conclude with our updated 2016 guidance.So starting with the overall",2420,"Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with an overview of our first quarter financial performance of the total company, and I'll provide some color on the 4 segments and conclude with our updated 2016 guidance.
So starting with the overall financial performance for Q1. As you saw in our press release, we grew adjusted EPS by 10% to $1.80. GAAP EPS was $1.01, up 5% from Q1 last year. On the top line, our reported revenue grew 10% year-over-year. The Q1 reported revenue includes 10% organic growth, 1% growth from acquisitions and a 2% headwind from foreign exchange. Please note, the components of the Q1 change do not sum due to rounding.
As I mentioned on the last earnings call, the way our fiscal calendar falls in 2016, we have 4 extra billing days in Q1 and 4 less in Q4. We estimate that we received just under a 5% benefit to our organic growth in Q1 from the impact of days. The consumables revenue is getting most of the impact of the extra days while the capital equipment revenue was only marginally affected. We expect to see the opposite effect on revenue in Q4 when we have 4 less billing days and there's no impact on the year as a whole. So normalizing Q1 minus the extra days, we estimate that our organic growth was approximately 5% during the quarter.
Looking at growth by geography in Q1. I'll provide some color based on the 5% normalized organic growth to provide you with an understanding of the relative performance by region. Based on that, North America and Europe grew in the mid-single digits. Asia Pacific grew in the high single digits with another strong contribution from China and the rest of the world, which represents less than 5% of our revenue, declined in the high single digits.
Looking at our operational performance. Q1 adjusted operating income increased 9% and adjusted operating margin was 21.7%, down 20 basis points from Q1 of last year. Our margin performance in Q1 was in line with our expectations. We received good expansions from our organic growth, driven by strong contributions from our PPI business systems and the benefit of acquisition cost synergies, but this is more than offset by a 30 basis point negative impact from the extra calendar days and a 30 basis point headwind from foreign exchange.
The impact of the extra days on margins is not that intuitive, so I thought it would be helpful to take a minute to summarize it for you. There were 66 billing days in Q1 2016 versus 62 in Q1 2015, a 6.5% increase. As I mentioned earlier, this had a positive impact on organic growth of approximately 5%. However, since the level of cost is directly correlated to the number of days, the impact on cost was a full 6.5%. So that means that cost went up more than our revenue because of the days impact. The net effect from this on our operating margin is a headwind of approximately 30 basis points in Q1 that I just mentioned. It's important to note there'll be a corresponding positive impact to margins in Q4 when we have 4 less billing days.
Moving on to the details of the P&L. Total company adjusted gross margin came in at 48.2% in Q1, down 110 basis points from the prior year. The decrease in gross margin in Q1 is primarily attributed to headwinds from unfavorable business mix, the impact of 4 extra days and foreign exchange. Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 22.4% of revenue, which is 80 basis points favorable to Q1 2015 and R&D expense came in at 4.1% of revenue, down 10 basis points versus Q1 last year. R&D as a percent of our manufacturing revenue in Q1 was 6.4%.
Looking at our results below the line. Net interest expense was $95 million, down $6 million from Q1 last year, mainly as a result of lower average debt levels. Adjusted other income and expense was negative $1 million, which is $8 million lower than 2015, driven primarily by changes in nonoperating foreign exchange. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 14% flat to last year and average diluted shares were 398.7 million, down 2.7 million year-over-year, mainly as a result of the share buybacks completed in Q1, partially offset by option dilution.
Turning to cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow from continuing operations through Q1 was $290 million and free cash flow was $180 million after deducting net capital expenditures of $110 million. Free cash flow is $195 million favorable to Q1 2015. We ended the quarter with $830 million in cash and investments. We also returned significant capital to shareholders during the quarter. On our Q4 call, I mentioned we'd already completed the $500 million in share buybacks in January. We also bought an incremental $500 million later in the quarter for a total of $1 billion in buybacks during Q1. And as I am sure you're aware, we deployed $1.3 billion to acquire Affymetrix right at the end of Q1. And we also returned $60 million to shareholders during the quarter through our dividend.
So all in all, as Marc mentioned, we deployed $2.4 billion of capital in Q1. Our total debt at the end of Q1 was $15 billion, up $2.5 billion sequentially from Q4, mainly driven by the increase in short-term debt relating to the acquisition of Affymetrix and the share buyback. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3.5x total debt to adjusted EBITDA. And wrapping up my comments on total company performance. ROIC improved in the quarter. Our trailing 12-month adjusted ROIC at the end of Q1 was 9.6%, up 10 basis points sequentially from Q4.
So with that, I'll provide you with some color on the performance of our 4 business segments. As I highlighted for the total company, foreign exchange continued to be a headwind for the top line for our segments, an impacted our year-over-year revenue growth and adjusted operating margin to varying degrees. The 4 extra calendar days impacted segment revenue and margins to varying degrees as well.
So starting with Life Sciences Solutions segment. Reported revenue increased 11% in Q1 and organic revenue also grew 11%. In the quarter, we continue to see strong growth in our bioproduction, biosciences and next-gen sequencing business. Q1 adjusted operating income in Life Science Solutions increased 10%, and adjusted operating margin was 29.1%, down 20 basis points year-over-year. Operating margin was positively affected by volume pull-through, strong productivity and the impact of days, but this is more than offset by unfavorable business mix, strategic investments and unfavorable foreign exchange.
In the Analytical Instruments segment, reported revenue increased 4% in Q1 and organic revenue growth was 6%. In the quarter, we have strong growth in our chromatography and services businesses, partially offset by continued weakness in some of our core industrial markets. Q1 adjusted operating income in Analytical Instruments decreased 8% and adjusted operating margin was 14.7%, down 200 basis points year-over-year. Strong productivity was more than offset by the impact of the extra days in the quarter as well as the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange and strategic investments. The days impact is very material for the segment, approximately 200 basis points. Given the low consumables mix in this segment, the extra days have little impact on the top line, but they have a full impact on the cost base, causing significant margin compression. This will revert in Q4 when we have 4 less days.
Turning to the Specialty Diagnostics segment. In Q1, total revenue grew 9% and organic revenue growth was 10%. This is driven by solid growth across all our businesses in this segment. Adjusted operating income increased 7% in Q1 and adjusted operating margin was 26.9%, down 40 basis points from the prior year. Operating margin was positively impacted by good productivity and volume pull-through, but this is more than offset by strategic investments, unfavorable business mix and unfavorable foreign exchange.
Finally, in the Lab Products and Services segment, Q1 reported revenue increased 14% and organic revenue growth was also 14%. This segment continues to benefit from our strong performance in the pharma and biotech end markets. For our biopharma services, research and safety market channels and lab products businesses, all delivering very stronger. Adjusted operating income in the segment increased 16% and adjusted operating margin was 15%, up 30 basis points from the prior year. Margin expansion in the quarter was driven by volume pull-through and good productivity with partial offset from strategic investments and the headwind of additional days in the quarter.
So now I'll review the details of our full year 2016 guidance. As you saw in the press release, I'm pleased to report significant increases in both our top and bottom line guidance. The improved guidance is due to several factors: The acquisition of Affymetrix, more favorable foreign exchange rates relative to our prior guidance, additional stock buybacks completed in Q1 and stronger operational performance. We'll take you through the impact of each of these 4 items in turn.
The first change relates to -- to guidance reflects the acquisition of Affymetrix. We expect this to deliver $275 million of revenue and $40 million of adjusted operating income over the remaining 9 months of the year and that includes our synergies. So and all that will translate to $0.06 of adjusted earnings per share in 2016. The accretion impact of Affymetrix is very back end loaded given the phasing of their revenues and the strong ramp of synergies towards the end of the year. Affymetrix is dilutive to the total company operating margin in 2016 by approximately 10 basis points.
The second change to guidance relate to foreign exchange. We've increased our guidance to reflect the less adverse FX environment, increasing revenue by $200 million and adjusted earnings per share by $0.11. As you know, we've seen tremendous amounts of volatility in FX rates this year, so we used an average of rates over the past couple of months for our revised guidance. Our revised 2016 guidance now assumes a year-over-year FX headwind of $90 million of revenue, $32 million of adjusted operating income and $0.075 of adjusted earnings per share. There's still a headwind for the year but much lower than our initial guidance.
The third change to guidance reflects the impact of the stock buybacks we completed in Q1. In total, we bought back $1 billion of stock in Q1. Half of this was already in our initial guidance. So the revised guidance includes an additional $0.06 for the second $500 million of buybacks we completed in the quarter.
The fourth change to guidance reflects improved operational performance. Given the strong start to the year, we're raising the low end of revenue guidance by $25 million and raising the low end of adjusted EPS guidance by $0.02.
So to sum all this up, the revised 2016 revenue guidance range is $17.86 billion to $18.04 billion, which would represent 5% to 6% growth versus 2015. The $490 million increase to the midpoint comes from 3 factors: $275 million relates to Affymetrix, $200 million from the improved foreign exchange environment and $15 million at higher organic growth. We're still expecting to deliver organic growth of about 4% for the full year, consistent with our previous guidance.
In terms of phasing for the remainder of the year, given the days impact and the strong comp from last year, we expect Q4 organic growth to be essentially flat. And as a reminder, the organic growth comp in Q2 is more challenging than the organic growth comp in Q3. Acquisitions are now expected to contribute about 2% to our reported revenue growth in '16 and FX is expected to be a 0.5% headwind.
In terms of our adjusted EPS, our revised guidance range is $8.05 to $8.19. It represents growth of 9% to 11% over our 2015 adjusted earnings per share of $7.39 for the 1% headwind from foreign exchange. To bridge the $0.24 increase in the midpoint of our adjusted EPS guidance, we gained $0.11 from the more favorable foreign exchange, $0.06 from Affymetrix, $0.06 from additional Q1 share buyback and $0.01 from operational improvements.
A few other details behind the revised 2016 guidance. We are now expecting 50 to 70 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion year-over-year, and this includes the 10 basis point dilution from Affymetrix. We're expecting net interest expense to be about $390 million versus the $380 million in our previous guidance as a result of the incremental debt relating to the Affymetrix acquisition. We're forecasting our adjusted income tax rate to be about 14%, consistent with our previous guidance. In terms of capital deployment, we're still assuming we'll return approximately $240 million of capital to shareholders through dividends. Our guidance does not include any future acquisitions, divestitures or stock buybacks. This is consistent with our past practice of not forecasting incremental capital deployment beyond dividends.
Full year average diluted shares are estimated to be in the range of 398 million to 399 million, down about 3 million from our previous guidance as a result of the stock buybacks we completed in Q1, and we're expecting net capital expenditure to be approximately $440 million, up slightly from the previous guidance due to the Affymetrix acquisition.
In terms of free cash flow for 2016, we now expect this to be about $2.72 billion, slightly higher than the prior guidance due to the increase in our earnings outlook related to FX and our operational performance. There is no net free cash flow impact in 2016 from adding Affymetrix as the operating cash flow for the 9 months is offset by the cost to achieve synergies, deal fees and the capital expenditures related to the business.
In Q1, we used short-term borrowings for the acquisition of Affymetrix and the stock buybacks. Absent any other need, our intention is to pay this down during the course of the year with the cash flow we generate from operations. As always, in interpreting our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance ranges, we should focus on the midpoints of the most likely view of how we see results playing out.

With that, I'll turn the call back over to Ken."

As you know, we have a very strong competitive position because of our scale and our unique depth of capabilities. We have great relations with all of our pharma and biotech customers and that's positioned us to do well. But end market was stronger than our expectations in the quarter also. So we were able to deliver very positive growth there. So that's an end market look. If you take another lens on the same question, which is more a product look or a business segment look, that's an area we pay a lot of attention to, a very strong start to the year. And all my comments -- and this is really normalizing for the days as well so that you're getting kind of apples-to-apples look. Our lab products business and our channel business, very strong performance. Certainly, our bioproduction business not only benefits from a really good end market, but the business is performing extraordinarily well. So that clearly has been above market growth. Our chromatography and mass spec business, that combined business, had a very strong start to the year as well. So those would be some examples where you take a product lens looking at that and say how are we doing, that's a nice cut on products and by the end markets, pharma and biotech. And then finally, China, geographically, we're growing very, very strong, continuing the strength there."

And I know the low tax rate of the company has always been one of the things that people have always asked questions about Thermo. So can you talk us through the changes that are going on and the impact on the company, number one? And then how sustainable is the 14% tax rate and how should we think about that over the next few years?
  I'll take the question. So obviously, we pay very close attention to tax regulations and changes there and those regulations across the world as well as domestically. And we have a very great tax team. Recently, the Treasury Department laid out kind of 2 new tax regulations, one very -- one of those regulations is very concentrated to reduce the impact -- the benefit of inversions, and that exposure  simply don't apply to the company. The second set of regulations were targeted at limiting U.S. companies' ability to tax efficiently repatriate cash from overseas. And when I think about that impact from our company, our existing tax structures, which aren't impacted by these regulations, provide pretty substantial cash repatriation capacity in a very tax efficient way. So at this point, I don't see any material impact from the regulated changes on the company for the foreseeable future. So the bottom line is we're comfortable with the tax rate and the corporate tax planning strategies we have in place across the company. When I think about the tax rate going forward, we'll probably talk more about this at the Analyst Day. Just to remind you kind of the messaging from last year is the tax rate -- the earnings accrete going forward over and above the earnings we have to date generally come in at a higher marginal tax rate than the 14% that we have in place on average for the company. So absent any other changes in terms of our structuring, the tax rate will creep up slightly. We've done a pretty good job of making sure that doesn't happen over time. if we look back over the past 3 years, I think we've effectively navigated through that. Part of that comes from some structures that we can put in place with acquisitions that we do. But the rest of it really comes from just good management of our tax strategies and just thinking about just regulatory changes. So more to come at the Analyst Day, but that's kind of a recap on how we've seen it for the last couple of years."

And it's kind of a combination of larger type of restructurings where you're consolidating the footprint of the organization in terms of the manufacturing operations in the back office. It's also the micro aspect of PPI. So we're -- day in day out, we're just being better at leaning out the operations and the back office functions and kind of the way that we work. So the combination of all of that is kind of the continual set of efforts. So there's nothing -- no major shift in terms of the look of [ph] region plays that we're doing, the footprint optimization and the use of sourcing and pricing levers. Those are kind of continuing. But the one new thing this year, as I said on the last earnings call, is that we're looking to reinvest the benefit of the medical device tax into some longer-term projects. And one set of projects around the footprint and more complex footprint changes in terms of manufacturing and then being more efficient in our financial back office. Those projects are underway and they're progressing well. So I think it's just a continuum in terms of the impact of the PPI Business System, and then we're kind of stepping it up a little bit in terms of using the opportunity to reinvest in medical device tax."

So John, we're really excited to have the business as part of Thermo Fisher and welcome our new colleagues. And they're not only running the business well but actively looking at how do you maximize the impact with our customer base and the competitive position. I'd break it into 2 different themes. One is a product theme and one is a geographic theme. The geographic theme is quite easy, right? Where we'll be looking for upside is really the commercial reach around the world. Thermo Fisher has incredible reach and Affymetrix was a much narrower company. So that will help over time focusing on accelerating growth and capturing revenue synergies. And over time, we'll obviously drive to the upside to the most extent possible. From a product fit, the reason the acquisition is so compelling is it's really the way you framed it, which is -- it was a whole company, but really, it is 2 great product lines that fit so incredibly tightly with our Life Sciences Solutions business. And we're able to combine our flow cytometry and antibody businesses in the biosciences business which gives us a much stronger competitive position. And we're able to add the microarray technologies to our large genetic sciences business, which really puts us in a very unique position because we will be truly technology-agnostic for solving customers' problems because we will be the only company that has next-gen sequencing, Sanger Sequencing, microarrays and qPCR with leading positions across that array of technology. So the customer would say, ""Here's the challenge that I have,"" and we will give them the optimal workflow. And these are very complementary fits. So with good execution, we'll obviously focus on delivering what we committed to and then always looking for the upside. So from an accretion perspective, as we announced when we announced the deal in January, it was in the $0.10 in the first full year, which translates to basically $0.06 this year, $0.04 in Q1 of 2017. But as you know, as time unfolds, we'll be looking for opportunities to drive to the upside, and that's probably more of a '17 benefit than a '16 benefit."

And we didn't have to talk about OEM contract, all    that other stuff that was -- did have a lot of talk, but in the scheme of things, it wasn't that material. So it's a reasonable quarter and really we're taking the actions to make sure in the long term that business is a fast-growing business for us."

So that business is good. From the consumables mix, it's pretty steady on good performance, right? Our channel business has done well. Our Life Sciences Solutions has done well. When I think about profitability, it's not a huge driver. We make a little bit more money on consumables for the self-manufactured portion, but embedded in there is the channel business. So as you know, we don't manage the mix that way. But generally, I'm not concerned by sort of the rates of growth in the businesses. In fact, the consumable growth shows that we have pretty steady stable performance in the end markets."

We delivered excellent growth in both revenue and adjusted EPS. Our great top and bottom line performance was the result of a few key factors: Good growth across all of our major geographies, strong operational execution by our team plus the added revenue benefit of 4 extra days in the quarter.
We said last quarter that we expected to come out of the gate strong and we did. In addition to great operational execution in Q1, we were also very active in capital deployment. We completed $1 billion of stock buybacks in the quarter and we also closed on our acquisition of Affymetrix at the end of March, which was a quarter sooner than we originally planned. We're excited about the new opportunities we'll have with those added capabilities, and I'll talk a bit more about that later. I'll follow our usual format this morning, starting with the financial results and some commentary on our performance by end market, then I'll cover a few of the business highlights from the quarter, provide an update on capital deployment and wrap up with our revised guidance outlook.
So starting with the financials. Revenue in Q1 grew 10% to $4.29 billion. Adjusted operating income was up 9%. In terms of our earnings performance, we continued our long track record of consistently delivering strong adjusted EPS with a 10% increase to $1.80 per share.
Let me give you a high level view of our Q1 performance in the context of our end markets. After a strong year-end finish, we've typically seen a weaker start in Q1, but that was obviously not the case this year even if you normalize for the 4 extra days we had versus last year. In our key end markets, pharma and biotech was our strongest again this quarter as it has been for some time. This was driven by excellent growth in our bioproduction, biopharma services and biosciences businesses.
Health care diagnostics grew around the company average, academic and government was slightly below the company average and performance overall in industrial and applied remain muted, with continued weakness in industrial end markets and ongoing strength in applied. In aggregate, the dynamics across our end markets were good with no material change from what we saw in 2015. Our strong results in Q1 reinforce that our scale and depth of capabilities are clear differentiators across our end markets.
Let me now highlight some of our key accomplishments from the quarter which show that we continue to position Thermo Fisher for an even stronger future. As you know, our growth strategy is based on developing high-impact innovative new products, leveraging our scale in Asia Pacific and emerging markets and delivering our unique customer value proposition to gain share. So starting with innovation. We kicked off the year, as we always do, with a strong showing at Pittcon, which you know is a major event in the U.S. for the analytical instruments industry. Over the past couple of years, Pittcon has really evolved into an opportunity for us to showcase our Thermo Scientific technologies for applied markets.
Let me give you 2 quick examples, first, in our mass spectrometry business and then chromatography. In mass spec, we've been adapting the advanced capabilities of our Orbitrap platform for customers working outside the research lab in applications such as food safety, forensic toxicology and sports doping. Our recently launched Q Exactive Orbitrap GC-MS/MS is a great example of how we've combined gas chromatography with our Orbitrap capabilities so customers can perform comprehensive sample analysis in a single run.
In our chromatography business, the big headline at Pittcon this year was our new Integrion system, a real breakthrough in high-pressure ion chromatography. It gives customers working in busy environmental, food and beverage and pharmaceutical laboratories a flexible system for creating highly efficient and accurate workflows. Integrion significantly raises the bar on productivity and performance in applied markets. It was nice to learn that our new ion chromatography portfolio was recognized at the show as the Instrument of the Year by readers of SelectScience magazine. This was a great endorsement by our customers and speaks to the strength of this business.
I'll make one more comment on innovation because it's a great example of how we innovate to fulfill our mission, which is to enable our customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer.
We all know about the Zika virus because it's been in the news a lot lately. As you'd expect, when Zika first broke out, we quickly mobilized our teams to begin working with government labs in Brazil as well as the CDC in the U.S. Our Life Sciences Solutions business has been developing a qPCR-based test to detect the virus, which is currently undergoing a validation process. We're also offering an immunoassay in the U.S. for researchers in partnership with a diagnostics company, EUROIMMUN, and we've already begun selling this through our channel business. This is a good example of how we're seen by our customers as a thought leader who could help them solve these pressing issues.
In terms of emerging markets, our second growth driver, let me first say that we saw good growth across all of our key geographies in Q1 with strong performance in North America and Europe as well as very strong performance in Asia Pacific and emerging markets. The standout contributors were China and India, and I'll give you a little more color on what we saw in those regions during the quarter.
Starting with India, our commercial teams there are doing an outstanding job of capturing growth opportunities in biopharma, health care and food safety markets. In China, we performed very well in Q1. Our key focus markets, biopharma, health care and environmental remain robust. As you know, the new 5-year plan was announced in March, and much of it is the continuation of the goal set forth in the previous plan, which is great for Thermo Fisher. The plan outlines investments in innovation, health care and the environment. And given the industry-leading presence we've built in China, we continue to be well positioned in this important growth market.
In terms of our customer value proposition, the third element of our growth strategy, you can think of our approach here in 2 parts. First, we continue to enhance our offering for our customers to make our value proposition even stronger. And second, we're focused on strengthening our commercial capabilities to best leverage our scale and depth of capabilities. Let me give you an example of each in the quarter.
We enhanced our customer offering by completing our acquisition of Affymetrix at the end of March for $1.3 billion. It was great to be out with the team in Santa Clara for the day 1 activities, and we're excited about the opportunities we have to leverage our complementary offerings. To remind you, Affymetrix is now part of our Life Sciences Solutions segment. The business has a strong position in flow cytometry in antibodies, which will strengthen our biosciences offering. Its innovative microarray technologies will also open up new growth avenues for us in genetic sciences, particularly in reproductive health and ag bio. This transaction also offers attractive financial benefits. We expect to generate $70 million of operating income synergies by year 3 following the close, $55 million from cost and $15 million from revenue. So good financial returns and a hand-in-glove fit with our Life Science Solutions business.
The next example I want to share is the investment that we made in our e-commerce capabilities to help our customers take full advantage of our comprehensive portfolio. As I've mentioned in the past, when we acquire a business, we always look to adapt -- adopt best practices that will make our company even stronger. When we acquired Life Technologies, we gained a gold standard e-commerce platform. We since moved our Thermo Scientific products to that platform. Now our customers go -- can go to one website for our entire self-manufacture offering, which features rich scientific content and will continue enhancing with added e-commerce functionality over time. The new website complements our fishersci.com website where customers can order our products as well as those in third-party suppliers. We think of our web presence as a highly valuable tool to drive incremental revenue and we're pleased with our progress to date.
Before I cover our guidance, I'll make a quick comment on capital deployment. As you know, we have an excellent track record of creating shareholder value through our capital deployment strategy, and it's been an active first quarter. We mentioned on our last call that we have already bought back $500 million of shares in January. As you saw in our press release, we bought back an additional $500 million of shares later in the quarter as well. So including our stock buybacks, the dividend and strategic M&A, we've deployed $2.4 billion of capital so far this year.
Now let me give you a quick update on our guidance for 2016. As you saw in our press release, we're raising both our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance for the year. Stephen will get into the details, but at a high level, the increased guidance is driven by 4 factors: The completion of the Affymetrix acquisition in late March, a less adverse foreign exchange environment, the additional $500 million of stock buybacks and stronger operational performance by our team. Based on these factors, we're raising our revenue guidance for the year to a new range of $17.86 billion to $18.04 billion. This would result in 5% to 6% growth over 2015. We're also raising our adjusted EPS guidance to a new range of $8.05 to $8.19 for strong growth of 9% to 11% year-over-year.
Before I turn the call over to Stephen, let me sum up my remarks with a couple of takeaways. We're starting the year with excellent top and bottom line performance. We closed the acquisition of Affymetrix and we're excited about the new capabilities it brings. We're performing very well in all key geographies and have many opportunities across our businesses to gain share. All of this positions us to achieve another strong year.
With that, I'll now hand the call over to Stephen."
97023,330014756,966966,"Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2016",2016-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with an overview of our first quarter financial performance of the total company, and I'll provide some color on the 4 segments and conclude with our updated 2016 guidance.So starting with the overall",2420,"Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with an overview of our first quarter financial performance of the total company, and I'll provide some color on the 4 segments and conclude with our updated 2016 guidance.
So starting with the overall financial performance for Q1. As you saw in our press release, we grew adjusted EPS by 10% to $1.80. GAAP EPS was $1.01, up 5% from Q1 last year. On the top line, our reported revenue grew 10% year-over-year. The Q1 reported revenue includes 10% organic growth, 1% growth from acquisitions and a 2% headwind from foreign exchange. Please note, the components of the Q1 change do not sum due to rounding.
As I mentioned on the last earnings call, the way our fiscal calendar falls in 2016, we have 4 extra billing days in Q1 and 4 less in Q4. We estimate that we received just under a 5% benefit to our organic growth in Q1 from the impact of days. The consumables revenue is getting most of the impact of the extra days while the capital equipment revenue was only marginally affected. We expect to see the opposite effect on revenue in Q4 when we have 4 less billing days and there's no impact on the year as a whole. So normalizing Q1 minus the extra days, we estimate that our organic growth was approximately 5% during the quarter.
Looking at growth by geography in Q1. I'll provide some color based on the 5% normalized organic growth to provide you with an understanding of the relative performance by region. Based on that, North America and Europe grew in the mid-single digits. Asia Pacific grew in the high single digits with another strong contribution from China and the rest of the world, which represents less than 5% of our revenue, declined in the high single digits.
Looking at our operational performance. Q1 adjusted operating income increased 9% and adjusted operating margin was 21.7%, down 20 basis points from Q1 of last year. Our margin performance in Q1 was in line with our expectations. We received good expansions from our organic growth, driven by strong contributions from our PPI business systems and the benefit of acquisition cost synergies, but this is more than offset by a 30 basis point negative impact from the extra calendar days and a 30 basis point headwind from foreign exchange.
The impact of the extra days on margins is not that intuitive, so I thought it would be helpful to take a minute to summarize it for you. There were 66 billing days in Q1 2016 versus 62 in Q1 2015, a 6.5% increase. As I mentioned earlier, this had a positive impact on organic growth of approximately 5%. However, since the level of cost is directly correlated to the number of days, the impact on cost was a full 6.5%. So that means that cost went up more than our revenue because of the days impact. The net effect from this on our operating margin is a headwind of approximately 30 basis points in Q1 that I just mentioned. It's important to note there'll be a corresponding positive impact to margins in Q4 when we have 4 less billing days.
Moving on to the details of the P&L. Total company adjusted gross margin came in at 48.2% in Q1, down 110 basis points from the prior year. The decrease in gross margin in Q1 is primarily attributed to headwinds from unfavorable business mix, the impact of 4 extra days and foreign exchange. Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 22.4% of revenue, which is 80 basis points favorable to Q1 2015 and R&D expense came in at 4.1% of revenue, down 10 basis points versus Q1 last year. R&D as a percent of our manufacturing revenue in Q1 was 6.4%.
Looking at our results below the line. Net interest expense was $95 million, down $6 million from Q1 last year, mainly as a result of lower average debt levels. Adjusted other income and expense was negative $1 million, which is $8 million lower than 2015, driven primarily by changes in nonoperating foreign exchange. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 14% flat to last year and average diluted shares were 398.7 million, down 2.7 million year-over-year, mainly as a result of the share buybacks completed in Q1, partially offset by option dilution.
Turning to cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow from continuing operations through Q1 was $290 million and free cash flow was $180 million after deducting net capital expenditures of $110 million. Free cash flow is $195 million favorable to Q1 2015. We ended the quarter with $830 million in cash and investments. We also returned significant capital to shareholders during the quarter. On our Q4 call, I mentioned we'd already completed the $500 million in share buybacks in January. We also bought an incremental $500 million later in the quarter for a total of $1 billion in buybacks during Q1. And as I am sure you're aware, we deployed $1.3 billion to acquire Affymetrix right at the end of Q1. And we also returned $60 million to shareholders during the quarter through our dividend.
So all in all, as Marc mentioned, we deployed $2.4 billion of capital in Q1. Our total debt at the end of Q1 was $15 billion, up $2.5 billion sequentially from Q4, mainly driven by the increase in short-term debt relating to the acquisition of Affymetrix and the share buyback. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3.5x total debt to adjusted EBITDA. And wrapping up my comments on total company performance. ROIC improved in the quarter. Our trailing 12-month adjusted ROIC at the end of Q1 was 9.6%, up 10 basis points sequentially from Q4.
So with that, I'll provide you with some color on the performance of our 4 business segments. As I highlighted for the total company, foreign exchange continued to be a headwind for the top line for our segments, an impacted our year-over-year revenue growth and adjusted operating margin to varying degrees. The 4 extra calendar days impacted segment revenue and margins to varying degrees as well.
So starting with Life Sciences Solutions segment. Reported revenue increased 11% in Q1 and organic revenue also grew 11%. In the quarter, we continue to see strong growth in our bioproduction, biosciences and next-gen sequencing business. Q1 adjusted operating income in Life Science Solutions increased 10%, and adjusted operating margin was 29.1%, down 20 basis points year-over-year. Operating margin was positively affected by volume pull-through, strong productivity and the impact of days, but this is more than offset by unfavorable business mix, strategic investments and unfavorable foreign exchange.
In the Analytical Instruments segment, reported revenue increased 4% in Q1 and organic revenue growth was 6%. In the quarter, we have strong growth in our chromatography and services businesses, partially offset by continued weakness in some of our core industrial markets. Q1 adjusted operating income in Analytical Instruments decreased 8% and adjusted operating margin was 14.7%, down 200 basis points year-over-year. Strong productivity was more than offset by the impact of the extra days in the quarter as well as the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange and strategic investments. The days impact is very material for the segment, approximately 200 basis points. Given the low consumables mix in this segment, the extra days have little impact on the top line, but they have a full impact on the cost base, causing significant margin compression. This will revert in Q4 when we have 4 less days.
Turning to the Specialty Diagnostics segment. In Q1, total revenue grew 9% and organic revenue growth was 10%. This is driven by solid growth across all our businesses in this segment. Adjusted operating income increased 7% in Q1 and adjusted operating margin was 26.9%, down 40 basis points from the prior year. Operating margin was positively impacted by good productivity and volume pull-through, but this is more than offset by strategic investments, unfavorable business mix and unfavorable foreign exchange.
Finally, in the Lab Products and Services segment, Q1 reported revenue increased 14% and organic revenue growth was also 14%. This segment continues to benefit from our strong performance in the pharma and biotech end markets. For our biopharma services, research and safety market channels and lab products businesses, all delivering very stronger. Adjusted operating income in the segment increased 16% and adjusted operating margin was 15%, up 30 basis points from the prior year. Margin expansion in the quarter was driven by volume pull-through and good productivity with partial offset from strategic investments and the headwind of additional days in the quarter.
So now I'll review the details of our full year 2016 guidance. As you saw in the press release, I'm pleased to report significant increases in both our top and bottom line guidance. The improved guidance is due to several factors: The acquisition of Affymetrix, more favorable foreign exchange rates relative to our prior guidance, additional stock buybacks completed in Q1 and stronger operational performance. We'll take you through the impact of each of these 4 items in turn.
The first change relates to -- to guidance reflects the acquisition of Affymetrix. We expect this to deliver $275 million of revenue and $40 million of adjusted operating income over the remaining 9 months of the year and that includes our synergies. So and all that will translate to $0.06 of adjusted earnings per share in 2016. The accretion impact of Affymetrix is very back end loaded given the phasing of their revenues and the strong ramp of synergies towards the end of the year. Affymetrix is dilutive to the total company operating margin in 2016 by approximately 10 basis points.
The second change to guidance relate to foreign exchange. We've increased our guidance to reflect the less adverse FX environment, increasing revenue by $200 million and adjusted earnings per share by $0.11. As you know, we've seen tremendous amounts of volatility in FX rates this year, so we used an average of rates over the past couple of months for our revised guidance. Our revised 2016 guidance now assumes a year-over-year FX headwind of $90 million of revenue, $32 million of adjusted operating income and $0.075 of adjusted earnings per share. There's still a headwind for the year but much lower than our initial guidance.
The third change to guidance reflects the impact of the stock buybacks we completed in Q1. In total, we bought back $1 billion of stock in Q1. Half of this was already in our initial guidance. So the revised guidance includes an additional $0.06 for the second $500 million of buybacks we completed in the quarter.
The fourth change to guidance reflects improved operational performance. Given the strong start to the year, we're raising the low end of revenue guidance by $25 million and raising the low end of adjusted EPS guidance by $0.02.
So to sum all this up, the revised 2016 revenue guidance range is $17.86 billion to $18.04 billion, which would represent 5% to 6% growth versus 2015. The $490 million increase to the midpoint comes from 3 factors: $275 million relates to Affymetrix, $200 million from the improved foreign exchange environment and $15 million at higher organic growth. We're still expecting to deliver organic growth of about 4% for the full year, consistent with our previous guidance.
In terms of phasing for the remainder of the year, given the days impact and the strong comp from last year, we expect Q4 organic growth to be essentially flat. And as a reminder, the organic growth comp in Q2 is more challenging than the organic growth comp in Q3. Acquisitions are now expected to contribute about 2% to our reported revenue growth in '16 and FX is expected to be a 0.5% headwind.
In terms of our adjusted EPS, our revised guidance range is $8.05 to $8.19. It represents growth of 9% to 11% over our 2015 adjusted earnings per share of $7.39 for the 1% headwind from foreign exchange. To bridge the $0.24 increase in the midpoint of our adjusted EPS guidance, we gained $0.11 from the more favorable foreign exchange, $0.06 from Affymetrix, $0.06 from additional Q1 share buyback and $0.01 from operational improvements.
A few other details behind the revised 2016 guidance. We are now expecting 50 to 70 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion year-over-year, and this includes the 10 basis point dilution from Affymetrix. We're expecting net interest expense to be about $390 million versus the $380 million in our previous guidance as a result of the incremental debt relating to the Affymetrix acquisition. We're forecasting our adjusted income tax rate to be about 14%, consistent with our previous guidance. In terms of capital deployment, we're still assuming we'll return approximately $240 million of capital to shareholders through dividends. Our guidance does not include any future acquisitions, divestitures or stock buybacks. This is consistent with our past practice of not forecasting incremental capital deployment beyond dividends.
Full year average diluted shares are estimated to be in the range of 398 million to 399 million, down about 3 million from our previous guidance as a result of the stock buybacks we completed in Q1, and we're expecting net capital expenditure to be approximately $440 million, up slightly from the previous guidance due to the Affymetrix acquisition.
In terms of free cash flow for 2016, we now expect this to be about $2.72 billion, slightly higher than the prior guidance due to the increase in our earnings outlook related to FX and our operational performance. There is no net free cash flow impact in 2016 from adding Affymetrix as the operating cash flow for the 9 months is offset by the cost to achieve synergies, deal fees and the capital expenditures related to the business.
In Q1, we used short-term borrowings for the acquisition of Affymetrix and the stock buybacks. Absent any other need, our intention is to pay this down during the course of the year with the cash flow we generate from operations. As always, in interpreting our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance ranges, we should focus on the midpoints of the most likely view of how we see results playing out.
So in summary, we had a number significant achievements this quarter while delivering solid operational results, which positions us really well to achieve our financial goals for the year.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Ken."

And all my comments -- and this is really normalizing for the days as well so that you're getting kind of apples-to-apples look. Our lab products business and our channel business, very strong performance. Certainly, our bioproduction business not only benefits from a really good end market, but the business is performing extraordinarily well. So that clearly has been above market growth.

And I know the low tax rate of the company has always been one of the things that people have always asked questions about Thermo. So can you talk us through the changes that are going on and the impact on the company, number one? And then how sustainable is the 14% tax rate and how should we think about that over the next few years?
I'll take the question. So obviously, we pay very close attention to tax regulations and changes there and those regulations across the world as well as domestically. And we have a very great tax team. Recently, the Treasury Department laid out kind of 2 new tax regulations, one very -- one of those regulations is very concentrated to reduce the impact -- the benefit of inversions, and that exposure simply don't apply to the company. The second set of regulations were targeted at limiting U.S. companies' ability to tax efficiently repatriate cash from overseas. And when I think about that impact from our company, our existing tax structures, which aren't impacted by these regulations, provide pretty substantial cash repatriation capacity in a very tax efficient way. So at this point, I don't see any material impact from the regulated changes on the company for the foreseeable future. So the bottom line is we're comfortable with the tax rate and the corporate tax planning strategies we have in place across the company. When I think about the tax rate going forward, we'll probably talk more about this at the Analyst Day. Just to remind you kind of the messaging from last year is the tax rate -- the earnings accrete going forward over and above the earnings we have to date generally come in at a higher marginal tax rate than the 14% that we have in place on average for the company. So absent any other changes in terms of our structuring, the tax rate will creep up slightly. We've done a pretty good job of making sure that doesn't happen over time. if we look back over the past 3 years, I think we've effectively navigated through that. Part of that comes from some structures that we can put in place with acquisitions that we do. But the rest of it really comes from just good management of our tax strategies and just thinking about just regulatory changes. So more to come at the Analyst Day, but that's kind of a recap on how we've seen it for the last couple of years."

And it's kind of a combination of larger type of restructurings where you're consolidating the footprint of the organization in terms of the manufacturing operations in the back office.

So the combination of all of that is kind of the continual set of efforts. So there's nothing -- no major shift in terms of the look of [ph] region plays that we're doing, the footprint optimization and the use of sourcing and pricing levers. Those are kind of continuing. But the one new thing this year, as I said on the last earnings call, is that we're looking to reinvest the benefit of the medical device tax into some longer-term projects. And one set of projects around the footprint and more complex footprint changes in terms of manufacturing and then being more efficient in our financial back office. Those projects are underway and they're progressing well. So I think it's just a continuum in terms of the impact of the PPI Business System, and then we're kind of stepping it up a little bit in terms of using the opportunity to reinvest in medical device tax."

One, on Affymetrix, can you maybe talk a little bit about how a little bit more how you're thinking of integrating that asset and what could drive upside to the accretion that you talked about? I know you distribute some products from Affymetrix. To me, it's always looked a little bit more like a product line. It seems like there could be a lot of G&A overlaps.

So John, we're really excited to have the business as part of Thermo Fisher and welcome our new colleagues.

So John, we're really excited to have the business as part of Thermo Fisher and welcome our new colleagues. And they're not only running the business well but actively looking at how do you maximize the impact with our customer base and the competitive position. I'd break it into 2 different themes. One is a product theme and one is a geographic theme. The geographic theme is quite easy, right? Where we'll be looking for upside is really the commercial reach around the world. Thermo Fisher has incredible reach and Affymetrix was a much narrower company. So that will help over time focusing on accelerating growth and capturing revenue synergies. And over time, we'll obviously drive to the upside to the most extent possible. From a product fit, the reason the acquisition is so compelling is it's really the way you framed it, which is -- it was a whole company, but really, it is 2 great product lines that fit so incredibly tightly with our Life Sciences Solutions business. And we're able to combine our flow cytometry and antibody businesses in the biosciences business which gives us a much stronger competitive position. And we're able to add the microarray technologies to our large genetic sciences business, which really puts us in a very unique position because we will be truly technology-agnostic for solving customers' problems because we will be the only company that has next-gen sequencing, Sanger Sequencing, microarrays and qPCR with leading positions across that array of technology. So the customer would say, ""Here's the challenge that I have,"" and we will give them the optimal workflow. And these are very complementary fits. So with good execution, we'll obviously focus on delivering what we committed to and then always looking for the upside. So from an accretion perspective, as we announced when we announced the deal in January, it was in the $0.10 in the first full year, which translates to basically $0.06 this year, $0.04 in Q1 of 2017. But as you know, as time unfolds, we'll be looking for opportunities to drive to the upside, and that's probably more of a '17 benefit than a '16 benefit."

So that business is good. From the consumables mix, it's pretty steady on good performance, right? Our channel business has done well. Our Life Sciences Solutions has done well. When I think about profitability, it's not a huge driver. We make a little bit more money on consumables for the self-manufactured portion, but embedded in there is the channel business. So as you know, we don't manage the mix that way. But generally, I'm not concerned by sort of the rates of growth in the businesses.

We had another great quarter with strong performance on the top and bottom lines. We have a proven growth strategy. Our team is executing well and we continue to strengthen our offering to help our customers meet their goals. Our results in Q2 contributed to a very good first half of the year. We're also successfully executing our capital deployment strategy. As you know, a big highlight in the quarter was our agreement to acquire FEI. We're really excited about the new opportunities this will bring, and I'll discuss that in more detail later in my remarks. 
As usual, I'll start by covering the Q2 financial highlights, give you a little color on our performance by end market and provide a recap of the quarter in the context of our growth strategy, then I'll wrap up with our revised guidance. 
Starting with the financials. Revenue in Q2 grew 6% to $4.54 billion. Adjusted operating income was up 9% and our adjusted operating margin increased 50 basis points to 22.8%. Last, but most important, we extended our long track record of delivering strong adjusted EPS growth with a 10% increase to $2.03 per share. So with another strong quarter behind us, we're in a great position at the halfway point of the year. As you know, the global economic environment remains uncertain, but we're using this as an opportunity to help our customers manage through it, and that will strengthen our competitive position and allow us to continue to gain share. 
Let me now turn to a high level view of our performance in the context of our key end markets. If you step back and look at the first half, our strong results were really a combination of good end markets in aggregate and very good execution. Looking specifically at Q2, we were pleased to see continued strong growth in pharma and biotech, which grew in the high-single digits. We're benefiting from both the underlying strength of this end market and our ability to successfully deliver our unique value proposition for these customers. Growth in our bioproduction business was particularly strong in Q2. In health care diagnostics, we grew at about the company average, highlighted by strong performance in our immunodiagnostics and next-generation sequencing businesses. In academic and government end markets, we continue to deliver low single-digit growth. And finally, we saw a continuation of low single-digit growth overall in industrial and applied. As we see for quite some -- quite a time, industrial markets remain soft and applied markets continue to perform well, with especially strong growth in China and our chromatography business globally. 
Now I'll cover some of our Q2 business highlights in the context of our growth strategy. As most of you know, we increase our capabilities for our customers and drive growth for our company by focusing on 3 strategic pillars, which are: high-impact innovation; scale in emerging markets; and delivering our unique customer value proposition to gain share. So let me start with innovation, where we participated in a number of major conferences in Q2, representing a broad cross-section of our customer base, from cancer research to bioproduction mass spectrometry and applied markets. They're all great opportunities for us to demonstrate our leadership and our commitment to our mission which is to enable our customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer. I use that as a framework to cover a few of the highlights. 
First, healthier. We exhibited our leading offering for bioproduction customers at Interfax. In addition to our expanded line of single-use containers, we featured new products from our recent acquisition of ASI such as the impulse single-use mixing system for biotherapeutics. We continue to benefit from strong demand for these technologies as our customers rapidly adopt single use technology for the production of biologics and vaccines. At ASMS, we launched our new Q Exactive biopharma mass spectrometer, which we designed specifically to help pharma and biotech customers more efficiently discover and develop new drugs. As these systems become more powerful and data much more plentiful, customers need to better track, manage and share their results as well as connect and monitor their instruments. We ramped up our efforts to address these rapidly changing needs and also launched a suite of new software and cloud-based solutions at ASMS to support a range of applications. 
So back to our mission. In terms of enabling a cleaner world, the big event for applied markets in the quarter was Analytica, which is held in Europe. Sustainability is a special important to these customers and a key area of focus for us as well. We feature a range of laboratory equipment designed for a cleaner lab including our new TSX ultra-low temperature freezers that use natural refrigerants and reduce energy consumption. We also feature biosafety cabinets that requires 75% less energy to operate. 
Last, a good example of safer is that our Gemini hand-held chemical analyzer won the 2016 Edison Award for forensics and security. To remind you, Gemini was the first instrument to integrate Raman and FT-IR spectroscopy in a handheld device that can be used by hazmat teams, first responders and military personnel in the field. These are just some of the many examples of how we fulfill our mission by helping our customers meet their goals. 
Turning to emerging markets, our second pillar of growth. We had another strong quarter in these geographic regions with standout results in China, South Korea, India and Southeast Asia. To mention a couple of highlights, China continues to be a great market for us and we delivered another strong quarter with growth in the mid teens. Our businesses across the company continue to benefit from growth in applied markets such as environmental and food safety as well as Life Sciences, which is expanding into new fields like precision medicine. In June, we announced our partnership with the West China Hospital of Sichuan University to develop a joint platform for advancing research in precision medicine. This is one of the largest single-site hospitals in the world and we're looking forward to helping our customers there improve the quality of pathology research and clinical diagnostics. This exciting opportunity underscores the importance of precision medicine as a global initiative and one that was identified as a key priority in China's new 5-year plan. 
In other emerging markets, robust growth in South Korea was driven by our leading presence in biopharma. It's also great to see our investments in India paying off with another strong quarter of growth. We had strong performance in Southeast Asia as well and I was traveling there last month and visited our regional headquarter in Singapore. We continue to expand our center of excellence in Singapore, which now supports manufacturing of our GC/MS products in addition to our Life Sciences Solutions instrumentation. This site is a very good example of how we're leveraging our scale to better serve our customers while improving the overall cost structure of our company. 
I'll make one last comment relative to the third growth pillar of our growth strategy, which is our unique customer value proposition. I mentioned precision medicine in my recap of China and want to give you another example of our efforts here because it illustrates how our scale and depth uniquely position us to play a key role. Precision medicine involves using a patient's biological information down to the molecular level to more effectively treat their disease. Cancer is a natural area of focus and this information is being used to diagnose and treat a patient's specific type of tumor. We had significant presence at the American Association for Cancer Research where we feature a range of technologies suited to this important work including CRISPR and the siRNA libraries, the Ion S5 and S5 XL next-generation sequencing systems as well as our leading mass spectrometry platforms. 
Our scientists also led numerous sessions on this topic, covering solutions ranging from next-gen sequencing to liquid biopsy, qPCR-based pharmacogenomics and targeted mass spectrometry. It's clear that our customers are committed to finding better ways to treat this terrible disease and our unmatched capabilities can help them accelerate their progress. 
Let me switch topics now and turn to capital deployment. We had big news on that front late May committing $4.2 billion to acquire FEI. This is a really exciting development given FEI's unique strategic fit with our company and specifically within Analytical Instruments. 
As you know, we have an exceptional track record of developing Orbitrap mass spectrometry for protein identification and characterization and has been the foundation of our highly successful franchise. FEI's Cryo-EM system is also being used in protein research specifically for the structural analysis of proteins. By combining these technologies to one company, we'll be in the best position to help our customers capitalize on the rapid growth and structural biology. While FEI has made progress moving more into life science applications, our unmatched presence in the industry will accelerate adoption with these customers. 
Since the announcement, I've had a chance to interact with quite a few of our future FEI colleagues and it reinforces to me what a great business this is. It's well managed, has excellent technologies and a talented and enthusiastic team. It's going to be a great addition to our Analytical Instruments segment and a key growth driver for our company. 
Let me also add that we're making good progress towards closing the transaction. We now expect to close by the end of this year versus our initial estimate of early 2017. The integration for both companies are in place, planning is underway and we're very confident in our ability to achieve the $80 million of total synergies we laid out when we announced the transaction. 
Now let me give you a quick update on our guidance for 2016. As you saw in our press release, we're updating our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance for the year. As usual, Stephen will cover the details and assumptions, but in summary, we're revising guidance based on our strong operating performance in the first half as well as for the more unfavorable foreign exchange environment. We now expect revenue for the year to be in the range of $17.84 billion to $18.0 billion. This would result in 5% to 6% growth over 2015, in line with our previous guidance. We are raising our adjusted EPS guidance to a new range of $8.07 to $8.20 which is 9% to 11% increase year-over-year. 
Before I turn the call over to Stephen, let me summarize my remarks with a couple of takeaways. We had another strong quarter of financial performance which contributed to a great first half. We're executing on our growth strategy and complementing that with strategic acquisitions like FEI. We're in an excellent position at the halfway point and on track to achieve our goals for the year. 
With that, I'll now hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen?"

I'll begin with an overview of our second quarter financial performance for the total company, then I'll provide some color on our 4 segments and conclude with an updated 2016 guidance. 
So starting with the overall financial performance for Q2. As you saw in our press release, we grew adjusted EPS by 10% to $2.03. GAAP EPS was $1.30, up 2% from Q2 last year. On the top line, our reported revenue grew 6% year-over-year. Q2 reported revenue includes 4% organic growth, 3% growth from acquisitions. Our currency translation decreased revenues slightly. Please note the components of the Q2 change [indiscernible] some due to rounding. 
Given the FX volatility, I thought it'd be helpful to provide a little more color on the impact of foreign exchange in Q2. The revenue impact from the -- was a headwind of $16 million. But due to the mix of currency change of $16 million but due to the mix and currency changes, the impact to adjusted resulting in a slight benefit to margins for the quarter and a $0.01 positive impact on adjusted earnings per share. At the very end of the quarter, rates changed significantly and we're expecting foreign exchange headwinds on both revenue and adjusted operating income for the remainder of the year. I'll provide more detail on this later when I go to the assumptions for our updated guidance. 
Looking at that growth by geography in Q2. Both North America and Europe grew in the low-single digits. Asia Pacific grew in the low double digits with continued strong momentum in China with growth in South Korea, Southeast Asia and India. And the rest of the world declined to mid-single digits. 
Turning to our operational performance. Q2 adjusted operating income increased 9% and adjusted operating margin was 22.8%, up 50 basis points from Q2 of last year. 
Looking at the components of our adjusted operating margin performance in Q2, we achieved good margin expansion from our organic growth driven by robust contributions from our PPI Business System price and volume. As we expected, Affymetrix was a 30 basis point headwind on margins in Q2, but this was offset by the FX tailwind that I just mentioned. 
Moving on to the details of the P&L. Total company adjusted gross margin came in at 48.6% in Q2, up 60 basis points from the prior year. The increase in adjusted gross margin was primarily due to strong productivity, acquisitions and the FX tailwind partially offset by unfavorable business mix. Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 21.8% of revenue, which is up 10 basis points versus Q2 2015 and R&D expense came in at 4% of revenue, down 10 basis points versus Q2 last year. And R&D as a percent of our manufacturing revenue in the quarter was 6.2%. 
Looking at our results below the line, net interest expense was $106 million, up $11 million from Q2 last year, mainly as a result of financing related to capital deployment activities during the quarter. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 13.5% which is 50 basis points lower than last year as a result of our tax planning initiatives. And average diluted shares in the quarter were 396.7 million, down 4.8 million year-over-year mainly as a result of the share buybacks we completed in Q1 partially offset by stock option dilution. 
Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Cash flow from continuing operations for the first half of the year was $1.2 billion and free cash flow was $970 million after deducting net capital expenditures of $210 million. This is $310 million higher than the first half free cash flow in 2015. We ended the quarter with $665 million in cash and investments, and in Q2, we paid $60 million of dividends. As you know, we were very active in deploying capital during the first half of this year. We've acquired Affymetrix for $1.3 billion, executed $1 billion of share buybacks in Q1 and distributed about $120 million in shareholder dividends for a total of $2.4 billion in the first half of the year. In addition, we signed an agreement to acquire FEI netting an additional $4.2 billion of capital. 
Our total debt at the end of Q2 was $14.1 billion, down $900 million sequentially from Q1 as a result of paying down short-term debt. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3.2x total debt to adjusted EBITDA, down from 3.5x at the end of Q1. 
Now wrapping up my comments in our total company performance, ROIC continues to improve. Our trailing 12 months adjusted ROIC at the end of Q2 was 9.8%, up 20 basis points sequentially from Q1. 
So with that, I'll now provide you with some color on the performance of our 4 business segments. Starting with the Life Sciences Solutions segment, reported revenue increased 13% in Q2 and organic revenue growth was 7%. In the quarter, we continue to see very strong momentum in our bioproduction business and had good growth in our next-gen sequencing and bioscience businesses. Q2 adjusted operating income in Life Science Solutions increased 14% and adjusted operating margin was 28.9%, up 30 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted operating margin was positively impacted by strong productivity and volume pull-through, partially offset by unfavorable business mix, acquisitions and strategic investments. 
In the Analytical Instruments segment, reported revenue increased 2% in Q2 and organic revenue growth was 3%. In the quarter, we had strong growth contributions from our chromatography and mass spec and our environmental instruments businesses, partially offset by continued weakness in some of our industrial markets. Q2 adjusted operating income in Analytical Instruments increased 4% and adjusted operating margin was 18.3%, up 30 basis points year-over-year. Very strong productivity, volume leverage and favorable FX were partially offset by unfavorable business mix and strategic investments. 
Turning to the Specialty Diagnostics segment. In Q2, reported and organic revenue both grew 4%. We saw good growth in the segment led by the immunodiagnostics business. Adjusted operating income increased 5% in Q2 and adjusted operating margin was 27.9%, up 10 basis points from the prior year. Adjusted operating margin was driven by productivity, volume leverage and foreign exchange, offset partly by the impact of strategic investments and unfavorable business mix. 
And finally, in the Lab Products and Services segments, Q2 reported revenue increased 6% and organic revenue growth was 5%. We had good growth across all businesses in the segments. Adjusted operating income in the segment increased 8% and adjusted operating margin was 15.5%, up 10 basis points from the prior year. Adjusted operating margin expansion in the quarter was driven by productivity and volume pull-through, with partial offsets from strategic investments and unfavorable business mix. 
Now I'll review the detail of our full year 2016 guidance. There are 2 primary changes from our previous guidance. First, we're increasing our guidance based on strong operational performance; and second, we're factoring in the recent changes in foreign exchange rates. And I'll take you through each of these in detail. So first is the increase in our operational performance outlook. With a good first half behind us, we're increasing our expected organic growth for the full year from about 4% to about 4.5%. This increases revenue at the midpoint by $60 million from our previous guidance. The stronger organic growth in outlook results in additional 3.5 cents of adjusted earnings per share at the midpoint. Given that we're 1 quarter further in the year, we're also narrowing the range of our revenue guidance from $180 million to $160 million and narrowing our adjusted EPS range from $0.14 to $0.13. 
The second change relates to the impact of FX, and as I'm sure you're all aware, rates have moved significantly in the past several weeks. Given the continued uncertainty around FX rates, we've once again taken a conservative approach to arrive at the FX impact for the year. As a result, the change in FX reduces our revenue guidance for the year by an additional $90 million and reduces our adjusted earnings per share guidance by an additional $0.02. Our 2016 guidance now assumes the year-over-year FX headwind of $180 million of revenue or 1.1%, $42 million of adjusted operating income and $0.10 of adjusted earnings per share. In terms of phasing of the $0.10 during the year, we've already incurred $0.05 of the headwind year-to-date and we're assuming $0.03 headwind in Q3 and $0.02 in Q4. 
So to sum all this up, the revised 2016 revenue guidance range is $17.84 billion to $18.0 billion, which represent 5% to 6% growth versus 2015, similar to our previous guidance. At the midpoint, revenue is increasing $60 million due to the improved operational performance outlook and decreasing $90 million for the additional foreign exchange headwinds. In terms of adjusted earnings per share, our increased 2016 guidance range is now $8.07 to $8.20 with a midpoint of 8 dollars 13.5 cents. This represents growth of 9% to 11% versus 2015 also consistent with our previous guidance. Excluding the FX impact, this would represent adjusted earnings per share growth of 10% to 12% for the year. The midpoint of adjusted earnings per share is increasing 1.5 cents with the additional $0.02 to foreign exchange headwinds being more than offset by the 3.5 cents of improved operational performance. And we're now expecting 60 to 70 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion year-over-year. This is slightly improved from our previous guidance of 50 to 70 basis points, primarily as a result of a change in FX. 
So given the days impact on our 2016 fiscal calendar, I thought it'd also be helpful to add some more color around phasing. As a reminder, our Q1 had 4 more days and our Q4 will have 4 less days in the equivalent quarters in 2015. In Q1 2016, our reported organic growth was 10% and we estimate the days adjusted organic growth in that quarter was approximately 5%. As we look to Q4, given that days will be a headwind in the quarter, we're expecting reported organic growth in Q4 to be essentially flat, consistent with our previous guidance. So days had a positive impact on Q1 and will have a corresponding negative impact on Q4 organic growth. Overall for the year, there's no impact. 
One final comment about the calendar. As I mentioned on previous calls, in Q4, we'll have the benefit of 4 less days of costs, which we expect to significantly benefit our adjusted operating margin and earnings in the quarter. As you think about the phasing of our adjusted earnings per share in the second half of the year, at the midpoints, we currently view approximately 55% being realized in Q4. 
A few of the details behind the revised 2016 guidance. Acquisitions are still expected to contribute about 2% to our reported revenue growth in 2016 and FX is expected to be about a 1% headwind. We continue to expect net interest expense to be about $390 million. We're forecasting our adjusted income tax rate to be about 14%, no change from our previous guidance. In terms of capital deployment, we're still assuming we will return approximately $240 million of capital to shareholders through dividends, and that guidance does not include any future acquisitions, divestitures or stock buybacks. 
Full year average diluted shares are estimated to be about 398 million, slightly lower than our previous guidance, and we're expecting net capital expenditure to be approximately $440 million, consistent with previous guidance. And finally, we're expecting about $2.72 billion of free cash flow for the full year 2016. This is also consistent with our previous guidance. As always, in interpreting the revenue and adjusted EPS guidance ranges, you should focus on the midpoint as the most likely view of how we see the results playing out. 
So in summary, we delivered another strong quarter in Q2, which positions us well at the halfway point to achieve our 2016 financial goals. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Ken."

Towards the second part of your question, more of the broader Thermo Fisher industrial and applied exposure, about 20% of our revenue is industrial and applied. Roughly half of that is applied and half is industrial. Applied markets continue to be strong. As I mentioned in my remarks, China continues to be very good for us. In the industrial markets, we really haven't seen any inflection point. It's really been continued solid conditions which we've had for the last few years. And then in terms of Europe and Brexit, really just given how late the U.K. announcements came in the quarter really had no impact in terms of the revenue outlook.

So I think back over various cycle, they become still small relative to U.S. and Western Europe but more meaningful. So that's clearly, a positive and we've seen good growth there. India has been a good growth drivers as well. So it's encouraging from kind of longevity. When you look at what's going on, I think the single biggest driver is that the quality of the research and new entities getting approved, right, and the funding ultimately is in Western Europe and the U.S. And as long as drugs are getting through to the market and demand is strong there, they'll be funding that's very robust in R&D. So it's less to me cyclical, then right now, they're in the sweet spot of the science turning into drugs that's turning into demand for our product, so we feel good about it. And the fact, even in what I think is very good end markets, there's an efficiency driver amongst that customer base, whether it's a small biotech or large pharma, and that plays to our sweet spot for sure, right? We see it in the results across quarter in quarter out with a very strong performance in the biopharma customer set for us. So we feel very well positioned in the good end market."

When I think about it, many of you have heard me say this, generally, I don't like to have investors have to really think about Thermo Fisher in terms of any of the nuances because it's our job to manage through the various puts and takes in the economy. We executed very well. Effectively, we were able to raise our organic growth outlook for the full year based on the half. We don't typically raise organic growth guidance during the course of the year. We typically are more focused on the EPS, so we did both, which I think is great. When you look at the geographic strength, we went out of the way to highlight the strength in 4 different end markets in Asia Pacific. That really is doing very well, which bodes well for the second half, given the fact that this there's clearly some volatility in Europe, uncertainty in Europe that we don't know -- nobody knows exactly how that will play out. But given how the U.S. is doing, and given how Asia Pacific is doing, we're very well positioned to have an outstanding year. Capital deployment has gone well. Margins were good. So I like the fact that there's really [indiscernible] nuances. It's just a very clean ahead of expectations quarter and our ability to offset the FX headwinds that are there and raise the guidance. And then finally, as Stephen said in his remarks, we are a bit conservative on the outlook on foreign exchange in our guidance.

We had another great quarter with strong performance on the top and bottom line. We have a proven growth strategy. Our team is executing well, and we continue to strengthen our offering to help our customers meet their goals. Our results in Q2 contributed to a very good first half of the year. We're also successfully executing our capital deployment strategy. As you know, a big highlight in the quarter was our agreement to acquire FEI. We're really excited about the new opportunities this will bring, and I'll discuss that in more detail later in my remarks. 
As usual, I'll start by covering the Q2 financial highlights, give you a little color on our performance by end market and provide a recap of the quarter in the context of our growth strategy. Then I'll wrap up with our revised guidance. 
Starting with the financials. Revenue in Q2 grew 6% to $4.54 billion. Adjusted operating income was up 9%, and our adjusted operating margin increased 50 basis points to 22.8%. Last but most important, we extended our long track record of delivering strong adjusted EPS growth with a 10% increase to $2.03 per share. So with another strong quarter behind us, we're in a great position at the halfway point of the year.  As you know, the global economic environment remains uncertain, but we're using this as an opportunity to help our customers manage through it. And that will strengthen our competitive position and allow us to continue to gain share. 
Let me now turn to a high-level view of our performance in the context of our key end markets. If you step back and look at the first half, our strong results were really a combination of good end markets in aggregate and very good execution. Looking specifically at Q2, we were pleased to see continued strong growth in pharma and biotech, which grew in the high single digits. We're benefiting from both the underlying strength of this end market and our ability to successfully deliver our unique value proposition for these customers. Growth in our bioproduction business was particularly strong in Q2. 
In healthcare diagnostics, we grew at about the company average, highlighted by strong performance in our immunodiagnostics and next-generation sequencing businesses. In academic and government end markets, we continue to deliver low single-digit growth. And finally, we saw a continuation of low single-digit growth overall in industrial and applied. As we see for quite some -- quite a time, industrial markets remain soft and applied markets continue to perform well with especially strong growth in China and our chromatography business globally. 
Now I'll cover some of our Q2 business highlights in the context of our growth strategy. As most of you know, we increase our capabilities for our customers and drive growth for our company by focusing on 3 strategic pillars, which are: high-impact innovation, scale in emerging markets and delivering our unique customer value proposition to gain share. 
So let me start with innovation, where we participated in a number of major conferences in Q2, representing a broad cross section of our customer base, from cancer research to bioproduction, mass spectrometry and applied markets. They're all great opportunities for us to demonstrate our leadership and our commitment to our mission, which is to enable our customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer. I'll use that as a framework to cover a few of the highlights. 
First, healthier. We exhibited our leading offering for bioproduction customers at INTERPHEX. In addition to our expanded line of single-use containers, we featured new products from our recent acquisition of ASI, such as the imPULSE single-use mixing system for biotherapeutics. We continue to benefit from strong demand for these technologies as our customers rapidly adopt single-use technology for the production of biologics and vaccines. At ASMS, we launched our new Q Exactive biopharma mass spectrometer, which we designed specifically to help pharma and biotech customers more efficiently discover and develop new drugs. As these systems become more powerful and data much more plentiful, customers need to better track, manage and share their results as well as connect and monitor their instruments. We ramped up our efforts to address these rapidly changing needs and also launched a suite of new software and cloud-based solutions at ASMS to support a range of applications. 
So back to our mission. In terms of enabling a cleaner world, the big event for applied markets in the quarter was Analytica, which is held in Europe. Sustainability is especially important to these customers and a key area of focus for us as well. We feature a range of laboratory equipment designed for a cleaner lab, including our new TSX ultra-low temperature freezers that use natural refrigerants and reduce energy consumption. We also featured biosafety cabinets that require 75% less energy to operate. 
Last, a good example of safer is that our Gemini hand-held chemical analyzer won the 2016 Edison Award for forensics and security. To remind you, Gemini was the first instrument to integrate Raman and FTIR spectroscopy in a handheld device that can be used by hazmat teams, first responders and military personnel in the field. These are just some of the many examples of how we fulfill our mission by helping our customers meet their goals. 
Turning to emerging markets, our second pillar of growth. We had another strong quarter in these geographic regions with standout results in China, South Korea, India and Southeast Asia. To mention a couple of highlights, China continues to be a great market for us, and we delivered another strong quarter with growth in the mid-teens. Our businesses across the company continue to benefit from growth in applied markets, such as environmental and food safety as well as life sciences, which is expanding into new fields like precision medicine. 
In June, we announced our partnership with the West China Hospital of Sichuan University to develop a joint platform for advancing research in precision medicine. This is one of the largest single-site hospitals in the world, and we're looking forward to helping our customers there improve the quality of pathology research and clinical diagnostics. This exciting opportunity underscores the importance of precision medicine as a global initiative and one that was identified as a key priority in China's new 5-year plan. 
In other emerging markets, robust growth in South Korea was driven by our leading presence in biopharma. It's also great to see our investments in India paying off with another strong quarter of growth. We had strong performance in Southeast Asia as well, and I was traveling there last month and visited our regional headquarters in Singapore. We continue to expand our center of excellence in Singapore, which now supports manufacturing of our GC/MS products, in addition to our Life Sciences Solutions instrumentation. This site is a very good example of how we're leveraging our scale to better serve our customers while improving the overall cost structure of our company. 
I'll make one last comment relative to the third growth pillar of our growth strategy, which is our unique customer value proposition. I mentioned precision medicine in my recap of China and want to give you another example of our efforts here because it illustrates how our scale and depth uniquely position us to play a key role. Precision medicine involves using a patient's biological information down to the molecular level to more effectively treat their disease. Cancer is a natural area of focus, and this information is being used to diagnose and treat a patient's specific type of tumor. We had a significant presence at the American Association for Cancer Research, where we featured a range of technologies suited to this important work, including CRISPR and the siRNA Libraries, the Ion S5 and S5 XL next-generation sequencing systems as well as our leading mass spectrometry platforms. 
Our scientists also led numerous sessions on this topic, covering solutions ranging from next-gen sequencing to liquid biopsy, qPCR-based pharmacogenomics and targeted mass spectrometry. It's clear that our customers are committed to finding better ways to treat this terrible disease, and our unmatched capabilities can help them accelerate their progress. 
Let me switch topics now and turn to capital deployment. We had big news on that front in late May, committing $4.2 billion to acquire FEI. This is a really exciting development given FEI's unique strategic fit with our company and specifically within analytical instruments. As you know, we have an exceptional track record of developing Orbitrap mass spectrometry for protein identification and characterization and has been the foundation of our highly successful franchise. FEI's Cryo-EM system is also being used in protein research, specifically for the structural analysis of proteins. By combining these technologies in one company, we'll be in the best position to help our customers capitalize on the rapid growth in structural biology. While FEI has made progress moving more into life science applications, our unmatched presence in the industry will accelerate adoption with these customers. 
Since the announcement, I've had a chance to interact with quite a few of our future FEI colleagues, and it reinforces to me what a great business this is. It's well managed, has excellent technologies and a talented and enthusiastic team. It's going to be a great addition to our Analytical Instruments Segment and a key growth driver for our company. Let me also add that we're making good progress towards closing the transaction. We now expect to close by the end of this year versus our initial estimate of early 2017. The integration for both companies are in place, planning is underway and we're very confident in our ability to achieve the $80 million of total synergies we laid out when we announced the transaction. 
Now let me give you a quick update on our guidance for 2016. As you saw in our press release, we're updating our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance for the year. As usual, Stephen will cover the details and assumptions, but in summary, we're revising guidance based on our strong operating performance in the first half as well as for the more unfavorable foreign exchange environment. We now expect revenue for the year to be in the range of $17.84 billion to $18.0 billion. This would result in 5% to 6% growth over 2015, in line with our previous guidance. We are raising our adjusted EPS guidance to a new range of $8.07 to $8.20, which is 9% to 11% increase year-over-year. 
Before I turn the call over to Stephen, let me summarize my remarks with a couple of takeaways. We had another strong quarter of financial performance which contributed to a great first half. We're executing our growth strategy and complementing that with strategic acquisitions like FEI. We're in an excellent position at the halfway point and on track to achieve our goals for the year. 
With that, I'll now hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen?"
97023,371819233,1015429,"Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with an overview of our second quarter financial performance for the total company, then I'll provide some color on our 4 segments and conclude with an updated 2016 guidance. So starting with the over",2007,"Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with an overview of our second quarter financial performance for the total company, then I'll provide some color on our 4 segments and conclude with an updated 2016 guidance. 
So starting with the overall financial performance for Q2. As you saw in our press release, we grew adjusted EPS by 10% to $2.03. GAAP EPS was $1.30, up 2% from Q2 last year. On the top line, our reported revenue grew 6% year-over-year. Q2 reported revenue includes 4% organic growth, 3% growth from acquisitions. Our currency translation decreased revenues slightly. Please note the components of the Q2 change did not sum due to rounding. 
Given the FX volatility, I thought it'd be helpful to provide a little more color on the impact of foreign exchange in Q2. The revenue impact from the -- was a headwind of $16 million. But due to the mix of currency changes the impact to adjusted operating income was actually a $4 million tailwind, resulting in a slight benefit to margins for the quarter and a $0.01 positive impact on adjusted earnings per share. At the very end of the quarter, rates changed significantly, and we're expecting foreign exchange headwinds on both revenue and adjusted operating income for the remainder of the year. I'll provide more detail on this later when I go to the assumptions for our updated guidance. 
Looking at that growth by geography in Q2. Both North America and Europe grew in the low single digits. Asia Pacific grew in the low double digits with continued strong momentum in China, good growth in South Korea, Southeast Asia and India. And the rest of the world declined to mid-single digits. 
Turning to our operational performance. Q2 adjusted operating income increased 9% and adjusted operating margin was 22.8%, up 50 basis points from Q2 of last year. Looking at the components of our adjusted operating margin performance in Q2, we achieved good margin expansion from our organic growth, driven by robust contributions from our PPI Business System, price and volume. As we expected, Affymetrix was a 30 basis point headwind on margins in Q2, but this was offset by the FX tailwind that I just mentioned. 
Moving on to the details of the P&L. Total company adjusted gross margin came in at 48.6% in Q2, up 60 basis points from the prior year. The increase in adjusted gross margin was primarily due to strong productivity, acquisitions and the FX tailwind, partially offset by unfavorable business mix. Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 21.8% of revenue, which is up 10 basis points versus Q2 2015. And R&D expense came in at 4% of revenue, down 10 basis points versus Q2 last year. And R&D as a percent of our manufacturing revenue in the quarter was 6.2%. 
Looking at our results below the line, net interest expense was $106 million, up $11 million from Q2 last year, mainly as a result of financing related to capital deployment activities during the quarter. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 13.5% which is 50 basis points lower than last year as a result of our tax-planning initiatives. And average diluted shares in the quarter were 396.7 million, down 4.8 million year-over-year, mainly as a result of the share buybacks we completed in Q1, partially offset by stock option dilution. 
Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Cash flow from continuing operations for the first half of the year was $1.2 billion, and free cash flow was $970 million after deducting net capital expenditures of $210 million. This is $310 million higher than the first half free cash flow in 2015. We ended the quarter with $665 million in cash and investments. And in Q2, we paid $60 million of dividends. As you know, we were very active in deploying capital during the first half of this year. We've acquired Affymetrix for $1.3 billion, executed $1 billion of share buybacks in Q1 and distributed about $120 million in shareholder dividends for a total of $2.4 billion in the first half of the year. In addition, we signed an agreement to acquire FEI, netting an additional $4.2 billion of capital. 
Our total debt at the end of Q2 was $14.1 billion, down $900 million sequentially from Q1 as a result of paying down short-term debt. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3.2x total debt to adjusted EBITDA, down from 3.5x at the end of Q1. 
Now wrapping up my comments in our total company performance, ROIC continues to improve. Our trailing 12 months adjusted ROIC at the end of Q2 was 9.8%, up 20 basis points sequentially from Q1. 
So with that, I'll now provide you with some color on the performance of our 4 business segments. Starting with the Life Sciences Solutions Segment, reported revenue increased 13% in Q2, and organic revenue growth was 7%. In the quarter, we continued to see very strong momentum in our bioproduction business and had good growth in our next-gen sequencing and bioscience businesses. Q2 adjusted operating income in Life Sciences Solutions increased 14%, and adjusted operating margin was 28.9%, up 30 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted operating margin was positively impacted by strong productivity and volume pull-through, partially offset by unfavorable business mix, acquisitions and strategic investments. 
In the Analytical Instruments Segment, reported revenue increased 2% in Q2, and organic revenue growth was 3%. In the quarter, we had strong growth contributions from our chromatography and mass spec and our environmental instruments businesses, partially offset by continued weakness in some of our industrial markets. Q2 adjusted operating income in Analytical Instruments increased 4%, and adjusted operating margin was 18.3%, up 30 basis points year-over-year. Very strong productivity, volume leverage and favorable FX were partially offset by unfavorable business mix and strategic investments. 
Turning to the Specialty Diagnostics Segment. In Q2, reported and organic revenue both grew 4%. We saw good growth in the segment led by the immunodiagnostics business. Adjusted operating income increased 5% in Q2, and adjusted operating margin was 27.9%, up 10 basis points from the prior year. Adjusted operating margin was driven by productivity, volume leverage and foreign exchange, offset partly by the impact of strategic investments and unfavorable business mix. 
And finally, in the Lab Products and Services Segment, Q2 reported revenue increased to 6%, and organic revenue growth was 5%. We had good growth across all businesses in the segment. Adjusted operating income in the segment increased 8%, and adjusted operating margin was 15.5%, up 10 basis points from the prior year. Adjusted operating margin expansion in the quarter was driven by productivity and volume pull-through with partial offsets from strategic investments and unfavorable business mix. 
Now I'll review the details of our full year 2016 guidance. There are 2 primary changes from our previous guidance. First, we're increasing our guidance based on strong operational performance; and second, we're factoring in the recent changes in foreign exchange rates. And I'll take you through each of these in detail. So first is the increase in our operational performance outlook. With a good first half behind us, we're increasing our expected organic growth for the full year from about 4% to about 4.5%. This increases revenue at the midpoint by $60 million from our previous guidance. The stronger organic growth at outlook results in additional $0.035 of adjusted earnings per share at the midpoint. Given that we're one quarter further in the year, we're also narrowing the range of our revenue guidance from $180 million to $160 million and narrowing our adjusted EPS range from $0.14 to $0.13. 
The second change relates to the impact of FX. And as I'm sure you're all aware, rates have moved significantly in the past several weeks. Given the continued uncertainty around FX rates, we have once again taken a conservative approach to arrive at the FX impact for the year. As a result, the change in FX reduces our revenue guidance for the year by an additional $90 million and reduces our adjusted earnings per share guidance by an additional $0.02. Our 2016 guidance now assumes the year-over-year FX headwind of $180 million of revenue or 1.1%, $42 million of adjusted operating income and $0.10 of adjusted earnings per share. In terms of phasing of the $0.10 during the year, we've already incurred $0.05 of the headwind year-to-date, and we're assuming $0.03 headwind in Q3 and $0.02 in Q4. 
So to sum all this up, the revised 2016 revenue guidance range is $17.84 billion to $18.0 billion, which represent 5% to 6% growth versus 2015, similar to our previous guidance. At the midpoint, revenue is increasing $60 million due to the improved operational performance outlook and decreasing $90 million for the additional foreign exchange headwind. In terms of adjusted earnings per share, our increased 2016 guidance range is now $8.07 to $8.20 with a midpoint of $8.135. This represents growth of 9% to 11% versus 2015, also consistent with our previous guidance. Excluding the FX impact, this would represent adjusted earnings per share growth of 10% to 12% for the year. The midpoint of adjusted earnings per share is increasing $0.015 with the additional $0.02 of foreign exchange headwind being more than offset by the $0.035 of improved operational performance. And we're now expecting 60 to 70 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion year-over-year. This is slightly improved from our previous guidance of 50 to 70 basis points, primarily as a result of a change in FX. 
So given the days impact on our 2016 fiscal calendar, I thought it'd also be helpful to add some more color around phasing. As a reminder, our Q1 had 4 more days, and our Q4 will have 4 less days in the equivalent quarters in 2015. In Q1 2016, our reported organic growth was 10%, and we estimate the days adjusted organic growth in that quarter was approximately 5%. As we look to Q4, given that the days will be a headwind in that quarter, we're expecting reported organic growth in Q4 to be essentially flat, consistent with our previous guidance. So days had a positive impact on Q1 and will have a corresponding negative impact on Q4 organic growth. Overall for the year, there is no impact. 
One final comment about the calendar. As I mentioned on previous calls, in Q4, we'll have the benefit of 4 less days of costs, which we will expect to significantly benefit our adjusted operating margin and earnings in the quarter. So as you think about the phasing of our adjusted earnings per share in the second half of the year, at the midpoint, we currently view approximately 55% being realized in Q4. 
A few of the details behind the revised 2016 guidance. Acquisitions are still expected to contribute about 2% to our reported revenue growth in 2016, and FX is expected to be about a 1% headwind. We continue to expect net interest expense to be about $390 million. We're forecasting our adjusted income tax rate to be about 14%, no change from our previous guidance. In terms of capital deployment, we're still assuming we will return approximately $240 million of capital to shareholders through dividends, and that guidance does not include any future acquisitions, divestitures or stock buybacks. Full year average diluted shares are estimated to be about 398 million, slightly lower than our previous guidance. And we're expecting net capital expenditure to be approximately $440 million, consistent with previous guidance. And finally, we're expecting about $2.72 billion of free cash flow for the full year 2016. This is also consistent with our previous guidance. As always, in interpreting the revenue and adjusted EPS guidance ranges, you should focus on the midpoint as the most likely view of how we see the results playing out. 
So in summary, we delivered another strong quarter in Q2 which positions us well at the halfway point to achieve our 2016 financial goals. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Ken."

Chromo mass spec continues to grow high single digits and grew that in the quarter. Our chemical analysis, which is really the industrially related business, is declined in the mid-single digits. So when you kind of look at it versus the various kind of sub peers, chromo mass spec continues to do extraordinary well in the marketplace, and chemical analysis is operating like most of the peers that are very heavily industrially oriented. Towards the second part of your question, more of the broader Thermo Fisher industrial and applied exposure, about 20% of our revenue is industrial and applied. Roughly half of that is applied and half is industrial. Applied markets continue to be strong. As I mentioned in my remarks, China continues to be very good for us. In the industrial markets, we really haven't seen any inflection point. It's really been continued solid conditions, which we've had for the last few years. And then in terms of Europe and Brexit, really just given how late the U.K. announcements came in the quarter really had no impact in terms of the revenue outlook. It obviously had a lot of movement in volatility, and there might have been a little conservatism in the U.K. spend itself but nothing significant in the quarter."

While we don't manage our business by the end markets we manage by our businesses, what you see is in that particular end market, applied markets because of the importance of environmental protection and food safety is much larger as a percent of the total mix than the other markets around the world. So those markets are good. China continues to deliver very strong growth, and bookings once again exceeded revenue in the quarter, and that bodes well for the short term as well."

So I think back over various cycles, they become still small relative to the U.S. and Western Europe but more meaningful. So that's clearly a positive, and we've seen good growth there. India has been a good growth driver as well, so those are encouraging from kind of longevity. When you look at what's going on, I think the single biggest driver is that the quality of the research and new entities getting approved, right, and -- because the funding ultimately is Western Europe and the U.S. And as long as drugs are getting through to the market and demand is strong there, they'll be funding that's very robust in R&D. So it's less to me cyclical. Then right now, they're in the sweet spot of the science, turning into drugs that's turning into demand for our product, so we feel good about it. And the fact, even in what I think is very good end markets, there's an efficiency driver amongst that customer base, whether it's small biotech or large pharma, and that plays to our sweet spot for sure, right? We see it in the results across quarter in to quarter out with a very strong performance in the biopharma customer set for us, so we feel very well positioned in a good end market."

Our Attune flow cytometer has good adoption. The revenue synergies there should come out very strong, so all of that's very positive. The microarray business is softer than we had seen before. And really what's going on in microarrays is that before the close of the transaction, the primary competitor in microarrays really dramatically dropped price. And Affymetrix as an independent company chose not to follow suit. So in Q2, we focus the R&D and marketing teams on addressing that competitive dynamic. And in early July, you may have noticed that we launched the Axiom Precision Medicine Research Array, and that's a broad-based genotyping array that's very valuable in providing interesting information around health questions, and we're offering that at a very attractive price point.

We don't typically raise organic growth guidance during the course of the year. We typically are more focused on the EPS, so we did both, so which is -- I think is great. When you look at the geographic strength, we went out of the way to highlight the strength in 4 different end markets in Asia Pacific. That really is doing very well, which bodes well for the second half, given the fact that there's clearly some volatility in Europe that -- an uncertainty in Europe that we don't know -- nobody knows exactly how that will play out.

I appreciate the question, and the reason I would say that I won't get too much into the details of the products is just we have such a broad range of products, and really it's how we manage the portfolio, but I'm happy to get into the NGS discussion. We had a very good quarter. The adoption of S5 and S5 XL sequencers, going really well. The feedback is very positive, and customers love the ease of installation and the ease of use of the instruments. I mean, it's fantastic feedback. The other thing that was exciting, as it may not be as clear, but at the European Association of Cancer Research conference, we were the first company to bring to market a kit for liquid biopsy for cancer, and that was very well received as well. So consumables is doing well. Our product development is going well, and adoption of instrumentation is going well in the quarter."

We had another great quarter with strong performance on the top and bottom line. We have a proven growth strategy. Our team is executing well, and we continue to strengthen our offering to help our customers meet their goals. Our results in Q2 contributed to a very good first half of the year. We're also successfully executing our capital deployment strategy. As you know, a big highlight in the quarter was our agreement to acquire FEI. We're really excited about the new opportunities this will bring, and I'll discuss that in more detail later in my remarks. 
As usual, I'll start by covering the Q2 financial highlights, give you a little color on our performance by end market and provide a recap of the quarter in the context of our growth strategy. Then I'll wrap up with our revised guidance. 
Starting with the financials. Revenue in Q2 grew 6% to $4.54 billion. Adjusted operating income was up 9%, and our adjusted operating margin increased 50 basis points to 22.8%. Last but most important, we extended our long track record of delivering strong adjusted EPS growth with a 10% increase to $2.03 per share. So with another strong quarter behind us, we're in a great position at the halfway point of the year.  As you know, the global economic environment remains uncertain, but we're using this as an opportunity to help our customers manage through it. And that will strengthen our competitive position and allow us to continue to gain share. 
Let me now turn to a high-level view of our performance in the context of our key end markets. If you step back and look at the first half, our strong results were really a combination of good end markets in aggregate and very good execution. Looking specifically at Q2, we were pleased to see continued strong growth in pharma and biotech, which grew in the high single digits. We're benefiting from both the underlying strength of this end market and our ability to successfully deliver our unique value proposition for these customers. Growth in our bioproduction business was particularly strong in Q2. 
In healthcare diagnostics, we grew at about the company average, highlighted by strong performance in our immunodiagnostics and next-generation sequencing businesses. In academic and government end markets, we continued to deliver low single-digit growth. And finally, we saw a continuation of low single-digit growth overall in industrial and applied. As we see for quite some -- quite a time, industrial markets remain soft and applied markets continue to perform well, with especially strong growth in China and our chromatography business globally. 
Now I'll cover some of our Q2 business highlights in the context of our growth strategy. As most of you know, we increase our capabilities for our customers and drive growth for our company by focusing on 3 strategic pillars, which are: high-impact innovation, scale in emerging markets and delivering our unique customer value proposition to gain share. 
So let me start with innovation, where we participated in a number of major conferences in Q2, representing a broad cross section of our customer base, from cancer research to bioproduction, mass spectrometry and applied markets. They're all great opportunities for us to demonstrate our leadership and our commitment to our mission, which is to enable our customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer. I'll use that as a framework to cover a few of the highlights. 
First, healthier. We exhibited our leading offering for bioproduction customers at INTERPHEX. In addition to our expanded line of single-use containers, we featured new products from our recent acquisition of ASI, such as the imPULSE single-use mixing system for biotherapeutics. We continue to benefit from strong demand for these technologies as our customers rapidly adopt single-use technology for the production of biologics and vaccines. At ASMS, we launched our new Q Exactive biopharma mass spectrometer, which we designed specifically to help pharma and biotech customers more efficiently discover and develop new drugs. As these systems become more powerful and data much more plentiful, customers need to better track, manage and share their results as well as connect and monitor their instruments. We've ramped up our efforts to address these rapidly changing needs and also launched a suite of new software and cloud-based solutions at ASMS to support a range of applications. 
So back to our mission. In terms of enabling a cleaner world, the big event for applied markets in the quarter was Analytica, which is held in Europe. Sustainability is especially important to these customers and a key area of focus for us as well. We feature a range of laboratory equipment designed for a cleaner lab, including our new TSX ultra-low temperature freezers that use natural refrigerants and reduce energy consumption. We also featured biosafety cabinets that require 75% less energy to operate. 
Last, a good example of safer is that our Gemini hand-held chemical analyzer won the 2016 Edison Award for forensics and security. To remind you, Gemini was the first instrument to integrate Raman and FTIR spectroscopy in a handheld device that can be used by hazmat teams, first responders and military personnel in the field. These are just some of the many examples of how we fulfill our mission by helping our customers meet their goals. 
Turning to emerging markets, our second pillar of growth. We had another strong quarter in these geographic regions with standout results in China, South Korea, India and Southeast Asia. To mention a couple of highlights, China continues to be a great market for us, and we delivered another strong quarter with growth in the mid-teens. Our businesses across the company continue to benefit from growth in applied markets, such as environmental and food safety as well as life sciences, which is expanding into new fields like precision medicine. 
In June, we announced our partnership with the West China Hospital of Sichuan University to develop a joint platform for advancing research in precision medicine. This is one of the largest single-site hospitals in the world, and we're looking forward to helping our customers there improve the quality of pathology research and clinical diagnostics. This exciting opportunity underscores the importance of precision medicine as a global initiative and one that was identified as a key priority in China's new 5-year plan. 
In other emerging markets, robust growth in South Korea was driven by our leading presence in biopharma. It's also great to see our investments in India paying off with another strong quarter of growth. We had strong performance in Southeast Asia as well, and I was traveling there last month and visited our regional headquarters in Singapore. We continue to expand our center of excellence in Singapore, which now supports manufacturing of our GC/MS products, in addition to our Life Sciences Solutions instrumentation. This site is a very good example of how we're leveraging our scale to better serve our customers while improving the overall cost structure of our company. 
I'll make one last comment relative to the third growth pillar of our growth strategy, which is our unique customer value proposition. I mentioned precision medicine in my recap of China and I want to give you another example of our efforts here because it illustrates how our scale and depth uniquely position us to play a key role. Precision medicine involves using a patient's biological information down to the molecular level to more effectively treat their disease. Cancer is a natural area of focus, and this information is being used to diagnose and treat a patient's specific type of tumor. We had a significant presence at the American Association for Cancer Research, where we featured a range of technologies suited to this important work, including CRISPR and the siRNA Libraries, the Ion S5 and S5 XL next-generation sequencing systems as well as our leading mass spectrometry platforms. 
Our scientists also led numerous sessions on this topic, covering solutions ranging from next-gen sequencing to liquid biopsy, qPCR-based pharmacogenomics and targeted mass spectrometry. It's clear that our customers are committed to finding better ways to treat this terrible disease, and our unmatched capabilities can help them accelerate their progress. 
Let me switch topics now and turn to capital deployment. We had big news on that front in late May, committing $4.2 billion to acquire FEI. This is a really exciting development given FEI's unique strategic fit with our company and specifically within analytical instruments. As you know, we have an exceptional track record of developing Orbitrap mass spectrometry for protein identification and characterization and it's been the foundation of our highly-successful franchise. FEI's Cryo-EM system is also being used in protein research, specifically for the structural analysis of proteins. By combining these technologies in one company, we'll be in the best position to help our customers capitalize on the rapid growth in structural biology. While FEI has made progress moving more into life science applications, our unmatched presence in the industry will accelerate adoption with these customers. 
Since the announcement, I've had a chance to interact with quite a few of our future FEI colleagues, and it reinforces to me what a great business this is. It's well managed, has excellent technologies and a talented and enthusiastic team. It's going to be a great addition to our Analytical Instruments Segment and a key growth driver for our company. Let me also add that we're making good progress towards closing the transaction. We now expect to close by the end of this year versus our initial estimate of early 2017. The integration for both companies are in place, planning is underway and we're very confident in our ability to achieve the $80 million of total synergies we laid out when we announced the transaction. 
Now let me give you a quick update on our guidance for 2016. As you saw in our press release, we're updating our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance for the year. As usual, Stephen will cover the details and assumptions, but in summary, we're revising guidance based on our strong operating performance in the first half as well as for the more unfavorable foreign exchange environment. We now expect revenue for the year to be in the range of $17.84 billion to $18.0 billion. This would result in 5% to 6% growth over 2015, in line with our previous guidance. We are raising our adjusted EPS guidance to a new range of $8.07 to $8.20, which is 9% to 11% increase year-over-year. 
Before I turn the call over to Stephen, let me summarize my remarks with a couple of takeaways. We had another strong quarter of financial performance which contributed to a great first half. We're executing our growth strategy and complementing that with strategic acquisitions like FEI. We're in an excellent position at the halfway point and on track to achieve our goals for the year. 
With that, I'll now hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen?"

I'll begin with an overview of our second quarter financial performance for the total company, then I'll provide some color on our 4 segments and conclude with an updated 2016 guidance. So starting with the over",2006,"Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with an overview of our second quarter financial performance for the total company, then I'll provide some color on our 4 segments and conclude with an updated 2016 guidance. 
So starting with the overall financial performance for Q2. As you saw in our press release, we grew adjusted EPS by 10% to $2.03. GAAP EPS was $1.30, up 2% from Q2 last year. On the top line, our reported revenue grew 6% year-over-year. Q2 reported revenue includes 4% organic growth and 3% growth from acquisitions. Our currency translations decreased revenues slightly. Please note the components of the Q2 change do not sum due to rounding. 
Given the FX volatility, I thought it'd be helpful to provide a little more color on the impact of foreign exchange in Q2. The revenue impact from the -- was a headwind of $16 million. But due to the mix of currency changes the impact to adjusted operating income was actually a $4 million tailwind, resulting in a slight benefit to margins for the quarter and a $0.01 positive impact on adjusted earnings per share. At the very end of the quarter, rates changed significantly, and we're expecting foreign exchange headwinds on both revenue and adjusted operating income for the remainder of the year. I'll provide more detail on this later when I go to the assumptions for our updated guidance. 
Looking at that growth by geography in Q2. Both North America and Europe grew in the low single digits. Asia Pacific grew in the low double digits with continued strong momentum in China, good growth in South Korea, Southeast Asia and India. And the rest of the world declined to mid-single digits. 
Turning to our operational performance. Q2 adjusted operating income increased 9% and adjusted operating margin was 22.8%, up 50 basis points from Q2 of last year. Looking at the components of our adjusted operating margin performance in Q2, we achieved good margin expansion from our organic growth, driven by robust contributions from our PPI Business System, price and volume. As we expected, Affymetrix was a 30 basis point headwind on margins in Q2, but this was offset by the FX tailwind that I just mentioned. 
Moving on to the details of the P&L. Total company adjusted gross margin came in at 48.6% in Q2, up 60 basis points from the prior year. The increase in adjusted gross margin was primarily due to strong productivity, acquisitions and the FX tailwind, partially offset by unfavorable business mix. Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 21.8% of revenue, which is up 10 basis points versus Q2 2015. And R&D expense came in at 4% of revenue, down 10 basis points versus Q2 last year. And R&D as a percent of our manufacturing revenue in the quarter was 6.2%. 
Looking at our results below the line, net interest expense was $106 million, up $11 million from Q2 last year, mainly as a result of financing related to capital deployment activities during the quarter. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 13.5% which is 50 basis points lower than last year as a result of our tax-planning initiatives. And average diluted shares in the quarter were 396.7 million, down 4.8 million year-over-year, mainly as a result of the share buybacks we completed in Q1, partially offset by stock option dilution. 
Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Cash flow from continuing operations for the first half of the year was $1.2 billion, and free cash flow was $970 million after deducting net capital expenditures of $210 million. This is $310 million higher than the first half free cash flow in 2015. We ended the quarter with $665 million in cash and investments. And in Q2, we paid $60 million of dividends. As you know, we were very active in deploying capital during the first half of this year. We've acquired Affymetrix for $1.3 billion, executed $1 billion of share buybacks in Q1 and distributed about $120 million in shareholder dividends for a total of $2.4 billion in the first half of the year. In addition, we signed an agreement to acquire FEI, committing an additional $4.2 billion of capital. 
Our total debt at the end of Q2 was $14.1 billion, down $900 million sequentially from Q1 as a result of paying down short-term debt. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3.2x total debt to adjusted EBITDA, down from 3.5x at the end of Q1. 
Now wrapping up my comments in our total company performance, ROIC continues to improve. Our trailing 12 months adjusted ROIC at the end of Q2 was 9.8%, up 20 basis points sequentially from Q1. 
So with that, I'll now provide you with some color on the performance of our 4 business segments. Starting with the Life Sciences Solutions Segment, reported revenue increased 13% in Q2, and organic revenue growth was 7%. In the quarter, we continued to see very strong momentum in our bioproduction business and had good growth in our next-gen sequencing and bioscience businesses. Q2 adjusted operating income in Life Sciences Solutions increased 14%, and adjusted operating margin was 28.9%, up 30 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted operating margin was positively impacted by strong productivity and volume pull-through, partially offset by unfavorable business mix, acquisitions and strategic investments. 
In the Analytical Instruments Segment, reported revenue increased 2% in Q2, and organic revenue growth was 3%. In the quarter, we had strong growth contributions from our chromatography and mass spec and our environmental instruments businesses, partially offset by continued weakness in some of our industrial markets. Q2 adjusted operating income in Analytical Instruments increased 4%, and adjusted operating margin was 18.3%, up 30 basis points year-over-year. Very strong productivity, volume leverage and favorable FX were partially offset by unfavorable business mix and strategic investments. 
Turning to the Specialty Diagnostics Segment. In Q2, reported and organic revenue both grew 4%. We saw good growth in the segment led by the immunodiagnostics business. Adjusted operating income increased 5% in Q2, and adjusted operating margin was 27.9%, up 10 basis points from the prior year. Adjusted operating margin was driven by productivity, volume leverage and foreign exchange, offset partly by the impact of strategic investments and unfavorable business mix. 
And finally, in the Lab Products and Services Segment, Q2 reported revenue increased 6%, and organic revenue growth was 5%. We had good growth across all businesses in the segment. Adjusted operating income in the segment increased 8%, and adjusted operating margin was 15.5%, up 10 basis points from the prior year. Adjusted operating margin expansion in the quarter was driven by productivity and volume pull-through with partial offsets from strategic investments and unfavorable business mix. 
Now I'll review the details of our full year 2016 guidance. There are 2 primary changes from our previous guidance. First, we're increasing our guidance based on strong operational performance; and second, we're factoring in the recent changes in foreign exchange rates. And I'll take you through each of these in detail. So first is the increase in our operational performance outlook. With a good first half behind us, we're increasing our expected organic growth for the full year from about 4% to about 4.5%. This increases revenue at the midpoint by $60 million from our previous guidance. The stronger organic growth and outlook results in additional $0.035 of adjusted earnings per share at the midpoint. Given that we're one quarter further in the year, we're also narrowing the range of our revenue guidance from $180 million to $160 million and narrowing our adjusted EPS range from $0.14 to $0.13. 
The second change relates to the impact of FX. As I'm sure you're all aware, rates have moved significantly in the past several weeks. Given the continued uncertainty around FX rates, we have once again taken a conservative approach to arrive at the FX impact for the year. As a result, the change in FX reduces our revenue guidance for the year by an additional $90 million and reduces our adjusted earnings per share guidance by an additional $0.02. Our 2016 guidance now assumes a year-over-year FX headwind of $180 million of revenue or 1.1%, $42 million of adjusted operating income and $0.10 of adjusted earnings per share. In terms of phasing of the $0.10 during the year, we've already incurred $0.05 of the headwind year-to-date, and we're assuming $0.03 headwind in Q3 and $0.02 in Q4. 
So to sum all this up, the revised 2016 revenue guidance range is $17.84 billion to $18.0 billion, which would represent 5% to 6% growth versus 2015, similar to our previous guidance. At the midpoint, revenue is increasing $60 million due to the improved operational performance outlook and decreasing $90 million for the additional foreign exchange headwind. In terms of adjusted earnings per share, our increased 2016 guidance range is now $8.07 to $8.20 with a midpoint of $8.135. This represents growth of 9% to 11% versus 2015, also consistent with our previous guidance. Excluding the FX impact, this would represent adjusted earnings per share growth of 10% to 12% for the year. The midpoint of adjusted earnings per share is increasing $0.015 with the additional $0.02 of foreign exchange headwind being more than offset by the $0.035 of improved operational performance. And we're now expecting 60 to 70 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion year-over-year. This is slightly improved from our previous guidance of 50 to 70 basis points, primarily as a result of a change in FX. 
So given the days impact on our 2016 fiscal calendar, I thought it would also be helpful to add some more color around phasing. As a reminder, our Q1 had 4 more days, and our Q4 will have 4 less days than the equivalent quarters in 2015. In Q1 2016, our reported organic growth was 10%, and we estimate the days-adjusted organic growth in that quarter was approximately 5%. As we look to Q4, given that days will be a headwind in that quarter, we're expecting reported organic growth in Q4 to be essentially flat, consistent with our previous guidance. So days had a positive impact on Q1 and will have a corresponding negative impact on Q4 organic growth. Overall for the year, there is no impact. 
One final comment about the calendar. As I mentioned on previous calls, in Q4, we'll have the benefit of 4 less days of costs, which we will expect to significantly benefit our adjusted operating margin and earnings in the quarter. So as you think about the phasing of our adjusted earnings per share in the second half of the year, at the midpoint, we currently view approximately 55% being realized in Q4. 
A few other details behind the revised 2016 guidance. Acquisitions are still expected to contribute about 2% to our reported revenue growth in 2016, and FX is expected to be about a 1% headwind. We continue to expect net interest expense to be about $390 million. We're forecasting our adjusted income tax rate to be about 14% -- no change from our previous guidance. In terms of capital deployment, we're still assuming we will return approximately $240 million of capital to shareholders through dividends, and that guidance does not include any future acquisitions, divestitures or stock buybacks. Full year average diluted shares are estimated to be about 398 million, slightly lower than our previous guidance. And we're expecting net capital expenditure to be approximately $440 million, consistent with previous guidance. And finally, we're expecting about $2.72 billion of free cash flow for the full year 2016. This is also consistent with our previous guidance. As always, in interpreting the revenue and adjusted EPS guidance ranges, you should focus on the midpoints as the most likely view of how we see the results playing out. 
So in summary, we delivered another strong quarter in Q2 which positions us well at the halfway point to achieve our 2016 financial goals. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Ken."

Chromo mass spec continues to grow high single digits and grew that in the quarter. Our chemical analysis, which is really the industrially-related business, is -- declined in the mid-single digits. So when you kind of look at it versus the various kind of sub peers, chromo mass spec continues to do extraordinary well in the marketplace, and chemical analysis is operating like most of the peers that are very heavily industrially oriented. Towards the second part of your question, more of the broader Thermo Fisher industrial and applied exposure, about 20% of our revenue is industrial and applied. Roughly half of that is applied and half is industrial. Applied markets continue to be strong. As I mentioned in my remarks, China continues to be very good for us. In the industrial markets, we really haven't seen any inflection point. It's really been continued soft conditions, which we've had for the last few years. And then in terms of Europe and Brexit, really just given how late the U.K. announcements came in the quarter, really had no impact in terms of the revenue outlook. It obviously had a lot of movement and volatility, and there might have been a little conservatism in U.K. spend itself but nothing significant in the quarter."

When you look at what's going on, I think the single biggest driver is that the quality of the research and new entities getting approved, right, and -- because the funding ultimately is Western Europe and the U.S. And as long as drugs are getting through to the market and demand is strong there, there'll be funding that's very robust in R&D. So it's less to me cyclical than right now, they're in a sweet spot of the science, turning into drugs that's turning into demand for our product, so we feel good about it. And the fact, even in what I think is very good end markets, there's an efficiency drive amongst that customer base, whether it's small biotech or large pharma, and that plays to our sweet spot for sure, right?

We don't do it for basically 1 quarter. The integration is going extremely well. We continue to be on track to deliver the EPS accretion for 2016, Ross, that we outlined, which was about $0.06. Synergies are running ahead of schedule in terms of timing on the cost side, so that's very good. The eBioscience business is performing well. The flow cytometry market looks attractive. Our Attune flow cytometer has good adoption. The revenue synergies there should come out very strongly, so all of that's very positive. The microarray business is softer than we had seen before. And really what's going on in microarrays is that before the close of the transaction, the primary competitor in microarrays really dramatically dropped price. And Affymetrix as an independent company chose not to follow suit. So in Q2, we focused the R&D and marketing teams on addressing that competitive dynamic. And in early July, you may have noticed that we launched the Axiom Precision Medicine Research Array, and that's a broad-based genotyping array that's very valuable in providing interesting information around health questions, and we're offering that at a very attractive price point. So generally, I feel good about the integration, the synergies, the accretion and the flow in eBio business, and we are putting some countermeasures in place on microarrays."

When I think about it, many of you have heard me say is, generally, I don't like to have investors have to really think about Thermo Fisher in terms of any of the nuances because it's our job to manage through the various puts and takes in the economy. We executed very well. Effectively, we were able to raise our organic growth outlook for the full year based on the half. We don't typically raise organic growth guidance during the course of the year. We typically are more focused on the EPS, so we did both, so which is -- I think is great. When you look at the geographic strength, we went out of the way to highlight the strength in 4 different end markets in Asia Pacific. That really is doing very well, which bodes well for the second half, given the fact that there's clearly some volatility in Europe that -- and uncertainty in Europe that we don't know -- nobody knows exactly how that will play out. But given how the U.S. is doing and given how Asia Pacific is doing, we're very well positioned to have an outstanding year. Capital deployment has gone well. Margins were good. So I like the fact that there's really not a tremendous amount of nuance. It was just a very clean ahead-of-expectations quarter and our ability to offset the FX headwinds that are there and raise guidance. And then finally, as Stephen said in his remarks, we are a bit conservative on the outlook on foreign exchange in our guidance. And if foreign exchange stays exactly as they closed on the spot rates, we actually have a little bit of upside to the guidance there. But given the volatility, we did think it was prudent to put that in. So really a very good time at the halfway point of the year."

We had another great quarter with strong performance on the top and bottom line. We have a proven growth strategy. Our team is executing well, and we continue to strengthen our offering to help our customers meet their goals. Our results in Q2 contributed to a very good first half of the year. We're also successfully executing our capital deployment strategy. As you know, a big highlight in the quarter was our agreement to acquire FEI. We're really excited about the new opportunities this will bring, and I'll discuss that in more detail later in my remarks. 
As usual, I'll start by covering the Q2 financial highlights, give you a little color on our performance by end market and provide a recap of the quarter in the context of our growth strategy. Then I'll wrap up with our revised guidance. 
Starting with the financials. Revenue in Q2 grew 6% to $4.54 billion. Adjusted operating income was up 9%, and our adjusted operating margin increased 50 basis points to 22.8%. Last but most important, we extended our long track record of delivering strong adjusted EPS growth with a 10% increase to $2.03 per share. So with another strong quarter behind us, we're in a great position at the halfway point of the year.  As you know, the global economic environment remains uncertain, but we're using this as an opportunity to help our customers manage through it. And that will strengthen our competitive position and allow us to continue to gain share. 
Let me now turn to a high-level view of our performance in the context of our key end markets. If you step back and look at the first half, our strong results were really a combination of good end markets in aggregate and very good execution. Looking specifically at Q2, we were pleased to see continued strong growth in pharma and biotech, which grew in the high single digits. We're benefiting from both the underlying strength of this end market and our ability to successfully deliver our unique value proposition for these customers. Growth in our bioproduction business was particularly strong in Q2. 
In healthcare diagnostics, we grew at about the company average, highlighted by strong performance in our immunodiagnostics and next-generation sequencing businesses. In academic and government end markets, we continued to deliver low single-digit growth. And finally, we saw a continuation of low single-digit growth overall in industrial and applied. As we see for quite some -- quite a time, industrial markets remain soft and applied markets continue to perform well, with especially strong growth in China and our chromatography business globally. 
Now I'll cover some of our Q2 business highlights in the context of our growth strategy. As most of you know, we increase our capabilities for our customers and drive growth for our company by focusing on 3 strategic pillars, which are: high-impact innovation, scale in emerging markets and delivering our unique customer value proposition to gain share. 
So let me start with innovation, where we participated in a number of major conferences in Q2, representing a broad cross section of our customer base, from cancer research to bioproduction, mass spectrometry and applied markets. They're all great opportunities for us to demonstrate our leadership and our commitment to our mission, which is to enable our customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer. I'll use that as a framework to cover a few of the highlights. 
First, healthier. We exhibited our leading offering for bioproduction customers at INTERPHEX. In addition to our expanded line of single-use containers, we featured new products from our recent acquisition of ASI, such as the imPULSE single-use mixing system for biotherapeutics. We continue to benefit from strong demand for these technologies as our customers rapidly adopt single-use technology for the production of biologics and vaccines. At ASMS, we launched our new Q Exactive biopharma mass spectrometer, which we designed specifically to help pharma and biotech customers more efficiently discover and develop new drugs. As these systems become more powerful and data much more plentiful, customers need to better track, manage and share their results as well as connect and monitor their instruments. We've ramped up our efforts to address these rapidly changing needs and also launched a suite of new software and cloud-based solutions at ASMS to support a range of applications. 
So back to our mission. In terms of enabling a cleaner world, the big event for applied markets in the quarter was Analytica, which is held in Europe. Sustainability is especially important to these customers and a key area of focus for us as well. We feature a range of laboratory equipment designed for a cleaner lab, including our new TSX ultra-low temperature freezers that use natural refrigerants and reduce energy consumption. We also featured biosafety cabinets that require 75% less energy to operate. 
Last, a good example of safer is that our Gemini hand-held chemical analyzer won the 2016 Edison Award for forensics and security. To remind you, Gemini was the first instrument to integrate Raman and FTIR spectroscopy in a handheld device that can be used by hazmat teams, first responders and military personnel in the field. These are just some of the many examples of how we fulfill our mission by helping our customers meet their goals. 
Turning to emerging markets, our second pillar of growth. We had another strong quarter in these geographic regions with standout results in China, South Korea, India and Southeast Asia. To mention a couple of highlights, China continues to be a great market for us, and we delivered another strong quarter with growth in the mid-teens. Our businesses across the company continue to benefit from growth in applied markets, such as environmental and food safety as well as life sciences, which is expanding into new fields like precision medicine. 
In June, we announced our partnership with the West China Hospital of Sichuan University to develop a joint platform for advancing research in precision medicine. This is one of the largest single-site hospitals in the world, and we're looking forward to helping our customers there improve the quality of pathology research and clinical diagnostics. This exciting opportunity underscores the importance of precision medicine as a global initiative and one that was identified as a key priority in China's new 5-year plan. 
In other emerging markets, robust growth in South Korea was driven by our leading presence in biopharma. It's also great to see our investments in India paying off with another strong quarter of growth. We had strong performance in Southeast Asia as well, and I was traveling there last month and visited our regional headquarters in Singapore. We continue to expand our center of excellence in Singapore, which now supports manufacturing of our GC/MS products, in addition to our Life Sciences Solutions instrumentation. This site is a very good example of how we're leveraging our scale to better serve our customers while improving the overall cost structure of our company. 
I'll make one last comment relative to the third growth pillar of our growth strategy, which is our unique customer value proposition. I mentioned precision medicine in my recap of China and I want to give you another example of our efforts here because it illustrates how our scale and depth uniquely position us to play a key role. Precision medicine involves using a patient's biological information down to the molecular level to more effectively treat their disease. Cancer is a natural area of focus, and this information is being used to diagnose and treat a patient's specific type of tumor. We had a significant presence at the American Association for Cancer Research, where we featured a range of technologies suited to this important work, including CRISPR and the siRNA Libraries, the Ion S5 and S5 XL next-generation sequencing systems as well as our leading mass spectrometry platforms. 
Our scientists also led numerous sessions on this topic, covering solutions ranging from next-gen sequencing to liquid biopsy, qPCR-based pharmacogenomics and targeted mass spectrometry. It's clear that our customers are committed to finding better ways to treat this terrible disease, and our unmatched capabilities can help them accelerate their progress. 
Let me switch topics now and turn to capital deployment. We had big news on that front in late May, committing $4.2 billion to acquire FEI. This is a really exciting development given FEI's unique strategic fit with our company and specifically within analytical instruments. As you know, we have an exceptional track record of developing Orbitrap mass spectrometry for protein identification and characterization and it's been the foundation of our highly-successful franchise. FEI's Cryo-EM system is also being used in protein research, specifically for the structural analysis of proteins. By combining these technologies in one company, we'll be in the best position to help our customers capitalize on the rapid growth in structural biology. While FEI has made progress moving more into life science applications, our unmatched presence in the industry will accelerate adoption with these customers. 
Since the announcement, I've had a chance to interact with quite a few of our future FEI colleagues, and it reinforces to me what a great business this is. It's well managed, has excellent technologies and a talented and enthusiastic team. It's going to be a great addition to our Analytical Instruments Segment and a key growth driver for our company. Let me also add that we're making good progress towards closing the transaction. We now expect to close by the end of this year versus our initial estimate of early 2017. The integration for both companies are in place, planning is underway and we're very confident in our ability to achieve the $80 million of total synergies we laid out when we announced the transaction. 
Now let me give you a quick update on our guidance for 2016. As you saw in our press release, we're updating our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance for the year. As usual, Stephen will cover the details and assumptions, but in summary, we're revising guidance based on our strong operating performance in the first half as well as for the more unfavorable foreign exchange environment. We now expect revenue for the year to be in the range of $17.84 billion to $18.0 billion. This would result in 5% to 6% growth over 2015, in line with our previous guidance. We are raising our adjusted EPS guidance to a new range of $8.07 to $8.20, which is 9% to 11% increase year-over-year. 
Before I turn the call over to Stephen, let me summarize my remarks with a couple of takeaways. We had another strong quarter of financial performance which contributed to a great first half. We're executing our growth strategy and complementing that with strategic acquisitions like FEI. We're in an excellent position at the halfway point and on track to achieve our goals for the year. 
With that, I'll now hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen?"
97023,371819233,1016591,"Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with an overview of our second quarter financial performance for the total company, then I'll provide some color on our 4 segments and conclude with an updated 2016 guidance. So starting with the over",2006,"Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with an overview of our second quarter financial performance for the total company, then I'll provide some color on our 4 segments and conclude with an updated 2016 guidance. 
So starting with the overall financial performance for Q2. As you saw in our press release, we grew adjusted EPS by 10% to $2.03. GAAP EPS was $1.30, up 2% from Q2 last year. On the top line, our reported revenue grew 6% year-over-year. Q2 reported revenue includes 4% organic growth and 3% growth from acquisitions. Our currency translations decreased revenues slightly. Please note the components of the Q2 change do not sum due to rounding. 
Given the FX volatility, I thought it'd be helpful to provide a little more color on the impact of foreign exchange in Q2. The revenue impact from the -- was a headwind of $16 million. But due to the mix of currency changes the impact to adjusted operating income was actually a $4 million tailwind, resulting in a slight benefit to margins for the quarter and a $0.01 positive impact on adjusted earnings per share. At the very end of the quarter, rates changed significantly, and we're expecting foreign exchange headwinds on both revenue and adjusted operating income for the remainder of the year. I'll provide more detail on this later when I go to the assumptions for our updated guidance. 
Looking at that growth by geography in Q2. Both North America and Europe grew in the low single digits. Asia Pacific grew in the low double digits with continued strong momentum in China, good growth in South Korea, Southeast Asia and India. And the rest of the world declined to mid-single digits. 
Turning to our operational performance. Q2 adjusted operating income increased 9% and adjusted operating margin was 22.8%, up 50 basis points from Q2 of last year. Looking at the components of our adjusted operating margin performance in Q2, we achieved good margin expansion from our organic growth, driven by robust contributions from our PPI Business System, price and volume. As we expected, Affymetrix was a 30 basis point headwind on margins in Q2, but this was offset by the FX tailwind that I just mentioned. 
Moving on to the details of the P&L. Total company adjusted gross margin came in at 48.6% in Q2, up 60 basis points from the prior year. The increase in adjusted gross margin was primarily due to strong productivity, acquisitions and the FX tailwind, partially offset by unfavorable business mix. Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 21.8% of revenue, which is up 10 basis points versus Q2 2015. And R&D expense came in at 4% of revenue, down 10 basis points versus Q2 last year. And R&D as a percent of our manufacturing revenue in the quarter was 6.2%. 
Looking at our results below the line, net interest expense was $106 million, up $11 million from Q2 last year, mainly as a result of financing related to capital deployment activities during the quarter. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 13.5% which is 50 basis points lower than last year as a result of our tax-planning initiatives. And average diluted shares in the quarter were 396.7 million, down 4.8 million year-over-year, mainly as a result of the share buybacks we completed in Q1, partially offset by stock option dilution. 
Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Cash flow from continuing operations for the first half of the year was $1.2 billion, and free cash flow was $970 million after deducting net capital expenditures of $210 million. This is $310 million higher than the first half free cash flow in 2015. We ended the quarter with $665 million in cash and investments. And in Q2, we paid $60 million of dividends. As you know, we were very active in deploying capital during the first half of this year. We've acquired Affymetrix for $1.3 billion, executed $1 billion of share buybacks in Q1 and distributed about $120 million in shareholder dividends for a total of $2.4 billion in the first half of the year. In addition, we signed an agreement to acquire FEI, committing an additional $4.2 billion of capital. 
Our total debt at the end of Q2 was $14.1 billion, down $900 million sequentially from Q1 as a result of paying down short-term debt. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3.2x total debt to adjusted EBITDA, down from 3.5x at the end of Q1. 
Now wrapping up my comments in our total company performance, ROIC continues to improve. Our trailing 12 months adjusted ROIC at the end of Q2 was 9.8%, up 20 basis points sequentially from Q1. 
So with that, I'll now provide you with some color on the performance of our 4 business segments. Starting with the Life Sciences Solutions Segment, reported revenue increased 13% in Q2, and organic revenue growth was 7%. In the quarter, we continued to see very strong momentum in our bioproduction business and had good growth in our next-gen sequencing and bioscience businesses. Q2 adjusted operating income in Life Sciences Solutions increased 14%, and adjusted operating margin was 28.9%, up 30 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted operating margin was positively impacted by strong productivity and volume pull-through, partially offset by unfavorable business mix, acquisitions and strategic investments. 
In the Analytical Instruments Segment, reported revenue increased 2% in Q2, and organic revenue growth was 3%. In the quarter, we had strong growth contributions from our chromatography and mass spec and our environmental instruments businesses, partially offset by continued weakness in some of our industrial markets. Q2 adjusted operating income in Analytical Instruments increased 4%, and adjusted operating margin was 18.3%, up 30 basis points year-over-year. Very strong productivity, volume leverage and favorable FX were partially offset by unfavorable business mix and strategic investments. 
Turning to the Specialty Diagnostics Segment. In Q2, reported and organic revenue both grew 4%. We saw good growth in the segment led by the immunodiagnostics business. Adjusted operating income increased 5% in Q2, and adjusted operating margin was 27.9%, up 10 basis points from the prior year. Adjusted operating margin was driven by productivity, volume leverage and foreign exchange, offset partly by the impact of strategic investments and unfavorable business mix. 
And finally, in the Lab Products and Services Segment, Q2 reported revenue increased 6%, and organic revenue growth was 5%. We had good growth across all businesses in the segment. Adjusted operating income in the segment increased 8%, and adjusted operating margin was 15.5%, up 10 basis points from the prior year. Adjusted operating margin expansion in the quarter was driven by productivity and volume pull-through with partial offsets from strategic investments and unfavorable business mix. 
Now I'll review the details of our full year 2016 guidance. There are 2 primary changes from our previous guidance. First, we're increasing our guidance based on strong operational performance; and second, we're factoring in the recent changes in foreign exchange rates. And I'll take you through each of these in detail. So first is the increase in our operational performance outlook. With a good first half behind us, we're increasing our expected organic growth for the full year from about 4% to about 4.5%. This increases revenue at the midpoint by $60 million from our previous guidance. The stronger organic growth and outlook results in additional $0.035 of adjusted earnings per share at the midpoint. Given that we're one quarter further in the year, we're also narrowing the range of our revenue guidance from $180 million to $160 million and narrowing our adjusted EPS range from $0.14 to $0.13. 
The second change relates to the impact of FX. As I'm sure you're all aware, rates have moved significantly in the past several weeks. Given the continued uncertainty around FX rates, we have once again taken a conservative approach to arrive at the FX impact for the year. As a result, the change in FX reduces our revenue guidance for the year by an additional $90 million and reduces our adjusted earnings per share guidance by an additional $0.02. Our 2016 guidance now assumes a year-over-year FX headwind of $180 million of revenue or 1.1%, $42 million of adjusted operating income and $0.10 of adjusted earnings per share. In terms of phasing of the $0.10 during the year, we've already incurred $0.05 of the headwind year-to-date, and we're assuming $0.03 headwind in Q3 and $0.02 in Q4. 
So to sum all this up, the revised 2016 revenue guidance range is $17.84 billion to $18.0 billion, which would represent 5% to 6% growth versus 2015, similar to our previous guidance. At the midpoint, revenue is increasing $60 million due to the improved operational performance outlook and decreasing $90 million for the additional foreign exchange headwind. In terms of adjusted earnings per share, our increased 2016 guidance range is now $8.07 to $8.20 with a midpoint of $8.135. This represents growth of 9% to 11% versus 2015, also consistent with our previous guidance. Excluding the FX impact, this would represent adjusted earnings per share growth of 10% to 12% for the year. The midpoint of adjusted earnings per share is increasing $0.015 with the additional $0.02 of foreign exchange headwind being more than offset by the $0.035 of improved operational performance. And we're now expecting 60 to 70 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion year-over-year. This is slightly improved from our previous guidance of 50 to 70 basis points, primarily as a result of a change in FX. 
So given the days impact on our 2016 fiscal calendar, I thought it would also be helpful to add some more color around phasing. As a reminder, our Q1 had 4 more days, and our Q4 will have 4 less days than the equivalent quarters in 2015. In Q1 2016, our reported organic growth was 10%, and we estimate the days-adjusted organic growth in that quarter was approximately 5%. As we look to Q4, given that days will be a headwind in that quarter, we're expecting reported organic growth in Q4 to be essentially flat, consistent with our previous guidance. So days had a positive impact on Q1 and will have a corresponding negative impact on Q4 organic growth. Overall for the year, there is no impact. 
One final comment about the calendar. As I mentioned on previous calls, in Q4, we'll have the benefit of 4 less days of costs, which we will expect to significantly benefit our adjusted operating margin and earnings in the quarter. So as you think about the phasing of our adjusted earnings per share in the second half of the year, at the midpoint, we currently view approximately 55% being realized in Q4. 
A few other details behind the revised 2016 guidance. Acquisitions are still expected to contribute about 2% to our reported revenue growth in 2016, and FX is expected to be about a 1% headwind. We continue to expect net interest expense to be about $390 million. We're forecasting our adjusted income tax rate to be about 14% -- no change from our previous guidance. In terms of capital deployment, we're still assuming we will return approximately $240 million of capital to shareholders through dividends, and that guidance does not include any future acquisitions, divestitures or stock buybacks. Full year average diluted shares are estimated to be about 398 million, slightly lower than our previous guidance. And we're expecting net capital expenditure to be approximately $440 million, consistent with previous guidance. And finally, we're expecting about $2.72 billion of free cash flow for the full year 2016. This is also consistent with our previous guidance. As always, in interpreting the revenue and adjusted EPS guidance ranges, you should focus on the midpoints as the most likely view of how we see the results playing out. 
So in summary, we delivered another strong quarter in Q2 which positions us well at the halfway point to achieve our 2016 financial goals. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Ken."

Chromo mass spec continues to grow high single digits and grew that in the quarter. Our chemical analysis, which is really the industrially-related business, is -- declined in the mid-single digits. So when you kind of look at it versus the various kind of sub peers, chromo mass spec continues to do extraordinary well in the marketplace, and chemical analysis is operating like most of the peers that are very heavily industrially oriented. Towards the second part of your question, more of the broader Thermo Fisher industrial and applied exposure, about 20% of our revenue is industrial and applied. Roughly half of that is applied and half is industrial. Applied markets continue to be strong. As I mentioned in my remarks, China continues to be very good for us. In the industrial markets, we really haven't seen any inflection point. It's really been continued soft conditions, which we've had for the last few years. And then in terms of Europe and Brexit, really just given how late the U.K. announcements came in the quarter, really had no impact in terms of the revenue outlook. It obviously had a lot of movement and volatility, and there might have been a little conservatism in U.K. spend itself but nothing significant in the quarter."

So I think back over various cycles, they become -- still small relative to the U.S. and Western Europe, but more meaningful. So that's clearly a positive, we've seen good growth there. India has been a good growth driver as well, so those are encouraging from kind of longevity. When you look at what's going on, I think the single biggest driver is that the quality of the research and new entities getting approved, right, and -- because the funding ultimately is Western Europe and the U.S. And as long as drugs are getting through to the market and demand is strong there, there'll be funding that's very robust in R&D. So it's less to me cyclical than right now, they're in a sweet spot of the science, turning into drugs that's turning into demand for our product, so we feel good about it. And the fact, even in what I think is very good end markets, there's an efficiency drive amongst that customer base, whether it's small biotech or large pharma, and that plays to our sweet spot for sure, right?

Our Attune flow cytometer has good adoption. The revenue synergies there should come out very strongly, so all of that's very positive. The microarray business is softer than we had seen before. And really what's going on in microarrays is that before the close of the transaction, the primary competitor in microarrays really dramatically dropped price. And Affymetrix as an independent company chose not to follow suit. So in Q2, we focused the R&D and marketing teams on addressing that competitive dynamic. And in early July, you may have noticed that we launched the Axiom Precision Medicine Research Array, and that's a broad-based genotyping array that's very valuable in providing interesting information around health questions, and we're offering that at a very attractive price point.

We don't typically raise organic growth guidance during the course of the year. We typically are more focused on the EPS, so we did both, so which is -- I think is great. When you look at the geographic strength, we went out of the way to highlight the strength in 4 different end markets in Asia Pacific. That really is doing very well, which bodes well for the second half, given the fact that there's clearly some volatility in Europe that -- and uncertainty in Europe that we don't know -- nobody knows exactly how that will play out.

So I like the fact that there's really not a tremendous amount of nuance. It was just a very clean ahead-of-expectations quarter and our ability to offset the FX headwinds that are there and raise guidance.

We achieved that all in the first half, meaning that we will far exceed the revenue synergy number. And it's less about tracking. It's just showing up in the organic growth. So that obviously continues to be a big benefit. As I said in other times, probably one point of the aggregate performance of the step-up in Life Sciences Solutions is the end market is better than it was at the time we announced the transaction in 2013.

We're pleased to tell you that we had another great quarter, and we're right where we should be at this point of the year. We delivered strong financial perform",2057,"Thanks, Ken. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today for our Q3 earnings call. We're pleased to tell you that we had another great quarter, and we're right where we should be at this point of the year. We delivered strong financial performance on the top and bottom lines. We continue to execute our growth strategy to best serve our customers and gain share. And we also completed our acquisition of FEI earlier than we expected, and the integration process is in full swing. So terrific progress across the board. I'll cover these points in more details in a few moments. But the key message is that with 3 great quarters behind us, we're well positioned to deliver another very successful year. I'll start by covering the Q3 financials at a high level, give you some color on our performance by end market and provide a recap of the quarterly highlights in the context of our growth strategy. Then I'll wrap up with our revised guidance. 
In terms of financials, revenue in Q3 grew 9% to $4.49 billion. Adjusted operating income was up 11%, and we expanded our adjusted operating margin by 40 basis points to 23%. 
Finally, I'm very pleased that we achieved the 13% increase in adjusted earnings per share to $2.03. As you know, adjusted EPS is our primary performance metric, and we continue to deliver consistently strong results to extend our long track record here. 
In summary, it was a great quarter financially, and our teams are really executing well to take advantage of the opportunities we have to help our customers meet their goals. 
As you hear from us every quarter, we're committed to building on our capabilities to being an even stronger partner for them, whether we're launching new products or making strategic acquisitions. The global environment, obviously, has its challenges, but we look at them as opportunities to help our customers be successful, and we're effectively leveraging our unique value proposition to gain share and drive growth. 
That's a good segue into our end market discussion. There's been a lot of commentary on the various end market dynamics. Let me provide you with some color on what we saw in our 4 end markets in Q3. In aggregate, our key end markets were in line with our expectations, and Q3 was similar to what we saw in Q2. At a high level, 2 of our end markets were essentially the same, academic and government and health care and diagnostics. And the other 2 changed a little. Pharma and biotech was a bit stronger, and industrial and applied was a bit weaker. I'll give you a few more details about each one. 
In pharma and biotech, we grew in the low double digits in Q3. The market dynamics remained very healthy, and we continue to effectively leverage our depth of capabilities to gain share with these customers. Growth on our bioproduction and BioPharma Services businesses were particularly strong in the quarter, and we also had strong performance here in our chromatography and mass spec business. 
Academic and government end markets grew slightly in the quarter, and industrial and applied end markets declined slightly. And in health care and diagnostics, our growth overall was similar to last quarter. This was highlighted by a strong performance on our transplant diagnostics business and particularly strong growth in our clinical next-gen sequencing business. So again, not much difference to our end markets overall compared with Q2. 
Now I'll cover some of our Q3 business highlights in the context of our growth strategy. As you know, we continue to follow a clear and consistent strategy to strengthen our position in targeted end markets and geographic regions. We're focused on developing high-impact innovative new products, expanding our scale in Asia Pacific and emerging markets and enhancing our unique customer value proposition. 
I'll start with innovation as I usually do. We launched a number of new products during the quarter across our businesses, but I'd like to focus my remarks today on a few examples of how we're increasing our depth of capabilities for customers working in the clinic. Late July marked the annual meeting of the American Association of Clinical Chemistry. We showcased a number of assays, instruments and software under our Thermo Scientific premier brand, so let me highlight a few of them. 
First, we were pleased to be cleared by the U.S. FDA to expand the use of our leading BRAHMS PCT sepsis test. It can now be used in the emergency room or other medical wards before a patient is admitted to the ICU. Our PCT test was previously cleared only for the use with critically ill patients on their first day in the ICU. By administering the sepsis test much earlier, clinicians can protect a broader patient population and help to reduce the associated health care costs. We also worked in tandem with our key PCT license partners, Roche Diagnostics and bioMérieux, so that they can receive clearance to run the test on their extensive installed base of instruments in the U.S. This will significantly expand access to this valuable diagnostic tool. 
We also received clearance for several other diagnostic assays as well, one with the DRI Hydrocodone assay, which has a high level of sensitivity to help doctors quickly identify possible opioid abuse. 
We also received clearance for 2 new EliA IgG autoimmunity tests for more effective diagnosis of thyroid disease. 
Last, for greater accuracy in the clinical lab, we launched LabLink xL 2.0 software, so clinicians can compare and validate results in real-time from labs around the world. 
I also want to make a comment on our next-gen sequencing business as well, where we're seeing nice momentum in customer adoption of our sequencers, including the new S5 and S5 XL that we introduced about a year ago. 
In the quarter, we launched a number of new assays, including additions to our Oncomine family of high-value oncology kits. Our new long self-re DNA as well as our BRCA1 and 2 assays are all designed for NGS analysis on our Ion Torrent platform. 
We also launched the new Ion AmpliSeq transcriptome human gene expression kit, which enables the simultaneous analysis of more than 20,000 genes in a single assay using our Ion Chef sample prep technology as part of the workflow. 
In terms of highlights from a geographic perspective, we're pleased to deliver another strong quarter of growth in Asia Pacific and emerging markets, which is the second pillar of our growth strategy. Our results in Q3 were led by outstanding performance in China and India. China continues to be a significant contributor with growth in the high teens during the quarter. We are positioning Thermo Fisher to not only take advantage of the significant opportunities available in China today, but also to help those customers meet their future plans. An important aspect of that is understanding the government's longer-term focus. 
During my last visit there in Q3, I spent time in Guangzhou and had the opportunity to meet with the municipal party secretary. We formalized a strategic partnership that involves working with local companies and scientific institutions in Guangzhou to advance health care, environmental protection and food safety. This is part of a national plan to boost development in the South China region. 
We're also partnering with HEALTH Biomed, a leading provider of clinical diagnostic and pharmaceutical products in China. The goal is to advance the development of molecular diagnostic kits for infectious disease and pharmacogenomic screening. The kits will be based on our Applied Biosystems CE platform and is another great example of our ability to support precision medicine initiatives that are part of China's Five-Year Plan. 
These are just 2 of the examples from many that we have in terms of long-term growth in China. I always think China [ph] even more energized about our prospects. It's a large and growing market. Our scale gives us a strong competitive advantage, and we're well aligned with the company's strategic -- the country's strategic priorities. 
I also spent some time in South Korea in Q3, and a specific opportunity I want to highlight there is the demand for our BioPharma Services capabilities. South Korea is a key location for clinical trials research because of strong government support, its modern infrastructure and an easily accessible patient population. During the quarter, we opened a new state-of-the-art facility in Seoul to provide local and global companies with a comprehensive clinical trial support. This complements our BioPharma Services capabilities in the region, including those in Singapore, China, India and Japan. 
South Korea is also a great example of how we're leveraging our unique customer value proposition, which is the third pillar of our growth strategy. Korea's GDP is growing in line with many developed countries, but we're clearly gaining share here. That's because of the size of our sales force, our full suite of products and services and the way we effectively bring it all together to help our customers drive innovation and productivity. We have outstanding customer relationships across Korea and are well positioned to continue to gain share. 
As you know, we continue to invest to strengthen our customer value proposition and a major highlight in Q3 was our acquisition of FEI, which we completed in September. FEI is a well-respected business with a leading position in electron microscopy. We're excited to add these technologies to our Analytical Instruments offering and extend their reach to our large Life Science customer base. 
I attended the Day 1 town halls at FEI sites in the Czech Republic and The Netherlands. I was able to meet many of our 3,000 new colleagues and it was great to see their enthusiasm about joining Thermo Fisher. I've been impressed with the FEI teams and the operations I visited, so far. The Brno side in the Czech Republic, in particular, is a world-class manufacturing facility that produces a wide range of FEI products. It's also strategically located in an area with a highly skilled workforce. The ability to leverage this site to support other parts of our company will help us to further optimize our global footprint and increase our presence in lower-cost regions. 
So we're very bullish about the many advantages that FEI brings to Thermo Fisher. The integration teams have hit the ground running and are implementing their plans. We're confident in our ability to achieve the $80 million of total synergies we laid out when we announced the transaction back in May. 
Before I move on to guidance, let me give you a quick overview of where we stand with our capital deployment activities so far this year. With the additions of Affymetrix and FEI, we've deployed more than $5 billion on strategic M&A, $1 billion on stock buybacks, and we're on a path to approximately $240 million of returns in dividends in 2016. 
So it's been an active year for Thermo Fisher Scientific in terms of effectively deploying our capital to create value for our customers and our shareholders. 
Now let me give you a quick update on our guidance for 2016. As you saw on our press release, we're raising our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance for the year. As usual, Stephen will cover the details and assumptions, but in summary, we're raising guidance based on the addition of FEI, our strong operational performance in the first 9 months and a better foreign exchange environment. 
We now expect revenue for the year to be in the range of $18.25 billion to $18.39 billion. This would result in 8% growth over 2015. We're raising our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.11 at the midpoint to a new range of $8.19 to $8.30, which represents 11% to 12% growth year-over-year. 
Before I turn the call over to Stephen, let me sum up my remarks with a couple of takeaways. It was another great quarter in terms of our financial performance, and we extended a long track record of consistently delivering strong adjusted EPS growth. We closed on the acquisition of FEI and look forward to the new opportunities we'll have to create value and drive growth. With the strong 9 months behind us, we're on track to deliver another very successful year. 
With that, I'll now hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen?"

I'll take you through an overview of our third quarter results for the total company. Then I'll provide some color on our 4 segments and conclude with the updated 2016 guidance. Before I get into the details",1905,"So thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. I'll take you through an overview of our third quarter results for the total company. Then I'll provide some color on our 4 segments and conclude with the updated 2016 guidance. 
Before I get into the details of our financial performance, I thought it'd be helpful to provide a high-level view of how the quarter played out versus our expectations at the time of our last earnings call. Operationally, we're right in line with our expectations, both on organic growth and earnings generation. Given the level of volatility in foreign exchange rates so far this year, it was good to see that Q3 FX was $0.02 less adverse than we've previously estimated. And finally, it was great to get the FEI deal closed in September, and we were able to deliver $0.04 of additional adjusted earnings per share in the quarter. 
So the high-level summary is we had a strong Q3 and we were able to deliver $0.06 of adjusted earnings per share above what we had previously expected. 
Now let me give you some more color on the quarter. Starting with adjusted earnings per share, as you saw in our press release, we grew adjusted EPS in Q3 by 13% to $2.03. GAAP EPS was $1.19, up 1% from Q3 last year. On the top line, our reported revenue grew 9% year-over-year. The components of our Q3 reported revenue included 4% organic growth, a 5% contribution from acquisitions and a slight headwind from currency translation. In Q3, we recognized just under $100 million of revenue from FEI. 
Looking in our growth by geography in Q3. This was very similar to what we saw in Q2. But as North America and Europe continued to grow in the low single digits, Asia Pacific grew in the low teens with another strong quarter from China, which grew in the high teens, as Marc mentioned, and rest of the world declined low single digits. 
Turning to our operational performance. Q3 adjusted operating income increased 11% and adjusted operating margin was 23.0%, up 40 basis points from Q3 of last year. Looking at the components of our adjusted operating margin performance in Q3, we delivered solid expansion from our organic growth, driven by our PPI business system and volume leverage, and this is partially offset by unfavorable business mix, strategic investments and a modest headwind from acquisitions. This quarter, FX had no impact on operating margin. 
Moving on to the details of the P&L. Total company adjusted gross margin came in at 48.9% in Q3, up 60 basis points from the prior year. Adjusted gross margin expansion was driven by strong productivity, positive contributions from acquisitions and FX and partially offset by business mix and strategic investments. 
Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 21.8% of revenue, which is up 30 basis points versus Q3 2015. And R&D expense came in at 4.1% of revenue, down 10 basis points versus Q3 last year. R&D as a percent of our manufacturing revenue in the quarter was 6.1%. 
Looking at our results below the line. Net interest expense was $103 million, which is $10 million higher compared to Q3 last year, mainly as a result of financing related to our capital deployment actions this year. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 13.1%, which is 90 basis points lower than last year as a result of our tax planning initiatives and the timing of discrete items. However, this was in line with our expectations. Average diluted shares in the quarter were 397.4 million, down 4.6 million year-over-year as a result of the share buybacks we completed in Q1, partially offset by stock option dilution. 
Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. For the first 9 months, cash flow from continuing operations was $2 billion and free cash flow was $1.7 billion after deducting net capital expenditures of $290 million. This is approximately $350 million higher than our prior year cash flow for the same period. 
We ended the quarter with $2 billion in cash and investments. This is higher than normal due to the timing of the financing activities related to the FEI acquisition. $1.2 billion of this was used on the first business day of Q4 to pay down debt obligations. Our total debt at the end of Q3 was $18.9 billion, up $4.8 billion sequentially from Q2 as a result of the financing activities related of the FEI acquisition. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 4.2x total debt to adjusted EBITDA, up from 3.2x at the end of Q2. After we paid down the debt on the first day of Q4, the leverage ratio was down to 4.0x. 
Similar to previous quarters, we paid $60 million of dividends in Q3. And wrapping up my comments on our total company performance, ROIC continues to be strong. Our trailing 12 months suggested ROIC at the end of the quarter was 9.8%. 
So with that, I'll now provide you with some color on the performance of our 4 business segments. Starting with the Life Sciences Solutions segment, reported revenue increased 14% in Q3 and organic revenue growth was 7%. In the quarter, we continued to see strong growth across a number of the businesses, led by next-gen sequencing, bioproduction, and biosciences. Q3 adjusted operating income in Life Sciences Solutions increased 11% and adjusted operating margin was 30.1%, a decline of 70 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted operating margin was in line with our expectations. And the year-over-year contraction was driven by unfavorable business mix and the impact of acquisitions, partially offset by positive productivity and volume pull-through. 
In the Analytical Instruments segment, which includes the FEI acquisition, reported revenue increased 15% in Q3 and organic revenue growth was 3%. In the quarter, we had strong growth contributions from our chromatography and mass spec and our environmental instruments businesses, partially offset by continued weakness in the businesses serving our industrial end markets. Q3 adjusted operating income in Analytical Instruments increased 30% and adjusted operating margin was 21.2%, up 240 basis points year-over-year. In the quarter, we saw very strong productivity, favorable FX, good volume leverage and a positive impact from the FEI acquisition. Expansion from these drivers was partially offset by unfavorable product mix and the impact of strategic investments. 
Turning to Specialty Diagnostics segments. In Q3, reported and organic revenue both grew 3%. We saw good growth on our transplant diagnostics and immunodiagnostics businesses. Adjusted operating income increased 5% in Q3 and adjusted operating margin was 26.8%, up 40 basis points from the prior year. Adjusted operating margin was driven by strong productivity, good volume pull-through and FX tailwinds, partially offset by the impact of strategic investments and headwinds from business mix. 
Finally, in the Lab Products and Services segment. Q3 reported revenue increased 7% and organic growth was 6%. We delivered particularly strong growth in our biopharma services and channel businesses. Adjusted operating income in the segment increased 3% and adjusted operating margin was 14.8%, down 40 basis points from the prior year. Adjusted operating margin benefited from volume and productivity. However, these are more than offset by the impact of strategic investments and unfavorable business mix. 
Now I'll review the details of our updated full year 2016 guidance. As you saw on our press release, we're raising both our revenue and adjusted earnings per share guidance. We're increasing revenue guidance by $400 million at the midpoint and increasing our adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.11 at the midpoint. 
Let me walk you through the details starting with revenue. We continue to expect to generate about 4.5% organic growth for the full year 2016. Of the $400 million increase in revenue guidance at the midpoint, $30 million reflects the slightly less adverse FX environment and $370 million reflects the impact of FEI, which includes approximately $100 million we recognized in Q3. The FEI numbers are net of purchase accounting adjustments to reduce deferred revenue. 
Then on adjusted earnings per share, we've increased in the midpoint of our adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.11. This reflects $0.02 from a less-adverse FX environment and $0.09 from the impact of FEI, which includes the $0.04 we recognized in Q3. 
And finally, with 3 quarters of strong operational performance behind us, and factoring in the addition of FEI, we're narrowing our revenue guidance range to $140 million and narrowing our adjusted earnings per share range to $0.11. 
So to sum all this up, the revised 2016 revenue guidance is now a range of $18.25 billion to $18.39 billion, which would represent 8% growth versus 2015. We expect acquisitions to contribute about 4.5% to our reported revenue growth in 2016, and FX is expected to be about a 1% headwind. 
In terms of adjusted earnings per share, our increased 2016 guidance is now a range of $8.19 to $8.30, with the midpoint of $8.245. This represents growth of 11% to 12% versus 2015. Excluding the FX impact, this would represent adjusted earnings per share growth of 12% to 13%. 
We are now expecting 50 to 60 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion year-over-year. This is slightly lower than our previous guidance of 60 to 70 basis points, primarily as a result of the impact of the FEI acquisition. 
So a few other details behind our 2016 guidance. Given the days impact on our 2016 fiscal calendar, I thought it'd be helpful to revisit our prior comments around phasing. Our Q1 has 4 more days and our Q4 will have 4 less days than the equivalent quarters in 2015. As a result, we're expecting the reported organic growth in Q4 to be essentially flat and the days adjusted organic growth in Q4 to be about 4.5%, consistent with our previous guidance. This is also a result in a full year organic growth of about 4.5%, also consistent with our previous guidance. 
Net interest expense has increased $25 million from our previous guidance to $420 million as a result of the FEI acquisition. There's no change to our full year adjusted income tax rate guidance, which is still expected to be about 14%. This implies a 15% adjusted tax rate in Q4, slightly higher than the full year average due to the phasing earlier in the year of certain discrete tax planning actions. 
Our guidance does not include any future acquisitions, divestitures or share buybacks. The full year average diluted shares are estimated to be about 398 million, consistent with previous guidance. We're expecting net capital expenditure to be approximately $440 million, consistent with previous guidance. And finally we're still expecting about $2.72 billion of free cash flow for the full year 2016, consistent with previous guidance. We're forecasting that the operational cash flow generated by FEI during our period of ownership in 2016 will be offset by the related transaction and restructuring costs. 
As always, when interpreting our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance ranges, you should focus on the midpoint as a most likely view of how we see results playing out. 
And in summary, we've had 3 strong quarters of operational performance, a less-adverse FX environment than expected and our capital deployment activities are generating strong earnings benefits in 2016 and will enhance our strategic position over the long term. All this will keep us on track to deliver another excellent year. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Ken."

The science is good and the number of approved drugs continues to go well. Vaccines are continuing to play a more and more important role in health care, and that's a good positive as well. And as more and more biotech large molecule drugs are making it through the pipeline versus small molecules, biotech is a larger consumer on a relative basis of life science tools and diagnostics because it's not just in the research and clinical trial space but all to production use of products. So actually the industry looks very bright. And then, obviously, on top of that is the company's position within the industry, and we have a great value proposition with these customers and we have consistently gained share for a number of years. We have strong relationships across all of the major biotech and pharmaceutical companies, and they see us as their partner to drive innovation and productivity, and that has allowed us to have a great historical performance or, more importantly, position for a very bright outlook in this end market."

And in terms of the academic and government markets, if you go back to what we said at the very beginning of the year, by which it's probably the best way to think about what's different or what's the same, we expected that the year would start slower in the U.S. in academic and government and then build as the year went on. And actually, the year started a little bit stronger than we have expected and has stayed steady with that at low single-digit growth. So it came a little bit early and it's been very steady. In terms of the other geographies, obviously, given that we expected academic and government to be a little better in aggregate, basically, they must be slightly weaker and clearly that's been offset by the strength in biopharma. So that's sort of a looking back into late January what's changed. In terms of are we off-cycle versus others, I don't know. I think we're gaining share versus others but that's my opinion. And when we thought about our range of outcomes for the year, we felt comfortable with raising the guidance at the end of Q2 to 4.5% organic growth, and we feel comfortable reaffirming that 4.5% outlook. And the way I think about it is our commercial teams cover a range of customers. We focus on the way the best opportunities are. And in a way, we don't force a lot of microlevel analysis for the investment community. It's our job to manage through it and we feel we're well positioned to deliver through a really nice year in terms of performance."

What I would say is the more -- the super high value-added businesses, transplant diagnostics, the allergy and autoimmunity business, the clinical next-gen sequencing businesses, those businesses are performing very well. The more routine volume-related businesses, your basic consumables use every day has been a little bit softer but not a change in trend. So what would have to happen for pickup in growth, 2 different factors could help drive it, which is a little bit higher level of activity and the basic consumption of products for consumables would help. And the other is we have a number of programs that are driving our life science tools into the clinic, and they will be meaningful drivers as well. So the driving into the clinic, that's in our control entirely and that puts us very optimistic about the midterm prospects for the diagnostic business, and then we'll always take the upside as the market's getting better."

And so next year should look like this year in terms of sort of high level things. One of the things we mentioned at the beginning of the year which we're continuing to execute on, which I'm encouraged about, is when the medical device tax was put on a 2-year hiatus, we spent the savings on investing in some midterm restructuring activities. We will get one more year of the hiatus. We will invest those monies as well, so there's no effect year-over-year. But that means we'll have invested about $30 million in actions to drive more efficiency kind of in the second half of '17 and '18, which I think is really good and encouraging.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today for our Q3 earnings call. We're pleased to tell you that we had another great quarter, and we're right where we should be at this point of the year. We delivered strong financial performance on the top and bottom lines. We continue to execute our growth strategy to best serve our customers and gain share. And we also completed our acquisition of FEI earlier than we expected, and the integration process is in full swing. So terrific progress across the board. I'll cover these points in more details in a few moments. But the key message is that with 3 great quarters behind us, we're well positioned to deliver another very successful year. I'll start by covering the Q3 financials at a high level, give you some color on our performance by end market and provide a recap of the quarterly highlights in the context of our growth strategy. Then I'll wrap up with our revised guidance. 
In terms of financials, revenue in Q3 grew 9% to $4.49 billion. Adjusted operating income was up 11%, and we expanded our adjusted operating margin by 40 basis points to 23%. 
Finally, I'm very pleased that we achieved the 13% increase in adjusted earnings per share to $2.03. As you know, adjusted EPS is our primary performance metric, and we continue to deliver consistently strong results to extend our long track record here. 
In summary, it was a great quarter financially, and our teams are really executing well to take advantage of the opportunities we have to help our customers meet their goals. 
As you hear from us every quarter, we're committed to building on our capabilities to being an even stronger partner for them, whether we're launching new products or making strategic acquisitions. The global environment, obviously, has its challenges, but we look at them as opportunities to help our customers be successful, and we're effectively leveraging our unique value proposition to gain share and drive growth. 
That's a good segue into our end market discussion. There's been a lot of commentary on the various end market dynamics. Let me provide you with some color on what we saw in our 4 end markets in Q3. In aggregate, our key end markets were in line with our expectations, and Q3 was similar to what we saw in Q2. At a high level, 2 of our end markets were essentially the same, academic and government and health care and diagnostics. And the other 2 changed a little. Pharma and biotech was a bit stronger, and industrial and applied was a bit weaker. I'll give you a few more details about each one. 
In pharma and biotech, we grew in the low double digits in Q3. The market dynamics remained very healthy, and we continue to effectively leverage our depth of capabilities to gain share with these customers. Growth on our bioproduction and BioPharma Services businesses were particularly strong in the quarter, and we also had strong performance here in our chromatography and mass spec business. 
Academic and government end markets grew slightly in the quarter, and industrial and applied end markets declined slightly. And in health care and diagnostics, our growth overall was similar to last quarter. This was highlighted by a strong performance on our transplant diagnostics business and particularly strong growth in our clinical next-gen sequencing business. So again, not much difference to our end markets overall compared with Q2. 
Now I'll cover some of our Q3 business highlights in the context of our growth strategy. As you know, we continue to follow a clear and consistent strategy to strengthen our position in targeted end markets and geographic regions. We're focused on developing high-impact innovative new products, expanding our scale in Asia Pacific and emerging markets and enhancing our unique customer value proposition. 
I'll start with innovation as I usually do. We launched a number of new products during the quarter across our businesses, but I'd like to focus my remarks today on a few examples of how we're increasing our depth of capabilities for customers working in the clinic. Late July marked the annual meeting of the American Association of Clinical Chemistry. We showcased a number of assays, instruments and software under our Thermo Scientific premier brand, so let me highlight a few of them. 
First, we were pleased to be cleared by the U.S. FDA to expand the use of our leading BRAHMS PCT sepsis test. It can now be used in the emergency room or other medical wards before a patient is admitted to the ICU. Our PCT test was previously cleared only for the use with critically ill patients on their first day in the ICU. By administering the sepsis test much earlier, clinicians can protect a broader patient population and help to reduce the associated health care costs. We also worked in tandem with our key PCT license partners, Roche Diagnostics and bioMérieux, so that they can receive clearance to run the test on their extensive installed base of instruments in the U.S. This will significantly expand access to this valuable diagnostic tool. 
We also received clearance for several other diagnostic assays as well, one with the DRI Hydrocodone assay, which has a high level of sensitivity to help doctors quickly identify possible opioid abuse. 
We also received clearance for 2 new EliA IgG autoimmunity tests for more effective diagnosis of thyroid disease. 
Last, for greater accuracy in the clinical lab, we launched LabLink XL 2.0 software, so clinicians can compare and validate results in real-time from labs around the world. 
I also want to make a comment on our next-gen sequencing business as well, where we're seeing nice momentum in customer adoption of our sequencers, including the new S5 and S5 XL that we introduced about a year ago. 
In the quarter, we launched a number of new assays, including additions to our Oncomine family of high-value oncology kits. Our new long self-re DNA as well as our BRCA1 and 2 assays are all designed for NGS analysis on our Ion Torrent platform. 
We also launched the new Ion AmpliSeq transcriptome human gene expression kit, which enables the simultaneous analysis of more than 20,000 genes in a single assay using our Ion Chef sample prep technology as part of the workflow. 
In terms of highlights from a geographic perspective, we're pleased to deliver another strong quarter of growth in Asia Pacific and emerging markets, which is the second pillar of our growth strategy. Our results in Q3 were led by outstanding performance in China and India. China continues to be a significant contributor with growth in the high teens during the quarter. We are positioning Thermo Fisher to not only take advantage of the significant opportunities available in China today, but also to help those customers meet their future plans. An important aspect of that is understanding the government's longer-term focus. 
During my last visit there in Q3, I spent time in Guangzhou and had the opportunity to meet with the municipal party secretary. We formalized a strategic partnership that involves working with local companies and scientific institutions in Guangzhou to advance health care, environmental protection and food safety. This is part of a national plan to boost development in the South China region. 
We're also partnering with HEALTH Biomed, a leading provider of clinical diagnostic and pharmaceutical products in China. The goal is to advance the development of molecular diagnostic kits for infectious disease and pharmacogenomic screening. The kits will be based on our Applied Biosystems CE platform and is another great example of our ability to support precision medicine initiatives that are part of China's Five-Year Plan. 
These are just 2 of the examples from many that we have in terms of long-term growth in China. I always believe China's even more energized about our prospects. It's a large and growing market. Our scale gives us a strong competitive advantage, and we're well aligned with the company's strategic -- the country's strategic priorities. 
I also spent some time in South Korea in Q3, and a specific opportunity I want to highlight there is the demand for our BioPharma Services capabilities. South Korea is a key location for clinical trials research because of strong government support, its modern infrastructure and an easily accessible patient population. During the quarter, we opened a new state-of-the-art facility in Seoul to provide local and global companies with a comprehensive clinical trial support. This complements our BioPharma Services capabilities in the region, including those in Singapore, China, India and Japan. 
South Korea is also a great example of how we're leveraging our unique customer value proposition, which is the third pillar of our growth strategy. Korea's GDP is growing in line with many developed countries, but we're clearly gaining share here. That's because of the size of our sales force, our full suite of products and services and the way we effectively bring it all together to help our customers drive innovation and productivity. We have outstanding customer relationships across Korea and are well positioned to continue to gain share. 
As you know, we continue to invest to strengthen our customer value proposition and a major highlight in Q3 was our acquisition of FEI, which we completed in September. FEI is a well-respected business with a leading position in electron microscopy. We're excited to add these technologies to our Analytical Instruments offering and extend their reach to our large Life Science customer base. 
I attended the Day 1 town halls at FEI sites in the Czech Republic and The Netherlands. I was able to meet many of our 3,000 new colleagues and it was great to see their enthusiasm about joining Thermo Fisher. I've been impressed with the FEI teams and the operations I visited, so far. The Brno side in the Czech Republic, in particular, is a world-class manufacturing facility that produces a wide range of FEI products. It's also strategically located in an area with a highly skilled workforce. The ability to leverage this site to support other parts of our company will help us to further optimize our global footprint and increase our presence in lower-cost regions. 
So we're very bullish about the many advantages that FEI brings to Thermo Fisher. The integration teams have hit the ground running and are implementing their plans. We're confident in our ability to achieve the $80 million of total synergies we laid out when we announced the transaction back in May. 
Before I move on to guidance, let me give you a quick overview of where we stand with our capital deployment activities so far this year. With the additions of Affymetrix and FEI, we've deployed more than $5 billion on strategic M&A, $1 billion on stock buybacks, and we're on a path to approximately $240 million of returns in dividends in 2016. 
So it's been an active year for Thermo Fisher Scientific in terms of effectively deploying our capital to create value for our customers and our shareholders. 
Now let me give you a quick update on our guidance for 2016. As you saw on our press release, we're raising our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance for the year. As usual, Stephen will cover the details and assumptions, but in summary, we're raising guidance based on the addition of FEI, our strong operational performance in the first 9 months and a better foreign exchange environment. 
We now expect revenue for the year to be in the range of $18.25 billion to $18.39 billion. This would result in 8% growth over 2015. We're raising our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.11 at the midpoint to a new range of $8.19 to $8.30, which represents 11% to 12% growth year-over-year. 
Before I turn the call over to Stephen, let me sum up my remarks with a couple of takeaways. It was another great quarter in terms of our financial performance, and we extended a long track record of consistently delivering strong adjusted EPS growth. We closed on the acquisition of FEI and look forward to the new opportunities we'll have to create value and drive growth. With the strong 9 months behind us, we're on track to deliver another very successful year. 
With that, I'll now hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen?"

I'll take you through an overview of our third quarter results for the total company. Then I'll provide some color on our 4 segments and conclude with the updated 2016 guidance. Before I get into the details",1904,"So thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. I'll take you through an overview of our third quarter results for the total company. Then I'll provide some color on our 4 segments and conclude with the updated 2016 guidance. 
Before I get into the details of our financial performance, I thought it'd be helpful to provide a high-level view of how the quarter played out versus our expectations at the time of our last earnings call. Operationally, we're right in line with our expectations, both on organic growth and earnings generation. Given the level of volatility in foreign exchange rates so far this year, it was good to see that Q3 FX was $0.02 less adverse than we've previously estimated. And finally, it was great to get the FEI deal closed in September, and we were able to deliver $0.04 of additional adjusted earnings per share in the quarter. 
So the high-level summary is we had a strong Q3 and we were able to deliver $0.06 of adjusted earnings per share above what we had previously expected. 
Now let me give you some more color on the quarter. Starting with adjusted earnings per share, as you saw in our press release, we grew adjusted EPS in Q3 by 13% to $2.03. GAAP EPS was $1.19, up 1% from Q3 last year. On the top line, our reported revenue grew 9% year-over-year. The components of our Q3 reported revenue included 4% organic growth, a 5% contribution from acquisitions and a slight headwind from currency translation. In Q3, we recognized just under $100 million of revenue from FEI. 
Looking in our growth by geography in Q3. This was very similar to what we saw in Q2. But as North America and Europe continued to grow in the low single digits, Asia Pacific grew in the low teens with another strong quarter from China, which grew in the high teens, as Marc mentioned, and rest of the world declined low single digits. 
Turning to our operational performance. Q3 adjusted operating income increased 11% and adjusted operating margin was 23.0%, up 40 basis points from Q3 of last year. Looking at the components of our adjusted operating margin performance in Q3, we delivered solid expansion from our organic growth, driven by our PPI business system and volume leverage, and this is partially offset by unfavorable business mix, strategic investments and a modest headwind from acquisitions. This quarter, FX had no impact on operating margin. 
Moving on to the details of the P&L. Total company adjusted gross margin came in at 48.9% in Q3, up 60 basis points from the prior year. Adjusted gross margin expansion was driven by strong productivity, positive contributions from acquisitions and FX and partially offset by business mix and strategic investments. 
Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 21.8% of revenue, which is up 30 basis points versus Q3 2015. And R&D expense came in at 4.1% of revenue, down 10 basis points versus Q3 last year. R&D as a percent of our manufacturing revenue in the quarter was 6.1%. 
Looking at our results below the line. Net interest expense was $103 million, which is $10 million higher compared to Q3 last year, mainly as a result of financing related to our capital deployment actions this year. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 13.1%, which is 90 basis points lower than last year as a result of our tax planning initiatives and the timing of discrete items. However, this was in line with our expectations. Average diluted shares in the quarter were 397.4 million, down 4.6 million year-over-year as a result of the share buybacks we completed in Q1, partially offset by stock option dilution. 
Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. For the first 9 months, cash flow from continuing operations was $2 billion and free cash flow was $1.7 billion after deducting net capital expenditures of $290 million. This is approximately $350 million higher than our prior year cash flow for the same period. 
We ended the quarter with $2 billion in cash and investments. This is higher than normal due to the timing of the financing activities related to the FEI acquisition. $1.2 billion of this was used on the first business day of Q4 to pay down debt obligations. Our total debt at the end of Q3 was $18.9 billion, up $4.8 billion sequentially from Q2 as a result of the financing activities related of the FEI acquisition. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 4.2x total debt to adjusted EBITDA, up from 3.2x at the end of Q2. After we paid down the debt on the first day of Q4, the leverage ratio was down to 4.0x. 
Similar to previous quarters, we paid $60 million of dividends in Q3. And wrapping up my comments on our total company performance, ROIC continues to be strong. Our trailing 12 months suggested ROIC at the end of the quarter was 9.8%. 
So with that, I'll now provide you with some color on the performance of our 4 business segments. Starting with the Life Sciences Solutions segment, reported revenue increased 14% in Q3 and organic revenue growth was 7%. In the quarter, we continued to see strong growth across a number of the businesses, led by next-gen sequencing, bioproduction, and biosciences. Q3 adjusted operating income in Life Sciences Solutions increased 11% and adjusted operating margin was 30.1%, a decline of 70 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted operating margin was in line with our expectations. And the year-over-year contraction was driven by unfavorable business mix and the impact of acquisitions, partially offset by positive productivity and volume pull-through. 
In the Analytical Instruments segment, which includes the FEI acquisition, reported revenue increased 15% in Q3 and organic revenue growth was 3%. In the quarter, we had strong growth contributions from our chromatography and mass spec and our environmental instruments businesses, partially offset by continued weakness in the businesses serving our industrial end markets. Q3 adjusted operating income in Analytical Instruments increased 30% and adjusted operating margin was 21.2%, up 240 basis points year-over-year. In the quarter, we saw very strong productivity, favorable FX, good volume leverage and a positive impact from the FEI acquisition. Expansion from these drivers was partially offset by unfavorable product mix and the impact of strategic investments. 
Turning to Specialty Diagnostics segments. In Q3, reported and organic revenue both grew 3%. We saw good growth on our transplant diagnostics and immunodiagnostics businesses. Adjusted operating income increased 5% in Q3 and adjusted operating margin was 26.8%, up 40 basis points from the prior year. Adjusted operating margin was driven by strong productivity, good volume pull-through and FX tailwinds, partially offset by the impact of strategic investments and headwinds from business mix. 
Finally, in the Lab Products and Services segment. Q3 reported revenue increased 7% and organic growth was 6%. We delivered particularly strong growth in our biopharma services and channel businesses. Adjusted operating income in the segment increased 3% and adjusted operating margin was 14.8%, down 40 basis points from the prior year. Adjusted operating margin benefited from volume and productivity. However, these are more than offset by the impact of strategic investments and unfavorable business mix. 
Now I'll review the details of our updated full year 2016 guidance. As you saw on our press release, we're raising both our revenue and adjusted earnings per share guidance. We're increasing revenue guidance by $400 million at the midpoint and increasing our adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.11 at the midpoint. 
Let me walk you through the details starting with revenue. We continue to expect to generate about 4.5% organic growth for the full year 2016. Of the $400 million increase in revenue guidance at the midpoint, $30 million reflects the slightly less adverse FX environment and $370 million reflects the impact of FEI, which includes approximately $100 million we recognized in Q3. The FEI numbers are net of purchase accounting adjustments to reduce deferred revenue. 
Then on adjusted earnings per share, we've increased in the midpoint of our adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.11. This reflects $0.02 from a less-adverse FX environment and $0.09 from the impact of FEI, which includes the $0.04 we recognized in Q3. 
And finally, with 3 quarters of strong operational performance behind us, and factoring in the addition of FEI, we're narrowing our revenue guidance range to $140 million and narrowing our adjusted earnings per share range to $0.11. 
So to sum all this up, the revised 2016 revenue guidance is now a range of $18.25 billion to $18.39 billion, which would represent 8% growth versus 2015. We expect acquisitions to contribute about 4.5% to our reported revenue growth in 2016, and FX is expected to be about a 1% headwind. 
In terms of adjusted earnings per share, our increased 2016 guidance is now a range of $8.19 to $8.30, with the midpoint of $8.245. This represents growth of 11% to 12% versus 2015. Excluding the FX impact, this would represent adjusted earnings per share growth of 12% to 13%. 
We are now expecting 50 to 60 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion year-over-year. This is slightly lower than our previous guidance of 60 to 70 basis points, primarily as a result of the impact of the FEI acquisition. 
So a few other details behind our 2016 guidance. Given the days impact on our 2016 fiscal calendar, I thought it'd be helpful to revisit our prior comments around phasing. Our Q1 has 4 more days and our Q4 will have 4 less days than the equivalent quarters in 2015. As a result, we're expecting the reported organic growth in Q4 to be essentially flat and the days adjusted organic growth in Q4 to be about 4.5%, consistent with our previous guidance. This is also a result in a full year organic growth of about 4.5%, also consistent with our previous guidance. 
Net interest expense has increased $25 million from our previous guidance to $420 million as a result of the FEI acquisition. There's no change to our full year adjusted income tax rate guidance, which is still expected to be about 14%. This implies a 15% adjusted tax rate in Q4, slightly higher than the full year average due to the phasing earlier in the year of certain discrete tax planning actions. 
Our guidance does not include any future acquisitions, divestitures or share buybacks. The full year average diluted shares are estimated to be about 398 million, consistent with previous guidance. We're expecting net capital expenditure to be approximately $440 million, consistent with previous guidance. And finally we're still expecting about $2.72 billion of free cash flow for the full year 2016, consistent with previous guidance. We're forecasting that the operational cash flow generated by FEI during our period of ownership in 2016 will be offset by the related transaction and restructuring costs. 
As always, when interpreting our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance ranges, you should focus on the midpoint as a most likely view of how we see results playing out. 
And in summary, we've had 3 strong quarters of operational performance, a less-adverse FX environment than expected and our capital deployment activities are generating strong earnings benefits in 2016 and will enhance our strategic position over the long term. All this keeps us on track to deliver another excellent year. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Ken."

Vaccines are continuing to play a more and more important role in health care, and that's a good positive as well. And as more and more biotech large molecule drugs are making it through the pipeline versus small molecules, biotech is a larger consumer on a relative basis of life science tools and diagnostics because it's not just in the research and clinical trial space, but all the way into production and use of our products. So actually the industry looks very bright. And then, obviously, on top of that is the company's position within the industry.

The way that I see it is you have sort of the base operational assumptions and the capital deployment assumptions. And if I think about the environment, the environment looks very similar to what it was in May, so that puts us in a range of kind of 4% to 6% organic growth in terms of that. And in terms of capital deployment, we will clearly benefit from the accretion that we get from FEI on a year-over-year basis and certainly, the accretion that we get from the Affymetrix transaction. So at a high level, the way that you articulated it, I agree with you. Obviously, you've worked through all the math. But given the strong acquisitions that we've done this year, we're going to get a nice contribution to our earnings from the capital deployment actions in this year."

And actually, the year started a little bit stronger than we had expected and has stayed steady with that at low single-digit growth. So it came a little bit early and it's been very steady. In terms of the other geographies, obviously, given that we expected academic and government to be a little better in aggregate, it basically says it must be slightly weaker and clearly, that's been offset by the strength in biopharma. So that's the sort of looking back in late January what's changed. In terms of are we off-cycle versus others, I don't know. I think we're gaining share versus others, but that's my opinion. And when we thought about our range of outcomes for the year, we felt comfortable with raising the guidance in Q -- at the end of Q2 to 4.5% organic growth. And we feel comfortable reaffirming that 4.5% outlook. And the way I think about it is our commercial teams cover a range of customers. We focus on the way the best opportunities are.

And the other is we have a number of programs that are driving our life science tools into the clinic, and they will be meaningful drivers as well.

We will get one more year of that hiatus and we will invest those monies as well, so there's no effect year-over-year. But that means we'll have invested about $30 million in actions to drive more efficiency kind of in the second half of '17 and '18, which, I think, is really good and encouraging.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today for our Q3 earnings call. We're pleased to tell you that we had another great quarter, and we're right where we should be at this point of the year. We delivered strong financial performance on the top and bottom lines. We continued to execute our growth strategy to best serve our customers and gain share. And we also completed our acquisition of FEI earlier than we expected, and the integration process is in full swing. So terrific progress across the board. I'll cover these points in more details in a few moments. But the key message is that with 3 great quarters behind us, we're well positioned to deliver another very successful year. I'll start by covering the Q3 financials at a high level, give you some color on our performance by end market and provide a recap of the quarterly highlights in the context of our growth strategy. Then I'll wrap up with our revised guidance. 
In terms of financials, revenue in Q3 grew 9% to $4.49 billion. Adjusted operating income was up 11%, and we expanded our adjusted operating margin by 40 basis points to 23%. 
Finally, I'm very pleased that we achieved a 13% increase in adjusted earnings per share to $2.03. As you know, adjusted EPS is our primary performance metric, and we continued to deliver consistently strong results to extend our long track record here. 
In summary, it was a great quarter financially, and our teams are really executing well to take advantage of the opportunities we have to help our customers meet their goals. 
As you hear from us every quarter, we're committed to building on our capabilities to being an even stronger partner for them, whether we're launching new products or making strategic acquisitions. The global environment obviously has its challenges, but we look at them as opportunities to help our customers be successful, and we're effectively leveraging our unique value proposition to gain share and drive growth. 
That's a good segue into our end market discussion. There's been a lot of commentary on the various end market dynamics. Let me provide you with some color on what we saw in our 4 end markets in Q3. In aggregate, our key end markets were in line with our expectations, and Q3 was similar to what we saw in Q2. At a high level, 2 of our end markets were essentially the same, academic and government and health care and diagnostics. And the other 2 changed a little. Pharma and biotech was a bit stronger, and industrial and applied was a bit weaker. I'll give you a few more details about each one. 
In pharma and biotech, we grew in the low double digits in Q3. The market dynamics remained very healthy, and we continue to effectively leverage our depth of capabilities to gain share with these customers. Growth in our bioproduction and BioPharma Services businesses were particularly strong in the quarter, and we also had strong performance here in our chromatography and mass spec business. 
Academic and government end markets grew slightly in the quarter, and industrial and applied end markets declined slightly. And in health care and diagnostics, our growth overall was similar to last quarter. This was highlighted by strong performance in our transplant diagnostics business and particularly strong growth in our clinical next-gen sequencing business. So again, not much difference to our end markets overall compared with Q2. 
Now I'll cover some of our Q3 business highlights in the context of our growth strategy. As you know, we continue to follow a clear and consistent strategy to strengthen our position in targeted end markets and geographic regions. We're focused on developing high-impact innovative new products, expanding our scale in Asia Pacific and emerging markets and enhancing our unique customer value proposition. 
I'll start with innovation as I usually do. We launched a number of new products during the quarter across our businesses, but I'd like to focus my remarks today on a few examples of how we're increasing our depth of capabilities for customers working in the clinic. Late July marked the annual meeting of the American Association of Clinical Chemistry. We showcased a number of assays, instruments and software under our Thermo Scientific premier brand, so let me highlight a few of them. 
First, we were pleased to be cleared by the U.S. FDA to expand the use of our leading BRAHMS PCT sepsis test. It can now be used in the emergency room or other medical wards before a patient is admitted to the ICU. Our PCT test was previously cleared only for the use with critically ill patients on their first day in the ICU. By administering the sepsis test much earlier, clinicians can protect a broader patient population and help to reduce the associated health care costs. We also worked in tandem with our key PCT license partners, Roche Diagnostics and bioMérieux, so that they can receive clearance to run the test on their extensive installed base of instruments in the U.S. This will significantly expand access to this valuable diagnostic tool. 
We also received clearance for several other diagnostic assays as well, one was the DRI Hydrocodone assay, which has a high level of sensitivity to help doctors quickly identify possible opioid abuse. 
We also received clearance for 2 new EliA IgG autoimmunity tests for more effective diagnosis of thyroid disease. 
Last, for greater accuracy in the clinical lab, we launched LabLink XL 2.0 software, so clinicians can compare and validate results in real-time from labs around the world. 
I also want to make a comment on our next-gen sequencing business as well, where we're seeing nice momentum in customer adoption of our sequencers, including the new S5 and S5 XL that we introduced about a year ago. 
In the quarter, we launched a number of new assays, including additions to our Oncomine family of high-value oncology kits. Our new long cell-free DNA as well as our BRCA1 and 2 assays are all designed for NGS analysis on our Ion Torrent platform. 
We also launched the new Ion AmpliSeq transcriptome human gene expression kit, which enables the simultaneous analysis of more than 20,000 genes in a single assay using our Ion Chef sample prep technology as part of the workflow. 
In terms of highlights from a geographic perspective, we're pleased to deliver another strong quarter of growth in Asia Pacific and emerging markets, which is the second pillar of our growth strategy. Our results in Q3 were led by outstanding performance in China and India. China continues to be a significant contributor with growth in the high teens during the quarter. We are positioning Thermo Fisher to not only take advantage of the significant opportunities available in China today, but also to help those customers meet their future plans. An important aspect of that is understanding the government's longer-term focus. 
During my last visit there in Q3, I spent time in Guangzhou and had the opportunity to meet with the municipal party secretary. We formalized a strategic partnership that involves working with local companies and scientific institutions in Guangzhou to advance health care, environmental protection and food safety. This is part of a national plan to boost development in the South China region. 
We're also partnering with HEALTH Biomed, a leading provider of clinical diagnostic and pharmaceutical products in China. The goal is to advance the development of molecular diagnostic kits for infectious disease and pharmacogenomic screening. The kits will be based on our Applied Biosystems CE platform and is another great example of our ability to support precision medicine initiatives that are part of China's Five-Year Plan. 
These are just 2 of the examples from many that we have in terms of long-term growth in China. I always leave China's even more energized about our prospects. It's a large and growing market. Our scale gives us a strong competitive advantage, and we're well-aligned with the company's strategic -- the country's strategic priorities. 
I also spent some time in South Korea in Q3, and a specific opportunity I want to highlight there is the demand for our BioPharma Services capabilities. South Korea is a key location for clinical trials research because of strong government support, its modern infrastructure and an easily-accessible patient population. During the quarter, we opened a new state-of-the-art facility in Seoul to provide local and global companies with a comprehensive clinical trial support. This complements our BioPharma Services capabilities in the region, including those in Singapore, China, India and Japan. 
South Korea is also a great example of how we're leveraging our unique customer value proposition, which is the third pillar of our growth strategy. Korea's GDP is growing in line with many developed countries, but we're clearly gaining share here. That's because of the size of our sales force, our full suite of products and services and the way we effectively bring it all together to help our customers drive innovation and productivity. We have outstanding customer relationships across Korea and are well positioned to continue to gain share. 
As you know, we continue to invest to strengthen our customer value proposition and a major highlight in Q3 was our acquisition of FEI, which we completed in September. FEI is a well-respected business with a leading position in electron microscopy. We're excited to add these technologies to our Analytical Instruments offering and extend their reach to our large Life Science customer base. 
I attended the Day 1 town halls at FEI sites in the Czech Republic and The Netherlands. I was able to meet many of our 3,000 new colleagues and it was great to see their enthusiasm about joining Thermo Fisher. I've been impressed with the FEI teams and the operations I visited so far. The Brno side in the Czech Republic, in particular, is a world-class manufacturing facility that produces a wide range of FEI products. It's also strategically located in an area with a highly skilled workforce. The ability to leverage this site to support other parts of our company will help us to further optimize our global footprint and increase our presence in lower-cost regions. 
So we're very bullish about the many advantages that FEI brings to Thermo Fisher. The integration teams have hit the ground running and are implementing their plans. We're confident in our ability to achieve the $80 million of total synergies we laid out when we announced the transaction back in May. 
Before I move on to guidance, let me give you a quick overview of where we stand with our capital deployment activities so far this year. With the additions of Affymetrix and FEI, we've deployed more than $5 billion on strategic M&A, $1 billion on stock buybacks, and we're on a path to approximately $240 million of returns in dividends in 2016. 
So it's been an active year for Thermo Fisher Scientific in terms of effectively deploying our capital to create value for our customers and our shareholders. 
Now let me give you a quick update on our guidance for 2016. As you saw on our press release, we're raising our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance for the year. As usual, Stephen will cover the details and assumptions, but in summary, we're raising guidance based on the addition of FEI, our strong operational performance in the first 9 months and a better foreign exchange environment. 
We now expect revenue for the year to be in a range of $18.25 billion to $18.39 billion. This would result in 8% growth over 2015. We're raising our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.11 at the midpoint to a new range of $8.19 to $8.30, which represents 11% to 12% growth year-over-year. 
Before I turn the call over to Stephen, let me sum up my remarks with a couple of takeaways. It was another great quarter in terms of our financial performance, and we extended our long track record for consistently delivering strong adjusted EPS growth. We closed on the acquisition of FEI and look forward to the new opportunities we'll have to create value and drive growth. With a strong 9 months behind us, we're on track to deliver another very successful year. 
With that, I'll now hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen?"

I'll take you through an overview of our third quarter results for the total company. Then I'll provide some color on our 4 segments and conclude with the updated 2016 guidance. Before I get into the details",1902,"So thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. I'll take you through an overview of our third quarter results for the total company. Then I'll provide some color on our 4 segments and conclude with the updated 2016 guidance. 
Before I get into the details of our financial performance, I thought it'd be helpful to provide a high-level view of how the quarter played out versus our expectations at the time of our last earnings call. Operationally, we're right in line with our expectations, both on organic growth and earnings generation. Given the level of volatility in foreign exchange rates so far this year, it was good to see that Q3 FX was $0.02 less adverse than we previously estimated. And finally, it was great to get the FEI deal closed in September, and we were able to deliver $0.04 of additional adjusted earnings per share in the quarter. 
So the high-level summary is we had a strong Q3 and we were able to deliver $0.06 of adjusted earnings per share above what we had previously expected. 
Now let me give you some more color on the quarter. Starting with adjusted earnings per share, as you saw in our press release, we grew adjusted EPS in Q3 by 13% to $2.03. GAAP EPS was $1.19, up 1% from Q3 last year. On the top line, our reported revenue grew 9% year-over-year. The components of our Q3 reported revenue included 4% organic growth, a 5% contribution from acquisitions and a slight headwind from currency translation. In Q3, we recognized just under $100 million of revenue from FEI. 
Looking at our growth by geography in Q3, this was very similar to what we saw in Q2. But as North America and Europe continued to grow in the low single digits, Asia Pacific grew in the low teens with another strong quarter from China, which grew in the high teens, as Marc mentioned, and rest of the world declined low single digits. 
Turning to our operational performance. Q3 adjusted operating income increased 11% and adjusted operating margin was 23.0%, up 40 basis points from Q3 of last year. Looking at the components of our adjusted operating margin performance in Q3, we delivered solid expansion from our organic growth, driven by our PPI business system and volume leverage, and this is partially offset by unfavorable business mix, strategic investments and a modest headwind from acquisitions. This quarter, FX had no impact on operating margin. 
Moving on to the details of the P&L. Total company adjusted gross margin came in at 48.9% in Q3, up 60 basis points from the prior year. Adjusted gross margin expansion was driven by strong productivity, positive contributions from acquisitions and FX, and partially offset by business mix and strategic investments. 
Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 21.8% of revenue, which is up 30 basis points versus Q3 2015. And R&D expense came in at 4.1% of revenue, down 10 basis points versus Q3 last year. R&D as a percent of our manufacturing revenue in the quarter was 6.1%. 
Looking at our results below the line. Net interest expense was $103 million, which is $10 million higher compared to Q3 last year, mainly as a result of financing related to our capital deployment actions this year. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 13.1%, which is 90 basis points lower than last year as a result of our tax planning initiatives and the timing of discrete items. However, this was in line with our expectations. Average diluted shares in the quarter were 397.4 million, down 4.6 million year-over-year as a result of the share buybacks we completed in Q1, partially offset by stock option dilution. 
Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. For the first 9 months, cash flow from continuing operations was $2 billion and free cash flow was $1.7 billion after deducting net capital expenditures of $290 million. This is approximately $350 million higher than our prior year cash flow for the same period. 
We ended the quarter with $2 billion in cash and investments. This is higher than normal due to the timing of the financing activities related to the FEI acquisition. $1.2 billion of this was used on the first business day of Q4 to pay down debt obligations. Our total debt at the end of Q3 was $18.9 billion, up $4.8 billion sequentially from Q2 as a result of the financing activities related to the FEI acquisition. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 4.2x total debt to adjusted EBITDA, up from 3.2x at the end of Q2. After we paid down the debt on the first day of Q4, the leverage ratio was down to 4.0x. 
Similar to previous quarters, we paid $60 million of dividends in Q3. And wrapping up my comments on our total company performance, ROIC continues to be strong. Our trailing 12 months suggested ROIC at the end of the quarter was 9.8%. 
So with that, I'll now provide you with some color on the performance of our 4 business segments. Starting with the Life Science Solutions segment, reported revenue increased 14% in Q3 and organic revenue growth was 7%. In the quarter, we continued to see strong growth across a number of the businesses, led by next-gen sequencing, bioproduction, and biosciences. Q3 adjusted operating income in Life Science Solutions increased 11% and adjusted operating margin was 30.1%, a decline of 70 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted operating margin was in line with our expectations. And the year-over-year contraction was driven by unfavorable business mix and the impact of acquisitions, partially offset by positive productivity and volume pull-through. 
In the Analytical Instruments segment, which includes the FEI acquisition, reported revenue increased 15% in Q3 and organic revenue growth was 3%. In the quarter, we had strong growth contributions from our chromatography and mass spec and our environmental instruments businesses, partially offset by continued weakness in the businesses serving our industrial end markets. Q3 adjusted operating income in Analytical Instruments increased 30% and adjusted operating margin was 21.2%, up 240 basis points year-over-year. In the quarter, we saw very strong productivity, favorable FX, good volume leverage and a positive impact from the FEI acquisition. Expansion from these drivers was partially offset by unfavorable product mix and the impact of strategic investments. 
Turning to Specialty Diagnostics segments. In Q3, reported and organic revenue both grew 3%. We saw good growth in our transplant diagnostics and immunodiagnostics businesses. Adjusted operating income increased 5% in Q3 and adjusted operating margin was 26.8%, up 40 basis points from the prior year. Adjusted operating margin was driven by strong productivity, good volume pull-through and FX tailwinds, partially offset by the impact of strategic investments and headwinds from business mix. 
Finally, in the Lab Products and Services segment. Q3 reported revenue increased 7% and organic growth was 6%. We delivered particularly strong growth in our Biopharma Services and channel businesses. Adjusted operating income in the segment increased 3% and adjusted operating margin was 14.8%, down 40 basis points from the prior year. Adjusted operating margin benefited from volume and productivity. However, these were more than offset by the impact of strategic investments and unfavorable business mix. 
Now I'll review the details of our updated full year 2016 guidance. As you saw in our press release, we're raising both our revenue and adjusted earnings per share guidance. We're increasing revenue guidance by $400 million at the midpoint and increasing our adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.11 at the midpoint. 
Let me walk you through the details starting with revenue. We continue to expect to generate about 4.5% organic growth for the full year 2016. Of the $400 million increase in revenue guidance at the midpoint, $30 million reflects a slightly less adverse FX environment and $370 million reflects the impact of FEI, which includes approximately $100 million we recognized in Q3. The FEI numbers are net of purchase accounting adjustments to reduce deferred revenue. 
Then on adjusted earnings per share, we've increased the midpoint of our adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.11. This reflects $0.02 from a less-adverse FX environment and $0.09 from the impact of FEI, which includes the $0.04 we recognized in Q3. 
And finally, with 3 quarters of strong operational performance behind us, and factoring in the addition of FEI, we're narrowing our revenue guidance range to $140 million and narrowing our adjusted earnings per share range to $0.11. 
So to sum all this up, the revised 2016 revenue guidance is now a range of $18.25 billion to $18.39 billion, which would represent 8% growth versus 2015. We expect acquisitions to contribute about 4.5% to our reported revenue growth in 2016, and FX is expected to be about a 1% headwind. 
In terms of adjusted earnings per share, our increased 2016 guidance is now a range of $8.19 to $8.30, with a midpoint of $8.245. This represents growth of 11% to 12% versus 2015. Excluding the FX impact, this would represent adjusted earnings per share growth of 12% to 13%. 
We are now expecting 50 to 60 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion year-over-year. This is slightly lower than our previous guidance of 60 to 70 basis points, primarily as a result of the impact of the FEI acquisition. 
So a few other details behind our 2016 guidance. Given the days impact on our 2016 fiscal calendar, I thought it'd be helpful to revisit our prior comments around phasing. Our Q1 had 4 more days and our Q4 will have 4 less days than the equivalent quarters in 2015. As a result, we're expecting the reported organic growth in Q4 to be essentially flat and the days adjusted organic growth in Q4 to be about 4.5%, consistent with our previous guidance. This will also result in a full year organic growth of about 4.5%, also consistent with our previous guidance. 
Net interest expense has increased $25 million from our previous guidance to $420 million as a result of the FEI acquisition. There's no change to our full year adjusted income tax rate guidance, which is still expected to be about 14%. This implies a 15% adjusted tax rate in Q4, slightly higher than the full year average due to the phasing earlier in the year of certain discrete tax planning actions. 
Our guidance does not include any future acquisitions, divestitures or share buybacks. The full year average diluted shares are estimated to be about 398 million, consistent with previous guidance. We're expecting net capital expenditure to be approximately $440 million, consistent with previous guidance. And finally we're still expecting about $2.72 billion of free cash flow for the full year 2016, consistent with previous guidance. We're forecasting that the operational cash flow generated by FEI during our period of ownership in 2016 will be offset by the related transaction and restructuring costs. 
As always, when interpreting our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance ranges, you should focus on the midpoint as a most likely view of how we see results playing out. 
Then, in summary, we've had 3 strong quarters of operational performance, a less-adverse FX environment than expected and our capital deployment activities are generating strong earnings benefits in 2016 and will enhance our strategic position over the long term. All this keeps us on track to deliver another excellent year. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Ken."

The outlook continues to be very bright. Let's talk about why the market is generally good. The science is good and the number of approved drugs continues to go well. Vaccines are continuing to play a more and more important role in health care, and that's a good positive as well. And as more and more biotech large molecule drugs are making it through the pipeline versus small molecules, biotech is a larger consumer on a relative basis of life science tools and diagnostics because it's not just in the research and clinical trial space, but all the way into production users of product. So actually the industry looks very bright. And then, obviously, on top of that is the company's position within the industry. And we have a great value proposition with these customers and we have consistently gained share for a number of years. We have strong relationships across all of the major biotech and pharmaceutical companies. And they see us as their partner to drive innovation and productivity. And that has allowed us to have a great historical performance or, more importantly, position for a very bright outlook in this end market."

And then in terms of the academic and government markets, the -- if you go back to what we said at the very beginning of the year, which it's probably the best way to think about what's different or what's the same, we expected that the year would start slower in the U.S. in academic and government, and then build as the year went on. And actually, the year started a little bit stronger than we had expected and has stayed steady with that at low single-digit growth. So it came a little bit early and it's been very steady. In terms of the other geographies, obviously, given that we expected academic and government to be a little better in aggregate, it basically says it must be slightly weaker and clearly, that's been offset by the strength in biopharma. So that's the sort of looking back in late January, what's changed. In terms of are we off-cycle versus others, I don't know. I think we're gaining share versus others, but that's my opinion. And when we thought about our range of outcomes for the year, we felt comfortable with raising the guidance in Q -- at the end of Q2 to 4.5% organic growth. And we feel comfortable reaffirming that 4.5% outlook. And the way I think about it is our commercial teams cover a range of customers, we focus on where the best opportunities are, and in a way, we don't force a lot of microlevel of analysis for the investment community.

And at least as I sit here today, I don't see any special effects one way or another, so next year should look like this year in terms of some of the high-level things. One of the things we mentioned at the beginning of the year, which we're continuing to execute on, which I'm encouraged about, is when the medical device tax was put on a 2-year hiatus, we spent the savings on investing in some midterm restructuring activities. We will get one more year of that hiatus and we will invest those monies as well, so there's no effect year-over-year. But that means we'll have invested about $30 million in actions to drive more efficiency kind of in the second half of '17 and '18, which, I think, is really good and encouraging and it's something that we embedded into our long-term model. So those are some of the things we're thinking about. And I know that Stephen is looking forward to giving a detailed set of guidance at the beginning of 2017."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today for our Q3 earnings call. We're pleased to tell you that we had another great quarter, and we're right where we should be at this point of the year. We delivered strong financial performance on the top and bottom lines. We continued to execute our growth strategy to best serve our customers and gain share. And we also completed our acquisition of FEI earlier than we expected, and the integration process is in full swing. So terrific progress across the board. I'll cover these points in more details in a few moments. But the key message is that with 3 great quarters behind us, we're well positioned to deliver another very successful year. I'll start by covering the Q3 financials at a high level, give you some color on our performance by end market and provide a recap of the quarterly highlights in the context of our growth strategy. Then I'll wrap up with our revised guidance. 
In terms of financials, revenue in Q3 grew 9% to $4.49 billion. Adjusted operating income was up 11%, and we expanded our adjusted operating margin by 40 basis points to 23%. 
Finally, I'm very pleased that we achieved a 13% increase in adjusted earnings per share to $2.03. As you know, adjusted EPS is our primary performance metric, and we continued to deliver consistently strong results to extend our long track record here. 
In summary, it was a great quarter financially, and our teams are really executing well to take advantage of the opportunities we have to help our customers meet their goals. 
As you hear from us every quarter, we're committed to building on our capabilities to being an even stronger partner for them, whether we're launching new products or making strategic acquisitions. The global environment obviously has its challenges, but we look at them as opportunities to help our customers be successful, and we're effectively leveraging our unique value proposition to gain share and drive growth. 
That's a good segue into our end market discussion. There's been a lot of commentary on the various end market dynamics. Let me provide you with some color on what we saw in our 4 end markets in Q3. In aggregate, our key end markets were in line with our expectations, and Q3 was similar to what we saw in Q2. At a high level, 2 of our end markets were essentially the same, academic and government and health care and diagnostics. And the other 2 changed a little. Pharma and biotech was a bit stronger, and industrial and applied was a bit weaker. I'll give you a few more details about each one. 
In pharma and biotech, we grew in the low double digits in Q3. The market dynamics remained very healthy, and we continue to effectively leverage our depth of capabilities to gain share with these customers. Growth in our bioproduction and BioPharma Services businesses were particularly strong in the quarter, and we also had strong performance here in our chromatography and mass spec business. 
Academic and government end markets grew slightly in the quarter, and industrial and applied end markets declined slightly. And in health care and diagnostics, our growth overall was similar to last quarter. This was highlighted by strong performance in our transplant diagnostics business and particularly strong growth in our clinical next-gen sequencing business. So again, not much difference to our end markets overall compared with Q2. 
Now I'll cover some of our Q3 business highlights in the context of our growth strategy. As you know, we continue to follow a clear and consistent strategy to strengthen our position in targeted end markets and geographic regions. We're focused on developing high-impact innovative new products, expanding our scale in Asia Pacific and emerging markets and enhancing our unique customer value proposition. 
I'll start with innovation as I usually do. We launched a number of new products during the quarter across our businesses, but I'd like to focus my remarks today on a few examples of how we're increasing our depth of capabilities for customers working in the clinic. Late July marked the annual meeting of the American Association of Clinical Chemistry. We showcased a number of assays, instruments and software under our Thermo Scientific premier brand, so let me highlight a few of them. 
First, we were pleased to be cleared by the U.S. FDA to expand the use of our leading BRAHMS PCT sepsis test. It can now be used in the emergency room or other medical wards before a patient is admitted to the ICU. Our PCT test was previously cleared only for the use with critically ill patients on their first day in the ICU. By administering the sepsis test much earlier, clinicians can protect a broader patient population and help to reduce the associated health care costs. We also worked in tandem with our key PCT license partners, Roche Diagnostics and bioMérieux, so that they can receive clearance to run the test on their extensive installed base of instruments in the U.S. This will significantly expand access to this valuable diagnostic tool. 
We also received clearance for several other diagnostic assays as well, one was the DRI Hydrocodone assay, which has a high level of sensitivity to help doctors quickly identify possible opioid abuse. 
We also received clearance for 2 new EliA IgG autoimmunity tests for more effective diagnosis of thyroid disease. 
Last, for greater accuracy in the clinical lab, we launched LabLink XL 2.0 software, so clinicians can compare and validate results in real-time from labs around the world. 
I also want to make a comment on our next-gen sequencing business as well, where we're seeing nice momentum in customer adoption of our sequencers, including the new S5 and S5 XL that we introduced about a year ago. 
In the quarter, we launched a number of new assays, including additions to our Oncomine family of high-value oncology kits. Our new long cell-free DNA as well as our BRCA1 and 2 assays are all designed for NGS analysis on our Ion Torrent platform. 
We also launched the new Ion AmpliSeq transcriptome human gene expression kit, which enables the simultaneous analysis of more than 20,000 genes in a single assay using our Ion Chef sample prep technology as part of the workflow. 
In terms of highlights from a geographic perspective, we're pleased to deliver another strong quarter of growth in Asia Pacific and emerging markets, which is the second pillar of our growth strategy. Our results in Q3 were led by outstanding performance in China and India. China continues to be a significant contributor with growth in the high teens during the quarter. We are positioning Thermo Fisher to not only take advantage of the significant opportunities available in China today, but also to help those customers meet their future plans. An important aspect of that is understanding the government's longer-term focus. 
During my last visit there in Q3, I spent time in Guangzhou and had the opportunity to meet with the municipal party secretary. We formalized a strategic partnership that involves working with local companies and scientific institutions in Guangzhou to advance health care, environmental protection and food safety. This is part of a national plan to boost development in the South China region. 
We're also partnering with HEALTH Biomed, a leading provider of clinical diagnostic and pharmaceutical products in China. The goal is to advance the development of molecular diagnostic kits for infectious disease and pharmacogenomic screening. The kits will be based on our Applied Biosystems CE platform and is another great example of our ability to support precision medicine initiatives that are part of China's Five-Year Plan. 
These are just 2 of the examples from many that we have in terms of long-term growth in China. I always leave China's even more energized about our prospects. It's a large and growing market. Our scale gives us a strong competitive advantage, and we're well-aligned with the company's strategic -- the country's strategic priorities. 
I also spent some time in South Korea in Q3, and a specific opportunity I want to highlight there is the demand for our BioPharma Services capabilities. South Korea is a key location for clinical trials research because of strong government support, its modern infrastructure and an easily-accessible patient population. During the quarter, we opened a new state-of-the-art facility in Seoul to provide local and global companies with a comprehensive clinical trial support. This complements our BioPharma Services capabilities in the region, including those in Singapore, China, India and Japan. 
South Korea is also a great example of how we're leveraging our unique customer value proposition, which is the third pillar of our growth strategy. Korea's GDP is growing in line with many developed countries, but we're clearly gaining share here. That's because of the size of our sales force, our full suite of products and services and the way we effectively bring it all together to help our customers drive innovation and productivity. We have outstanding customer relationships across Korea and are well positioned to continue to gain share. 
As you know, we continue to invest to strengthen our customer value proposition and a major highlight in Q3 was our acquisition of FEI, which we completed in September. FEI is a well-respected business with a leading position in electron microscopy. We're excited to add these technologies to our Analytical Instruments offering and extend their reach to our large Life Science customer base. 
I attended the Day 1 town halls at FEI sites in the Czech Republic and The Netherlands. I was able to meet many of our 3,000 new colleagues and it was great to see their enthusiasm about joining Thermo Fisher. I've been impressed with the FEI teams and the operations I visited so far. The Brno side in the Czech Republic, in particular, is a world-class manufacturing facility that produces a wide range of FEI products. It's also strategically located in an area with a highly skilled workforce. The ability to leverage this site to support other parts of our company will help us to further optimize our global footprint and increase our presence in lower-cost regions. 
So we're very bullish about the many advantages that FEI brings to Thermo Fisher. The integration teams have hit the ground running and are implementing their plans. We're confident in our ability to achieve the $80 million of total synergies we laid out when we announced the transaction back in May. 
Before I move on to guidance, let me give you a quick overview of where we stand with our capital deployment activities so far this year. With the additions of Affymetrix and FEI, we've deployed more than $5 billion on strategic M&A, $1 billion on stock buybacks, and we're on a path to approximately $240 million of returns in dividends in 2016. 
So it's been an active year for Thermo Fisher Scientific in terms of effectively deploying our capital to create value for our customers and our shareholders. 
Now let me give you a quick update on our guidance for 2016. As you saw on our press release, we're raising our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance for the year. As usual, Stephen will cover the details and assumptions, but in summary, we're raising guidance based on the addition of FEI, our strong operational performance in the first 9 months and a better foreign exchange environment. 
We now expect revenue for the year to be in a range of $18.25 billion to $18.39 billion. This would result in 8% growth over 2015. We're raising our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.11 at the midpoint to a new range of $8.19 to $8.30, which represents 11% to 12% growth year-over-year. 
Before I turn the call over to Stephen, let me sum up my remarks with a couple of takeaways. It was another great quarter in terms of our financial performance, and we extended our long track record for consistently delivering strong adjusted EPS growth. We closed on the acquisition of FEI and look forward to the new opportunities we'll have to create value and drive growth. With a strong 9 months behind us, we're on track to deliver another very successful year. 
With that, I'll now hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen?"

I'll take you through an overview of our third quarter results for the total company. Then I'll provide some color on our 4 segments and conclude with the updated 2016 guidance. Before I get into the details",1902,"So thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. I'll take you through an overview of our third quarter results for the total company. Then I'll provide some color on our 4 segments and conclude with the updated 2016 guidance. 
Before I get into the details of our financial performance, I thought it'd be helpful to provide a high-level view of how the quarter played out versus our expectations at the time of our last earnings call. Operationally, we're right in line with our expectations, both on organic growth and earnings generation. Given the level of volatility in foreign exchange rates so far this year, it was good to see that Q3 FX was $0.02 less adverse than we previously estimated. And finally, it was great to get the FEI deal closed in September, and we were able to deliver $0.04 of additional adjusted earnings per share in the quarter. 
So the high-level summary is we had a strong Q3 and we were able to deliver $0.06 of adjusted earnings per share above what we had previously expected. 
Now let me give you some more color on the quarter. Starting with adjusted earnings per share, as you saw in our press release, we grew adjusted EPS in Q3 by 13% to $2.03. GAAP EPS was $1.19, up 1% from Q3 last year. On the top line, our reported revenue grew 9% year-over-year. The components of our Q3 reported revenue included 4% organic growth, a 5% contribution from acquisitions and a slight headwind from currency translation. In Q3, we recognized just under $100 million of revenue from FEI. 
Looking at our growth by geography in Q3, this was very similar to what we saw in Q2. But as North America and Europe continued to grow in the low single digits, Asia Pacific grew in the low teens with another strong quarter from China, which grew in the high teens, as Marc mentioned, and rest of the world declined low single digits. 
Turning to our operational performance. Q3 adjusted operating income increased 11% and adjusted operating margin was 23.0%, up 40 basis points from Q3 of last year. Looking at the components of our adjusted operating margin performance in Q3, we delivered solid expansion from our organic growth, driven by our PPI business system and volume leverage, and this is partially offset by unfavorable business mix, strategic investments and a modest headwind from acquisitions. This quarter, FX had no impact on operating margin. 
Moving on to the details of the P&L. Total company adjusted gross margin came in at 48.9% in Q3, up 60 basis points from the prior year. Adjusted gross margin expansion was driven by strong productivity, positive contributions from acquisitions and FX, and partially offset by business mix and strategic investments. 
Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 21.8% of revenue, which is up 30 basis points versus Q3 2015. And R&D expense came in at 4.1% of revenue, down 10 basis points versus Q3 last year. R&D as a percent of our manufacturing revenue in the quarter was 6.1%. 
Looking at our results below the line. Net interest expense was $103 million, which is $10 million higher compared to Q3 last year, mainly as a result of financing related to our capital deployment actions this year. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 13.1%, which is 90 basis points lower than last year as a result of our tax planning initiatives and the timing of discrete items. However, this was in line with our expectations. Average diluted shares in the quarter were 397.4 million, down 4.6 million year-over-year as a result of the share buybacks we completed in Q1, partially offset by stock option dilution. 
Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. For the first 9 months, cash flow from continuing operations was $2 billion and free cash flow was $1.7 billion after deducting net capital expenditures of $290 million. This is approximately $350 million higher than our prior year cash flow for the same period. 
We ended the quarter with $2 billion in cash and investments. This is higher than normal due to the timing of the financing activities related to the FEI acquisition. $1.2 billion of this was used on the first business day of Q4 to pay down debt obligations. Our total debt at the end of Q3 was $18.9 billion, up $4.8 billion sequentially from Q2 as a result of the financing activities related to the FEI acquisition. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 4.2x total debt to adjusted EBITDA, up from 3.2x at the end of Q2. After we paid down the debt on the first day of Q4, the leverage ratio was down to 4.0x. 
Similar to previous quarters, we paid $60 million of dividends in Q3. And wrapping up my comments on our total company performance, ROIC continues to be strong. Our trailing 12 months suggested ROIC at the end of the quarter was 9.8%. 
So with that, I'll now provide you with some color on the performance of our 4 business segments. Starting with the Life Science Solutions segment, reported revenue increased 14% in Q3 and organic revenue growth was 7%. In the quarter, we continued to see strong growth across a number of the businesses, led by next-gen sequencing, bioproduction, and biosciences. Q3 adjusted operating income in Life Science Solutions increased 11% and adjusted operating margin was 30.1%, a decline of 70 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted operating margin was in line with our expectations. And the year-over-year contraction was driven by unfavorable business mix and the impact of acquisitions, partially offset by positive productivity and volume pull-through. 
In the Analytical Instruments segment, which includes the FEI acquisition, reported revenue increased 15% in Q3 and organic revenue growth was 3%. In the quarter, we had strong growth contributions from our chromatography and mass spec and our environmental instruments businesses, partially offset by continued weakness in the businesses serving our industrial end markets. Q3 adjusted operating income in Analytical Instruments increased 30% and adjusted operating margin was 21.2%, up 240 basis points year-over-year. In the quarter, we saw very strong productivity, favorable FX, good volume leverage and a positive impact from the FEI acquisition. Expansion from these drivers was partially offset by unfavorable product mix and the impact of strategic investments. 
Turning to Specialty Diagnostics segments. In Q3, reported and organic revenue both grew 3%. We saw good growth in our transplant diagnostics and immunodiagnostics businesses. Adjusted operating income increased 5% in Q3 and adjusted operating margin was 26.8%, up 40 basis points from the prior year. Adjusted operating margin was driven by strong productivity, good volume pull-through and FX tailwinds, partially offset by the impact of strategic investments and headwinds from business mix. 
Finally, in the Lab Products and Services segment. Q3 reported revenue increased 7% and organic growth was 6%. We delivered particularly strong growth in our Biopharma Services and channel businesses. Adjusted operating income in the segment increased 3% and adjusted operating margin was 14.8%, down 40 basis points from the prior year. Adjusted operating margin benefited from volume and productivity. However, these were more than offset by the impact of strategic investments and unfavorable business mix. 
Now I'll review the details of our updated full year 2016 guidance. As you saw in our press release, we're raising both our revenue and adjusted earnings per share guidance. We're increasing revenue guidance by $400 million at the midpoint and increasing our adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.11 at the midpoint. 
Let me walk you through the details starting with revenue. We continue to expect to generate about 4.5% organic growth for the full year 2016. Of the $400 million increase in revenue guidance at the midpoint, $30 million reflects a slightly less adverse FX environment and $370 million reflects the impact of FEI, which includes approximately $100 million we recognized in Q3. The FEI numbers are net of purchase accounting adjustments to reduce deferred revenue. 
Then on adjusted earnings per share, we've increased the midpoint of our adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.11. This reflects $0.02 from a less-adverse FX environment and $0.09 from the impact of FEI, which includes the $0.04 we recognized in Q3. 
And finally, with 3 quarters of strong operational performance behind us, and factoring in the addition of FEI, we're narrowing our revenue guidance range to $140 million and narrowing our adjusted earnings per share range to $0.11. 
So to sum all this up, the revised 2016 revenue guidance is now a range of $18.25 billion to $18.39 billion, which would represent 8% growth versus 2015. We expect acquisitions to contribute about 4.5% to our reported revenue growth in 2016, and FX is expected to be about a 1% headwind. 
In terms of adjusted earnings per share, our increased 2016 guidance is now a range of $8.19 to $8.30, with a midpoint of $8.245. This represents growth of 11% to 12% versus 2015. Excluding the FX impact, this would represent adjusted earnings per share growth of 12% to 13%. 
We are now expecting 50 to 60 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion year-over-year. This is slightly lower than our previous guidance of 60 to 70 basis points, primarily as a result of the impact of the FEI acquisition. 
So a few other details behind our 2016 guidance. Given the days impact on our 2016 fiscal calendar, I thought it'd be helpful to revisit our prior comments around phasing. Our Q1 had 4 more days and our Q4 will have 4 less days than the equivalent quarters in 2015. As a result, we're expecting the reported organic growth in Q4 to be essentially flat and the days adjusted organic growth in Q4 to be about 4.5%, consistent with our previous guidance. This will also result in a full year organic growth of about 4.5%, also consistent with our previous guidance. 
Net interest expense has increased $25 million from our previous guidance to $420 million as a result of the FEI acquisition. There's no change to our full year adjusted income tax rate guidance, which is still expected to be about 14%. This implies a 15% adjusted tax rate in Q4, slightly higher than the full year average due to the phasing earlier in the year of certain discrete tax planning actions. 
Our guidance does not include any future acquisitions, divestitures or share buybacks. The full year average diluted shares are estimated to be about 398 million, consistent with previous guidance. We're expecting net capital expenditure to be approximately $440 million, consistent with previous guidance. And finally we're still expecting about $2.72 billion of free cash flow for the full year 2016, consistent with previous guidance. We're forecasting that the operational cash flow generated by FEI during our period of ownership in 2016 will be offset by the related transaction and restructuring costs. 
As always, when interpreting our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance ranges, you should focus on the midpoint as a most likely view of how we see results playing out. 
Then, in summary, we've had 3 strong quarters of operational performance, a less-adverse FX environment than expected and our capital deployment activities are generating strong earnings benefits in 2016 and will enhance our strategic position over the long term. All this keeps us on track to deliver another excellent year. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Ken."

The outlook continues to be very bright. Let's talk about why the market is generally good. The science is good and the number of approved drugs continues to go well. Vaccines are continuing to play a more and more important role in health care, and that's a good positive as well. And as more and more biotech large molecule drugs are making it through the pipeline versus small molecules, biotech is a larger consumer on a relative basis of life science tools and diagnostics because it's not just in the research and clinical trial space, but all the way into production users of product. So actually the industry looks very bright. And then, obviously, on top of that is the company's position within the industry. And we have a great value proposition with these customers and we have consistently gained share for a number of years.

And actually, the year started a little bit stronger than we had expected and has stayed steady with that at low single-digit growth. So it came a little bit early and it's been very steady. In terms of the other geographies, obviously, given that we expected academic and government to be a little better in aggregate, it basically says it must be slightly weaker and clearly, that's been offset by the strength in biopharma. So that's the sort of looking back in late January, what's changed. In terms of are we off-cycle versus others, I don't know. I think we're gaining share versus others, but that's my opinion. And when we thought about our range of outcomes for the year, we felt comfortable with raising the guidance in Q -- at the end of Q2 to 4.5% organic growth. And we feel comfortable reaffirming that 4.5% outlook. And the way I think about it is our commercial teams cover a range of customers, we focus on where the best opportunities are, and in a way, we don't force a lot of microlevel of analysis for the investment community. It's our job to manage through it and we feel well positioned to deliver a really nice year in terms of performance."

The more routine volume-related businesses, your basic consumables used every day has been a little bit softer, but not a change in trend. So what would have to happen for a pickup in growth? 2 different factors could help drive it. You'll need volume [ph] , which is a little bit higher level of activity and the basic consumption of the products for consumables would help. And the other is we have a number of programs that are driving our life science tools into the clinic, and they will be meaningful drivers as well. So the one -- driving into the clinic, that's in our control entirely and that puts us very optimistic about the midterm prospects for the diagnostic business. And then we'll always take the upside if the market's getting better."

And at least as I sit here today, I don't see any special effects one way or another, so next year should look like this year in terms of some of the high-level things. One of the things we mentioned at the beginning of the year, which we're continuing to execute on, which I'm encouraged about, is when the medical device tax was put on a 2-year hiatus, we spent the savings on investing in some midterm restructuring activities. We will get one more year of that hiatus and we will invest those monies as well, so there's no effect year-over-year. But that means we'll have invested about $30 million in actions to drive more efficiency kind of in the second half of '17 and '18, which, I think, is really good and encouraging and it's something that we embedded into our long-term model.
