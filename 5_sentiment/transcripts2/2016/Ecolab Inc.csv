Hello, everyone, and welcome to Ecolab's fourth quarter conference call. With me today are Doug Baker, Ecolab's Chairman and CEO; and our CFO, Dan Schmechel.A discussion of our results along with the earnings release and the slides referencin",960,"Thank you. Hello, everyone, and welcome to Ecolab's fourth quarter conference call. With me today are Doug Baker, Ecolab's Chairman and CEO; and our CFO, Dan Schmechel.
A discussion of our results along with the earnings release and the slides referencing the quarter's results and our outlook are available on Ecolab's website at ecolab.com/investor.
Please take a moment to read the cautionary statements on these materials stating that this teleconference, the discussion and the slides include estimates of future performance.
These are forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially from those projected.
Factors that could cause actual results to differ are described in the section of our most recent Form 10-K and 10-Q under Item 1A, Risk Factors, and in our posted materials. We also refer you to the supplemental diluted earnings per share information in the release. 
Starting with a brief overview of the quarter. Continued strong new account gains and new product introductions drove good fixed-currency sales growth in our Global Institutional, Industrial and Other segments during the fourth quarter, nearly offsetting a decline in Global Energy sales. Delivered product cost savings, ongoing cost-efficiency work and synergies led the growth -- led the strong adjusted operating margin expansion, more than offsetting the impact of softening economies, weaker oil prices and increased currency headwinds. These, along with the lower tax rate and fewer shares outstanding, drove the adjusted earnings per share increase. 
While 2016 will present challenges, we are prepared to respond. Once again, we will focus on the fundamental Ecolab growth strategies that have proven successful through repeated economic cycles: the best products and service for our customers to give them the best results and lowest operating costs. We expect them to succeed again in 2016. 
Looking to the first quarter, we expect our Global Institutional, Industrial and Other segments to continue to show solid fixed-currency growth, outpacing their markets and softer international economies as they leverage investments we have made to further improved sales and service force effectiveness and profitability and more than offset results from our Global Energy business. We look for our first quarter earnings to show very attractive growth before currency, increasing 5% to 14% as we continue to aggressively drive business growth. 
Adjusted earnings per share are expected to reflect about 14 percentage points of unfavorable currency impact, yielding adjusted EPS in a $0.73 to $0.80 per share range. We look for comparative results to improve as 2016 progresses and show strong results for the full year with 9% to 13% adjusted earnings per share growth before the unfavorable impact of currency and the Venezuela deconsolidation. We expect currency and the Venezuela deconsolidation will penalize 2016 growth by approximately 9 percentage points. Net, we expect Ecolab to once again significantly outperform its markets and show a superior performance in 2016 while also investing in the key drivers for future sustainable above-average earnings growth. 
Moving to some highlights from the fourth quarter and as discussed in our press release, reported fourth quarter earnings per share were $0.69. On an adjusted basis, excluding special gains and charges and discrete tax items from both years, fourth quarter 2015 adjusted earnings per share increased 2% to $1.22 despite a $0.13 or 11% currency headwind. 
The adjusted earnings per share growth was driven by delivered product and other cost savings, cost efficiencies, synergies, new products and lower tax rate and share count. Our fixed currency acquisition-adjusted sales were modestly lower as our Institutional, Industrial and Other segments grew 4% but were offset by lower energy sales. Regional sales growth was led by Europe and Latin America, excluding Venezuela. 
Adjusted fixed currency operating margins showed very strong growth, expanding 130 basis points. In 2015's difficult environment, we focused on driving new business gains and lower costs. We used our industry-leading product innovation and service strengths to help customers achieve better results and lower operating costs and through these, aggressively drove new account gains across all of our segments. 
Further, raw material cost savings, along with our cost-efficiency work, helped to offset these headwinds. Importantly, we also continued to make investments in our key growth drivers. 
These actions delivered a strong fundamental business performance in 2015 with double-digit profit growth before currency. The fourth quarter represented another strong performance on this basis, growing 13% despite the further deterioration in energy markets. 
As noted earlier, the business environment has become more challenging in recent months as the dollar strengthened, energy markets weakened and global economies softened. Nonetheless, against that challenging backdrop, we look for 2016 earnings before currency and Venezuela deconsolidation effects to continue to show strong growth as we implement the same approach in 2015 -- or in 2016 as we did in 2015 and aggressively drive market share and new business gains. 
We expect first quarter adjusted earnings per share from operations to rise 5% to 14% before currency and the Venezuela deconsolidation, with adjusted earnings per share in the $0.73 to $0.80 range, reflecting a currency drag of approximately 14% to earnings per share growth. 
Results are expected to improve as the year progresses with the second half outperforming the first half. We look for our full year adjusted earnings before currency and the Venezuela deconsolidation to increase 9% to 13%. We expect adjusted earnings per share in the $4.35 to $4.55 per share range with currency and Venezuela deconsolidation representing an approximate 9% drag to results. 
In summary, despite a very challenging global economic and market environment, we expect our underlying business to continue to deliver very strong fundamental earnings in 2016. We remain confident in our business, our markets and our people as well as our capacities to meet our aggressive growth objectives over the coming years. 
And now here's Doug Baker with some comments."
268799,321351847,938341,"Ecolab Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 23, 2016",2016-02-23,"Earnings Calls","Ecolab Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike. First, I'll just offer some perspective on '15 and then talk '16 as well. So 2015, we had very solid business performance that was clearly shrouded by FX. But if you take it net of translation FX, our EPS is 12% for the year and 13% in Q4,",626,"Thanks, Mike. First, I'll just offer some perspective on '15 and then talk '16 as well. 
So 2015, we had very solid business performance that was clearly shrouded by FX. But if you take it net of translation FX, our EPS is 12% for the year and 13% in Q4, and this includes the full impact of energy in the year and in the quarter, full impact of transaction FX. It includes system investments of $0.10 for the year, which is $0.03 over last year. It also includes an increase in sales and service headcount, i.e., we continue to invest in the business while driving double-digit results and obviously, not the perfect environment. 
Our major businesses drove this. All of them grew faster than their markets, including energy. While energy was hit clearly by the oil and gas market headwinds, it outperformed. So in a market with a 60% decline in U.S. rigs, 50% drop in oil prices, our energy business declined 8% top line for the year, 14% at OI. 
If you parse through energy and look at the core of the business, the production, OFC and downstream collectively, they grew top line 1%, and OI 8% for the year. So the core of that business managed very well. 
The rest of our businesses, I'd say, also outperformed the markets and had a very, very strong year. So Institutional globally grew sales 6%; OI, 12%. F&B grew sales 6%; OI, 16%. Water grew sales 6%; OI, 12%. Specialty Services, 7% and 16%. If you add in the rest, paper, health care, et cetera, the total of all those businesses was 5% growth and 12% OI. 
We drove it the old-fashioned way. We continue to take share. We're outgrowing our major competitors in the markets we compete in as our team continue to drive innovation and delivered new business. This is what drove the underlying 12% EPS performance. 
So as you look at 2016, it's going to be much more of the same as we continued FX headwinds, see more of the same market conditions. We expect the economies globally to be choppy but manageable. There's going to be continued tough oil and gas markets offset, in part, by favorable raw material markets, which is the flip side of that coin, but most importantly, we're going to have continued strong underlying business execution. 
So we expect to deliver double-digit underlying EPS growth again in 2016. The range is 9 to 13. We expect energy to continue to be impacted by the tough market conditions, but our natural raw materials price hedge will mitigate this negative impact. Energy, we do not believe, will be as negative with last year. But given our forecast position of no 2016 energy market turnaround, we will likely decline modestly year-on-year, but at a slower rate than last year. 
The balance of the business is poised to have another very good year, a bit stronger than 2015 on top line and continued margin expansion. Net, we feel good about the business in '15 -- or in '16 as we continue to invest for the long term. We're going to continue to invest in R&D and systems field technologies, sales firepower, talent development. We're very, very excited about the future, and I think our investment belies that. Our positioning and promise of clean water, safe food, abundant energy, healthy environment, we believe, remains even more relevant or is more relevant as we go forward. So the business continues to do well. The underlying results, I believe, demonstrate our resilience as we continue to deliver double-digit EPS when you exclude translation FX and far from perfect market conditions. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Mike, and we can open it up for Q&A."

U.S., we expect U.S. to continue to slog along with positive GDP, but there's some positive impacts in the U.S. for us, i.e, in the foodservice market and some of the others, where, frankly, cheap oil price starts driving consumer behavior in our favor at least in that part of the business. We think Western Europe's likely to be worse in 2016 than in '15 as the baseline economy. It was probably a big positive surprise last year, and we would expect it to be modestly off in terms of economic growth but still growing this year. So we're not predicting recession. China still more. If you look at Latin America, clearly Brazil's going to be not very healthy. So I'd call it a tick off, but I don't really believe that's what we're trying to forecast the driver. As long as it's we should be fine and able to grow. I think next year, I think our base sales are going to be better in 2016 than '15."

Well, I would say this year, clearly margin accelerated throughout the year, which is what we've predicted, and that was that raw material savings increases as the year went on, which is how they manifest themselves. We also had the other side, which is the energy business, cost savings effects really build throughout the year, too, as we had to take out heads and other things and obviously have more heads out of your business in Q4 than you did in Q1 if it's an initiative that you undertake at the beginning of the year. In '16, we would expect margins to continue to expand at a somewhat slower pace than they expanded in 2015, and really that's mainly driven by the fact that raw material delta isn't going to be as significant as savings. It will be a savings, but not the same level in '16 versus '15 as '15 was to '14, but we would expect margins to continue to accelerate and improve."

I think production will be -- it's going to be about even with last year for the year. So we don't think that's really going to be the big negative impact, but there may be some slight negative in our OFC production business, not material and not significant. And in downstream, we would expect to be quite strong this year as it goes forward. I would say net, on balance, energy, simply because the comparative period becomes much easier, it's going to be at worst, less of a drag than last year, at better maybe no drag in terms of OI."

If you can just walk through some of the assumption, underlying assumptions, particularly in the WellChem should decline, you're assuming production is flat, but are we going to end up or are you anticipating a scenario, where the production goes to kind of the cheaper to produce type of oil that just requires less chemicals? In other words, I'm trying to get to what the assumption are if we have kind of flat production and only modestly lower top line. What's embedded in that I assume there's a little bit of pricing, but are we in a situation where just the well that they're going after is just cheaper to get oil right now?"

I guess, I mean, we go a little higher on this for a few minutes. I think the big change year-on-year in terms of -- when we talk about oils impact, the energy impact on our business is the fact that we're going to get entirely different base. So whe",602,"Yes. I guess, I mean, we go a little higher on this for a few minutes. I think the big change year-on-year in terms of -- when we talk about oils impact, the energy impact on our business is the fact that we're going to get entirely different base. So when we're giving an EPS forecast and growth forecast I mean, obviously, we're comparing against 2015, not '14, and that's not insignificant when you look at the energy business. So the really only negative comparison we have is the first quarter, and that's when the market with a started diving and our business started feeling the impacts of the market. So in terms of WellChem, we think WellChem's going to be a negative for the year but nowhere near the types of numbers we saw last year. It's going to be mitigated by the fact that it's against last year. We've gained share in a couple of key segments, and we feel a lot of the rig count decline is in the base as we move forward. U.S. is down 62%. So even a 20% decline isn't all that material given that you've already taken 60 out of the market. You have OFC. It's going to be flattish for the year. We have pricing pressure there. We'll continue to have fairly solid volumes. You've got some new business coming on. I mean, we have secured some new business. Some fields came on during the year that were basically CapEx that was spent prior years and/or platforms that went out to see, et cetera. That's going to be net new business. In total, we look at that flat to modestly down but very modest. And in the downstream, we expect to have a stronger year this year on the top line than last year. So net, I think it's a very modest decline in the top line to something resembling this year's decline, which is 8%. I think it's going to be less than that would be the downside case. When you look at OI, there's mitigating -- we've got cost savings going this year, started really seeing full effects in Q4. They're going to annualize. The headcount moves have been taken. There are not a lot more anticipated or any really anticipated going forward, but we're going to be very judicious about heads that we add as we move forward. So cost savings are going to be a bigger positive, and the raw material markets are going to continue to benefit the energy business. Now part of that is given back in the form of cost-plus arrangements but not all of it, and so last year, we had some margin declines. Fourth quarter margin was up. Some of that was onetime benefits. But was probably up if you neutralize for that about 90 basis points in the fourth quarter. We don't expect it to be that strong throughout the whole year. But we do have steps in place now that we think mitigate margin decline, and we think volume is going to be not a significant story this year. So that's the energy story. In net, this natural hedge we have of energy pain offset by raw material gain in the balance of the business is going to be true next year, too. Those are almost a net neutral in 2015. We would expect there to be close to a net neutral in 2016, and so then it's back to the industrial Institutional and Other businesses, which we think are going to have another strong year. I mean, that's the fundamental equation."

Hello, everyone, and welcome to Ecolab's Fourth Quarter Conference Call. With me today are Doug Baker, Ecolab's Chairman and CEO; and our CFO, Dan Schmechel.
A discussion of our results along with our earnings release and the slides referencing the quarter's results and our outlook are available on Ecolab's website at ecolab.com/investor.
Please take a moment to read the cautionary statements on these materials stating that this teleconference, the discussion and the slides include estimates of future performance.
These are forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially from those projected.
Factors that could cause actual results to differ are described in the section of our most recent Form 10-K and 10-Q under Item 1A, Risk Factors, and in our posted materials. We also refer you to the supplemental diluted earnings per share information in the release.
Starting with a brief overview of the quarter. Continued strong new account gains and new product introductions drove good fixed-currency sales growth in our Global Institutional, Industrial and Other segments during the fourth quarter, nearly offsetting a decline in Global Energy sales. Delivered product cost savings, ongoing cost-efficiency work and synergies led the growth -- signaled a strong adjusted operating margin expansion, more than offsetting the impact of softening economies, weaker oil prices and increased currency headwinds. These, along with the lower tax rate and fewer shares outstanding, drove the adjusted earnings per share increase.
While 2016 will present challenges, we are prepared to respond. Once again, we will focus on the fundamental Ecolab growth strategies that have proven successful through repeated economic cycles. The best products and service for our customers to give them the best results and lowest operating costs. We expect them to succeed again in 2016. 
Looking to the first quarter, we expect our Global Institutional, Industrial and Other segments to continue to show solid fixed-currency growth, outpacing their markets and softer international economies as they leverage investments we have made to further improve sales and service force effectiveness and profitability and more than offset results from our Global Energy business. We look for our first quarter earnings to show very attractive growth before currency, increasing 5% to 14% as we continue to aggressively drive business growth. 
Adjusted earnings per share are expected to reflect about 14 percentage points of unfavorable currency impact, yielding adjusted EPS in a $0.73 to $0.80 per share range. We look for comparative results to improve as 2016 progresses and show strong results for the full year with 9% to 13% adjusted earnings per share growth before the unfavorable impact of currency and the Venezuela deconsolidation. We expect currency and the Venezuela deconsolidation will penalize 2016 growth by approximately 9 percentage points. Net, we expect Ecolab to once again significantly outperform its markets and show a superior performance in 2016 while also investing in the key drivers for future sustainable above-average earnings growth. 
Moving to some highlights from the fourth quarter and as discussed in our press release, reported fourth quarter earnings per share was $0.69. On an adjusted basis, excluding special gains and charges and discrete tax items from both years, fourth quarter 2015 adjusted earnings per share increased 2% to $1.22 despite a $0.13 or 11% currency headwind.
The adjusted earnings per share growth was driven by delivered product and other cost savings, cost efficiencies, synergies, new products and lower tax rate and share count. Our fixed currency acquisition-adjusted sales were modestly lower as our Institutional, Industrial and Other segments grew 4%, but were offset by lower energy sales. Regional sales growth was led by Europe and Latin America, excluding Venezuela. 
Adjusted fixed currency operating margins showed very strong growth, expanding 130 basis points. In 2015's difficult environment, we focused on driving new business gains and lower costs. We used our industry-leading product innovation and service strengths to help customers achieve better results and lower operating costs and through these, aggressively drove new account gains across all of our segments.
Further, raw material cost savings, along with our cost-efficiency work, helped to offset these headwinds. Importantly, we also continued to make investments in our key growth drivers. 
These actions delivered a strong fundamental business performance in 2015 with double-digit profit growth before currency. The fourth quarter represented another strong performance on this basis, growing 13% despite the further deterioration in energy markets.
As noted earlier, the business environment has become more challenging in recent months as the dollar strengthened, energy markets weakened and global economies softened. Nonetheless, against that challenging backdrop, we look for 2016 earnings before currency and Venezuela deconsolidation effects to continue to show strong growth as we implement the same approach in 2015 -- or in 2016 as we did in 2015 and aggressively drive market share and new business gains. 
We expect first quarter adjusted earnings per share from operations to rise 5% to 14% before currency and the Venezuela deconsolidation, with adjusted earnings per share in the $0.73 to $0.80 set range, reflecting a currency drag of approximately 14% to earnings per share growth.
Results are expected to improve as the year progresses with the second half outperforming the first half. We look for our full year adjusted earnings before currency and the Venezuela deconsolidation to increase 9% to 13%. We expect adjusted earnings per share in the $4.35 to $4.55 per share range with currency and Venezuela deconsolidation representing an approximate 9% drag to results.
In summary, despite a very challenging global economic and market environment, we expect our underlying business to continue to deliver very strong fundamental earnings in 2016. We remain confident in our business, our markets and our people as well as our capacities to meet our aggressive growth objectives over the coming years. 
And now here's Doug Baker with some comments."
268799,321351847,938544,"Ecolab Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 23, 2016",2016-02-23,"Earnings Calls","Ecolab Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike. First, I'll just offer some perspective on '15 and then talk '16 as well. So 2015, we had very solid business performance that was clearly shrouded by FX. But if you take it net of translation FX, our EPS is 12% for the year and 13% in Q4,",628,"Thanks, Mike. First, I'll just offer some perspective on '15 and then talk '16 as well. 
So 2015, we had very solid business performance that was clearly shrouded by FX. But if you take it net of translation FX, our EPS is 12% for the year and 13% in Q4, and this includes a full impact of energy in the year and in the quarter, full impact of transaction FX. It includes system investments of $0.10 for the year, which is $0.03 over last year. It also includes an increase in sales and service headcount, i.e., we continue to invest in the business while driving double-digit results and obviously, not the perfect environment.
Our major businesses drove this. All of them grew faster than their markets, including energy. While energy was hit clearly by the oil and gas market headwinds, it outperformed. So in a market with a 60% decline in U.S. rigs, 50% drop in oil prices, our energy business declined 8% top line for the year, 14% at OI.
If you parse through energy and look at the core of the business, the production or OFC and downstream collectively, they grew top line 1%, and OI 8% for the year. So the core of that business managed very well. 
The rest of our businesses, I'd say, also outperformed the markets and had a very, very strong year. So Institutional globally grew sales 6%; OI, 12%. F&B grew sales 6%; OI, 16%. Water grew sales 6%; OI, 12%. Specialty Services, 7% and 16%. If you add in the rest, paper, health care, et cetera, the total of all those businesses was 5% growth and 12% OI. 
We drove it the old-fashioned way. We continue to take share. We're outgrowing our major competitors in the markets we compete in as our team continue to drive innovation and delivered new business. This is what drove the underlying 12% EPS performance.
So if you look at 2016, it's going to be much more of the same, to be continued FX headwinds, see more of the same market conditions. We expect the economies globally to be choppy but manageable. There's going to be continued tough oil and gas markets, offset in part by favorable raw material markets, which is the flip side of that coin, but most importantly, we're going to have continued strong underlying business execution.
So we expect to deliver double digit underlying EPS growth again in 2016. The range is 9 to 13. We expect energy to continue to be impacted by the tough market conditions, but our natural raw materials price hedge will mitigate this negative impact. Energy, we do not believe, will be as negative as last year. But given our forecast position of no 2016 energy market turnaround, it will likely decline modestly year-on-year, but at a slower rate than last year. 
The balance of the business is poised to have another very good year, a bit stronger than 2015 on top line and continued margin expansion. Net, we feel good about the business in '15, in early '16 as we continue to invest for the long term. We're going to continue to invest in R&D and systems field technology, sales firepower, talent development. We're very, very excited about the future, and I think our investment belies that. Our positioning and promise of clean water, safe food, abundant energy, healthy environment, we believe, remains even more relevant or is more relevant as we go forward. So the business continues to do well. The underlying results, I believe, demonstrate our resilience as we continue to deliver double-digit EPS when you exclude translation FX and far from perfect market conditions. 
So with that, I'll turn it back to Mike, and we can open it up for Q&A."

We think Western Europe's likely to be worse in 2016 than in '15 as a just the baseline economy. It was probably our big positive surprise last year, and we would expect it to be modestly off in terms of economic growth, but still growing this year. So we're not predicting recession. China is still moribund. If you then look at Latin America, clearly Brazil is going to be not very healthy. So I'd call it a tick off, but I don't really believe that's what we're trying to forecast as a driver. As long as it's [indiscernible], we should be fine and able to grow.

We also had the other side, which is the energy business, cost savings effects really build throughout the year, too, as we had to take out heads and other things and obviously have more heads out of your business in Q4 than you did in Q1 if it's an initiative that you undertake at the beginning in the year. In '16, we would expect margins to continue to expand at a somewhat slower pace than they expanded in 2015, and really that's mainly driven by the fact that raw material delta isn't going to be a significant savings. It will be a savings, but not the same level in '16 versus '15 as '15 was to '14, but we would expect margins to continue to accelerate and improve."

So we don't think that's really going to be the big negative impact, but there may be some slight negative in our OFC production business, not material and not significant.

I think the difference between the old forecast and the new is Venezuela, and a lot of the Venezuela impact, we have an FX because of the fact a huge devaluation of their currency, which was sort of a reflection of the turmoil they have in their economy. So I think that delta and if you have more questions on that, we'd be happy to address them. In terms of expectations going forward, we've given the best forecast we can. We work way off in terms of our anticipated FX impact in 2015. If you looked at what we thought was going to happen in the first quarter versus what we ended up happening, I think it was $0.18 over plan for the year. So that -- we don't pretend to be great at forecasting this. We're trying to give clarity to you. So you know what our underlying forecast is and you know what our FX forecast. Obviously, if FX comes in a lot lighter, then we've stated that we are going to have better results. And conversely, if it's a lot worse than we stated, we're going to have worse results in terms of our adjusted EPS with FX. I think the FX we've got is realistic and makes sense given the environment we think we're in."

If you can just walk through some of the assumption -- underlying assumptions, particularly as to WellChem is, it should decline, you're assuming production is flat, but are we going to end up or are you anticipating a scenario, where the production goes to kind of the cheaper produce -- cheaper to produce type of oil that just requires less chemicals? In other words, I'm trying to get to what the assumptions are if we have kind of flat production and only modestly lower top line. What's embedded in that. I assume there's a little bit of pricing, but are we in a situation where just that the well that they're going after is just cheaper to get oil right now?"
268799,321351847,938544,"Ecolab Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 23, 2016",2016-02-23,"Earnings Calls","Ecolab Inc.","Executives","Yes. I guess, I mean, we go a little higher on this for a few minutes. I think the big change year-on-year in terms of -- when we talk about oils impact, the energy impact on our business is the fact that we're going to get an entirely different base. So",608,"Yes. I guess, I mean, we go a little higher on this for a few minutes. I think the big change year-on-year in terms of -- when we talk about oils impact, the energy impact on our business is the fact that we're going to get an entirely different base. So when we're giving an EPS forecast and growth forecast, I mean, obviously, we're comparing it against 2015, not '14, and that's not insignificant when you look at the energy business. So the really only negative comparison that we ever top is the first quarter, and that's when the market really started diving and our business started feeling the impacts of the market. So in terms of WellChem, we think WellChem's going to be a negative for the year, but nowhere near the types of numbers we saw last year. It's going to be mitigated by the fact that it's going against last year. We've gained share in a couple of key segments, and we feel a lot of the rig count decline is in the base as we move forward. And U.S. is down 62%. So even a 20% decline isn't all that material given that you've already taken 60 out of the market. You have OFC. It's going to be flattish for the year. We have pricing pressure there. We'll continue to have fairly solid volume. You've got some new business coming on. I mean, we have secured some new business. Some fields came on during the year that were basically CapEx that we spent prior years and/or platforms that went out to see, et cetera. That's going to be net new business. In total, we look at that flat to modestly down, but very modest. And in the downstream, we expect to have a stronger year this year on the top line than last year. So net, I think it's a very modest decline in the top line to something resembling this year's decline, which is 8%. I think it's going to be less than that would be the downside case. When you look at OI, there's mitigating -- we've got cost savings going this year, started really seeing full effects in Q4. They're going to annualize. The headcount moves have been taken. There are not a lot more anticipated or any really anticipated going forward, but we're going to be very judicious about heads that we add as we move forward. So cost savings are going to be a bigger positive, and the raw material markets are going to continue to benefit the energy business. Now part of that is given back in the form of cost-plus arrangements, but not all of it, and so last year, we had some margin decline. Fourth quarter margin was up. Some of that was onetime benefits. But was probably up if you neutralize for that about 90 basis points in the fourth quarter. We don't expect it to be that strong throughout the whole year. But we do have steps in place now that we think mitigate margin decline, and we think volume is going to be not a significant story this year. So that's the energy story. In net, this natural hedge we have of energy pain offset by raw material gain in the balance of the business is going to be true next year, too. Those are almost a net neutral in 2015. We would expect they're going to be close to a net neutral in 2016. And so then it's back to the industrial Institutional and Other businesses, which we think are going to have another strong year. I mean, that's the fundamental equation."

Hello, everyone, and welcome to Ecolab's Fourth Quarter Conference Call. With me today are Doug Baker, Ecolab's Chairman and CEO; and our CFO, Dan Schmechel.
A discussion of our results along with our earnings release and the slides referencing the quarter's results and our outlook are available on Ecolab's website at ecolab.com/investor.
Please take a moment to read the cautionary statements on these materials stating that this teleconference, the discussion and the slides include estimates of future performance.
These are forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially from those projected.
Factors that could cause actual results to differ are described in the section of our most recent Form 10-K and 10-Q under Item 1A, Risk Factors, and in our posted materials. We also refer you to the supplemental diluted earnings per share information in the release.
Starting with a brief overview of the quarter. Continued strong new account gains and new product introductions drove good fixed-currency sales growth in our Global Institutional, Industrial and Other segments during the fourth quarter, nearly offsetting a decline in Global Energy sales. Delivered product cost savings, ongoing cost-efficiency work and synergies led the growth to get the strong adjusted operating margin expansion, more than offsetting the impact of softening economies, weaker oil prices and increased currency headwinds. These, along with the lower tax rate and fewer shares outstanding, drove the adjusted earnings per share increase.
While 2016 will present challenges, we are prepared to respond. Once again, we will focus on the fundamental Ecolab growth strategies that have proven successful through repeated economic cycles. The best products and service for our customers to give them the best results and lowest operating costs. We expect them to succeed again in 2016. 
Looking to the first quarter, we expect our Global Institutional, Industrial and Other segments to continue to show solid fixed-currency growth, outpacing their markets and softer international economies as they leverage investments we have made to further improve sales and service force effectiveness and profitability and more than offset results from our Global Energy business. We look for our first quarter earnings to show very attractive growth before currency, increasing 5% to 14% as we continue to aggressively drive business growth. 
Adjusted earnings per share are expected to reflect about 14 percentage points of unfavorable currency impact, yielding adjusted EPS in a $0.73 to $0.80 per share range. We look for comparative results to improve as 2016 progresses and show strong results for the full year with 9% to 13% adjusted earnings per share growth before the unfavorable impact of currency and the Venezuela deconsolidation. We expect currency and the Venezuela deconsolidation will penalize 2016 growth by approximately 9 percentage points. Net, we expect Ecolab to once again significantly outperform its markets and show a superior performance in 2016 while also investing in the key drivers for future sustainable above-average earnings growth. 
Moving to some highlights from the fourth quarter and as discussed in our press release, reported fourth quarter earnings per share were $0.69. On an adjusted basis, excluding special gains and charges and discrete tax items from both years, fourth quarter 2015 adjusted earnings per share increased 2% to $1.22 despite a $0.13 or 11% currency headwind.
The adjusted earnings per share growth was driven by delivered product and other cost savings, cost efficiencies, synergies, new products and lower tax rate and share count. Our fixed currency acquisition-adjusted sales were modestly lower as our Institutional, Industrial and Other segments grew 4%, but were offset by lower energy sales. Regional sales growth was led by Europe and Latin America, excluding Venezuela. 
Adjusted fixed currency operating margins showed very strong growth, expanding 130 basis points. In 2015's difficult environment, we focused on driving new business gains and lower costs. We used our industry-leading product innovation and service strengths to help customers achieve better results and lower operating costs and through these, aggressively drove new account gains across all of our segments.
Further, raw material cost savings, along with our cost-efficiency work, helped to offset these headwinds. Importantly, we also continued to make investments in our key growth drivers. 
These actions delivered a strong fundamental business performance in 2015 with double-digit profit growth before currency. The fourth quarter represented another strong performance on this basis, growing 13% despite the further deterioration in energy markets.
As noted earlier, the business environment has become more challenging in recent months as the dollar strengthened, energy markets weakened and global economies softened. Nonetheless, against that challenging backdrop, we look for 2016 earnings before currency and Venezuela deconsolidation effects to continue to show strong growth as we implement the same approach in 2015 -- or in 2016 as we did in 2015 and aggressively drive market share and new business gains. 
We expect first quarter adjusted earnings per share from operations to rise 5% to 14% before currency and the Venezuela deconsolidation, with adjusted earnings per share in the $0.73 to $0.80 range, reflecting a currency drag of approximately 14% to earnings per share growth.
Results are expected to improve as the year progresses with the second half outperforming the first half. We look for our full year adjusted earnings before currency and the Venezuela deconsolidation to increase 9% to 13%. We expect adjusted earnings per share in the $4.35 to $4.55 per share range with currency and Venezuela deconsolidation representing an approximate 9% drag to results.
In summary, despite a very challenging global economic and market environment, we expect our underlying business to continue to deliver very strong fundamental earnings in 2016. We remain confident in our business, our markets and our people as well as our capacities to meet our aggressive growth objectives over the coming years. 
And now here's Doug Baker with some comments."
268799,321351847,938801,"Ecolab Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 23, 2016",2016-02-23,"Earnings Calls","Ecolab Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike. First, I'll just offer some perspective on '15 and then talk '16 as well. So 2015, we had very solid business performance that was clearly shrouded by FX. But if you take it net of translation FX, our EPS is 12% for the year and 13% in Q4,",629,"Thanks, Mike. First, I'll just offer some perspective on '15 and then talk '16 as well. 
So 2015, we had very solid business performance that was clearly shrouded by FX. But if you take it net of translation FX, our EPS is 12% for the year and 13% in Q4, and this includes a full impact of energy in the year and in the quarter, full impact of transaction FX. It includes system investments of $0.10 for the year, which is $0.03 over last year. It also includes an increase in sales and service headcount, i.e., we continue to invest in the business while driving double-digit results and obviously, not the perfect environment.
Our major businesses drove this. All of them grew faster than their markets, including energy. While energy was hit clearly by the oil and gas market headwinds, it outperformed. So in a market with a 60% decline in U.S. rigs, 50% drop in oil prices, our energy business declined 8% top line for the year, 14% at OI.
If you parse through energy and look at the core of the business, the production, or OFC, and downstream collectively, they grew top line 1%, and OI 8% for the year. So the core of that business managed very well. 
The rest of our businesses, I'd say, also outperformed the markets and had a very, very strong year. So Institutional globally grew sales 6%; OI, 12%. F&B grew sales 6%; OI, 16%. Water grew sales 6%; OI, 12%. Specialty Services, 7% and 16%. If you add in the rest, paper, health care, et cetera, the total of all those businesses was 5% growth and 12% OI. 
We drove it the old-fashioned way. We continue to take share. We're outgrowing our major competitors in the markets we compete in as our team continued to drive innovation and delivered new business. This is what drove the underlying 12% EPS performance.
So if you look at 2016, it's going to be much more of the same, to be continued FX headwinds, see more of the same market conditions. We expect the economies globally to be choppy but manageable. There's going to be continued tough oil and gas markets, offset in part by favorable raw material markets, which is the flip side of that coin, but most importantly, we're going to have continued strong underlying business execution.
So we expect to deliver double digit underlying EPS growth again in 2016. The range is 9% to 13%. We expect energy to continue to be impacted by the tough market conditions, but our natural raw materials price hedge will mitigate this negative impact. Energy, we do not believe, will be as negative as last year. But given our forecast position of no 2016 energy market turnaround, it will likely decline modestly year-on-year, but at a slower rate than last year. 
The balance of the business is poised to have another very good year, a bit stronger than 2015 on top line and continued margin expansion. Net, we feel good about the business in '15 and early '16 as we continue to invest for the long term. We're going to continue to invest in R&D and systems, field technology, sales firepower, talent development. We're very, very excited about the future, and I think our investment belies that. Our positioning and promise of clean water, safe food, abundant energy, healthy environment, we believe, remains even more relevant -- or is more relevant as we go forward. So the business continues to do well. The underlying results, I believe, demonstrate our resilience as we continue to deliver double-digit EPS when you exclude translation FX and far from perfect market conditions. 
So with that, I'll turn it back to Mike, and we can open it up for Q&A."

We think Western Europe's likely to be worse in 2016 than in '15 as a -- just the baseline economy. It was probably our big positive surprise last year, and we would expect it to be modestly off in terms of economic growth, but still growing this year. So we're not predicting recession. China is still moribund. If you then look at Latin America, clearly Brazil is going to be not very healthy. So I'd call it a tick off, but I don't really believe that's what we're trying to forecast as a driver. As long as it doesn't turtle, we should be fine and able to grow. I think next year, I think our base sales are going to be better in 2016 than '15."

We also had the other side, which is the energy business, cost savings effects really build throughout the year, too, as we had to take out heads and other things and obviously you have more heads out of your business in Q4 than you did in Q1 if it's an initiative that you undertake at the beginning in the year. In '16, we would expect margins to continue to expand at a somewhat slower pace than they expanded in 2015, and really that's mainly driven by the fact that raw material delta isn't going to be a significant savings. It will be a savings, but not the same level in '16 versus '15 as '15 was to '14, but we would expect margins to continue to accelerate and improve."

In other words, I'm trying to get to what the assumptions are if we have kind of flat production and only modestly lower top line. What's embedded in that. I assume there's a little bit of pricing, but are we in a situation where just the oil that they're going after is just cheaper-to-get oil right now?"

I guess, I may even go a little higher on this for a few minutes. I think the big change year-on-year in terms of -- when we talk about oil's impact, the energy impact on our business is the fact that we're going to get an entirely different base. So",608,"Yes. I guess, I may even go a little higher on this for a few minutes. I think the big change year-on-year in terms of -- when we talk about oil's impact, the energy impact on our business is the fact that we're going to get an entirely different base. So when we're giving an EPS forecast and growth forecast, I mean, obviously, we're comparing it against 2015, not '14, and that's not insignificant when you look at the energy business. So the really only negative comparison that we ever top is the first quarter, and that's when the market really started diving and our business started feeling the impacts of the market. So in terms of WellChem, we think WellChem's going to be a negative for the year, but nowhere near the types of numbers we saw last year. It's going to be mitigated by the fact that it's going against last year. We've gained share in a couple of key segments, and we feel a lot of the rig count decline is in the base as we move forward. And U.S. is down 62%. So even a 20% decline isn't all that material given that you've already taken 60% out of the market. You have OFC. It's going to be flattish for the year. We have pricing pressure there. We'll continue to have fairly solid volume. You've got some new business coming on. I mean, we have secured some new business. Some fields came on during the year that were basically CapEx that was spent prior years and/or platforms that went out to see, et cetera. That's going to be net new business. In total, we look at that flat to modestly down, but very modest. 
And in the downstream, we expect to have a stronger year this year on the top line than last year. 
So net, I think it's a very modest decline in the top line to something resembling this year's decline, which is 8%. I think it's going to be less than that would be the downside case. When you look at OI, there's mitigating -- we've got cost savings going this year, started really seeing full effects in Q4. They're going to annualize. The headcount moves have been taken. There are not a lot more anticipated or any really anticipated going forward, but we're going to be very judicious about heads that we add as we move forward. So cost savings are going to be a bigger positive, and the raw material markets are going to continue to benefit the energy business. Now part of that is given back in the form of cost-plus arrangements, but not all of it, and so last year, we had some margin decline. Fourth quarter margin was up. Some of that was onetime benefits. But was probably up, if you neutralize for that, about 90 basis points in the fourth quarter. We don't expect it to be that strong throughout the whole year. But we do have steps in place now that we think mitigate margin decline, and we think volume is going to be not a significant story this year. So that's the energy story. In net, this natural hedge we have of energy pain offset by raw material gain in the balance of the business is going to be true next year, too. Those are almost a net neutral in 2015. We would expect they're going to be close to a net neutral in 2016. And so then it's back to the industrial Institutional and Other businesses, which we think are going to have another strong year. I mean, that's the fundamental equation."

Hello, everyone, and welcome to Ecolab's first quarter conference call. With me today are Doug Baker, Ecolab's Chairman and CEO; and Dan Schmechel, our CFO.A discussion of our results along with the earnings release and the slides referencing",816,"Thank you. Hello, everyone, and welcome to Ecolab's first quarter conference call. With me today are Doug Baker, Ecolab's Chairman and CEO; and Dan Schmechel, our CFO.
A discussion of our results along with the earnings release and the slides referencing the quarter's results and our outlook are available on Ecolab's website at ecolab.com/investor.
Please take a moment to read the cautionary statements on these materials stating that this teleconference, the discussion and the slides include estimates of future performance.
These are forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially from those projected.
Factors that could cause actual results to differ are described in the section of our most recent Form 10-K under Item 1A, Risk Factors, and in our posted materials.
We also refer you to the supplemental diluted earnings per share information in the release.
Starting with a brief overview of the quarter. Continued attractive new account gains and new product introductions drove good fixed-currency sales growth in our Global Institutional, Industrial and Other segments during the first quarter, nearly offsetting a decline in Global Energy sales. New business and ongoing cost-efficiency work led to strong adjusted fixed-currency operating margin expansion, more than offsetting the impact of soft economies, weak oil prices and currency headwinds. These, along with fewer shares outstanding, drove the adjusted earnings per share increased before currency translation. 
While 2016 is proving to be a challenging year, we continue to focus on the same fundamental strategies that have successfully driven our strong growth record, providing the best products and service for our customers to give them the best results and lowest operating costs. They delivered again in the first quarter, and we expect them to deliver for the full year 2016. 
Looking to the second quarter, we expect our Global Institutional, Industrial and Other segments to continue to show solid acquisition-adjusted fixed-currency growth, outpacing their markets and soft international economies as they leverage investments we have made to further improve sales and service force effectiveness and profitability and more than offset lower results from our Global Energy business. 
We look for second quarter earnings per share to be in the $1.03 to $1.11 per share range with that range including approximately $0.08 per share or 7% of unfavorable currency translation and impact from the Venezuela deconsolidation as we continue to aggressively drive business growth. 
For the full year, the Global Institutional, Industrial and Other segments are expected to continue to show solid fixed-currency growth. Global Energy segment expectations have softened. Global Energy sales are expected to be on the lower end of our range, down upper single digits versus last year. While the dollar has weakened somewhat at this early point in the year, we are maintaining our earnings per share forecast for 2016 to reflect the uncertain currency trends and business environment. 
Net, we continue to expect to outperform our markets in 2016 while also investing in the key drivers for future sustainable above-average earnings growth. We expect our consolidated results to show improving comparisons in the second half and continue to look for adjusted diluted earnings per share in the $4.35 to $4.55 range. 
Moving to some highlights from the first quarter and as discussed in our press release, reported first quarter earnings per share were $0.77. On an adjusted basis, excluding special gains and charges and discrete tax items from both years, first quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share decreased 4% to $0.77, reflecting an $0.11 or 14% currency headwind. The adjusted earnings per share growth was driven by delivered product and other cost savings, cost efficiencies and a lower share count. 
Our consolidated fixed-currency acquisition-adjusted sales were modestly lower as our Global Institutional, Industrial and Other segments grew 4% but were offset by lower Global Energy sales. Regional sales growth was led by Latin America and Europe. 
Adjusted fixed-currency operating margins showed strong growth, expanding 60 basis points. In 2016's difficult growth environment, we are focused on driving new business gains by helping customers to lower their costs. We are using our industry-leading product innovation and service strengths to help customers achieve the best results and lowest operating costs and through these, aggressively drive new account gains across all of our segments. 
We expect second quarter adjusted earnings per share in the $1.03 to $1.11 range, reflecting a currency translation and Venezuela deconsolidation drag of approximately $0.08 or 7%. Consolidated results are expected to improve with the second half outperforming the first half. We look for full year adjusted diluted earnings per share in the $4.35 to $4.55 per share range. 
In summary, despite a very challenging global economic and market environment, we expect to continue to deliver solid fundamental results in 2016. We remain confident in our business, our markets and our people as well as our capacities to meet our aggressive growth objectives over the coming years. 
And now here's Doug Baker with some comments."
268799,330160558,970902,"Ecolab Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 03, 2016",2016-05-03,"Earnings Calls","Ecolab Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mike. Good afternoon everybody. Look, we had a solid quarter. We're on track for a full year delivery within our forecasted range. All of our sectors are handily outperforming their markets and competition, and we continue to gain share in all",499,"Thank you, Mike. Good afternoon everybody. Look, we had a solid quarter. We're on track for a full year delivery within our forecasted range. All of our sectors are handily outperforming their markets and competition, and we continue to gain share in all of these areas. 
For the year, there are natural puts and takes. We look at our Institutional, Industrial and Other business segments, they were a bit above expectations at this point, driven by new business, innovation, cost savings, very good execution. This is driving improving top line and improved margin performance. 
Energy is heading to the lower side of our expectation in spite of share gains and savings initiatives, and this is really driven by an even tougher market than expected. This will pass. We continue to believe, though, that the upturn is really 2017, not a 2016 story, i.e., the oil and gas market upturn. 
If we froze FX at today's rates, FX would be less of a negative than planned. It would be roughly $0.28 versus $0.38 negative, but given the fluidity of the FX situation, Brazil political environment, you've got the British exit vote, China, et cetera, we think it's too early and unwise to bake this into our forecast. 
Importantly, our forecast also continues to include significant investments in systems, R&D, talent initiatives, which are all, in total, greater than last year, which, I would remind you, was greater than the prior year and as I think a very strong indication of our confidence in the future, which is high, and we believe for good reason. 
So as we look at the future, we know that the temporary double headwinds of energy and FX will abate, don't know exactly when, but they will pass. Even with them, we've been doing well and outperforming markets. We do know, though, that our plan and our position, we think, are spot on for the future. So clean water, safe food, abundant energy and healthy environment is even more relevant going forward than it has been in the past 5 or 10 years. We have a stronger competitive advantage position now, we believe, given our recent new innovations and our focus on driving excellent outcomes at low cost because of reduction in footprints on CO2 and water. 
We also have very strong execution momentum. Our teams are on it. They're doing a great job. They're driving new business. We had another very strong new business quarter in the first quarter, and we have promising new business bets in businesses like life sciences in geographies like MEA, and there are plenty more. 
And finally, we've got a culture and a team that knows how to deliver. For all these reasons, we feel very good about where we are, how we're going to get through the year, the position we're going to be in to drive continued growth beyond. 
So that's my opening, and with that, I'll turn it over to Mike, who will move on into Q&A."

I think the recent move in oil price I think look, the best predictions I read forecasted that oil would move up in anticipation of increased demand from the summer. It was likely going to weaken over the summer because really what needs to drive the fundamental price of oil is a rebalancing of supply and demand, and nobody really believe that was going to happen until towards the end of this year. And until that happens, you're not going to really, we believe, have sustained improvement in oil price or increase, maybe we should call improvement, increase in oil price. In terms of raw materials, I guess, our forecast has always had 2 views. One that raws likely move before we see the impacts of higher oil prices in our Energy Services business. That's in our forecast on back half, we have some uptick in raws included, not because it's -- because we still have favorability in the first half, but that abates and goes away as we think the energy market start correcting and healing. So that's our view right now. I don't think you're going to see material increase in activity, which is what's really needed to drive our Energy Services volume until at the earliest very late this year. So most likely be we aren't going to see the impact until '17."

Or are you staying conservative at this point?"

And this is really the water technology that we sell into the world's mining operations. I mean, that business is down double digits. So you'll see spotty things. China, particularly on the heavy industrial side, is soft. So I don't -- our business reflects what you're going to read day to day about the global economy. But overall, the model, as it was always proven, is fairly resilient, and so we have puts and takes. We also have pretty strong business performance from Institutional in North America, in particular. There are oil dividends, which we've talked about, which are certainly lower raw materials, which you see flowing through our II&O segments, which is one of the reasons gross profit is up. The other reason obviously is innovation. So, I mean, I don't think the other surprises are really outliers nor will they dictate, I think, the year. And even the energy market softness, I would say it's the -- it's worse than we anticipated. I would still think energy is likely going to come in with the range we talked about. It's just going to be at the bottom end of it."

But certainly, we're in the later innings, and I think the data I pay most attention to is where are we in the supply-demand curve. There's virtually no inventory storage capabilities locally for oil. So this thing reacts wildly to very small changes in supply and demand, and that is still projected to start coming in very near balance at the end of the year, and I believe ultimately, that's going to be the data that dictates when this thing completely turns. So we're, what are we, 18 months into this? And we're saying probably have 6 to 9 months to go, so certainly we're in the later innings."

However, we didn't have equal capabilities in all these markets, and in particular we made a breakout investment move in MEA about 18 months ago, and this cost us margin obviously last year and even a little bit early this year, but it has driven improved results. Previously, we really ran MEA as part of Europe. Our history whenever we make these breakout organizational moves, we did it with Food Retail breaking it out from KQSR. We did it many years ago with health care outside of what was then called EPP, which is our janitorial business. There are plenty other examples here. Both participants benefit through focus, and I think you're seeing that MEA has accelerated since we've broken it out. We have increased focus. We have a handle on our supply chain challenges and opportunities, and I would also point out Europe has done better since we've taken MEA out as well. This simply drives increased focus on the region that's left. So that would be a good example of how we are investing in what we think are critical markets long term. Latin America, we grew by basically 10%, 9%, I guess, in the quarter. We continue to do well in a region that's obviously under a lot of pressure, Brazil being the most notable headline owner right now, and I would say it's 2 things. I think we've always tried to focus on what matters most in these areas. Our Food & Beverage business, which is important throughout all those economies, is up 19%. Even our Paper business through some big wins is having a very strong quarter. Water's up double-digit, down in that market as well, and we believe those businesses in particular are going to be very strong players in Latin America for a long time to come, and that's what our focus has been, and it's paying off."

Well, I guess, we didn't see a change in customer behavior towards pricing, which would be accepting price increases. So no, they're under pressure, and this is not unusual, and they are certainly putting pressure on us. You've got competitive pressure as well. Pricing still remains, in total, in the low single digits, and we expect it to be there for the year, but it's real pressure and a challenge. And what I would say is that's an average. So you've got some much more material getbacks in certain situations than other areas, where we've been able to hold price either because we have very, very unique technology and a high need or it's a customer not under the same pressure given the geographic position. So I would expect you'll continue to see that. I think the other thing that we're seeing in that market, I don't know if they're surprising, customers are turning off programs and services. We expected some. We're seeing a little more than we expected, but that's always a temporary issue, and so people will take some risk, particularly in North America, where the huge market pressure is really coming to bear. And the business outside of North America continues to perform in a much higher rate simply because the market really reacts here and everywhere else. People are typically pumping oil to meet builds, not necessarily to meet capital demands and trying to make money. So we expect to continue to see that. We're remaining fiscally disciplined. Some of the pain is self-induced. Last year, we had only $4 million in bad debt write-offs in the Energy business. We expect it to be greater this year but still in the single-digit millions, which is pretty low given the size of that business, and a lot of it is because of the energy team has been very, very acutely aware of the risk there. We're putting customers on cash on demand quite, quite early. We're staying out of some bankruptcy situations. Customers where we don't believe there's a future either before or after bankruptcy, we are walking from if they won't go to cash on delivery, et cetera. So those are the types of steps that we're taking, and they accentuate some short-term pain. But ultimately, even within the year, we think are going to be fiscally responsible moves because we're just going to avoid some big write-offs and other challenges."

But no, coming out of this, we put -- the demand for oil has not really been the question. What's happened is we've been in an oversupply situation, which has crushed price and now will crush activity, which will lead to undersupply. And I mean, that's what we believe is going to happen, and you're going to see prices move up, activity increase and the demand for our services increase as well. Right now, everybody's focusing on the easiest oil they can find.

I would also point out fourth quarter, as we said during the fourth quarter, had a number of onetime positive events in it, all of them legitimate, but that would probably account for almost $14 million of the $125 million that just weren't going to recur, which we called out in the fourth quarter, and it was simply we sold some inventory that was out there onetime, which were smart moves economically for the company, were legitimate deals, but you don't get to sell that inventory over and over again.

And then we also had a onetime or negative in the first quarter in Angola that was fairly substantial that needs to be accounted for. When you take those things, the whole thing makes sense. But the fourth quarter is a little bit overstated, and the first quarter is really reflective of low seasonality, and we will see improved margin in energy going forward, simply because volumes will be greater in the out quarters than what it was in this quarter, and you'll have better overhead coverage."

Well, I mean, I believe our F&B business is up 4% in the first quarter. And certainly I don't think the food market -- this is a heavily processed food, dairy market in particular is our focus in these markets. It includes protein and other areas. But those businesses are under pressure, and so there's no doubt in my mind we are outperforming the market, and the pressure comes in twofold: one, consumer demand pressure as people move to different parts of the store to procure food; and second, there's been quite a bit of M&A activity in that market, which means ultimately, they consolidate and takeout manufacturing facilities, which reduces temporarily total opportunity for us. Long term, though, the drivers in F&B, I think, are in excellent shape. It's called population and food safety. And the population will grow around the world. The middle class will grow expectations for food quality will continue to increase, particularly in emerging markets, and food safety is only going to get more challenging as well there's a lot of conversation in U.S. local farming. Local farming is not going to feed 9 billion people, and it's also not by any means the most sustainable way to farm. But what you're going to want to do is farm where stuff natural grows it. So you're not going to see bananas growing in Manhattan anytime soon because it doesn't makes any sense. It would be local, but it wouldn't be very sustainable, and so ultimately, I think you're going to still see long-distance shipping of food to in particular feed the Asian population growth and long distance equal time, and time is the enemy of food safety. And so if anything, we think that demands for food safety technology are going to grow faster than the food demand, which is ultimately going to be driven by the 2 components I talked about: population growth and middle-class expectation growth. So I like our Food & Beverage business. New technology, team's on it. They're outperforming the market I think that business gets better and the water technology coupling we have it's spot on for that business there's a huge way to leverage our base in F&B."

But given all the stuff going on in the world, we don't think booking that, at this point in time, is wise. There's a lot of things that can change, including currency as the year goes on. There's just too much time remaining in the year in a very dynamic environment to go snap the line on one of multiple variables. So what we basically said is we have not changed our expected currency out for the year even though we recognize and admit that today's rates would indicate $0.10 better. So yes, if you want to go to that math, there's a lot of things going in here. We haven't increased our range either at this point in time, and I think as the year goes, we'll continue to try to be transparent in what our expectations are and what the underlying assumption leading to our forecasted range and from there, right, we're just going to watch multivariable inputs and see how it all turns out, but I would expect to deliver our range."

It was $20 million in sales, 20% margin, OI margin and 20% return on invested capital. I was very clear at that time that we weren't getting hit all 3 by 2020 because if we did the math, it would imply much more than 15% EPS growth, and what we've said is we believe all 3 are achievable. They're achievable within sight of 2020, but they weren't all going to occur by 2020, and that's still true. If you go to the just the last 2 years, if '16 expected FX hit, not $0.10 better, you've got '15 and '16, we'd lose $1.5 billion in sales in 2 years, just some currency translation and over $250 million in OI. I mean, that's what those rates mean. So they chew up the bulk of the synergies you might have seen from one of those deals. With that, we continue to deliver positive EPS growth as we go through it. I will also say we also believe that translation FX, not transaction, transaction FX, we never talk about. It's almost equal in size, but we think that's a real impact in the business that has to be dealt with because it's the equivalent of inflation basically. So we don't talk about it. We only talk about translation. The translation is sort of goofy. If I headquartered in units last year, I would have been up 26% EPS with everything happening exactly the same except on consolidating euros not in the dollars. Our business isn't any better. Our share's not any better. Our margins aren't any better. Nothing's better except I translate to more favorable currency, and so this stuff flips back and forth. So our margin improvement? Yes, I think it's real fixed currencies more like 60, not 20, and we expect to have continued fixed margin growth year in, year out, and 1 year it's going to look like 200, the currency's going to in our favor and I will tell you it's still only 60 because really got to look at this the way the margin's really coming country by country and currency by currency. That's the way we ultimately realize it over any period of time that matters to incorporation, right? So that's how we look at it."

Hello, everyone, and welcome to Ecolab's first quarter conference call. With me today are Doug Baker, Ecolab's Chairman and CEO; and Dan Schmechel, our CFO.A discussion of results along with our earnings release and the slides referencing the",822,"Thank you. Hello, everyone, and welcome to Ecolab's first quarter conference call. With me today are Doug Baker, Ecolab's Chairman and CEO; and Dan Schmechel, our CFO.
A discussion of results along with our earnings release and the slides referencing the quarter's results and our outlook are available on Ecolab's website at ecolab.com/investor.
Please take a moment to read the cautionary statements on these materials stating that this teleconference, the discussion slides and the slides include estimates of future performance. 
These are forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially from those projected.
Factors that could cause actual results to differ are described in the section of our most recent Form 10-K under Item 1A, Risk Factors, and in our posted materials. We also refer you to the supplemental diluted earnings per share information in the release.
Starting with a brief overview of the quarter. Continued attractive new account gains and new product introductions drove good fixed currency sales growth in our Global Institutional, Industrial and Other segments during the first quarter, nearly offsetting a decline in Global Energy sales. New business and ongoing cost-efficiency work led to strong adjusted fixed currency operating margin expansion, more than offsetting the impact of soft economies, weak oil prices and currency headwinds. These, along with fewer shares outstanding, drove the adjusted earnings per share increase before our currency translation. 
While 2016 is proving to be a challenging year, we continue to focus on the same fundamental strategies that have successfully driven our strong growth record, providing the best products and service for our customers to give them the best results and lowest operating costs. They delivered again in the first quarter, and we expect them to deliver for the full year 2016. 
Looking to the second quarter, we expect our Global Institutional, Industrial and Other segments to continue to show solid acquisition-adjusted fixed currency growth, outpacing their markets in soft international economies as they leverage investments we have made to further improve sales and service force effectiveness and profitability, and more than offset lower results from our Global Energy business. 
We look for second quarter earnings per share to be in the $1.03 to $1.11 per share range with that range including approximately $0.08 per share or 7% of unfavorable currency translation and impact from the Venezuela deconsolidation as we continue to aggressively drive business growth. 
For the full year, the Global Institutional, Industrial and Other segments are expected to continue to show solid fixed currency growth. Global Energy segment expectations have softened. Global Energy sales are expected to be on the lower end of our range, down upper single digits versus last year. While the dollar has weakened somewhat at this early point in the year, we are maintaining our earnings per share forecast for 2016 to reflect the uncertain currency trends and business environment. 
Net, we continue to expect to outperform our markets in 2016 while also investing in the key drivers for future sustainable above-average earnings growth. We expect our consolidated results to show improving comparisons in the second half and continue to look for adjusted diluted earnings per share in the $4.35 to $4.55 range. 
Moving to some highlights from the first quarter and as discussed in our press release, reported first quarter earnings per share were $0.77. On an adjusted basis, excluding special gains and charges and discrete tax items from both years, first quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share decreased 4% to $0.77, reflecting an $0.11 or 14% currency headwind. The adjusted earnings per share growth was driven by delivered product and other cost savings, cost efficiencies and a lower share count. 
Our consolidated fixed currency acquisition-adjusted sales were modestly lower as our Global Institutional, Industrial and Other segments grew 4%, but were offset by lower Global Energy sales. Regional sales growth was led by Latin America and Europe. 
Adjusted fixed currency operating margins showed strong growth, expanding 60 basis points. In 2016's difficult environment, we are focused on driving new business gains by helping customers to lower their costs. We are using our industry-leading product innovation and service strengths to help customers achieve the best results and lowest operating costs and through these, aggressively drive new account gains across all of our segments. 
We expect second quarter adjusted earnings per share in the $1.03 to $1.11 range, reflecting a currency translation and Venezuela deconsolidation drag of approximately $0.08 or 7%. Consolidated results are expected to improve with the second half outperforming the first half. We look for full year adjusted diluted earnings per share in the $4.35 to $4.55 per share range. 
In summary, despite a very challenging global economic and market environment, we expect to continue to deliver solid fundamental results in 2016. We remain confident in our business, our markets and our people as well as our capacities to meet our aggressive growth objectives over the coming years. 
And now here's Doug Baker with some comments."
268799,330160558,971307,"Ecolab Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 03, 2016",2016-05-03,"Earnings Calls","Ecolab Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mike. Good afternoon everybody. Look, we had a solid quarter. We're on track for a full year delivery within our forecasted range. All of our sectors are handily outperforming their markets and competition, and we continue to gain share in all",500,"Thank you, Mike. Good afternoon everybody. Look, we had a solid quarter. We're on track for a full year delivery within our forecasted range. All of our sectors are handily outperforming their markets and competition, and we continue to gain share in all of these areas. 
For the year, there are natural puts and takes. If we look at our Institutional, Industrial and Other business segments, they are a bit above expectations at this point, driven by new business, innovation, cost savings, very good execution. This is driving improving top line and improved margin performance. 
Energy is heading to the lower side of our expectation in spite of share gains and savings initiatives, and this is really driven by an even tougher market than expected. This will pass. We continue to believe, though, that the upturn is really 2017, not a 2016 story, i.e., the oil and gas market upturn. 
If we froze FX at today's rates, FX would be less of a negative than planned. It would be roughly $0.28 versus $0.38 negative. But given the fluidity of the FX situation, Brazil political environment, you've got the British exit vote, China, et cetera, we think it's too early and unwise to bake this into our forecast. 
Importantly, our forecast also continues to include significant investment in systems, R&D, talent initiatives, which are all, in total, greater than last year, which, I would remind you, was greater than the prior year and is, I think, a very strong indication of our confidence in the future, which is high, and we believe for good reason. 
So as we look at the future, we know that the temporary double headwinds of energy and FX will abate, don't know exactly when, but they will pass. Even with them, we've been doing well and outperforming markets. We do know, though, that our plan and our position, we think, are spot on for the future. So clean water, safe food, abundant energy and healthy environment is even more relevant going forward than it has been in the past 5 or 10 years. We have a stronger competitive advantage position now, we believe, given our recent new innovations and our focus on driving excellent outcomes at low cost because of reduction in footprints on CO2 and water. 
We also have very strong execution momentum. Our teams are on it. They're doing a great job. They're driving new business. We had another very strong new business quarter in the first quarter, and we have promising new business bets in businesses like life sciences in geographies like MEA, and there are plenty more. 
And finally, we got a culture and a team that knows how to deliver. For all these reasons, we feel very good about where we are, how we're going to get through the year, the position we're going to be in to drive continued growth beyond. 
So that's my opening, and with that, I'll turn it over to Mike, who will move on into Q&A."

I think the recent move in oil price I think -- look, the best predictions I read forecasted that oil would move up in anticipation of increased demand for the summer. It was likely going to weaken over the summer because really what needs to drive the fundamental price of oil is a rebalancing of supply and demand, and nobody really believe that was going to happen until towards the end of this year. And until that happens, you're not going to really, we believe, have sustained improvement in oil price or increase -- maybe we should call an improvement, increase in oil price. In terms of raw materials, I guess, our forecast has always had 2 views. One that raws likely move before we see the impacts of higher oil prices in our Energy Services business. That's in our forecast. On back half, we have some uptick in raws included, not monstrous because we still have favorability in the first half, but that abates and goes away as we think the energy market start correcting and healing. So that's our view right now. I don't think you're going to see material increase in activity, which is what's really needed to drive our Energy Services volume until at the earliest very late this year. So most likely we aren't going to see the impact until '17."

China, particularly on the heavy industrial side, is soft. So I don't -- our business reflects what you're going to read day to day about the global economy. But overall, the model, as it has always proven, is fairly resilient, and so we have puts and takes. We also have pretty strong business performance from Institutional in North America, in particular. There are oil dividends, which we've talked about, which are certainly lower raw materials, which you see flowing through our II&O segments, which is one of the reasons gross profit is up. The other reason obviously is innovation. So -- I mean, I don't think the other surprises are really outliers nor will they dictate, I think, the year.

But certainly, we're in the later innings, and I think the data I pay most attention to is where are we on the supply-demand curve. There's virtually no inventory storage capabilities globally for oil. So this thing reacts wildly to very small changes in supply and demand, and that is still projected to start coming in very near balance at the end of the year, and I believe ultimately, that's going to be the data that dictates when this thing completely turns.

So that business is running as well as its run in terms of its financial performance for many, many years."

However, we didn't have equal capabilities in all these markets, and in particular we made a breakout investment move in MEA about 18 months ago, and this caused us margin obviously last year and even a little bit early this year, but it has driven improved results. Previously, we really ran MEA as part of Europe. Our history whenever we make these breakout organizational moves, we did it with Food Retail breaking it out from KAY QSR. We did it many years ago with health care outside of what was then called EPP, which is our janitorial business. There are plenty other examples here. Both participants benefit, improved focus. And I think you're seeing that MEA has accelerated since we broken it out. We have increased focus. We have a handle on our supply chain challenges and opportunities, and I would also point out Europe has done better since we've taken MEA out as well. This simply drives increased focus on the region that's left. So that would be a good example of how we are investing in what we think are critical markets long term. Latin America, we grew by basically 10% -- 9%, I guess, in the quarter. We continue to do well in a region that's obviously under a lot of pressure, Brazil being the most notable headline owner right now, and I would say it's 2 things. I think we've always tried to focus on what matters most in these areas. Our Food & Beverage business, which is important throughout all those economies, is up 19%. Even our Paper business through some big wins is having a very strong quarter. Water is up double-digit, down in that market as well, and we believe those businesses in particular are going to be very strong players in Latin America for a long time to come, and that's what our focus has been, and it's paying off."

Well, I guess, we didn't see a change in customer behavior towards pricing, which would be accepting price increases. So no, they're under pressure, and this is not unusual, and they are certainly putting pressure on us. You got competitive pressure as well. Pricing still remains, in total, in the low single digits, and we expect it to be there for the year, but it's real pressure and a challenge. And what I would say is that's an average. So you've got some much more material givebacks in certain situations than other areas, where we've been able to hold price either because we have very, very unique technology and a high need or it's a customer not under the same pressure given their geographic position. So I would expect you'll continue to see that. I think the other things that we're seeing in that market, I don't know if they're surprising, customers are turning off programs and services. We expected some. We're seeing a little more than we expected, but that's always a temporary issue, and so people will take some risk, particularly in North America, where the huge market pressure is really coming to bear. And the business outside of North America continues to perform at a much higher rate, simply because the market really reacts here and everywhere else. People are typically pumping oil to meet builds, not necessarily to meet capital demands and trying to make money. So we would expect to continue to see that. We're remaining fiscally disciplined. Some of the pain is self-induced. Last year, we had only $4 million in bad debt write-offs in the Energy business. We expect it to be greater this year, but still in the single-digit millions, which is pretty low given the size of that business, and a lot of it is because the energy team has been very, very acutely aware of the risk there. We're putting customers on cash on demand quite early. We're staying out of some bankruptcy situations. Customers where we don't believe there's a future either before or after bankruptcy, we are walking from if they won't go to cash on delivery, et cetera. So those are the types of steps that we're taking, and they accentuate some short-term pain. But ultimately, even within the year, we think are going to be fiscally responsible moves because we're just going to avoid some big write-offs and other challenges."

And so we think that seasonality comes through, and then the other issue is share, and we continue to gain share. And our net ahead as we go through this and while it's a tough environment, we continue to see the few things that are happening in the world are coming our way, and we are getting some of the existing fields to move our way.

The opportunities in that business are fairly significant because there's real pain in the industry, particularly in North America, as a consequence of wage pressure and ACA requirements.

Some of that seasonal and some of it is market, but that would account for the vast majority. You simply -- you don't have the same coverage in your plants and everything else, which is why first quarter broadly is always a low-margin quarter for us, and it's a low-margin quarter for energy as well. And then it was exacerbated by further market declines as you go in. I would also point how fourth quarter, as we said during the fourth quarter, had a number of onetime positive events in it, all of them legitimate, but that would probably be -- account for almost $40 million of the $125 million that just weren't going to recur, which we called out in that fourth quarter. And it was simply we sold some inventory that was out there onetime, which were smart moves economically for the company, were legitimate deals, but you don't get to sell that inventory over and over again. So it took risk off the table and triggered a sale and some gross profit realization as a consequence of that. So those things are also part of the story. And then we also had a onetime or negative in the first quarter in Angola that was fairly substantial that needs to be accounted for. When you take those things, the whole thing makes sense. But the fourth quarter is a little bit overstated, and the first quarter is really reflective of low seasonality. And we will see improved margin in energy going forward simply because volume will be greater in the out quarters than it was in this quarter, and you'll have better overhead coverage."

Look, in that -- in almost any business, when you have significant deleveraging in a business, you have almost as immediate significant impact on OI because there's no time to take out overhead. And I wouldn't anyway because a lot of it is just seasonally. So you get under-absorption in the plants that just immediately -- instead of going into inventory, sits in your OI line. I mean, this is just basic P&L stuff. But 15% is a significant volume hit. We've been under pressure there. We did not build inventory. We're trying to be disciplined on inventory and the other stuff so we took it on the chin. Last year, if you recall, we were building inventory year-on-year in energy because it took us a while to turn off the spigot in reaction to the market. So you've got even probably more outsized year-on-year impact from absorption than you would under normal times."

Typically, the way I would think about a launch, when we launch a program, it typically takes 5 years for us to reach peak annual sales. So it's not this monster ramp up. The technology also has legs. And we will often be selling technology for at least 10 years before we replace a platform or do other things. And this certainly is obviously longer-lived technology than Apple probably talks about.

Well, I mean, I believe our F&B business was up 4% in the first quarter. And certainly, I don't think the food market -- this is in -- this is heavily processed food, dairy market in particular is our focus in these markets. It includes protein and other areas. But those businesses are under pressure, and so there's no doubt in my mind we're outperforming the market. And the pressure comes in twofold: one, you have the consumer demand pressure as people move to different parts of the store to procure food; and second, there's been quite a bit of M&A activity in that market, which means ultimately, they consolidate and take out manufacturing facilities, which reduces temporarily total opportunity for us. Long term, though, the drivers in F&B, I think, are in excellent shape. It's called population and food safety. And the population will grow around the world. The middle-class will grow. Expectation for food quality will continue to increase, particularly in emerging market. And food safety is only going to get more challenging because, well, there's a lot of conversation in the U.S. about local farming. Local farming is not going to feed 9 billion people. And it's also not by any means the most sustainable way to farm. What you're going to want to do is farm where stuff naturally grows. So you're not going to see bananas growing in Manhattan anytime soon. It doesn't make any sense. It would be local, but it wouldn't be very sustainable. And so ultimately, I think you're going to still see long-distance shipping of food to, in particular, feed the Asian population growth. And long distance equals time, and time is the enemy of food safety. And so if anything, we think the demands for food safety technology are going to grow faster than the food demand, which is ultimately going to be driven by the 2 components I talked about: population growth and middle-class expectation growth. So I like our Food & Beverage business. New technology, team's on it, we're outperforming the market. I think that business gets better. And the water technology coupling we have is spot on for that business. It is a huge way to leverage our installed base in F&B."

But given all the stuff going on in the world, we don't think booking that at this point in time is wise. There's a lot of things that can change, including currency as the year goes on and there's just too much time remaining in the year in a very dynamic environment to go snap the line on one of multiple variables. So what we basically said is we have not changed our expected currency outcome for the year even though we recognize and admit that today's rates would indicate $0.10 better. So yes, if you want to go do that math, but there's a lot of things going in here. We haven't increased our range either at this point in time, and I think as the year goes, we'll continue to try to be transparent in what our expectations are and what the underlying assumption leading to our forecasted range.

It was $20 billion in sales, 20% margin -- OI margin and 20% return on invested capital. I was very clear at that time that we weren't going to hit all 3 by 2020 because if you did the math, it would imply much more than 15% EPS growth. And what we said is, we believe all 3 are achievable. They're achievable within sight of 2020, but they weren't all going to occur by 2020, and that's still true. If you go to the -- just the last 2 years, if '16 expected FX hit, not $0.10 better, you've got '15 and '16, we'd lose $1.5 billion in sales in 2 years, just some currency translation and over $250 million in OI. I mean, that's what those rates mean. So they chew up the bulk of the synergies you might have seen from one of those deals. With that, we continue to deliver positive EPS growth as we go through it. I will also say we also believe that translation FX, not transaction, transaction FX, we never talk about. It's almost equal in size, but we think that's a real impact in the business that has to be dealt with because it's the equivalent of inflation basically. So we don't talk about it. We only talk about translation because translation is sort of goofy. If I was headquartered in Munich last year, I would have been up 26% EPS with everything happening exactly the same except on consolidating into euros not into dollars. Our business isn't any better. Our share is not any better. Our margins aren't any better. Nothing's better except I translate to a more favorable currency. And so this stuff flips back and forth. So our margin improvement, yes, I think is real. At fixed currency is more like 60, not 20, and we expect to have continued fixed margin growth year in, year out. And 1 year it's going to look like 200 because currency is going to go in our favor. And I will tell you, it's still only 60 because really you've got to look at this the way the margin is really coming country by country and currency by currency. That's the way we ultimately realize it over any period of time that matters to our corporation, right? So that's how we look at it."

With me today are Doug Baker, Ecolab's Chairman and CEO; and Dan Schmechel, our CFO. A discussion of results along with our earnings release and the slides referencing the quarter's results and our outlook are available on Ecolab's website at ecolab.com/investor.
Please take a moment to read the cautionary statements on these materials stating that this teleconference, the discussion slides and the slides include estimates of future performance. These are forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially from those projected. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are described in the section of our most recent Form 10-K under Item 1A, Risk Factors, and in our posted materials. We also refer you to the supplemental diluted earnings per share information in the release.
Starting with a brief overview of the quarter. Continued attractive new account gains and new product introductions drove good fixed currency sales growth in our Global Institutional, Industrial and Other segments during the first quarter, nearly offsetting a decline in Global Energy sales. New business and ongoing cost-efficiency work led to strong adjusted fixed currency operating margin expansion, more than offsetting the impact of soft economies, weak oil prices and currency headwinds. These, along with fewer shares outstanding, drove the adjusted earnings per share increase before currency translation. While 2016 is proving to be a challenging year, we continue to focus on the same fundamental strategies that have successfully driven our strong growth record, providing the best products and service for our customers to give them the best results and lowest operating costs. They delivered again in the first quarter, and we expect them to deliver for the full year 2016. 
Looking to the second quarter, we expect our Global Institutional, Industrial and Other segments to continue to show solid acquisition-adjusted fixed currency growth, outpacing their markets in soft international economies as they leverage investments we have made to further improve sales and service force effectiveness and profitability, and more than offset lower results from our Global Energy business. We look for second quarter earnings per share to be in the $1.03 to $1.11 per share range with that range including approximately $0.08 per share or 7% of unfavorable currency translation and impact from the Venezuela deconsolidation as we continue to aggressively drive business growth. 
For the full year, the Global Institutional, Industrial and Other segments are expected to continue to show solid fixed currency growth. Global Energy segment expectations have softened. Global Energy sales are expected to be on the lower end of our range, down upper single digits versus last year. While the dollar has weakened somewhat, at this early point in the year, we are maintaining our earnings per share forecast for 2016 to reflect the uncertain currency trends and business environment. Net, we continue to expect to outperform our markets in 2016 while also investing in the key drivers for future sustainable above-average earnings growth. We expect our consolidated results to show improving comparisons in the second half and continue to look for adjusted diluted earnings per share in the $4.35 to $4.55 range. 
Moving to some highlights from the first quarter and as discussed in our press release, reported first quarter earnings per share were $0.77. On an adjusted basis, excluding special gains and charges and discrete tax items from both years, first quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share decreased 4% to $0.77, reflecting an $0.11 or 14% currency headwind. The adjusted earnings per share growth was driven by delivered product and other cost savings, cost efficiencies and a lower share count. Our consolidated fixed currency acquisition-adjusted sales were modestly lower as our Global Institutional, Industrial and Other segments grew 4%, but were offset by lower Global Energy sales. Regional sales growth was led by Latin America and Europe. 
Adjusted fixed currency operating margins showed strong growth, expanding 60 basis points. In 2016's difficult environment, we are focused on driving new business gains by helping customers to lower their costs. We are using our industry-leading product innovation and service strengths to help customers achieve the best results and lowest operating costs and through these, aggressively drive new account gains across all of our segments. We expect second quarter adjusted earnings per share in the $1.03 to $1.11 range, reflecting a currency translation and Venezuela deconsolidation drag of approximately $0.08 or 7%. Consolidated results are expected to improve with the second half outperforming the first half. We look for full year adjusted diluted earnings per share in the $4.35 to $4.55 per share range. 
In summary, despite a very challenging global economic and market environment, we expect to continue to deliver solid fundamental results in 2016. We remain confident in our business, our markets and our people as well as our capacities to meet our aggressive growth objectives over the coming years. 
And now here's Doug Baker with some comments."

We're on track for a full year delivery within our forecasted range. All of our sectors are handily outperforming their markets and competition, and we continue to gain share in all of these areas. 
For the year, there are natural puts and takes. If we look at our Institutional, Industrial and Other business segments, they're a bit above expectations at this point, driven by new business, innovation, cost savings, very good execution. This is driving improving top line and improved margin performance. Energy is heading to the lower side of our expectation in spite of share gains and savings initiatives, and this is really driven by an even tougher market than expected. This will pass. We continue to believe, though, that the upturn is really a 2017, not a 2016 story, i.e., the oil and gas market upturn. 
If we froze FX at today's rates, FX would be less of a negative than planned. It would be roughly $0.28 versus $0.38 negative. But given the fluidity of the FX situation, Brazil political environment, you've got the British exit vote, China, et cetera, we think it's too early and unwise to bake this into our forecast. Importantly, our forecast also continues to include significant investment in systems, R&D, talent initiatives, which are all, in total, greater than last year, which, I would remind you, was greater than the prior year and is, I think, a very strong indication of our confidence in the future, which is high, and we believe for good reason. 
So as we look at the future, we know that the temporary double headwinds of energy and FX will abate, don't know exactly when, but they will pass. Even with them, we've been doing well and outperforming markets. We do know, though, that our plan and our position, we think, are spot on for the future. So clean water, safe food, abundant energy and healthy environment is even more relevant going forward than it has been in the past 5 or 10 years. We have a stronger competitive advantage position now, we believe, given our recent new innovations and our focus on driving excellent outcomes at low cost because of reduction in footprints on CO2 and water. 
We also have very strong execution momentum. Our teams are on it. They're doing a great job. They're driving new business. We had another very strong new business quarter in the first quarter, and we have promising new business bets in businesses like life sciences in geographies like MEA, and there are plenty more. And finally, we got a culture and a team that knows how to deliver. For all these reasons, we feel very good about where we are, how we're going to get through the year, the position we're going to be in to drive continued growth beyond. 
So that's my opening, and with that, I'll turn it over to Mike, who will move on into Q&A."

I think the recent move in oil price I think -- look, the best predictions I read forecasted that oil would move up in anticipation of increased demand for the summer. It was likely going to weaken over the summer because really what needs to drive the fundamental price of oil is a rebalancing of supply and demand, and nobody really believed that was going to happen until towards the end of this year. And until that happens, you're not going to really, we believe, have sustained improvement in oil price or increase -- maybe we should call an improvement, increase in oil price. In terms of raw materials, I guess, our forecast has always had 2 views. One that raws likely move before we see the impacts of higher oil prices in our Energy Services business. That's in our forecast. So on back half, we have some uptick in raws included, not monstrous because it's -- because we still have favorability in the first half, but that abates and goes away as we think the energy market start correcting and healing. So that's our view right now. I don't think you're going to see material increase in activity, which is what's really needed to drive our Energy Services volume until at the earliest very late this year. But most likely we aren't going to see the impact until '17."

But overall, the model, as it has always proven, is fairly resilient, and so we have puts and takes. We also have pretty strong business performance from Institutional in North America, in particular. There are oil dividends, which we've talked about, which are certainly lower raw materials, which you see flowing through our II&O segments, which is one of the reasons gross profit is up. The other reason obviously is innovation. So I mean, I don't think the other surprises are really outliers nor will they dictate, I think, the year. And even the energy market softness, I would say it's the -- it's worse than we anticipated. I would still think energy is likely going to come in with a range we talked about.

There's virtually no inventory storage capabilities globally for oil. So this thing reacts wildly to very small changes in supply and demand, and that is still projected to start coming in very near balance at the end of the year, and I believe ultimately, that's going to be the data that dictates when this thing completely turns. So we're -- what are we, 18 months into this? And we're saying probably have 6 to 9 months to go, so certainly we're in the later innings."

However, we didn't have equal capabilities in all these markets, and in particular we made a breakout investment move in MEA about 18 months ago, and this cost us margin obviously last year and even a little bit early this year, but it has driven improved results. Previously, we really ran MEA as part of Europe. Our history whenever we make these breakout organizational moves, we did it with Food Retail breaking it out from KAY QSR. We did it many years ago with health care outside of what was then called EPP, which is our janitorial business. There are plenty other examples here. Both participants benefit, improve focus. And I think you're seeing that MEA has accelerated since we've broken it out. We have increased focus. We have a handle on our supply chain challenges and opportunities, and I would also point out Europe has done better since we've taken MEA out as well. Just simply it drives increased focus on the region that's left. So that would be a good example of how we are investing in what we think are critical markets long term. Latin America, we grew by basically 10% -- or 9%, I guess, in the quarter. We continue to do well in a region that's obviously under a lot of pressure, Brazil being the most notable headline owner right now, and I would say it's 2 things. I think we've always tried to focus on what matters most in these areas. Our Food & Beverage business, which is important throughout all those economies, is up 19%. Even our Paper business through some big wins is having a very strong quarter. Water is up double-digit, down in that market as well, and we believe those businesses in particular are going to be very strong players in Latin America for a long time to come, and that's what our focus has been, and it's paying off."

Well, I guess, we didn't see a change in customer behavior towards pricing, which would be accepting price increases. So no, they're under pressure, and this is not unusual, and they're certainly putting pressure on us. You got competitive pressure as well. Pricing still remains, in total, in the low single digits, and we expect it to be there for the year, but it's real pressure and a challenge. And what I would say is that's an average. So you've got some much more material givebacks in certain situations than other areas, where we've been able to hold price either because we have very, very unique technology and a high need or it's a customer not under the same pressure given their geographic position. So I would expect you'll continue to see that. I think the other things that we're seeing in that market, I don't know if they're surprising, customers are turning off programs and services. We expected some. We're seeing a little more than we expected, but that's always a temporary issue, and so people will take some risk, particularly in North America, where the huge market pressure is really coming to bear. And the business outside of North America continues to perform at a much higher rate, simply because the market really reacts here and everywhere else. People are typically pumping oil to meet builds, not necessarily to meet capital demands and trying to make money. So we would expect to continue to see that. We're remaining fiscally disciplined. Some of the pain is self-induced. Last year, we had only $4 million in bad debt write-offs in the Energy business. We expect it to be greater this year, but still in the single-digit millions, which is pretty low given the size of that business. And a lot of it is because the energy team has been very, very acutely aware of the risk there. We're putting customers on cash on demand quite early. We're staying out of some bankruptcy situations. Customers where we don't believe there's a future either before or after bankruptcy, we are walking from if they won't go to cash on delivery, et cetera. So those are the types of steps that we're taking, and they accentuate some short-term pain. But ultimately, even within the year, we think are going to be fiscally responsible moves because we're just going to avoid some big write-offs and other challenges."

Life sciences is a business that we competed in for a long time, but we did it as part of the work in our F&B business, and some of the function was driven out of our Healthcare business. We've taken those 2 pieces of business and created a focused division on the life sciences market, i.e., pharma, cosmetics, et cetera. The changes in that business and their needs match very much what we can do. So it's a market that's dominated by large multinationals. They're getting to shorter runs, need to run at higher efficiencies, cleaning-in-place technology is important in that market and a core competency that we have. So a lot of things that we do there match well. I would say when this business is run as a small piece of 2 other businesses, it performed well. We believe with focus, enhanced capabilities, R&D, et cetera, that we are going to be able to up the performance of this business handily just as we've done in other markets like Food Retail, et cetera, in the past."

The opportunities in that business are fairly significant because there's real pain in the industry, particularly in North America, as a consequence of wage pressure and ACA requirements.

Some of that's seasonal and some of it is market, but that would account for the vast majority. You simply -- you don't have the same coverage in your plants and everything else, which is why first quarter broadly is always a low-margin quarter for us, and it's a low-margin quarter for energy as well. And then it was exacerbated by further market declines as you go in. I would also point how fourth quarter, as we said during the fourth quarter, had a number of onetime positive events in it, all of them legitimate, but that would probably be -- account for almost $14 million of the $125 million that just weren't going to recur, which we called out in that fourth quarter. And it was simply we sold some inventory that was out there onetime, which were smart moves economically for the company, were legitimate deals, but you don't get to sell that inventory over and over again. So it took risk off the table and triggered a sale and some gross profit realization as a consequence of that. So those things are also part of the story. And then we also had a onetime or negative in the first quarter in Angola that was fairly substantial that needs to be accounted for. When you take those things, the whole thing makes sense. But the fourth quarter was a little bit overstated, and the first quarter is really reflective of low seasonality. And we will see improved margin in energy going forward simply because volume will be greater in the out quarters than it was in this quarter, and you'll have better overhead coverage."

If anything, we've reduced it in the near term as we up investments in G&A. We split this out 2 years ago. We've added a number of key division leadership positions, added corporate account position, added supply chain position so we have better ability to get product to customers in that region. Done a number of things which have put us in a better stead to drive growth, which is the real focus in that place and will drive margin after we get growth really cooking, but really right now, it's growth first."

We think that's the right balance between financial efficiency and also strategic capability, i.e., capitalize or jump quickly if you needed to. In terms of what we're looking at, I think our focus has been water because we believe it's a great opportunity. We continue to look there. You've seen recent Institutional and F&B deal, they continue to have promising bolt-ons, so we'll continue to do that. And then I'd say Healthcare broadly is an area that we're still very interested in. We think that's a great market for us. And we aim to win in that market. And I would say, typically, what we set our minds to, we do. It sometimes takes us longer than we would like. You certainly saw that in GCS, but we get there. And we end up persevering, and we are going to have a great Healthcare business. So those are areas we're looking at. In terms of energy, we have said we don't want to be dramatically bigger than we are in energy. We've said that for a while. But with that, where there are promising properties or new technologies that we think we can develop into promising annuity streams, we'll do it. We just announced one late last year, a Canadian technology that we bought for that very reason because the energy team, I think, has a very good vision of how to drive that technology into an annuity stream that helps customers and helps us. So that's how we look at it. Right now, the market, there are deals going down for prices that honestly we wouldn't pay. And we're going to remain disciplined. We did before. We did the Nalco deal at kind of the -- after the froth was over. And then we try to be smart stewards of shareholder money as we go forward."

So in this very tough economic environment what folks have done is basically gone to focus on the wells that are easiest to extract and cheapest to extract. That's how they're keeping cash flow going to pay their bills and hopefully survive until the price recovers. And when price recovers and demand needs to be met because you've got a lot of capital that's been pulled out of that business, they're going to have to go back to the other wells, and so the shift is inevitable.

I mean, this is just basic P&L stuff. But 15% is a significant volume hit. We've been under pressure there. We did not build inventory. We're trying to be disciplined on inventory and the other stuff so we took it on the chin.

Typically, the way I would think about a launch, when we launch a program, it typically takes 5 years for us to reach peak annual sales. So it's not this monster ramp up. The technology also has legs. And we will often be selling technology for at least 10 years before we replace a platform or do other things. And this certainly is obviously longer-lived technology than Apple probably talks about.

Well, I mean, I believe our F&B business was up 4% in the first quarter. And certainly, I don't think the food market -- this is in -- this is a processed food, dairy market in particular is our focus in these markets. It includes protein and other areas. But those businesses are under pressure, and so there's no doubt in my mind we're outperforming the market. And the pressure comes in twofold: one, you're under consumer demand pressure as people move to different parts of the store to procure food; and second, there's been quite a bit of M&A activity in that market, which means ultimately, they consolidate and take out manufacturing facilities, which reduces temporarily total opportunity for us. Long term, though, the drivers in F&B, I think, are in excellent shape. It's called population and food safety. And the population will grow around the world. The middle-class will grow. Expectation for food quality will continue to increase, particularly in emerging market. And food safety is only going to get more challenging because, well, there's a lot of conversation in the U.S. about local farming. Local farming is not going to feed 9 billion people. And it's also not by any means the most sustainable way to farm. What you're going to want to do is farm where stuff naturally grows. So you're not going to see bananas growing in Manhattan anytime soon. Doesn't make any sense. It would be local, but it wouldn't be very sustainable. And so ultimately, I think you're going to still see long-distance shipping of food to, in particular, feed the Asian population growth. And long distance equals time, and time is the enemy of food safety. And so if anything, we think the demands for food safety technology are going to grow faster than the food demand, which is ultimately going to be driven by the 2 components I talked about: population growth and middle-class expectation growth. So I like our Food & Beverage business. New technology, team's on it, we're outperforming the market. I think that business gets better. And the water technology coupling we have is spot on for that business. It is a huge way to leverage our installed base in F&B."

It was $20 million in sales, 20% margin -- OI margin and 20% return on invested capital. I was very clear at that time that we weren't going to hit all 3 by 2020 because if you did the math, it would imply much more than 15% EPS growth. And what we said is, we believe all 3 are achievable. They're achievable within sight of 2020, but they weren't all going to occur by 2020, and that's still true. If you go to the -- just the last 2 years, if '16 expected FX hit, that's $0.10 better, you've got '15 and '16, we lose $1.5 billion in sales in 2 years, just some currency translation and over $250 million in OI. I mean, that's what those rates mean. So they chew up the bulk of the synergies you might have seen from one of those deals. With that, we continue to deliver positive EPS growth as we go through it. I will also say we also believe that translation FX, not transaction, transaction FX, we never talk about. It's almost equal in size, but we think that's a real impact in the business that has to be dealt with because it's the equivalent of inflation basically. So we don't talk about it. We only talk about translation because translation is sort of goofy. If I was headquartered in Munich last year, I would have been up 26% EPS with everything happening exactly the same except on consolidating into euros not into dollars. Our business isn't any better. Our share is not any better. Our margins aren't any better. Nothing's better except I translate to a more favorable currency. And so this stuff flips back and forth. So our margin improvement, yes, I think is real. At fixed currency is more like 60, not 20, and we expect to have continued fixed margin growth year in, year out. And 1 year it's going to look like 200 because currency is going to go in our favor. And it will tell you, it's still only 60 because really you've got to look at this the way the margin is really coming country by country and currency by currency. That's the way we ultimately realize it over any period of time that matters to our corporation, right? So that's how we look at it."

[Technical Difficulty]
Okay. Sorry, we've got an odd dial tone.
All right. A discussion of our results along with earnings release and the slides referencing our quarter's results and our outlook are available on Ecolab's website at ecolab.com/investor.
Please take a moment to read the cautionary statements on these materials stating that this teleconference, the discussion and the slides include estimates of future performance.
These are forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially from those projected.
Factors that could cause actual results to differ are described in the section of our most recent Form 10-K under item 1A, Risk Factors, and in our posted materials.
We also refer you to the supplemental diluted earnings per share information in the release.
Starting with a brief overview of the quarter, continued attractive new account gains and new product introductions drove strong acquisition-adjusted fixed-currency sales growth in our Global Institutional, Industrial and Other segments during the second quarter, nearly offsetting a decline in energy sales. 
New business and ongoing cost-efficiency work led the adjusted fixed-currency operating margin expansion, more than offsetting the impact of soft economies, challenging end markets and continued currency headwinds. These, along with lower taxes and shares outstanding, drove the 7% adjusted earnings per share increase before currency translation. 
While Energy segment results have been challenging, we believe that recent trends suggest a bottoming of our energy cycle, and we expect second half Energy segment sequential results to reflect that stabilization. We look for the market recovery to begin gradually and take hold in 2017 and improve through 2018 and 2019 and for the Energy segment to show results reflecting that market improvement. 
Looking to the third quarter, we expect our Global Institutional, Industrial and Other segments to continue to show further strong acquisition-adjusted fixed-currency growth, outpacing their markets and soft international economies as they leverage investments we have made to further improve sales and service force effectiveness and profitability and more than offset lower year-on-year results from our Energy business. 
We look for the third quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the $1.24 range to $1.32 range, with that range approximately $0.08 per share or 6% of unfavorable impact from the Venezuela devaluation and deconsolidation and currency translation as we continue to aggressively drive business growth. 
For the full year, the Global Institutional Industrial and Other segments are expected to continue to show strong acquisition-adjusted fixed-currency growth. Energy year-on-year sales comparison should improve versus the first half, and for the full year are expected to decline around 10% versus the last year. 
We continue to expect to outperform our markets in 2016 while also investing in the key drivers for future sustainable above-average earnings growth. We expect our consolidated results to show improving comparisons in the second half and have narrowed our forecast for adjusted diluted earnings per share in 2016 to the $4.35 to $4.50 range from $4.35 to $4.55, which includes expected currency headwinds of $0.27 to $0.32 per share, of which $0.17 per share is from the Venezuela devaluation and deconsolidation. 
Moving to some highlights from the quarter and as discussed in our press release, reported second quarter diluted earnings per share were $0.87. On an adjusted basis, excluding special gains and charges and discrete tax items from both years, second quarter 2016 adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.08 and included $0.08 or 7% currency headwind. This compared with adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.08 a year ago. 
The adjusted diluted earnings per share growth was driven by delivered product and other cost savings, cost efficiencies and lower taxes and shares, which offset investments in the business and higher variable compensation. Our consolidated acquisition-adjusted fixed-currency sales were modestly lower as our Global Institutional, Industrial and Other segments grew 4% but were offset by lower Energy sales. 
Regional sales growth was led by Latin America and Europe. Reported operating margins declined 50 basis points. Adjusted fixed-currency operating margins expanded 30 basis points as delivered product and other cost savings and cost efficiencies offset investments in the business, higher variable compensation and lower Energy results. 
In 2016's difficult environment, we are focused on driving new business gains by helping customers lower costs. We are using our industry-leading product innovation and service strengths to help customers achieve the best results and the lowest operating costs and through these, aggressively drive new account gains across all of our segments. 
We expect third quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share in the $1.24 to $1.32 range, reflecting a combined Venezuela devaluation and deconsolidation impact and currency translation drag of approximately $0.08 or 6%. Consolidated results are expected to improve with the second half outperforming the first half. 
We narrowed our full year adjusted diluted earnings per share forecast to the $4.35 to $4.50 per share range from $4.35 to $4.55. This forecast includes expected unfavorable currency exchange in the $0.27 to $0.32 per share range, of which $0.17 per share is from the Venezuela devaluation, deconsolidation. 
In summary, despite a very challenging global economic and market environment, we expect to continue to deliver solid fundamental results in 2016. We remain confident in our business, our markets and our people as well as our capacities to meet our aggressive growth objectives over the coming years. 
And now here's Doug Baker with some comments."

So Q2 results were solid, particularly given the environment. 
So our adjusted EPS was flat versus last year but plus 7, excluding currency. And if you look at operating cash flow, it was up 37% versus last year for the first half. So these results are driven by continued strong performance as Mike just went through in our Institutional, Industrial and Other segments. Those segments combined added 6.5% top line growth, 4% organic. 
Our Energy segment is stabilizing. If you look at Q2 sales and OI, they're very much in line with Q1, with sales off about $5 million but OI stronger in Q2. 
Importantly, if you look at underlying metrics, what we call our leading indicators, both our new business and innovation metrics remained strong. We believe it will strengthen throughout the year. We expect the strong second half as a result. So that will be driven again by continued strong Industrial, Institutional and Other performances. We will see lessening Energy and FX headwinds we are forecasting in the second half. Energy is really driven principally by a easier base because last year, we had seen more of a drop in the second half than the first. So the base is just simpler to compare against. 
FX is our forecast, but really we're annualizing against last year's big second half move, and we predict that FX will be close to neutral, modest negative in the fourth quarter but obviously, coming out and being more neutral going into 2017. 
Last thing, I guess, I would highlight is a real call out to our team, who I think is doing a great, great job in a very tough environment. We remain focused on what we can control. We're getting after business. We're driving innovation. We're taking care of customers. We're doing a terrific job there. We continue to invest in the future. We're managing the business the right way, particularly around cash flow metrics and working capital, and we're also continuing to focus on delivering in the short term while doing all of these. So I'm very proud of the team and proud of the performance and importantly, happy to be moving into the second half, where we're starting to see a little less of a headwind than we've seen in the last 6 quarters. 
So with that, let me turn it back over to Mike introduce Q&A."

Well, Nate, yes, I would say our view was that we have bottomed or bottoming in the Energy segment. As a consequence, we felt it was a good time for us to analyze what assets we're actually going to be useful or not useful given the changing the Energy business. So we chose the timing based on our belief that we are at the bottom and starting to move into an inflection point though as I've said before, coming out angle is going to be a lot lower than the coming in angle. So it's not going to be an equal recovery. It's going to take more time to get out, but it's basically looking at our inventory situation. We had made products which made a lot of sense in previous environment, i.e., the water replacements and the like that given the drop off in the market, they don't make sense anymore, so that would be an example of a type of inventory that we disposed of, simply it made a lot of sense 2 years ago, doesn't make a lot of sense in this environment. And likewise, in some of the capital, could have been some fleet assets or some mixing vessels, et cetera, that just aren't going to be productive going forward. And so we felt it was the right thing to do to take these off the balance sheet. So really, the timing was as you said, and we do believe that this represents the ""we'll look at the assets as a consequence of the change in the Energy market."" We don't believe there is more to come, but also it's hard to predict the future, but that was the idea."

In terms of underlying business performance, we've never had a one-to-one on foot traffic, and we're watching some of the same foot traffic reports that probably everybody else is. I would say broadly in the full-service restaurant area, foot traffic has been soft for literally 7, 8 years. So it hasn't been our principal driver. It's really our ability to drive share based on our technologies, capability of lowering costs for our customers, and that's going to remain, we think, the forefront of how we're going to continue to drive share. In QSR, it's continuing to ensure that we're focusing on what our customer needs are, expanding with them as they expand geographically and seeking out new QSR customers, particularly outside of the U.S. as they emerge in different markets, and all of those strategies continued to work. We think that both Institutional and Specialty will continue to perform well throughout the balance of the year."

I think you're seeing that through announcements like Anios. We've got other smaller announcements this year. In terms of appetite, it's not that we don't have an appetite for a bigger deal. I think we'd be in a position to do one, both on the balance sheet, and I would say most importantly internally with management capacity and capability, but that's really going to be determined by mutual interest coming to a place where economically it makes sense, and these things you have to be a little more patient around.

It didn't make any money. It was actually losing money, and we wanted to turn that around over time because we're quite sensitive we want to remain in control of keeping the volume and the customers happy. So I would say that's progressing, and we'll start seeing positive out of Swisher either Q4 this year or Q1 next year. So no different. I'd say I think your formulaic statement around we get the sales first and the profit next. I think it's more true than not. It feels upended. We -- the metric we pay most attention to is return when we're doing deals, not accretion, dilution. Swisher should be a good example of that, dilutive the first year, but a hell of a return if we're able to execute on it, and we think we will be able to. That's how we like to focus on doing deals, and so we're just not as sensitive to first year profitability on these as long as we think the return's going to be great. Now we're not against first year profitability either. But often, they don't come hand in hand. So I think that's how we think about it. But if you do a series of these year in, year out, it sort of takes care of itself because you build up a number of annuity streams, and you're making money on the deals over any reasonable period of time."

We never have high expectations. We always go into these years thinking the growth is going to be more similar in the past couple of years, and there's no magic second half inflection point. Seems to be regularly forecast but rarely realized. So U.S., we haven't seen a huge change. I think there is a bit of a consumer spend hiccup in April, May, but that seems to have evened out a bit. In terms of Europe, I don't know that I would say the more -- the bigger impact in the near term has been around from terrorism, not British exit, and I think British exit may well, indeed, have significant impact on Europe in total. I guess, it's too early to recognize that at this point in time, but terrorism certainly where it's hit. So obviously, the Turkish tourism business is way off for 2 reasons. There are challenges with Russia, which seems to be clearing up. Russian tourists were one of their main draws, and that dried up, but obviously, the terroristic activity throughout that country has had a dampening effect on people's desire to go visit. And likewise, in parts of Europe, you've seen the same impact. With that said, I still think we're going to have positive sales growth this year in Europe. We continue to drive share. Our share anywhere in the world is not anywhere near what we would call max capability, and so what we focus on is taking care of our customers, keeping them and driving share, and we still believe we are more in charge than not of driving top line."

We are not anticipating or expecting any upturn in Energy market activity in the second half from really first half levels. We do believe that you continue to have the correction that we've been seeing in terms of supply and demand in the overall oil market. That continues to narrow, which we believe is the metric to watch, more so than price where price has seasonal components to it, too. We believe that we are likely to see softening of price as the summer ended, and what's predicted by many in the industry, I know many are acting surprised, but that was a common prediction, and so we still think that the key metrics are supply and demand. They are narrowing. That's what's going to drive correction in price over any period of time, but we don't see any real activity recovery until 2017."

So the Anios business and the rationale is one, it's in very similar businesses, has some excellent technology which we can leverage throughout the other geographic parts of our business. It's a great geographic footprint match with our current European business, i.e., where they're strong, we were almost nonexistent and vice versa. So it's almost ideal puzzle piece from that standpoint. And then the Anios brand is a strong brand, and we see it as a great way to go drive penetration in markets that may not be large enough for us to build our own kind of locally focused health care organization but still develop a very strong distributor-based strategy, leveraging a very strong global brand name like Anios.

I think the 4% is a bit understated versus what the actual performance is. If you said the global environment, it's going to be static here because you've got a number of industries, which are going through some major contractions as a consequence of change in economic environment, specifically Primary Metals, steel, et cetera, which are big water technology consumers for us, have been contracting. That's got a half-life. They stop contracting. So they may not rebuild. You do run into year-on-year base. Mining is, obviously, going through a major shift, and so you've got these. Mining was down 10%. We've got some large pieces of our heavy water business down double digits as well. That stuff will moderate over time even if the economy doesn't improve from here, and so I really think this is much of our business is growing and call it more like around a 5% is own. I don't think that's an unusual expectation or an unrealistic expectation in a modest growth economy, which we're in globally. So I would probably pin it around there. I think it's going to take a better economy to get us firmly in the 6% to 8% over an extended period of time, and we're welcome to prove that out if the economic gods would benefit us with a better economy."

Latin America, we've got very modest volume growth in Latin America but very strong pricing impacts, which as I said earlier, were and are critical given the high inflation in those markets, which is really driven by their currency devaluation.

And what we would like is more food produced in more plants. That's not exactly how are our customers view it.

Just on maybe the pace our trajectory of recovery you mentioned, Doug, that you didn't think it would be the same angle of recovery as the angle of decline. Then you also mentioned you expected a sizable improvement in operating income even with a mid-single-digit top line improvement next year. When you say sizable, I think the consensus number for EBIT growth next year in Energy is around 20%, 25%. Is that the type of growth you think we should be baking in? Or is that aggressive?"

So if you would, we'll give you more transparency into that expectation as the year goes on. But right now, it seems to be it's just too early for us to do that in good conscience because our odds of being right are even smaller than they will be in December. Now with that said, when you have volume degradation in a business, particularly after X, you just see a lot of margin chewed up because you're no longer getting coverage. And so you will see, I think, a march back on OI that is different on sales simply because as you get some nominal or a volume coverage, it starts rebuilding overhead coverage, and you also get out of cutting inventories and back into even building inventories, and so this thing is always a little bit procyclical and how you have to manage inventories and everything else. It accentuates the negative and probably in a small way, accentuates the positive when you get out of it."

And so this is one of those opportunities that is occurring because we are joining forces, i.e., how do you get out and aggressively exploit the opportunity Anios has geographically outside of Europe, and we think it's significant given our existing footprint, our ability to do this quickly because we already have legal entities, capability to manage billing, people and all the rest and all these markets. We can turn on a dime to do this, whereas obviously, it'd be much more difficult for them. So that's some of the unique growth opportunities it presents.

Will there be one exception? I'm sure there will be. But broadly in the Energy market in 2017, we think that's more likely a 2018 and '19 story as that market heals, recovers, and activity levels have to ramp up significantly in those years to fill in the hole that's been created by the capital that's been yanked out of this industry. And so we really think it takes that kind of accelerated activity to create an environment where you're going to see pricing. Others in this industry have talked about getting pricing sooner, but I would say they're in parts of the industry where they've had much more dramatic price decreases than we have. Remember, we're talking in total, on average, several percentage points, not 15% and 20% type reductions, and so they're in a very different situation and frankly, probably have to get pricing to be healthy enough to continue operating in those industries."

Heavy, the pressure there is Primary Metals in particular, and it's growing but very modestly, and I think that's what we're going to see in the second half.

Last year, it was up versus the prior year. We have not blinked in terms of making long-term investments in our business. We have not taken any dollar off the table there. We want to continue to manage this business wisely, which means make your long-term investment, January comes every year. We're working to go manage our cash flow and working capital intelligently, which means take it out of the business even when it has adverse impacts in your quarterly results because when you reduce inventory, you reduce POH overhead coverage, but it's important that we get inventory down. We've been driving it down. I think we're $200 million plus in terms of reduced working capital year-on-year, first half versus second half. So that's an important metric for us to continue to drive. We want to make sure that we not only deliver very, very good EPS numbers but very good cash flow numbers as well because at the end of the day, that's what drives shareholder value.

A discussion of our results along with",907,"Thank you. Hello, everyone, and welcome to Ecolab second quarter conference call. With me today is Doug Baker, Ecolab's Chairman and CEO.
[Technical Difficulty]
Okay. Sorry, we've got an odd dial tone.
All right. A discussion of our results along with earnings release and the slides referencing our quarter's results and our outlook are available on Ecolab's website at ecolab.com/investor.
Please take a moment to read the cautionary statements on these materials stating that this teleconference, the discussion and the slides include estimates of future performance. These are forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially from those projected.
Factors that could cause actual results to differ are described in the section of our most recent Form 10-K under item 1A, Risk Factors, and in our posted materials. We also refer you to the supplemental diluted earnings per share information in the release.
Starting with a brief overview of the quarter, continued attractive new account gains and new product introductions drove strong acquisition-adjusted fixed-currency sales growth in our Global Institutional, Industrial and Other segments during the second quarter, nearly offsetting a decline in energy sales.
New business and ongoing cost-efficiency work led the adjusted fixed-currency operating margin expansion, more than offsetting the impact of soft economies, challenging end markets and continued currency headwinds. These, along with lower taxes and shares outstanding, drove the 7% adjusted earnings per share increase before currency translation.
While Energy segment results have been challenging, we believe that recent trends suggest a bottoming of our energy cycle, and we expect second half Energy segment sequential results to reflect that stabilization. We look for the market recovery to begin gradually and take hold in 2017 and improve through 2018 and 2019 and for the Energy segment to show results reflecting that market improvement.
Looking to the third quarter, we expect our Global Institutional, Industrial and Other segments to continue to show further strong acquisition-adjusted fixed-currency growth, outpacing their markets and soft international economies as they leverage investments we have made to further improve sales and service force effectiveness and profitability and more than offset lower year-on-year results from our Energy business.
We look for the third quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the $1.24 to $1.32 range, with that range including approximately $0.08 per share or 6% of unfavorable impact from the Venezuela devaluation, deconsolidation and currency translation as we continue to aggressively drive business growth.
For the full year, the Global Institutional, Industrial and Other segments are expected to continue to show strong acquisition-adjusted fixed-currency growth. Energy year-on-year sales comparison should improve versus the first half and for the full year are expected to decline around 10% versus the last year.
We continue to expect to outperform our markets in 2016 while also investing in the key drivers for future sustainable above-average earnings growth. We expect our consolidated results to show improving comparisons in the second half and have narrowed our forecast for adjusted diluted earnings per share in 2016 to the $4.35 to $4.50 range from $4.35 to $4.55, which includes expected currency headwinds of $0.27 to $0.32 per share, of which $0.17 per share is from the Venezuela devaluation and deconsolidation.
Moving to some highlights from the quarter and as discussed in our press release, reported second quarter diluted earnings per share were $0.87. On an adjusted basis, excluding special gains and charges and discrete tax items from both years, second quarter 2016 adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.08 and included $0.08 or 7% currency headwind. This compared with adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.08 a year ago.
The adjusted diluted earnings per share growth was driven by delivered product and other cost savings, cost efficiencies and lower taxes and shares, which offset investments in the business and higher variable compensation.
Our consolidated acquisition-adjusted fixed-currency sales were modestly lower as our Global Institutional, Industrial and Other segments grew 4% but were offset by lower Energy sales.
Regional sales growth was led by Latin America and Europe. Reported operating margins declined 50 basis points. Adjusted fixed-currency operating margins expanded 30 basis points as delivered product and other cost savings and cost efficiencies offset investments in the business, higher variable compensation and lower Energy results.
In 2016's difficult environment, we are focused on driving new business gains by helping customers lower costs. We are using our industry-leading product innovation and service strengths to help customers achieve the best results and the lowest operating costs; and through these, aggressively drive new account gains across all of our segments.
We expect third quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share in the $1.24 to $1.32 range, reflecting a combined Venezuela devaluation and deconsolidation impact and currency translation drag of approximately $0.08 or 6%. Consolidated results are expected to improve, with the second half outperforming the first half.
We narrowed our full year adjusted diluted earnings per share forecast to the $4.35 to $4.50 per share range from $4.35 to $4.55. This forecast includes expected unfavorable currency exchange in the $0.27 to $0.32 per share range, of which $0.17 per share is from the Venezuela devaluation, deconsolidation. 
In summary, despite a very challenging global economic and market environment, we expect to continue to deliver solid fundamental results in 2016. We remain confident in our business, our markets and our people as well as our capacities to meet our aggressive growth objectives over the coming years.
And now here's Doug Baker with some comments."

Just a couple of thoughts on the quarter and the second half of the year. So Q2 results were solid, particularly given the environment.
So adjusted EPS was flat versus last year, but plus 7% excluding currency. And if you look at operating cash flow, it was up 37% versus last year for the first half. So these results are driven by continued strong performance, as Mike just went through, in our Institutional, Industrial and Other segments. Those segments combined added 6.5% top line growth, 4% organic.
Our Energy segment is stabilizing. If you look at Q2 sales and OI, they're very much in line with Q1, with sales off about $5 million but OI stronger in Q2.
Importantly, if you look at underlying metrics, what we call our leading indicators, both our new business and innovation metrics remained strong. We believe it will strengthen throughout the year. We expect a strong second half as a result. So that will be driven again by continued strong Industrial, Institutional and Other performances. We will see lessening Energy and FX headwinds, we are forecasting in the second half. Energy is really driven principally by an easier base because, last year, we had seen more of the drop in the second half than the first. So the base is just simpler to compare against.
FX is our forecast -- and really we're annualizing against last year's big second half move, and we predict that FX will be close to neutral, modest negative in the fourth quarter but obviously coming out and being more neutral going into 2017.
Last thing, I guess, I would highlight is a real call out to our team, who I think is doing a great, great job in a very tough environment. We remain focused on what we can control. We're getting after new business. We're driving innovation. We're taking care of customers. We're doing a terrific job there. We continue to invest in the future. We're managing the business the right way, particularly around cash flow metrics and working capital, and we're also continuing to focus on delivering in the short term while doing all of these. So I'm very proud of the team and proud of the performance and, importantly, happy to be moving into the second half, where we're starting to see a little less of a headwind than we've seen in the last 6 quarters.
So with that, now let me turn it back over to Mike to introduce Q&A."

Well, Nate, yes, I would say our view was that we have bottomed or bottoming in the Energy segment. As a consequence, we felt it was a good time for us to analyze what assets were actually going to be useful or not useful given the change in the Energy business. So we chose the timing based on our belief that we are at the bottom and starting to move into an inflection point. Though as I've said before, coming out angle is going to be a lot lower than the coming in angle. So it's not going to be an equal recovery. It's going to take more time to get out. But basically looking at our inventory situation, we had made products which made a lot of sense in the previous environment, i.e. guar replacements and the like that given the dropoff in the guar market, they don't make sense anymore. And so that would be an example of the type of inventory that we disposed of. Simply, it made a lot of sense 2 years ago. It doesn't make a lot of sense in this environment. And likewise, in some of the capital, there could have been some fleet assets or some mixing vessels, et cetera, that just aren't going to be productive going forward. And so we felt it was the right thing to do to take these off the balance sheet. So really, the timing was as you said, and we do believe that this represents the ""we look at the assets as a consequence of the change in the Energy market."" We don't believe there is more to come. But also, it's hard to predict the future, but that was the idea."

Our -- most of the growth in both the Specialty and Institutional businesses is volume driven. You have exceptions like Latin America, where you just have high inflation, where we're going after and getting significant price because it's a must given the environment. In terms of underlying business performance, we've never had a one to one on foot traffic, and we're watching some of the same foot traffic reports that probably everybody else is. I would say broadly in the full-service restaurant area, foot traffic has been soft for literally 7, 8 years. So it hasn't been our principal driver. It's really our ability to drive share based on our technologies, capability of lowering costs for our customers. And that's going to remain, we think, in the forefront of how we're going to continue to drive share. In QSR, it's continuing to make sure that we're focusing on what our customer needs are, expanding with them as they expand geographically and seeking out new QSR customers, particularly outside of the U.S. as they emerge in different markets, and all of those strategies continue to work. We think that both Institutional and Specialty will continue to perform well throughout the balance of the year."

More frequently, we're buying companies as opposed to making equity investments in companies. Here, it made sense to make the type of investment we're making given the matching capabilities and what we were looking to try to do. We thought it was a wise way to proceed. I would say in the M&A front, generally, yes, I'm quite comfortable that if you take some kind of midpoint of a range around 3% of sales that without doing anything outsized, there's enough attractive targets out there to continue to add approximately 3% to the sales line. I think you're seeing that through announcements like Anios. We've got other smaller announcements this year. In terms of appetite, it's not that we don't have an appetite for a bigger deal. I think we'd be in a position to do one both on the balance sheet and I would say most importantly internally with management capacity and capability. But that's really going to be determined by mutual interest coming to a place where economically it makes sense, and these things you have to be a little more patient around. So I would expect more smaller deals in the near term."

When we did the -- so I'll answer the last question first, Swisher. Swisher is more or less on plan and as we predicted. At the time we bought it, we said the first 4 quarters of ownership would be likely negative. Obviously, we bought that asset at a pretty low price. It was at a low price for a reason. It didn't make any money. It was actually losing money, and we wanted to turn that around over time because we're quite sensitive. We want to remain in control of keeping the volume and the customers happy. So I would say that's progressing, and we'll start seeing positive out of Swisher either Q4 this year or Q1 next year. So no different. I'd say I think your formulaic statement around we get the sales first and the profit next. I think it's more true than not. It feels dependent. We -- the metric we pay most attention to is return when we're doing deals, not accretion, dilution. Swisher would be a good example of that, dilutive the first year but a hell of a return if we're able to execute on it, and we think we will be able to. That's how we like to focus on doing deals. And so we're just not as sensitive to first year profitability on these as long as we think the return's going to be great. Now we're not against first year profitability either. But often, they don't come hand in hand. So I think that's how I think about it. But if you do have series of these year in, year out, it sort of takes care of itself because you build up a number of annuity streams, and you're making money on the deals over any reasonable period of time."

In terms of Europe, I don't know that -- I would say the more -- the bigger impact in the near term has been around from terrorism, not British exit. And I think British exit may well indeed have significant impact on Europe in total. I guess, it's too early to recognize that at this point in time, but terrorism certainly where it's hit. So obviously, the Turkish tourism business is way off for 2 reasons: Their challenges with Russia, which seemed to be clearing up. Russian tourists were one of their main draws, and that dried up. But obviously, the terroristic activity throughout that country has had a dampening effect on people's desire to go visit. And likewise, in parts of Europe, you've seen the same impact. With that said, I still think we're going to have positive sales growth this year in Europe. We continue to drive share. Our share anywhere in the world is not anywhere near what we would call max capability.

So we're seeing the recovery and improvement that we've been talking about in that business, and we anticipate a better second half in that business even before we close on Anios. So the Anios business and the rationale is, one, it's in very similar businesses, has some excellent technology, which we can leverage throughout the other geographic parts of our business. It's a great geographic footprint match with our current European business, i.e. where they're strong, we were almost nonexistent and vice versa. So it's almost ideal puzzle piece from that standpoint. And then the Anios brand is a strong brand, and we see it as a great way to go drive penetration in markets that may not be large enough for us to build our own, if you will, kind of locally focused health care organization but still develop a very strong distributor-based strategy, leveraging a very strong global brand name like Anios. So that's the basics of that deal."

I think the 4% is a bit understated versus what the actual performance is. If you said the global environment, it's going to be static here because you've got a number of industries, which are going through some major contractions as a consequence of change in economic environment, specifically primary metals, steel, et cetera, which are big water technology consumers for us, have been contracting. That's got a half-life. They stop contracting. While they may not rebuild, you do run into year-on-year base. Mining is obviously going through a major shift. And so you've got these -- mining was down 10%. We've got some large pieces of our heavy water business down double digits as well. That stuff will moderate over time even if the economy doesn't improve from here. And so I really think this is -- much of our business is growing in, call it, more like around the 5% zone. I don't think that's an unusual expectation or an unrealistic expectation in a modest growth economy, which we're in globally. So I would probably pin it around there. I think it's going to take a better economy to get us firmly in the 6% to 8% over an extended period of time, and we're welcome to prove that out if the economic gods would benefit us with a better economy."

Latin America, we've got very modest volume growth in Latin America, the very strong pricing impacts, which as I said earlier, were and are critical given the high inflation in those markets, which is really driven by their currency devaluation. So they import a lot of technology and a lot of raw materials, and those raws cost more in those markets as a consequence of their currency moves. And we have to get pricing to negate that, and we are. So that's, I guess, the perspective I have on those regions.

There's been a number of large acquisitions, both executed and considered. And so when 2 big companies get together, they tend to drive synergies, which means fewer plants. And what we would like is more food produced in more plants. That's not exactly how our customers view it. So they like more food produced in less plants. And as a result, we've got to go work through those things. What we've been doing -- often on, this goes in cycles. We're just going through another one, and this too has an end.

Now with that said, when you have volume degradation in a business, particularly after X, you just see a lot of margin chewed up because you're no longer getting coverage. And so you will see, I think, a march back on OI that is different on sales simply because as you get some nominal -- or a volume coverage, it starts rebuilding overhead coverage, and you also get out of cutting inventories and back into even building inventories.

We're still going to have negative pricing for a few quarters after that before you start annualizing against the price concessions that we've made in the industry, but we don't expect that we're going to have price increases, and I'm talking broadly. Will there be one exception? I'm sure there will be. But broadly, in the Energy market in 2017, we think that's more likely a 2018 and '19 story as that market heals, recovers. And activity levels have to ramp up significantly in those years to fill in the hole that's been created by the capital that's been yanked out of this industry. And so we really think it takes that kind of accelerated activity to create an environment where you're going to see pricing. Others in this industry have talked about getting pricing sooner, but I would say they're in parts of the industry where they've had much more dramatic price decreases than we have. Remember, we're talking in total, on average, several percentage points, not 15% and 20%-type reductions. And so they're in a very different situation and, frankly, probably have to get pricing to be healthy enough to continue in operating in those industries."

And I think you'd come out of it and are probably in a position where you can grow that business again in 2017. Heavy, the pressure there is primary metals in particular, and it's growing but very modestly. And I think that's what we're going to see in the second half. You're not going to see a significant upturn, but we do believe we'll see one early in 2017 as you start annualizing against some of the pain in that business and start moving forward. In the light side of water, so water, heavy and light combined were up about 4% in this quarter. Light continues to be very strong, upper single-digit organic growth. We see that continuing.

That area has gotten significant increased investment and will continue to do so. If you look at our combined technology and R&D budget, it's up significantly this year versus last year. Last year, it was up versus the prior year. We have not blinked in terms of making long-term investments in our business. We have not taken any dollar off the table there. We want to continue to manage this business wisely, which means make your long-term investment. January comes every year. We're working to go manage our cash flow and working capital intelligently, which means take it out of the business even when it has adverse impacts in your quarterly results because when you reduce inventory, you reduce PLOH overhead coverage, but it's important that we get inventory down. We've been driving it down. I think we're $200 million-plus in terms of reduced working capital year-on-year, first half versus second half. So that's an important metric for us to continue to drive. We want to make sure that we not only deliver very, very good EPS numbers but very good cash flow numbers as well because, at the end of the day, that's what drives shareholder value.

With me today is Doug Baker, Ecolab's Chairman and CEO.
[Technical Difficulty]
Okay. Sorry, we've got an odd dial tone.
All right. A discussion of our results along with earnings release and the slides referencing our quarter's results and our outlook are available on Ecolab's website at ecolab.com/investor.
Please take a moment to read the cautionary statements on these materials stating that this teleconference, the discussion and the slides include estimates of future performance. These are forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially from those projected.
Factors that could cause actual results to differ are described in the section of our most recent Form 10-K under item 1A, Risk Factors, and in our posted materials. We also refer you to the supplemental diluted earnings per share information in the release.
Starting with a brief overview of the quarter, continued attractive new account gains and new product introductions drove strong acquisition-adjusted fixed-currency sales growth in our Global Institutional, Industrial and Other segments during the second quarter, nearly offsetting a decline in energy sales.
New business and ongoing cost-efficiency work led the adjusted fixed-currency operating margin expansion, more than offsetting the impact of soft economies, challenging end markets and continued currency headwinds. These, along with lower taxes and shares outstanding, drove the 7% adjusted earnings per share increase before currency translation.
While Energy segment results have been challenging, we believe that recent trends suggest a bottoming of our energy cycle, and we expect second half Energy segment sequential results to reflect that stabilization. We look for the market recovery to begin gradually and take hold in 2017 and improve through 2018 and 2019 and for the Energy segment to show results reflecting that market improvement.
Looking to the third quarter, we expect our Global Institutional, Industrial and Other segments to continue to show further strong acquisition-adjusted fixed-currency growth, outpacing their markets and soft international economies as they leverage investments we have made to further improve sales and service force effectiveness and profitability and more than offset lower year-on-year results from our Energy business.
We look for the third quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the $1.24 to $1.32 range, with that range including approximately $0.08 per share or 6% of unfavorable impact from the Venezuela devaluation, deconsolidation and currency translation as we continue to aggressively drive business growth.
For the full year, the Global Institutional, Industrial and Other segments are expected to continue to show strong acquisition-adjusted fixed-currency growth. Energy year-on-year sales comparison should improve versus the first half and for the full year are expected to decline around 10% versus the last year.
We continue to expect to outperform our markets in 2016 while also investing in the key drivers for future sustainable above-average earnings growth. We expect our consolidated results to show improving comparisons in the second half and have narrowed our forecast for adjusted diluted earnings per share in 2016 to the $4.35 to $4.50 range from $4.35 to $4.55, which includes expected currency headwinds of $0.27 to $0.32 per share, of which $0.17 per share is from the Venezuela devaluation and deconsolidation.
Moving to some highlights from the quarter and as discussed in our press release, reported second quarter diluted earnings per share were $0.87. On an adjusted basis, excluding special gains and charges and discrete tax items from both years, second quarter 2016 adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.08 and included $0.08 or 7% currency headwind. This compared with adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.08 a year ago.
The adjusted diluted earnings per share growth was driven by delivered product and other cost savings, cost efficiencies and lower taxes and shares, which offset investments in the business and higher variable compensation.
Our consolidated acquisition-adjusted fixed-currency sales were modestly lower as our Global Institutional, Industrial and Other segments grew 4% but were offset by lower Energy sales.
Regional sales growth was led by Latin America and Europe. Reported operating margins declined 50 basis points. Adjusted fixed-currency operating margins expanded 30 basis points as delivered product and other cost savings and cost efficiencies offset investments in the business, higher variable compensation and lower Energy results.
In 2016's difficult environment, we are focused on driving new business gains by helping customers lower costs. We are using our industry-leading product innovation and service strengths to help customers achieve the best results and the lowest operating costs; and through these, aggressively drive new account gains across all of our segments.
We expect third quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share in the $1.24 to $1.32 range, reflecting a combined Venezuela devaluation and deconsolidation impact and currency translation drag of approximately $0.08 or 6%. Consolidated results are expected to improve, with the second half outperforming the first half.
We narrowed our full year adjusted diluted earnings per share forecast to the $4.35 to $4.50 per share range from $4.35 to $4.55. This forecast includes expected unfavorable currency exchange in the $0.27 to $0.32 per share range, of which $0.17 per share is from the Venezuela devaluation, deconsolidation. 
In summary, despite a very challenging global economic and market environment, we expect to continue to deliver solid fundamental results in 2016. We remain confident in our business, our markets and our people as well as our capacities to meet our aggressive growth objectives over the coming years.
And now here's Doug Baker with some comments."

Just a couple of thoughts on the quarter and the second half of the year. So Q2 results were solid, particularly given the environment.
So adjusted EPS was flat versus last year, but plus 7% excluding currency. And if you look at operating cash flow, it was up 37% versus last year for the first half. So these results are driven by continued strong performance, as Mike just went through, in our Institutional, Industrial and Other segments. Those segments combined added 6.5% top line growth, 4% organic.
Our Energy segment is stabilizing. If you look at Q2 sales and OI, they're very much in line with Q1, with sales off about $5 million but OI stronger in Q2.
Importantly, if you look at underlying metrics, what we call our leading indicators, both our new business and innovation metrics remain strong. We believe it will strengthen throughout the year. We expect a strong second half as a result. So that will be driven again by continued strong Industrial, Institutional and Other performances. We will see lessening Energy and FX headwinds, we are forecasting in the second half. Energy is really driven principally by an easier base because, last year, we had seen more of the drop in the second half than the first. So the base is just simpler to compare against.
FX is our forecast -- and really we're annualizing against last year's big second half move, and we predict that FX will be close to neutral, modest negative in the fourth quarter but obviously coming out and being more neutral going into 2017.
Last thing, I guess, I would highlight is a real call out to our team, who I think is doing a great, great job in a very tough environment. We remain focused on what we can control. We're getting after new business. We're driving innovation. We're taking care of customers. We're doing a terrific job there. We continue to invest in the future. We're managing the business the right way, particularly around cash flow metrics and working capital, and we're also continuing to focus on delivering in the short term while doing all of these. So I'm very proud of the team and proud of the performance and, importantly, happy to be moving into the second half, where we're starting to see a little less of a headwind than we've seen in the last 6 quarters.
So with that, now let me turn it back over to Mike to introduce Q&A."

Well, Nate, yes, I would say our view was that we have bottomed or bottoming in the Energy segment. As a consequence, we felt it was a good time for us to analyze what assets were actually going to be useful or not useful given the change in the Energy business. So we chose the timing based on our belief that we are at the bottom and starting to move into an inflection point. Though as I've said before, coming out angle is going to be a lot lower than the coming in angle. So it's not going to be an equal recovery. It's going to take more time to get out. But it's basically looking at our inventory situation, we had made products which made a lot of sense in the previous environment, i.e. guar replacements and the like, that given the drop-off in the guar market, they don't make sense anymore. And so that would be an example of the type of inventory that we disposed of. Simply, it made a lot of sense 2 years ago. It doesn't make a lot of sense in this environment. And likewise, in some of the capital, there could have been some fleet assets or some mixing vessels, et cetera, that just aren't going to be productive going forward. And so we felt it was the right thing to do to take these off the balance sheet. So really, the timing was as you said, and we do believe that this represents the ""we look at the assets as a consequence of the change in the Energy market."" We don't believe there is more to come. But also, it's hard to predict the future, but that was the idea."

Our -- most of the growth in both the Specialty and Institutional businesses is volume driven. You have exceptions like Latin America, where you just have high inflation, where we're going after and getting significant price because it's a must given the environment. In terms of underlying business performance, we've never had a one to one on foot traffic, and we're watching some of the same foot traffic reports that probably everybody else is. I would say broadly in the full-service restaurant area, foot traffic has been soft for literally 7, 8 years. So it hasn't been our principal driver. It's really our ability to drive share based on our technologies, capability of lowering costs for our customers. And that's going to remain, we think, in the forefront of how we're going to continue to drive share. In QSR, it's continuing to make sure that we're focusing on what our customer needs are, expanding with them as they expand geographically and seeking out new QSR customers, particularly outside of the U.S. as they emerge in different markets, and all of those strategies continue to work. We think that both Institutional and Specialty will continue to perform well throughout the balance of the year."

More frequently, we're buying companies as opposed to making equity investments in companies. Here, it made sense to make the type of investment we're making given the matching capabilities and what we were looking to try to do. We thought it was a wise way to proceed. I would say in the M&A front, generally, yes, I'm quite comfortable that if you take some kind of midpoint of a range around 3% of sales, that without doing anything outsized, there's enough attractive targets out there to continue to add approximately 3% to the sales line. I think you're seeing that through announcements like Anios. We've got other smaller announcements this year. In terms of appetite, it's not that we don't have an appetite for a bigger deal. I think we'd be in a position to do one both on the balance sheet and I would say most importantly internally with management capacity and capability. But that's really going to be determined by mutual interest coming to a place where economically it makes sense, and these things you have to be a little more patient around. So I would expect more smaller deals in the near term."

When we did the -- so I'll answer the last question first, Swisher. Swisher is more or less on plan and as we predicted. At the time we bought it, we said the first 4 quarters of ownership would be likely negative. Obviously, we bought that asset at a pretty low price. It was at a low price for a reason. It didn't make any money. It was actually losing money, and we wanted to turn that around over time because we're quite sensitive. We want to remain in control of keeping the volume and the customers happy. So I would say that's progressing, and we'll start seeing positive out of Swisher either Q4 this year or Q1 next year. So no different. I'd say I think your formulaic statement around we get the sales first and the profit next. I think it's more true than not. It feels dependent. We -- the metric we pay most attention to is return when we're doing deals, not accretion, dilution. Swisher would be a good example of that, dilutive the first year but a hell of a return if we're able to execute on it, and we think we will be able to. That's how we like to focus on doing deals. And so we're just not as sensitive to first year profitability on these as long as we think the return's going to be great. Now we're not against first year profitability either. But often, they don't come hand in hand. So I think that's how I think about it. But if you do a series of these year in, year out, it sort of takes care of itself because you build up a number of annuity streams, and you're making money on the deal over any reasonable period of time."

In terms of Europe, I don't know that -- I would say the more -- the bigger impact in the near term has been around -- from terrorism, not British exit. And I think British exit may well indeed have significant impact on Europe in total. I guess, it's too early to recognize that at this point in time, but terrorism certainly where it's hit. So obviously, the Turkish tourism business is way off for 2 reasons: Their challenges with Russia, which seemed to be clearing up. Russian tourists were one of their main draws, and that dried up. But obviously, the terroristic activity throughout that country has had a dampening effect on people's desire to go visit. And likewise, in parts of Europe, you've seen the same impact. With that said, I still think we're going to have positive sales growth this year in Europe. We continue to drive share. Our share anywhere in the world is not anywhere near what we would call max capability. And so what we focus on is taking care of our customers, keeping them and driving share, and we still believe we are more in charge than not of driving top line."

We do believe that you continue to have the correction that we've been seeing in terms of supply and demand in the overall oil market. That continues to narrow, which we believe is the metric to watch, more so than price. Price has seasonal components to it, too. We believe that we are likely to see softening of price as the summer ended. It was predicted by many in the industry. I know many are acting surprised, but that was a common prediction.

It's a great geographic footprint match with our current European business, i.e. where they're strong, we were almost nonexistent and vice versa. So it's an almost ideal puzzle piece from that standpoint. And then the Anios brand is a strong brand, and we see it as a great way to go drive penetration in markets that may not be large enough for us to build our own, if you will, kind of locally focused health care organization but still develop a very strong distributor-based strategy, leveraging a very strong global brand name like Anios.

I think the 4% is a bit understated versus what the actual performance is if you said the global environment is going to be static here because you've got a number of industries which are going through some major contractions as a consequence of change in economic environment, specifically primary metals, steel, et cetera, which are big water technology consumers for us, have been contracting. That's got a half-life. They stop contracting. While they may not rebuild, you do run into year-on-year base. Mining is obviously going through a major shift. And so you've got these -- mining was down 10%. We've got some large pieces of our heavy water business down double digits as well. That stuff will moderate over time even if the economy doesn't improve from here. And so I really think this is -- much of our business is growing in, call it, more like around the 5% zone. I don't think that's an unusual expectation or an unrealistic expectation in a modest growth economy, which we're in globally. So I would probably pin it around there.

If they're these assumptions, which is that you do see modest oil price recovery next year, where it's, call it, $50, $55 for a continued period of time, which is what we believe and you start seeing a very modest pickup in activity in 2017, we think that we'll see modest growth, which we talked about previously, call it, mid-single digits. And in that scenario, just the volume leverage, overhead coverage leverage alone, you would see sizable improvement in operating income from that business. That would -- we do not believe next year is going to be a price recovery year simply because, typically, it's probably going to have to move into '18 before we see substantial price recovery. A price recovery alone isn't needed to see improved margins or improved profits."

Latin America, we've got very modest volume growth in Latin America, the very strong pricing impacts, which as I said earlier, were and are critical given the high inflation in those markets, which is really driven by their currency devaluation. So they import a lot of technology and a lot of raw materials, and those raws cost more in those markets as a consequence of their currency moves. And we had to get pricing to negate that, and we are. So that's, I guess, the perspective I have on those regions. So LA, we continue to get modest market share gains with significant pricing gains."

But you've seen a lot of consolidation, particularly in the North American market as there's been real pressure on a number of the processed food companies. There's been a number of large acquisitions, both executed and considered. And so when 2 big companies get together, they tend to drive synergies, which means fewer plants. And what we would like is more food produced in more plants. That's not exactly how our customers view it. So they like more food produced in less plants. And as a result, we've got to go work through those things. But we've been doing this off and on, this goes in cycles. We're just going through another one, and this too has an end.

But right now, it seems to be -- it's just too early for us to do that in good conscience because our odds of being right are even smaller than they will be in December. Now with that said, when you have volume degradation in a business, particularly after X, you just see a lot of margin chewed up because you're no longer getting coverage. And so you will see, I think, a march back on OI that is different on sales simply because as you get some nominal -- or a volume coverage, it starts rebuilding overhead coverage, and you also get out of cutting inventories and back into even building inventories. And so this thing is always a little bit procyclical in how you have to manage inventories and everything else.

And we didn't have the product line and even some of the registrations that they do to accelerate it without them. And so this is one of those opportunities that is occurring because we're joining forces, i.e. how do you get out and aggressively exploit the opportunity Anios has geographically outside of Europe. And we think it's significant given our existing footprint, our ability to do this quickly because we already have legal entities, capability to manage billing, people and all the rest in all these markets. We can turn on a dime to do this, whereas, obviously, it'd be much more difficult for them. So that's some of the unique growth opportunities it presents.

But broadly, in the Energy market in 2017, we think that's more likely a 2018 and '19 story as that market heals, recovers and activity levels have to ramp up significantly in those years to fill in the hole that's been created by the capital that's been yanked out of this industry. And so we really think it takes that kind of accelerated activity to create an environment where you're going to see pricing. Others in this industry have talked about getting pricing sooner, but I would say they're in parts of the industry where they've had much more dramatic price decreases than we have. Remember, we're talking in total, on average, several percentage points, not 15% and 20%-type reductions.

We want to make sure that we not only deliver very, very good EPS numbers but very good cash flow numbers as well because, at the end of the day, that's what drives shareholder value. So those are our focus areas. So R&D will continue to get its investment. I don't care how bad the economy is."

With me today is Doug Baker, Ecolab's Chairman and CEO.
[Technical Difficulty]
Okay. Sorry, we've got an odd dial tone.
All right. A discussion of our results along with earnings release and the slides referencing our quarter's results and our outlook are available on Ecolab's website at ecolab.com/investor.
Please take a moment to read the cautionary statements on these materials stating that this teleconference, the discussion and the slides include estimates of future performance. These are forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially from those projected.
Factors that could cause actual results to differ are described in the section of our most recent Form 10-K under item 1A, Risk Factors, and in our posted materials. We also refer you to the supplemental diluted earnings per share information in the release.
Starting with a brief overview of the quarter, continued attractive new account gains and new product introductions drove strong acquisition-adjusted fixed-currency sales growth in our Global Institutional, Industrial and Other segments during the second quarter, nearly offsetting a decline in energy sales.
New business and ongoing cost-efficiency work led the adjusted fixed-currency operating margin expansion, more than offsetting the impact of soft economies, challenging end markets and continued currency headwinds. These, along with lower taxes and shares outstanding, drove the 7% adjusted earnings per share increase before currency translation.
While Energy segment results have been challenging, we believe that recent trends suggest a bottoming of our energy cycle, and we expect second half Energy segment sequential results to reflect that stabilization. We look for the market recovery to begin gradually and take hold in 2017 and improve through 2018 and 2019 and for the Energy segment to show results reflecting that market improvement.
Looking to the third quarter, we expect our Global Institutional, Industrial and Other segments to continue to show further strong acquisition-adjusted fixed-currency growth, outpacing their markets and soft international economies as they leverage investments we have made to further improve sales and service force effectiveness and profitability and more than offset lower year-on-year results from our Energy business.
We look for the third quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the $1.24 to $1.32 range, with that range including approximately $0.08 per share or 6% of unfavorable impact from the Venezuela devaluation, deconsolidation and currency translation as we continue to aggressively drive business growth.
For the full year, the Global Institutional, Industrial and Other segments are expected to continue to show strong acquisition-adjusted fixed-currency growth. Energy year-on-year sales comparison should improve versus the first half and for the full year are expected to decline around 10% versus the last year.
We continue to expect to outperform our markets in 2016 while also investing in the key drivers for future sustainable above-average earnings growth. We expect our consolidated results to show improving comparisons in the second half and have narrowed our forecast for adjusted diluted earnings per share in 2016 to the $4.35 to $4.50 range from $4.35 to $4.55, which includes expected currency headwinds of $0.27 to $0.32 per share, of which $0.17 per share is from the Venezuela devaluation and deconsolidation.
Moving to some highlights from the quarter and as discussed in our press release, reported second quarter diluted earnings per share were $0.87. On an adjusted basis, excluding special gains and charges and discrete tax items from both years, second quarter 2016 adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.08 and included $0.08 or 7% currency headwind. This compared with adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.08 a year ago.
The adjusted diluted earnings per share growth was driven by delivered product and other cost savings, cost efficiencies and lower taxes and shares, which offset investments in the business and higher variable compensation.
Our consolidated acquisition-adjusted fixed-currency sales were modestly lower as our Global Institutional, Industrial and Other segments grew 4% but were offset by lower Energy sales.
Regional sales growth was led by Latin America and Europe. Reported operating margins declined 50 basis points. Adjusted fixed-currency operating margins expanded 30 basis points as delivered product and other cost savings and cost efficiencies offset investments in the business, higher variable compensation and lower Energy results.
In 2016's difficult environment, we are focused on driving new business gains by helping customers lower costs. We are using our industry-leading product innovation and service strengths to help customers achieve the best results and the lowest operating costs; and through these, aggressively drive new account gains across all of our segments.
We expect third quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share in the $1.24 to $1.32 range, reflecting a combined Venezuela devaluation and deconsolidation impact and currency translation drag of approximately $0.08 or 6%. Consolidated results are expected to improve, with the second half outperforming the first half.
We narrowed our full year adjusted diluted earnings per share forecast to the $4.35 to $4.50 per share range from $4.35 to $4.55. This forecast includes expected unfavorable currency exchange in the $0.27 to $0.32 per share range, of which $0.17 per share is from the Venezuela devaluation, deconsolidation. 
In summary, despite a very challenging global economic and market environment, we expect to continue to deliver solid fundamental results in 2016. We remain confident in our business, our markets and our people as well as our capacities to meet our aggressive growth objectives over the coming years.
And now here's Doug Baker with some comments."

Just a couple of thoughts on the quarter and the second half of the year. So Q2 results were solid, particularly given the environment.
So adjusted EPS was flat versus last year, but plus 7% excluding currency. And if you look at operating cash flow, it was up 37% versus last year for the first half. So these results are driven by continued strong performance, as Mike just went through, in our Institutional, Industrial and Other segments. Those segments combined added 6.5% top line growth, 4% organic.
Our Energy segment is stabilizing. If you look at Q2 sales and OI, they're very much in line with Q1, with sales off about $5 million but OI stronger in Q2.
Importantly, if you look at underlying metrics, what we call our leading indicators, both our new business and innovation metrics remain strong. We believe it will strengthen throughout the year. We expect a strong second half as a result. So that will be driven again by continued strong Industrial, Institutional and Other performances. We will see lessening Energy and FX headwinds, we are forecasting in the second half. Energy is really driven principally by an easier base because, last year, we had seen more of the drop in the second half than the first. So the base is just simpler to compare against.
FX is our forecast -- and really we're annualizing against last year's big second half move, and we predict that FX will be close to neutral, modest negative in the fourth quarter but obviously coming out and being more neutral going into 2017.
Last thing, I guess, I would highlight is a real call out to our team, who I think is doing a great, great job in a very tough environment. We remain focused on what we can control. We're getting after new business. We're driving innovation. We're taking care of customers. We're doing a terrific job there. We continue to invest in the future. We're managing the business the right way, particularly around cash flow metrics and working capital, and we're also continuing to focus on delivering in the short term while doing all of these. So I'm very proud of the team and proud of the performance and, importantly, happy to be moving into the second half, where we're starting to see a little less of a headwind than we've seen in the last 6 quarters.
So with that, now let me turn it back over to Mike to introduce Q&A."

Well, Nate, yes, I would say our view was that we have bottomed or bottoming in the Energy segment. As a consequence, we felt it was a good time for us to analyze what assets were actually going to be useful or not useful given the change in the Energy business. So we chose the timing based on our belief that we are at the bottom and starting to move into an inflection point. Though as I've said before, coming out angle is going to be a lot lower than the coming in angle. So it's not going to be an equal recovery. It's going to take more time to get out. But it's basically looking at our inventory situation, we had made products which made a lot of sense in the previous environment, i.e. guar replacements and the like, that given the drop-off in the guar market, they don't make sense anymore. And so that would be an example of the type of inventory that we disposed of. Simply, it made a lot of sense 2 years ago. It doesn't make a lot of sense in this environment. And likewise, in some of the capital, there could have been some fleet assets or some mixing vessels, et cetera, that just aren't going to be productive going forward. And so we felt it was the right thing to do to take these off the balance sheet. So really, the timing was as you said, and we do believe that this represents the ""we look at the assets as a consequence of the change in the Energy market."" We don't believe there is more to come. But also, it's hard to predict the future, but that was the idea."

In terms of underlying business performance, we've never had a one to one on foot traffic, and we're watching some of the same foot traffic reports that probably everybody else is. I would say broadly in the full-service restaurant area, foot traffic has been soft for literally 7, 8 years. So it hasn't been our principal driver. It's really our ability to drive share based on our technologies, capability of lowering costs for our customers. And that's going to remain, we think, in the forefront of how we're going to continue to drive share. In QSR, it's continuing to make sure that we're focusing on what our customer needs are, expanding with them as they expand geographically and seeking out new QSR customers, particularly outside of the U.S. as they emerge in different markets, and all of those strategies continue to work. We think that both Institutional and Specialty will continue to perform well throughout the balance of the year."

Here, it made sense to make the type of investment we're making given the matching capabilities and what we were looking to try to do. We thought it was a wise way to proceed. I would say in the M&A front, generally, yes, I'm quite comfortable that if you take some kind of midpoint of a range around 3% of sales, that without doing anything outsized, there's enough attractive targets out there to continue to add approximately 3% to the sales line. I think you're seeing that through announcements like Anios. We've got other smaller announcements this year. In terms of appetite, it's not that we don't have an appetite for a bigger deal. I think we'd be in a position to do one both on the balance sheet and I would say most importantly internally with management capacity and capability. But that's really going to be determined by mutual interest coming to a place where economically it makes sense, and these things you have to be a little more patient around. So I would expect more smaller deals in the near term."

At the time we bought it, we said the first 4 quarters of ownership would be likely negative. Obviously, we bought that asset at a pretty low price. It was at a low price for a reason. It didn't make any money. It was actually losing money, and we wanted to turn that around over time because we're quite sensitive. We want to remain in control of keeping the volume and the customers happy. So I would say that's progressing, and we'll start seeing positive out of Swisher either Q4 this year or Q1 next year. So no different. I'd say I think your formulaic statement around we get the sales first and the profit next. I think it's more true than not. It feels dependent. We -- the metric we pay most attention to is return when we're doing deals, not accretion, dilution. Swisher would be a good example of that, dilutive the first year but a hell of a return if we're able to execute on it, and we think we will be able to. That's how we like to focus on doing deals. And so we're just not as sensitive to first year profitability on these as long as we think the return's going to be great. Now we're not against first year profitability either. But often, they don't come hand in hand. So I think that's how I think about it. But if you do a series of these year in, year out, it sort of takes care of itself because you build up a number of annuity streams, and you're making money on the deal over any reasonable period of time."

We never have high expectations. We always go into these years thinking that growth is going to be more similar the past couple of years, and there's no magic second half inflection point. Seems to be regularly forecast but rarely realized. So U.S., we haven't seen a huge change. I think there is a bit of a consumer spend hiccup in April, May, but that seems to have evened out a bit. In terms of Europe, I don't know that -- I would say the more -- the bigger impact in the near term has been around -- from terrorism, not British exit. And I think British exit may well indeed have significant impact on Europe in total. I guess, it's too early to recognize that at this point in time, but terrorism certainly where it's hit. So obviously, the Turkish tourism business is way off for 2 reasons: Their challenges with Russia, which seemed to be clearing up. Russian tourists were one of their main draws, and that dried up. But obviously, the terroristic activity throughout that country has had a dampening effect on people's desire to go visit. And likewise, in parts of Europe, you've seen the same impact. With that said, I still think we're going to have positive sales growth this year in Europe. We continue to drive share. Our share anywhere in the world is not anywhere near what we would call max capability. And so what we focus on is taking care of our customers, keeping them and driving share, and we still believe we are more in charge than not of driving top line."

We are not anticipating or expecting any upturn in Energy market activity in the second half from really first half levels. We do believe that you continue to have the correction that we've been seeing in terms of supply and demand in the overall oil market. That continues to narrow, which we believe is the metric to watch, more so than price. Price has seasonal components to it, too. We believe that we are likely to see softening of price as the summer ended. It was predicted by many in the industry. I know many are acting surprised, but that was a common prediction.

It's a great geographic footprint match with our current European business, i.e. where they're strong, we were almost nonexistent and vice versa. So it's an almost ideal puzzle piece from that standpoint. And then the Anios brand is a strong brand, and we see it as a great way to go drive penetration in markets that may not be large enough for us to build our own, if you will, kind of locally focused health care organization but still develop a very strong distributor-based strategy, leveraging a very strong global brand name like Anios.

I think the 4% is a bit understated versus what the actual performance is if you said the global environment is going to be static here because you've got a number of industries which are going through some major contractions as a consequence of change in economic environment, specifically primary metals, steel, et cetera, which are big water technology consumers for us, have been contracting. That's got a half-life. They stop contracting. While they may not rebuild, you do run into year-on-year base. Mining is obviously going through a major shift. And so you've got these -- mining was down 10%. We've got some large pieces of our heavy water business down double digits as well. That stuff will moderate over time even if the economy doesn't improve from here. And so I really think this is -- much of our business is growing in, call it, more like around the 5% zone. I don't think that's an unusual expectation or an unrealistic expectation in a modest growth economy, which we're in globally. So I would probably pin it around there.

Can you talk a little bit about sort of where you see that coming from, whether it's petrochemical side or nonpetrochemical side of the equation? Or I'm just -- I'm not seeing a lot of sort of raw material pressure, so I'm just wondering where you're seeing them."

You mentioned, Doug, that you didn't think it would be the same angle of recovery as the angle of decline. Then you also mentioned you expected a sizable improvement in operating income even with a mid-single-digit top line improvement next year. When you say sizable, I think the consensus number for EBIT growth next year in Energy is around 20%, 25%. Is that the type of growth you think we should be baking in? Or is that aggressive?"

So if you would, we'll give you more transparency into that expectation as the year goes on. But right now, it seems to be -- it's just too early for us to do that in good conscience because our odds of being right are even smaller than they will be in December. Now with that said, when you have volume degradation in a business, particularly after X, you just see a lot of margin chewed up because you're no longer getting coverage. And so you will see, I think, a march back on OI that is different on sales simply because as you get some nominal -- or a volume coverage, it starts rebuilding overhead coverage, and you also get out of cutting inventories and back into even building inventories. And so this thing is always a little bit procyclical in how you have to manage inventories and everything else. It accentuates the negative and probably in a small way accentuates the positive when you get out of it."

No, they were growing mid-single digits is what they've been growing regularly for a long period of time. I think 2 things. As I mentioned when I talked about the rationale for buying a geographic footprint, but also this opportunity it presents that they couldn't fully capitalize on without us, i.e. this expansion geographically. And we didn't have the product line and even some of the registrations that they do to accelerate it without them. And so this is one of those opportunities that is occurring because we're joining forces, i.e. how do you get out and aggressively exploit the opportunity Anios has geographically outside of Europe. And we think it's significant given our existing footprint, our ability to do this quickly because we already have legal entities, capability to manage billing, people and all the rest in all these markets. We can turn on a dime to do this, whereas, obviously, it'd be much more difficult for them. So that's some of the unique growth opportunities it presents. There's also technology they have that we think will feed our other geographies and vice versa. So we believe there's a lot of compatibilities and synergies on the top line as well."

Will there be one exception? I'm sure there will be. But broadly, in the Energy market in 2017, we think that's more likely a 2018 and '19 story as that market heals, recovers and activity levels have to ramp up significantly in those years to fill in the hole that's been created by the capital that's been yanked out of this industry. And so we really think it takes that kind of accelerated activity to create an environment where you're going to see pricing. Others in this industry have talked about getting pricing sooner, but I would say they're in parts of the industry where they've had much more dramatic price decreases than we have. Remember, we're talking in total, on average, several percentage points, not 15% and 20%-type reductions. And so they're in a very different situation and, frankly, probably have to get pricing to be healthy enough to continue in operating in those industries."

We want to continue to manage this business wisely, which means make your long-term investment. January comes every year. We're working to go manage our cash flow and working capital intelligently, which means take it out of the business even when it has adverse impacts in your quarterly results because when you reduce inventory, you reduce PLOH overhead coverage, but it's important that we get inventory down. We've been driving it down. I think we're $200 million-plus in terms of reduced working capital year-on-year, first half versus second half. So that's an important metric for us to continue to drive.

Hello, everyone, and welcome to Ecolab's third quarter conference call. With me today is Doug Baker, Ecolab's Chairman and CEO; and Dan Schmechel, our CFO.
A discussion of our results, along with our earnings release and the slides referencing our quarter's results, and our outlook are available on Ecolab's website at ecolab.com/investor. Please take a moment to read the cautionary statements on these materials stating that this teleconference, the discussion and the slides include estimates of future performance. These are forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially from those projected. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are described in the section of our most recent Form 10-K under the Item 1A, [ph] Risk Factors, and in our posted materials. We also refer you to the supplemental diluted earnings per share information in the release.
Starting with a brief overview of the quarter, continued attractive new business gains and new product introductions drove acquisition-adjusted fixed currency sales growth in our Institutional, Industrial [ph] and Other segments during the third quarter, offsetting a moderated decline in energy sales. Product innovation, lower deliberate product costs and ongoing cost-efficiency work led to strong adjusted fixed currency operating margin expansion, more than offsetting the impact of soft economies, challenging end markets and continued currency headwinds. These drove the 7% adjusted earnings per share increase before currency translation.
Looking to the fourth quarter. We expect our Institutional, Industrial and Other segments to show a modestly better year-on-year acquisition-adjusted fixed currency growth versus the third quarter, outpacing their markets and [ph] soft international economies as they leverage investments we've made to further improve sales and service force effectiveness and profitability.
We expect lower year-on-year results from our energy business. We look for our fourth quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the $1.23 to $1.33 range, with that range including approximately $0.02 per share of unfavorable impact from the Venezuela devaluation and deconsolidation and currency translation as we continue to aggressively drive business growth.
We have narrowed our forecast for the full year 2016 to the $4.35 to $4.45 range from $4.35 to $4.50, which includes expected currency headwinds of approximately $0.30 per share, of which $0.17 per share is from the Venezuela devaluation and deconsolidation.
Moving to some highlights from the quarter. As discussed in our press release, third quarter diluted earnings per share were $1.27. On an adjusted basis, excluding special gains and charges and discrete tax items from both years, third quarter 2016 adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.28 and included a $0.09 or 7 percentage point currency headwind. This compared with adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.28 a year ago.
Our consolidated acquisition-adjusted fixed currency sales were modestly higher as our Institutional, Industrial and Other segments grew 3% but were offset by lower energy sales. Regional sales growth was led by Latin America.
Reported operating margins increased 500 basis points. Adjusted fixed currency operating margins expanded 60 basis points as continued sales growth from the Institutional, Industrial and Other segments, lower delivered product cost and cost efficiencies more than offset investments in the business and lower energy results.
In 2016's difficult operating environment, we have focused on driving new business gains by helping customers to lower their costs. We are using our industry-leading product innovation and service strengths to help customers achieve the best results and the lowest operating cost and, through these, aggressively drive new account gains across all of our segments.
We expect fourth quarter earnings per share in the $1.23 to $1.33 range, reflecting currency translation drag of approximately $0.02. We narrowed our full year earnings per share forecast to the $4.35 to $4.45 range, and this forecast includes expected unfavorable currency translation, a currency exchange of approximately $0.30 per share, of which $0.17 per share is from the Venezuela devaluation and deconsolidation.
In summary, despite a very challenging global economic and end [ph] market environment, we expect to deliver solid fundamental results in 2016. We remain confident in our business, our markets and our people as well as our capacities to meet our aggressive growth objectives over the coming years.
And now here's Doug Baker with some comments."
268799,403008884,1068540,"Ecolab Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2016",2016-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Ecolab Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike. Look, my headline would be solid quarter, headwinds are easing, and we believe we're in a good position as we close out the year. So let me go through each of these briefly.So first, the quarter. I would describe it as better than it looks",623,"Thanks, Mike. Look, my headline would be solid quarter, headwinds are easing, and we believe we're in a good position as we close out the year. So let me go through each of these briefly.
So first, the quarter. I would describe it as better than it looks. The Institutional business, if you look at the underlying sales particularly in North America, which is a big piece of the business, they remained consistent with the first half in Q3. The noise in this quarter was really in the U.S. distribution channel, and we expect Q4 sales to bounce back to the level that we were seeing prior to Q3.
QSR and FRS, our Food Retail and quick service businesses, remained quite strong. Our F&B business was solid. We've got good new business. We expect that business to accelerate in 2017. The water business, mining declined, eclipsed mid-single-digit light industry growth and low single-digit heavy industry growth. Mining is expected to rebound in Q4 as it hits easier comps and also benefits from new sales, so the water business will look much better in Q4 and throughout 2017.
The health care [ph] business grew at a healthy 6%. We expect an even better Q4 as it laps last year's recall and continues to benefit from new business efforts and successes that we're having. So this business is really gaining traction.
Pest and Equipment Care [ph] were quite strong and expect to remain strong. Energy stabilized. So our sales of $760 million in Q3 are consistent with both Q2 and Q1. Our OI in Q3, however, is much better as reformulations, synergies and other savings take hold.
As we look to Q4, we expect the results to be quite similar to Q3, call it [ph] plus/minus. Sales likely to be a bit better, OI maybe a touch weaker as we will take down 2 plants for refurbishment. And we're doing that just to be prepared, if we're surprised on the upside next year, we don't want to be in a position where we have to take them down at that time.
So we expect to leave the year with very good momentum and fewer hills to climb. The external environment continues to be challenging, and it's mixed but we believe manageable from an economic standpoint. Raw materials are expected to increase, but we can manage via pricing and cost savings, we have in the past, and we don't see this as spiky. We see it as fairly gradual.
FX is easing. So on our first quarter, FX is a 14% headwind, and it's roughly a 1% headwind in Q4. We assume we're highly unlikely to see another 7% full year challenge in 2017.
Energy has stabilized, and if market only stands still here, it will likely or should be an accretive year even in those conditions for us in 2017. Internally, we've also continued to have great success with new business and our innovation pipeline. We've also maintained investments throughout this year. We invested more in '16 than '15, and '15 was larger in the investment category than '14, so we continue to build on what we think are core investments for the future. So we've not, if you will, emptied the cabinet there by any means.
We've also rebuilt bonus, taken down inventory as well as the absorption hit that this typically drives, so we leave the year whole is what I would say. So while it's too early for 2017 forecast or [ph] just, frankly, in the middle of our planning season, we feel like we're sitting in a good position leaving the year to deliver significantly improved 2017.
So those are my opening comments. With that, I'll turn it back to Mike."

So we made, what, mid-50s on roughly the same sales like $56 million, I think, in the first quarter and roughly the same sales that we have in the third quarter. We made nearly $100 million in the third quarter. And a lot of that is just timing. There's been a lot of great work done in the energy business to reformulate products, lower cost, position ourselves for what I would say improved margins going forward once the wind starts blowing in our direction again. So the consequence of that even in a relatively flat environment if you assume no material activity change, and we continue to generate around the same 7 50, 7 60 [ph] in sales a quarter, which is what we've done in the last 3 and are forecasting in 4, you're going to see OI lift just as a consequence of the timing of the OI improvement this year. Now what we think is going to happen next year is there'll be very modest improvement throughout the year, particularly in the second half of '17, but I caution we think it's modest. We don't think this is by any means set up for a V [ph] recovery. I'm talking about the overall energy market. In that environment, we think we'll have low single digit, mid-single-digit type sales and decent OI."

And transaction is like inflation, and we mitigate that. But the translation, there's nothing to do. And FX has really been the problem that's been the most challenging for us at the [ph] gate because it's not going to justify any pricing or driving pricing in the market. Raw materials, I think we've proven over the years that when the raws start moving, we typically can go command additional pricing as a consequence. We continue to drive mix through new technology upgrades in our customers, and of course, we've got the benefit to [ph] customers financially as well. And we've got what I would say very strong momentum in our supply chain around what we call structural savings. So I'm really not that nervous about what we believe is going to happen in the raw material markets, which we believe raws are going to move up next year, but we do believe we're [ph] going to move up in a fairly orderly fashion as we go, but we have that fully forecasted in our business. I don't think that's going to drive or negate our ability to continue to drive margin expansion in those businesses. And I would say we didn't drive margin just because oil was down. I mean, we were driving margin when oil was up in a number of those businesses. That's kind of our constant. We want profitable growth, continue to drive mix in a favorable way, watch our spending, continue to get productivity, and those are going to be the same focus areas next year as well."

In the manufacturing and product supply area, which we always said was going to be the last frontier for synergies, and -- so we can't call them synergies anymore, but we are getting after a number of opportunities in product supply because we now have a full handle on what the networks looks like today and what we think it ought to [ph] look like going forward, and there is significant opportunities there that our product supply team is after. So we don't feel we're impaired in terms of opportunities to continue to drive productivity and margin enhancements as we go forward.

I mean, as we watch volumes degrade [ph] there, it is a more harmful process than simply you lose the OI, particularly because you'll lose the overhead coverage in your plans. So I think you're right. As energy volume comes back, you're going to see sort of outsize contributions in the near term as you build volume back in your plans. We will use some of that, what I will call extra contribution to reinvest back in the energy business where it makes sense, but we aren't going to be I think overzealous of those investments. We want to see full recovery and make sure that we're investing as the business comes back, and we'd rather be 2 weeks late than 2 weeks early on that recovery because it's so hard to predict. So I don't know if that answers fully your question. But I don't feel like we've got huge pent-up investment demands in the balance of the business, and what I tried to highlight in the opening comments were we have been increasing our investments in these last 2 years in spite of FX and energy headwinds. It's important to continue to do that in the business.

We're lapping Q4 last year [ph] was the first real pain that we saw in mining as it reflected the pain broadly in the mining market. So mining, based on new business and, frankly, lapping Q4 of last year, we are pretty confident it's going to be, let's just say, neutral at worst, maybe minorly [ph] positive at best year-on-year. So the negative influence for mining is going to abate, and mining will turn positive as you move into 2017. The other mark that you mentioned is China, and that's really pain we feel on the heavy side of that business, and that's a reflection of steel, [ph] overcapacity, some being taken off line, mining also in China and also somewhat paper. Our paper results globally were positive, but they were much more positive than that if you took out the mining or the China results. And ultimately, we look at that, we're going to start lapping those comps starting a little bit in the first quarter next year and really fully after the second quarter next year. And so we look at that as an improving situation as we move through 2017 as well. Otherwise, I mean, the water business is doing quite well. So the light business continues to perform, which continue to drive great innovation there. That's the largest segment that we're in. It's also the most profitable. It'll de-emphasized and re-emphasized [ph] it to a significant positive effect. And the heavy side is starting to do a good job generating new business.

And we also aren't predicting a fourth quarter in the range that you cited either. It's going to be down modestly worse year-on-year than the third quarter simply because the fourth quarter comps of last year included a number of onetime issues, which we identified last year in the fourth quarter, it [ph] was a little bit inflated, if you will. But sequentially, the energy business in the fourth quarter this year versus third quarter this year is going to be quite consistent. So we've improved. The top line run rate is stabilized.

So yes, it's going to take a little while to build this business back and regain the 20% we lost. What we've tried to signal is this isn't going to be a 1 year phenomenon, and I don't know if it's going to take 2 years or 2.5 years at this point in time, but it's certainly going to take longer than 1 year to build it [ph] back.

One was getting energy ready for what we call stabilization and kind of upturn and I think we can check the box and if you feel like we're in good shape there moving in the next year. So priorities around driving business or just making sure we continue to stick to the fundamentals. Driving new business, leverage innovation to do that as well as to build mix profitable mix within the existing customer base, all the fundamentals that we typically drive. We've got some significant cost-savings initiatives that we're undertaking particularly in product supply, which I mentioned earlier, to make sure just from an operating standpoint we continue to build both top line and to expand margins to go forward. Longer term, it's probably 2 key areas that we're going to have outsize emphasis, one I just talked about in terms of field technology and customer connection technology. We're going to continue to invest there, make sure that we have a leadership position. We already have a huge installed base information collection capability. We want to make sure that we fully leverage of that to our advantage, our customers' advantage moving forward. So that's going to get an area. The second would be talent. And so we have had a lot of success I think attracting great people, but we want to continue to improve our capabilities there. We track by business, by market more than 172 of them, how we do in terms of keeping our people, developing our people and promoting our people, and we want to continue to increase our capabilities in all those areas because we think that's going to increasingly become very important source of long-term competitiveness."

Again, I don't think it's fundamental to what's going on in the business and long term that turns the other way some day. I just don't know when it is. The other area I think would be just kind of world economic health. I don't think the world's going to turn to recession, but it's kind of a flaky world right now, and it's almost a binary, things turn on and off much more rapidly than they did before. I think that's something we're just going to have to manage and be nimble. And then finally, oil, which I would say is probably more likely an upsides than downside to price, but it could go either way as we all know. Oil will be the other one that you would say I think we've got this fairly in a comfortable zone. We're not expecting a nearly upside benefit from a big market upturn from oil. I don't think you're going to see it in any case in the first half. Second half, you could start arguing a case, probably more likely upside versus our forecast than downside."

But they will. So that's one of the reasons I think to be bullish in that business.

If anything, it slowed us down on a few areas of synergies that we are now getting after, i.e., we have to keep our operating in Charlotte open much longer than anticipated and some other things because that's where that business is going to run out of. And so we'll got on with it. Swisher acquisition I would say is largely untracked if you're going to pin me down and say where is it exactly, I mean, it's behind by weeks and it's in a position where that team will catch-up quite quickly now that, that divestiture is behind us, so that deals going to ultimately turn out to be a absolute home run financially for us. It's just been a heck of a lot of work in terms of transitioning all the products of our formula, moving them, we're still during production. One, their warehouse to our warehouse and their factory to our factory, changing the way that they distribute because a lot of distributed by individual salespeople.

So for all kinds of reasons, there's a lot of transitioning going on, all of it's going quite well, but it's a lot of work.

A discussion of our results, along with our earnings release and the slides referencing our quarter's results, and our outlook are available on Ecolab's website at ecolab.com/investor. Please take a moment to read the cautionary statements on these materials stating that this teleconference, the discussion and the slides include estimates of future performance. These are forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially from those projected. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are described in the section of our most recent Form 10-K under the Item 1A, Risk Factors, and in our posted materials. We also refer you to the supplemental diluted earnings per share information in the release.
Starting with a brief overview of the quarter, continued attractive new business gains and new product introductions drove acquisition-adjusted fixed currency sales growth in our Institutional, Industrial and Other segments during the third quarter, offsetting a moderated decline in energy sales. Product innovation, lower deliberate product costs and ongoing cost-efficiency work led to strong adjusted fixed currency operating margin expansion, more than offsetting the impact of soft economies, challenging end markets and continued currency headwinds. These drove the 7% adjusted earnings per share increase before currency translation.
Looking to the fourth quarter. We expect our Institutional, Industrial and Other segments to show a modestly better year-on-year acquisition-adjusted fixed currency growth versus the third quarter, outpacing their markets and soft international economies as they leverage investments we've made to further improve sales and service force effectiveness and profitability.
We expect lower year-on-year results from our energy business. We look for our fourth quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the $1.23 to $1.33 range, with that range including approximately $0.02 per share of unfavorable impact from the Venezuela devaluation and deconsolidation and currency translation as we continue to aggressively drive business growth.
We have narrowed our forecast for the full year 2016 to the $4.35 to $4.45 range from $4.35 to $4.50, which includes expected currency headwinds of approximately $0.30 per share, of which $0.17 per share is from the Venezuela devaluation and deconsolidation.
Moving to some highlights from the quarter. As discussed in our press release, third quarter diluted earnings per share were $1.27. On an adjusted basis, excluding special gains and charges and discrete tax items from both years, third quarter 2016 adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.28 and included a $0.09 or 7 percentage point currency headwind. This compared with adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.28 a year ago.
Our consolidated acquisition-adjusted fixed currency sales were modestly higher as our Institutional, Industrial and Other segments grew 3% but were offset by lower energy sales. Regional sales growth was led by Latin America.
Reported operating margins increased 500 basis points. Adjusted fixed currency operating margins expanded 60 basis points as continued sales growth from the Institutional, Industrial and Other segments, lower delivered product cost and cost efficiencies more than offset investments in the business and lower energy results.
In 2016's difficult operating environment, we have focused on driving new business gains by helping customers to lower their costs. We are using our industry-leading product innovation and service strengths to help customers achieve the best results and the lowest operating cost and, through these, aggressively drive new account gains across all of our segments.
We expect fourth quarter earnings per share in the $1.23 to $1.33 range, reflecting currency translation drag of approximately $0.02. We narrowed our full year earnings per share forecast to the $4.35 to $4.45 range, and this forecast includes expected unfavorable currency translation, a currency exchange of approximately $0.30 per share, of which $0.17 per share is from the Venezuela devaluation and deconsolidation.
In summary, despite a very challenging global economic and market environment, we expect to deliver solid fundamental results in 2016. We remain confident in our business, our markets and our people as well as our capacities to meet our aggressive growth objectives over the coming years.
And now here's Doug Baker with some comments."
268799,403008884,1068666,"Ecolab Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2016",2016-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Ecolab Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike. Look, my headline would be solid quarter, headwinds are easing, and we believe we're in a good position as we close out the year. So let me go through each of these briefly.So first, the quarter. I would describe it as better than it looks",618,"Thanks, Mike. Look, my headline would be solid quarter, headwinds are easing, and we believe we're in a good position as we close out the year. So let me go through each of these briefly.
So first, the quarter. I would describe it as better than it looks. The Institutional business, if you look at the underlying sales particularly in North America, which is a big piece of the business, they remained consistent with the first half in Q3. The noise in this quarter was really in the U.S. distribution channel, and we expect Q4 sales to bounce back to the level that we were seeing prior to Q3.
QSR and FRS, our Food Retail and quick service businesses, remained quite strong. Our F&B business was solid. We've got good new business. We expect that business to accelerate in 2017. The water business, mining declined, eclipsed mid-single-digit light industry growth and low single-digit heavy industry growth. Mining is expected to rebound in Q4 as it hits easier comps and also benefits from new sales, so the water business will look much better in Q4 and throughout 2017.
The Healthcare business grew at a healthy 6%. We expect an even better Q4 as it laps last year's recall and continues to benefit from new business efforts and successes that we're having. So this business is really gaining traction.
Pest and Equipment Care were quite strong and expect to remain strong. Energy stabilized. So our sales of $760 million in Q3 are consistent with both Q2 and Q1. Our OI in Q3, however, is much better as reformulations, synergies and other savings take hold.
As we look to Q4, we expect the results to be quite similar to Q3, call it plus/minus. Sales likely to be a bit better, OI maybe a touch weaker as we will take down 2 plants for refurbishment. And we're doing that just to be prepared, if we're surprised on the upside next year, we don't want to be in a position where we have to take them down at that time.
So we expect to leave the year with very good momentum and fewer hills to climb. The external environment continues to be challenging, and it's mixed but we believe manageable from an economic standpoint. Raw materials are expected to increase, but we can manage via pricing and cost savings, we have in the past, and we don't see this as spiky. We see it as fairly gradual.
FX is easing. So on our first quarter, FX is a 14% headwind, and it's roughly a 1% headwind in Q4. We assume we're highly unlikely to see another 7% full year challenge in 2017.
Energy has stabilized, and if market only stands still here, it will likely or should be an accretive year even in those conditions for us in 2017. Internally, we've also continued to have great success with new business and our innovation pipeline. We've also maintained investments throughout this year. We invested more in '16 than '15, and '15 was larger in the investment category than '14, so we continue to build on what we think are core investments for the future. So we've not, if you will, emptied the cabinet there by any means.
We've also rebuilt bonus, taken down inventory as well as the absorption hit that this typically drives, so we leave the year whole is what I would say. So while it's too early for 2017 forecast, we're just, frankly, in the middle of our planning season, we feel like we're sitting in a good position leaving the year to deliver significantly improved 2017.
So those are my opening comments. With that, I'll turn it back to Mike."

So we made, what, mid-50s on roughly the same sales like $56 million, I think, in the first quarter and roughly the same sales that we have in the third quarter. We made nearly $100 million in the third quarter. And a lot of that is just timing. There's been a lot of great work done in the energy business to reformulate products, lower cost, position ourselves for what I would say improved margins going forward once the wind starts blowing in our direction again. So the consequence of that even in a relatively flat environment if you assume no material activity change, and we continue to generate around the same 750, 760 in sales a quarter, which is what we've done in the last 3 and are forecasting in 4, you're going to see OI lift just as a consequence of the timing of the OI improvement this year. Now what we think is going to happen next year is there'll be very modest improvement throughout the year, particularly in the second half of '17, but I caution we think it's modest. We don't think this is by any means set up for a V recovery. I'm talking about the overall energy market. In that environment, we think we'll have low single digit, mid-single-digit type sales and decent OI."

And transaction is like inflation, and we mitigate that. But the translation, there's nothing to do. And FX has really been the problem that's been the most challenging for us in the gate because it's not going to justify any pricing or driving pricing in the market. Raw materials, I think we've proven over the years that when the raws start moving, we typically can go command additional pricing as a consequence. We continue to drive mix through new technology upgrades in our customers, and of course, we've got to benefit the customers financially as well. And we've got what I would say very strong momentum in our supply chain around what we call structural savings. So I'm really not that nervous about what we believe is going to happen in the raw material markets, which we believe raws are going to move up next year, but we do believe we're going to move up in a fairly orderly fashion as we go, but we have that fully forecasted in our business. I don't think that's going to drive or negate our ability to continue to drive margin expansion in those businesses. And I would say we didn't drive margin just because oil was down. I mean, we were driving margin when oil was up in a number of those businesses. That's kind of our constant. We want profitable growth, continue to drive mix in a favorable way, watch our spending, continue to get productivity, and those are going to be the same focus areas next year as well."

So certainly, a number of these initiatives have what I'll call long tail. They take a number of years to fully realize the benefits. And so a number of steps, but we're continuing to roll out new technology in the Institutional field force. And so we certainly are already absorbing the costs associated with that but haven't fully realized the benefits and won't for a couple of years, meaning it will continue to increase in benefits, but I don't think you're going to be at full run rate for a few years. It just takes a while to change. Happens in practices, take out the cost that is obsolete, et cetera. In the manufacturing and product supply area, which we always said was going to be the last frontier for synergies, and -- so we can't call them synergies anymore, but we are getting after a number of opportunities in product supply because we now have a full handle on what the networks looks like today and what we think it ought to look like going forward, and there is significant opportunities there that our product supply team is after. So we don't feel we're impaired in terms of opportunities to continue to drive productivity and margin enhancements as we go forward. And I would expect as we continue to add businesses through M&A that we will continue to see additional opportunities arise."

I mean, as we watch volumes degrade there, it is a more harmful process than simply you lose the OI, particularly because you'll lose the overhead coverage in your plans. So I think you're right. As energy volume comes back, you're going to see sort of outsize contributions in the near term as you build volume back in your plans. We will use some of that, what I will call extra contribution to reinvest back in the energy business where it makes sense, but we aren't going to be I think overzealous of those investments. We want to see full recovery and make sure that we're investing as the business comes back, and we'd rather be 2 weeks late than 2 weeks early on that recovery because it's so hard to predict. So I don't know if that answers fully your question. But I don't feel like we've got huge pent-up investment demands in the balance of the business, and what I tried to highlight in the opening comments were we have been increasing our investments in these last 2 years in spite of FX and energy headwinds. It's important to continue to do that in the business. We have a relatively long-term view of the business, and so I don't feel like the cupboards are bare, that are going to need to be restocked per se from an investment standpoint as a consequence."

This quarter, you talked about some declines in demand in Asia, particularly China as well as the mining market impact, and then -- but you were, I guess, a little bit more bullish in the mining expectation for the fourth quarter. So can you talk a little bit about what -- sort of what the trends are in water? Why China was down? Was it all because of the mining? Or was there some other slowdown going on?

We're lapping Q4 last year, was the first real pain that we saw in mining as it reflected the pain broadly in the mining market. So mining, based on new business and, frankly, lapping Q4 of last year, we are pretty confident it's going to be, let's just say, neutral at worst, maybe minorly positive at best year-on-year. So the negative influence for mining is going to abate, and mining will turn positive as you move into 2017. The other mark that you mentioned is China, and that's really pain we feel on the heavy side of that business, and that's a reflection of steel overcapacity, some being taken off line, mining also in China and also somewhat paper. Our paper results globally were positive, but they were much more positive than that if you took out the mining or the China results. And ultimately, we look at that, we're going to start lapping those comps starting a little bit in the first quarter next year and really fully after the second quarter next year. And so we look at that as an improving situation as we move through 2017 as well. Otherwise, I mean, the water business is doing quite well. So the light business continues to perform, which continue to drive great innovation there. That's the largest segment that we're in. It's also the most profitable. It had been deemphasized, and we have reemphasized it to a significant positive effect. And the heavy side is starting to do a good job generating new business. It's going to start lapping some of the industrial slowdown like our more reasonable comps for this environment, and so I think you'll see some of that good work coming through."

And this year, we're saying it's going to be down what I think we said 10% to 12% or 12%. So it's not down 30% over the last couple of years, right? It's down considerably less than that. And we also aren't predicting a fourth quarter in the range that you cited either. It's going to be down modestly worse year-on-year than the third quarter simply because the fourth quarter comps of last year included a number of onetime issues, which we identified last year in the fourth quarter was a little bit inflated, if you will. But sequentially, the energy business in the fourth quarter this year versus third quarter this year is going to be quite consistent. So we've improved. The top line run rate is stabilized. OI run rate has improved throughout the year. So we're going to enter the year with what I would call top line stable, OI margin momentum as we go in. So yes, it's going to take a little while to build this business back and regain the 20% we lost. What we've tried to signal is this isn't going to be a 1 year phenomenon, and I don't know if it's going to take 2 years or 2.5 years at this point in time, but it's certainly going to take longer than 1 year to build it back.

One was getting energy ready for what we call stabilization and kind of upturn, and I think we can check the box, and if we feel like we're in good shape, they're moving into next year, so strategic priorities around driving the business or just making sure we continue to stick to the fundamentals. Driving new business, leverage innovation to do that as well as to build mix, profitable mix within the existing customer base, all the fundamentals that we typically drive. We've got some significant cost-savings initiatives that we're undertaking particularly in product supply, which I mentioned earlier, to make sure just from an operating standpoint we continue to build both top line and expand margins as we go forward. Longer term, there's probably 2 key areas that we're going to have outsize emphasis, one I just talked about in terms of field technology and customer connection technology. We're going to continue to invest there, make sure that we have a leadership position. We already have a huge installed base of information collection capability. We want to make sure that we fully leverage that to our advantage and our customers' advantage moving forward. So that's going to get an area. The second would be talent. And so we have had a lot of success, I think, attracting great people, but we want to continue to improve our capabilities there. We track by business, by market more than 172 of them, how we do in terms of keeping our people, developing our people and promoting our people, and we want to continue to increase our capabilities in all those areas because we think that's going to increasingly become a very important source of long-term competitiveness."

It's also impossible to predict, I guess, I just did. So that would be the wild card. Again, I don't think it's fundamental to what's going on in the business and long term, that turns the other way some day. I just don't know when it is. The other area I think would be just kind of world economic health. I don't think the world's going to turn to recession, but it's kind of a flaky world right now, and it's almost a binary, things turn on and off much more rapidly than they did before. I think that's something we're just going to have to manage and be nimble. And then finally, oil, which I would say is probably more likely an upside than downside to price, but it could go either way as we all know. Oil will be the other one that you would say I think we've got this in cast fairly in kind of a comfortable zone. We are not expecting any really upside benefit from a big market upturn from oil. I don't think you're going to see it in any case in the first half. Second half, you could start arguing a case, probably more likely upside versus our forecast than downside."

And so what we've been able to do in a number of what I would call is the Asia Pacific and Latin America markets is continuing to drive density, which will continue to drive much better leverage. Right now if you look at those markets, they are the lowest OI margins that we have, and it's really a consequence of the makeup of the business, i.e., smaller businesses that are growing but haven't quite achieved what I would call margin-efficient density level, but they will. So that's one of the reasons, I think, to be bullish in that business. All of them are growing quite well, and the growth in particularly Latin America and Asia Pacific is going to have outsize margin contribution as it starts overwhelming the overhead investments that we've already made."

But the underlying Institutional U.S. business, which is the one that impacted, created that delta, most notably, is fine. The underlying business is solid.

It's a good business. It's just not necessarily a good business for  us to own. And so as a consequence, we divested it. We thought we'd be able to divest that a lot quicker than we did. If anything, it slowed us down on a few areas of synergies that we are now getting after, i.e., we have to keep our Operating Center in Charlotte open much longer than we anticipated and some other things because that's where that business is going to run out of. And so we'll got on with it. The Swisher acquisition I would say is largely untracked if you're going to pin me down and say where is it exactly, I mean, it's behind by weeks and it's in a position where that team will catch-up quite quickly now that, that divestiture is behind us, so that deals going to ultimately turn out to be a absolute home run financially for us. It's just been a heck of a lot of work in terms of transitioning all the products of our formula, moving them, we're still during production. One, their warehouse to our warehouse and their factory to our factory, changing the way that they distribute because a lot of it was distributed by individual salespeople. It was in Swisher, and obviously, that's not how we distribute our product for safety reasons as well as just control reasons and utilization of sales time efficiency, so for all kinds of reasons. So there's been a lot of transitioning going on, all of it's going quite well, but it's a lot of work.

And then we had a couple of world events that I would say also Nexus pipeline breaking, pulling out of a rock, et cetera. But I don't know that that's really a material part of the story. I think the story on energy is it's been a dramatic headwind for us over the last, if you will, 6, 7 quarters. We're now starting to enter a period where we're going to start lapping, and it's going to quickly move from a headwind to a tailwind almost under any normal scenario if you don't believe oil is going to decline further from here. All of this is stabilized, I think it's accretive. If it happens to start picking up, it's going to be more accretive as we go forward. Subsegment, sequentially, I think OFC is the same or a little better. Downstream is going to be a little better but going to be a little worse year-on-year. Also have one-timers in that business last year. WellChem's going to be a little better also Q4 to Q3. So kind of across the board, we see minor sequential strengthening, but I underline minor.

Starting with a brief overview of the quarter, continued attractive new business gains and new product introductions drove acquisition-adjusted fixed currency sales growth in our Institutional, Industrial and Other segments during the third quarter, offsetting a moderated decline in energy sales. Product innovation, lower deliberate product costs and ongoing cost-efficiency work led the strong adjusted fixed currency operating margin expansion, more than offsetting the impact of soft economies, challenging end markets and continued currency headwinds. These drove the 7% adjusted earnings per share increase before currency translation.
Looking to the fourth quarter. We expect our Institutional, Industrial and Other segments to show a modestly better year-on-year acquisition-adjusted fixed currency growth versus the third quarter, outpacing their markets and soft international economies as they leverage investments we've made to further improve sales and service force effectiveness and profitability.
We expect lower year-on-year results from our energy business. We look for our fourth quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the $1.23 to $1.33 range, with that range including approximately $0.02 per share of unfavorable impact from the Venezuela devaluation and deconsolidation and currency translation as we continue to aggressively drive business growth.
We have narrowed our forecast for the full year 2016 to the $4.35 to $4.45 range from $4.35 to $4.50, which includes expected currency headwinds of approximately $0.30 per share, of which $0.17 per share is from the Venezuela devaluation and deconsolidation.
Moving to some highlights from the quarter. As discussed in our press release, third quarter diluted earnings per share were $1.27. On an adjusted basis, excluding special gains and charges and discrete tax items from both years, third quarter 2016 adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.28 and included a $0.09 or 7 percentage point currency headwind. This compared with adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.28 a year ago.
Our consolidated acquisition-adjusted fixed currency sales were modestly higher as our Institutional, Industrial and Other segments grew 3% but were offset by lower energy sales. Regional sales growth was led by Latin America.
Reported operating margins increased 500 basis points. Adjusted fixed currency operating margins expanded 60 basis points as continued sales growth from the Institutional, Industrial and Other segments, lower delivered product cost and cost efficiencies more than offset investments in the business and lower energy results.
In 2016's difficult operating environment, we have focused on driving new business gains by helping customers to lower their costs. We are using our industry-leading product innovation and service strengths to help customers achieve the best results and the lowest operating cost and, through these, aggressively drive new account gains across all of our segments.
We expect fourth quarter earnings per share in the $1.23 to $1.33 range, reflecting currency translation drag of approximately $0.02. We narrowed our full year earnings per share forecast to the $4.35 to $4.45 range, and this forecast includes expected unfavorable currency translation, a currency exchange of approximately $0.30 per share, of which $0.17 per share is from the Venezuela devaluation and deconsolidation.
In summary, despite a very challenging global economic and market environment, we expect to deliver solid fundamental results in 2016. We remain confident in our business, our markets and our people as well as our capacities to meet our aggressive growth objectives over the coming years.
And now here's Doug Baker with some comments."
268799,403008884,1068982,"Ecolab Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2016",2016-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Ecolab Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike. Look, my headline would be solid quarter, headwinds are easing, and we believe we're in a good position as we close out the year. So let me go through each of these briefly.So first, the quarter. I would describe it as better than it looks",619,"Thanks, Mike. Look, my headline would be solid quarter, headwinds are easing, and we believe we're in a good position as we close out the year. So let me go through each of these briefly.
So first, the quarter. I would describe it as better than it looks. The Institutional business, if you look at the underlying sales particularly in North America, which is the big piece of the business, they remained consistent with the first half in Q3. The noise in this quarter was really in the U.S. distribution channel, and we expect Q4 sales to bounce back to the level that we were seeing prior to Q3.
QSR and FRS, our Food Retail and quick service businesses, remained quite strong. Our F&B business was solid. We've got good new business. We expect that business to accelerate in 2017. The water business, mining declined, eclipsed mid-single-digit light industry growth and low single-digit heavy industry growth. Mining is expected to rebound in Q4 as it hits easier comps and also benefits from new sales, so the water business will look much better in Q4 and throughout 2017.
The Healthcare business grew at a healthy 6%. We expect an even better Q4 as it laps last year's recall and continues to benefit from new business efforts and successes that we're having. So this business is really gaining traction.
Pest and Equipment Care were quite strong and expect to remain strong. Energy stabilized. So our sales of $760 million in Q3 are consistent with both Q2 and Q1. Our OI in Q3, however, is much better as reformulations, synergies and other savings take hold.
As we look to Q4, we expect the results to be quite similar to Q3. I'd call it plus/minus. Sales likely to be a bit better, OI maybe a touch weaker as we will take down 2 plants for refurbishment. And we're doing that just to be prepared. If we're surprised on the upside next year, we don't want to be in a position where we have to take them down at that time.
So we expect to leave the year with very good momentum and fewer hills to climb. The external environment continues to be challenging, and it's mixed but we believe manageable from an economic standpoint. Raw materials are expected to increase, but we can manage via pricing and cost savings, we have in the past, and we don't see this as spiky. We see it as fairly gradual.
FX is easing. So on our first quarter, FX is a 14% headwind, and it's roughly a 1% headwind in Q4. We assume we're highly unlikely to see another 7% full year challenge in 2017.
Energy has stabilized, and if market only stands still here, it will likely or should be an accretive year even in those conditions for us in 2017. Internally, we've also continued to have great success with new business and our innovation pipeline. We've also maintained investments throughout this year. We invested more in '16 than '15, and '15 was larger in the investment category than '14, so we continue to build on what we think are core investments for the future. So we've not, if you will, emptied the cabinet there by any means.
We've also rebuilt bonus, taken down inventory as well as the absorption hit that this typically drives, so we leave the year whole is what I would say. So while it's too early for 2017 forecast, we're just, frankly, in the middle of our planning season, we feel like we're sitting in a good position leaving the year to deliver significantly improved 2017.
So those are my opening comments. With that, I'll turn it back to Mike."

So we made, what, mid-50s on roughly the same sales like $56 million, I think, in the first quarter on roughly the same sales that we had in the third quarter. We made nearly $100 million in the third quarter. And a lot of that is just timing. There's been a lot of great work done in the energy business to reformulate products, lower cost, position ourselves for what I would say improved margins going forward once the wind starts blowing in our direction again. So the consequence of that even in a relatively flat environment if you assume no material activity change, and we continue to generate around the same 750, 760 in sales a quarter, which is what we've done in the last 3 and are forecasting in 4, you're going to see OI lift just as a consequence of the timing of the OI improvement this year. Now what we think is going to happen next year is there'll be very modest improvement throughout the year, particularly in the second half of '17, but I caution we think it's modest. We don't think this is by any means set up for a V recovery. I'm talking about the overall energy market. In that environment, we think we'll have low single digit, mid-single-digit type sales and decent OI."

And transaction is like inflation, and we mitigate that. But the translation, there's nothing to do. And FX has really been the problem that's been the most challenging for us to negate because it's not going to justify any pricing or drive any pricing in the market. Raw materials, I think we've proven over the years that when the raws start moving, we typically can go command additional pricing as a consequence. We continue to drive mix through technology upgrades in our customers, and of course, we've got to benefit to customers financially as well. And we've got what I would say very strong momentum in our supply chain around what we call structural savings. So I'm really not that nervous about what we believe is going to happen in the raw material markets, which we believe raws are going to move up next year, but we do believe we're going to move up in a fairly orderly fashion as we go, but we have that fully forecasted in our business. I don't think that's going to drive or negate our ability to continue to drive margin expansion in those businesses. And I would say we didn't drive margin just because oil was down. I mean, we were driving margin when oil was up in a number of those businesses. That's kind of our constant. We want profitable growth, continue to drive mix in a favorable way, watch our spending, continue to get productivity, and those are going to be the same focus areas next year as well."

So certainly, a number of these initiatives have what I'll call long tails. They take a number of years to fully realize the benefits. And so a number of steps, but we're continuing to roll out new technology in the Institutional field force. And so we certainly are already absorbing the costs associated with that but haven't fully realized the benefits and won't for a couple of years, meaning it will continue to increase in benefits, but I don't think you're going to be at full run rate for a few years. It just takes a while to change. Happens in practices, take out the cost that is obsolete, et cetera. In the manufacturing and product supply area, which we always said was going to be the last frontier for synergies, and -- so we can't call them synergies anymore, but we are getting after a number of opportunities in product supply because we now have a full handle on what the networks looks like today and what we think it ought to look like going forward, and there is significant opportunities there that our product supply team is after. So we don't feel we're impaired in terms of opportunities to continue to drive productivity and margin enhancements as we go forward. And I would expect as we continue to add businesses through M&A that we will continue to see additional opportunities arise."

I mean, as we watch volumes degrade there, it is a more harmful process than simply you lose the OI, particularly because you'll lose the overhead coverage in your plans. So I think you're right. As energy volume comes back, you're going to see sort of outsize contributions in the near term as you build volume back in your plans. We will use some of that, what I will call extra contribution to reinvest back in the energy business where it makes sense, but we aren't going to be I think overzealous of those investments. We want to see full recovery and make sure that we're investing as the business comes back, and we'd rather be 2 weeks late than 2 weeks early on that recovery because it's so hard to predict. So I don't know if that answers fully your question. But I don't feel like we've got huge pent-up investment demands in the balance of the business, and what I tried to highlight in the opening comments were we have been increasing our investments in these last 2 years in spite of FX and energy headwinds. It's important to continue to do that in the business. We have a relatively long-term view of the business, and so I don't feel like the cupboards are bare, that are going to need to be restocked per se from an investment standpoint as a consequence."

We're lapping Q4 last year, was the first real pain that we saw in mining as it reflected the pain broadly in the mining market. So mining, based on new business and, frankly, lapping Q4 of last year, we are pretty confident it's going to be, let's just say, neutral at worst, maybe minorly positive at best year-on-year. So the negative influence for mining is going to abate, and mining will turn positive as we move into 2017. The other mark that you mentioned is China, and that's really pain we feel on the heavy side of that business, and that's a reflection of steel overcapacity, some being taken off line, mining also in China and also somewhat paper. Our paper results globally were positive, but they were much more positive than that if you took out the mining or the China results. And ultimately, we look at that, we're going to start lapping those comps starting a little bit in the first quarter next year and really fully after the second quarter next year. And so we look at that as an improving situation as we move through 2017 as well. Otherwise, I mean, the water business is doing quite well. So the light business continues to perform, which continues to drive great innovation there. That's the largest segment that we're in. It's also the most profitable. It had been deemphasized, and we have reemphasized it to a significant positive effect. And the heavy side is starting to do a good job generating new business. It's going to start lapping some of the industrial slowdown like our more reasonable comps for this environment, and so I think you'll see some of that good work coming through."

And we also aren't predicting a fourth quarter in the range that you cited either. It's going to be down modestly worse year-on-year than the third quarter simply because the fourth quarter comps of last year included a number of onetime issues, which we identified last year in the fourth quarter. It was a little bit inflated, if you will. But sequentially, the energy business in the fourth quarter this year versus third quarter this year is going to be quite consistent. So we've improved. The top line run rate is stabilized. OI run rate has improved throughout the year. So we're going to enter the year with what I would call top line stable, OI margin momentum as we go in. So yes, it's going to take a little while to build this business back and regain the 20% we lost. What we've tried to signal is this isn't going to be a 1 year phenomenon, and I don't know if it's going to take 2 years or 2.5 years at this point in time, but it's certainly going to take longer than 1 year to build it back.

One was getting energy ready for what we'll call stabilization and kind of upturn, and I think we can check the box, and if we feel like we're in good shape there moving into next year, so strategic priorities around driving the business or just making sure we continue to stick to the fundamentals. Driving new business, leveraging innovation to do that as well as to build mix, profitable mix within the existing customer base, all the fundamentals that we typically drive. We've got some significant cost-savings initiatives that we're undertaking particularly in product supply, which I mentioned earlier, to make sure just from an operating standpoint we continue to build both top line and expand margins as we go forward. Longer term, there's probably 2 key areas that we're going to have outsize emphasis, one I just talked about in terms of field technology and customer connection technology. We're going to continue to invest there, make sure that we have a leadership position. We already have a huge installed base of information collection capability. We want to make sure that we fully leverage that to our advantage and our customers' advantage moving forward. So that's going to get an area. The second would be talent. And so we have had a lot of success, I think, attracting great people, but we want to continue to improve our capabilities there. We track by business, by market--we're in more than 172 of them, how we do in terms of keeping our people, developing our people and promoting our people, and we want to continue to increase our capabilities in all those areas because we think that's going to increasingly become a very important source of long-term competitiveness."

It's also impossible to predict, I guess, I just did. So that would be the wild card. Again, I don't think it's fundamental to what's going on in the business. In long term, that turns the other way some day. I just don't know when it is. The other area I think would be just kind of world economic health. I don't think the world's going to turn to recession, but it's kind of a flaky world right now, and it's almost a binary, things turn on and off much more rapidly than they did before. I think that's something we're just going to have to manage and be nimble. And then finally, oil, which I would say is probably more likely an upside than downside to price, but it could go either way as we all know. Oil will be the other one that you would say I think we've got this in cast fairly in kind of a comfortable zone. We are not expecting any really upside benefit from a big market upturn from oil. I don't think you're going to see it in any case in the first half. Second half, you could start arguing a case, probably more likely upside versus our forecast than downside."

And so what we've been able to do in a number of what I would call is the Asia Pacific and Latin America markets is continuing to drive density, which will continue to drive much better leverage. Right now if you look at those markets, they are the lowest OI margins that we have, and it's really a consequence of the makeup of the business, i.e., smaller businesses that are growing but haven't quite achieved what I would call margin-efficient density level, but they will. So that's one of the reasons, I think, to be bullish in that business. All of them are growing quite well, and the growth in particularly Latin America and Asia Pacific is going to have outsize margin contribution as it starts overwhelming the overhead investments that we've already made."

I mean, I guess, we had open minds and it proved to us to be a lot more valuable to us than we suspected going in, but we never saw that business as a great fit for the way that we conduct the business. It's a good business. It's just not necessarily a good business for us to own. And so as a consequence, we divested it. We thought we'd be able to divest that a lot quicker than we did. If anything, it slowed us down on a few areas of synergies that we are now getting after, i.e., we have to keep our Operating Center in Charlotte open much longer than we anticipated and some other things because that's where that business is going to run out of. And so we'll got on with it. The Swisher acquisition I would say it's largely on track if you're going to pin me down and say where is it exactly, I mean, it's behind by weeks and it's in a position where that team will catch-up quite quickly now that, that divestiture is behind us. So that deals going to ultimately turn out to be a absolute home run financially for us. It's just been a heck of a lot of work in terms of transitioning all the products in our formulas, moving them, we're still during production. One, their warehouse to our warehouse and their factory to our factory, changing the way that they distribute because a lot of it was distributed by individual salespeople. It went in Swisher, and obviously, that's not how we distribute our product for safety reasons as well as just control reasons and utilization of sales time efficiency, so for all kinds of reasons. So there's been a lot of transitioning going on, all of it's going quite well, but it's a lot of work.

I would -- mostly-- Downstream's a little softer than we had forecasted at that time. There's been some new business that we've had that's been delayed, not permanently but out a quarter or so. And then we had a couple of world events that I would say also nicked us-- pipelines breaking, pulling out of Iraq, et cetera. But I don't know that that's really a material part of the story. I think the story on energy is it's been a dramatic headwind for us over the last, if you will, 6, 7 quarters. We're now starting to enter a period where we're going to start lapping, and it's going to quickly move from a headwind to a tailwind almost under any normal scenario if you don't believe oil is going to decline further from here. All of this is stabilized, I think it's accretive. If it happens to start picking up, it's going to be more accretive as we go forward. Subsegment, sequentially, I think OFC is the same or a little better. Downstream is going to be a little better but going to be a little worse year-on-year. Also have one-timers in that business last year. WellChem's going to be a little better also Q4 to Q3. So kind of across the board, we see minor sequential strengthening, but I underline minor.

Please take a moment to read the cautionary statements on these materials stating that this teleconference, the discussion and the slides include estimates of future performance. These are forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially from those projected. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are described in the section of our most recent Form 10-K under the Item 1A, Risk Factors, and in our posted materials. We also refer you to the supplemental diluted earnings per share information in the release.
Starting with a brief overview of the quarter, continued attractive new business gains and new product introductions drove acquisition-adjusted fixed currency sales growth in our Institutional, Industrial and Other segments during the third quarter, offsetting a moderated decline in energy sales. Product innovation, lower deliberate product costs and ongoing cost-efficiency work led the strong adjusted fixed currency operating margin expansion, more than offsetting the impact of soft economies, challenging end markets and continued currency headwinds. These drove the 7% adjusted earnings per share increase before currency translation.
Looking to the fourth quarter. We expect our Institutional, Industrial and Other segments to show a modestly better year-on-year acquisition-adjusted fixed currency growth versus the third quarter, outpacing their markets and soft international economies as they leverage investments we've made to further improve sales and service force effectiveness and profitability.
We expect lower year-on-year results from our energy business. We look for our fourth quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the $1.23 to $1.33 range, with that range including approximately $0.02 per share of unfavorable impact from the Venezuela devaluation and deconsolidation and currency translation as we continue to aggressively drive business growth.
We have narrowed our forecast for the full year 2016 to the $4.35 to $4.45 range from $4.35 to $4.50, which includes expected currency headwinds of approximately $0.30 per share, of which $0.17 per share is from the Venezuela devaluation and deconsolidation.
Moving to some highlights from the quarter. As discussed in our press release, third quarter diluted earnings per share were $1.27. On an adjusted basis, excluding special gains and charges and discrete tax items from both years, third quarter 2016 adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.28 and included a $0.09 or 7 percentage point currency headwind. This compared with adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.28 a year ago.
Our consolidated acquisition-adjusted fixed currency sales were modestly higher as our Institutional, Industrial and Other segments grew 3% but were offset by lower energy sales. Regional sales growth was led by Latin America.
Reported operating margins increased 500 basis points. Adjusted fixed currency operating margins expanded 60 basis points as continued sales growth from the Institutional, Industrial and Other segments, lower delivered product cost and cost efficiencies more than offset investments in the business and lower energy results.
In 2016's difficult operating environment, we have focused on driving new business gains by helping customers to lower their costs. We are using our industry-leading product innovation and service strengths to help customers achieve the best results and the lowest operating cost and, through these, aggressively drive new account gains across all of our segments.
We expect fourth quarter earnings per share in the $1.23 to $1.33 range, reflecting currency translation drag of approximately $0.02. We narrowed our full year earnings per share forecast to the $4.35 to $4.45 range, and this forecast includes expected unfavorable currency translation, a currency exchange of approximately $0.30 per share, of which $0.17 per share is from the Venezuela devaluation and deconsolidation.
In summary, despite a very challenging global economic and market environment, we expect to deliver solid fundamental results in 2016. We remain confident in our business, our markets and our people as well as our capacities to meet our aggressive growth objectives over the coming years.
And now here's Doug Baker with some comments."
268799,403008884,1070118,"Ecolab Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2016",2016-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Ecolab Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike. Look, my headline would be solid quarter, headwinds are easing, and we believe we're in a good position as we close out the year. So let me go through each of these briefly.So first, the quarter. I would describe it as better than it looks",619,"Thanks, Mike. Look, my headline would be solid quarter, headwinds are easing, and we believe we're in a good position as we close out the year. So let me go through each of these briefly.
So first, the quarter. I would describe it as better than it looks. The Institutional business, if you look at the underlying sales particularly in North America, which is the big piece of the business, they remained consistent with the first half in Q3. The noise in this quarter was really in the U.S. distribution channel, and we expect Q4 sales to bounce back to the level that we were seeing prior to Q3.
QSR and FRS, our Food Retail and quick service businesses, remained quite strong. Our F&B business was solid. We've got good new business. We expect that business to accelerate in 2017. The water business, mining declined, eclipsed mid-single-digit light industry growth and low single-digit heavy industry growth. Mining is expected to rebound in Q4 as it hits easier comps and also benefits from new sales, so the water business will look much better in Q4 and throughout 2017.
The Healthcare business grew at a healthy 6%. We expect an even better Q4 as it laps last year's recall and continues to benefit from new business efforts and successes that we're having. So this business is really gaining traction.
Pest and Equipment Care were quite strong and expect to remain strong. Energy stabilized. So our sales of $760 million in Q3 are consistent with both Q2 and Q1. Our OI in Q3, however, is much better as reformulations, synergies and other savings take hold.
As we look to Q4, we expect the results to be quite similar to Q3. I'd call it plus/minus. Sales likely to be a bit better, OI maybe a touch weaker as we will take down 2 plants for refurbishment. And we're doing that just to be prepared. If we're surprised on the upside next year, we don't want to be in a position where we have to take them down at that time.
So we expect to leave the year with very good momentum and fewer hills to climb. The external environment continues to be challenging, and it's mixed but we believe manageable from an economic standpoint. Raw materials are expected to increase, but we can manage via pricing and cost savings, we have in the past, and we don't see this as spiky. We see it as fairly gradual.
FX is easing. So on our first quarter, FX is a 14% headwind, and it's roughly a 1% headwind in Q4. We assume we're highly unlikely to see another 7% full year challenge in 2017.
Energy has stabilized, and if market only stands still here, it will likely or should be an accretive year even in those conditions for us in 2017. Internally, we've also continued to have great success with new business and our innovation pipeline. We've also maintained investments throughout this year. We invested more in '16 than '15, and '15 was larger in the investment category than '14, so we continue to build on what we think are core investments for the future. So we've not, if you will, emptied the cabinet there by any means.
We've also rebuilt bonus, taken down inventory as well as the absorption hit that this typically drives, so we leave the year whole is what I would say. So while it's too early for 2017 forecast, we're just, frankly, in the middle of our planning season, we feel like we're sitting in a good position leaving the year to deliver significantly improved 2017.
So those are my opening comments. With that, I'll turn it back to Mike."

So we made, what, mid-50s on roughly the same sales like $56 million, I think, in the first quarter on roughly the same sales that we had in the third quarter. We made nearly $100 million in the third quarter. And a lot of that is just timing. There's been a lot of great work done in the energy business to reformulate products, lower cost, position ourselves for what I would say improved margins going forward once the wind starts blowing in our direction again. So the consequence of that even in a relatively flat environment if you assume no material activity change, and we continue to generate around the same 750, 760 in sales a quarter, which is what we've done in the last 3 and are forecasting in 4, you're going to see OI lift just as a consequence of the timing of the OI improvement this year. Now what we think is going to happen next year is there'll be very modest improvement throughout the year, particularly in the second half of '17, but I caution we think it's modest. We don't think this is by any means set up for a V recovery. I'm talking about the overall energy market. In that environment, we think we'll have low single digit, mid-single-digit type sales and decent OI."

You've done an outstanding job the last 18 months driving consistent margin expansion in all of those businesses to offset the energy weakness. Has there -- I know you said you've been investing a lot, but is there a risk that if energy takes longer to come back that it just becomes much more difficult, I guess, particularly with raw's prices likely going up in the first half of next year to sustain the momentum on a constant currency basis? Obviously, FX looks like it's going to be a lot less of a drag."
268799,403008884,1070118,"Ecolab Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2016",2016-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Ecolab Inc.","Executives","Yes, I think, Gary, I guess, the FX, it hits you in transaction and translation.

And transaction is like inflation, and we mitigate that. But the translation, there's nothing to do. And FX has really been the problem that's been the most challenging for us to negate because it's not going to justify any pricing or drive any pricing in the market. Raw materials, I think we've proven over the years that when the raws start moving, we typically can go command additional pricing as a consequence. We continue to drive mix through technology upgrades in our customers, and of course, we've got to benefit to customers financially as well. And we've got what I would say very strong momentum in our supply chain around what we call structural savings. So I'm really not that nervous about what we believe is going to happen in the raw material markets, which we believe raws are going to move up next year, but we do believe we're going to move up in a fairly orderly fashion as we go, but we have that fully forecasted in our business. I don't think that's going to drive or negate our ability to continue to drive margin expansion in those businesses. And I would say we didn't drive margin just because oil was down. I mean, we were driving margin when oil was up in a number of those businesses. That's kind of our constant. We want profitable growth, continue to drive mix in a favorable way, watch our spending, continue to get productivity, and those are going to be the same focus areas next year as well."

So certainly, a number of these initiatives have what I'll call long tails. They take a number of years to fully realize the benefits. And so a number of steps, but we're continuing to roll out new technology in the Institutional field force. And so we certainly are already absorbing the costs associated with that but haven't fully realized the benefits and won't for a couple of years, meaning it will continue to increase in benefits, but I don't think you're going to be at full run rate for a few years. It just takes a while to change. Happens in practices, take out the cost that is obsolete, et cetera. In the manufacturing and product supply area, which we always said was going to be the last frontier for synergies, and -- so we can't call them synergies anymore, but we are getting after a number of opportunities in product supply because we now have a full handle on what the networks looks like today and what we think it ought to look like going forward, and there is significant opportunities there that our product supply team is after. So we don't feel we're impaired in terms of opportunities to continue to drive productivity and margin enhancements as we go forward. And I would expect as we continue to add businesses through M&A that we will continue to see additional opportunities arise."

I mean, as we watch volumes degrade there, it is a more harmful process than simply you lose the OI, particularly because you'll lose the overhead coverage in your plans. So I think you're right. As energy volume comes back, you're going to see sort of outsize contributions in the near term as you build volume back in your plans. We will use some of that, what I will call extra contribution to reinvest back in the energy business where it makes sense, but we aren't going to be I think overzealous of those investments. We want to see full recovery and make sure that we're investing as the business comes back, and we'd rather be 2 weeks late than 2 weeks early on that recovery because it's so hard to predict. So I don't know if that answers fully your question. But I don't feel like we've got huge pent-up investment demands in the balance of the business, and what I tried to highlight in the opening comments were we have been increasing our investments in these last 2 years in spite of FX and energy headwinds. It's important to continue to do that in the business. We have a relatively long-term view of the business, and so I don't feel like the cupboards are bare, that are going to need to be restocked per se from an investment standpoint as a consequence."

One is we continue to have new business success, so we've got a solid base. You can count on it in the food safety business and the water business, in particular. Those things are typically fairly immune to huge economic swings. With that said, we're also getting pricing, fairly significant pricing as a consequence of the devaluation that have occurred down there from a currency standpoint. That begets inflation. It drives up our raw materials in that market, and we've got to get pricing to offset that, which we're doing successfully. So that's certainly a key piece of the double-digit growth story. I would expect that, that business is going to remain fairly resilient and have strong performance for the quarters to come."

We're lapping Q4 last year, was the first real pain that we saw in mining as it reflected the pain broadly in the mining market. So mining, based on new business and, frankly, lapping Q4 of last year, we are pretty confident it's going to be, let's just say, neutral at worst, maybe minorly positive at best year-on-year. So the negative influence for mining is going to abate, and mining will turn positive as we move into 2017. The other mark that you mentioned is China, and that's really pain we feel on the heavy side of that business, and that's a reflection of steel overcapacity, some being taken off line, mining also in China and also somewhat paper. Our paper results globally were positive, but they were much more positive than that if you took out the mining or the China results. And ultimately, we look at that, we're going to start lapping those comps starting a little bit in the first quarter next year and really fully after the second quarter next year. And so we look at that as an improving situation as we move through 2017 as well. Otherwise, I mean, the water business is doing quite well. So the light business continues to perform, which continues to drive great innovation there. That's the largest segment that we're in. It's also the most profitable. It had been deemphasized, and we have reemphasized it to a significant positive effect. And the heavy side is starting to do a good job generating new business. It's going to start lapping some of the industrial slowdown like our more reasonable comps for this environment, and so I think you'll see some of that good work coming through."

And we also aren't predicting a fourth quarter in the range that you cited either. It's going to be down modestly worse year-on-year than the third quarter simply because the fourth quarter comps of last year included a number of onetime issues, which we identified last year in the fourth quarter. It was a little bit inflated, if you will. But sequentially, the energy business in the fourth quarter this year versus third quarter this year is going to be quite consistent. So we've improved. The top line run rate is stabilized. OI run rate has improved throughout the year. So we're going to enter the year with what I would call top line stable, OI margin momentum as we go in. So yes, it's going to take a little while to build this business back and regain the 20% we lost. What we've tried to signal is this isn't going to be a 1 year phenomenon, and I don't know if it's going to take 2 years or 2.5 years at this point in time, but it's certainly going to take longer than 1 year to build it back.

One was getting energy ready for what we'll call stabilization and kind of upturn, and I think we can check the box, and if we feel like we're in good shape there moving into next year, so strategic priorities around driving the business or just making sure we continue to stick to the fundamentals. Driving new business, leveraging innovation to do that as well as to build mix, profitable mix within the existing customer base, all the fundamentals that we typically drive. We've got some significant cost-savings initiatives that we're undertaking particularly in product supply, which I mentioned earlier, to make sure just from an operating standpoint we continue to build both top line and expand margins as we go forward. Longer term, there's probably 2 key areas that we're going to have outsize emphasis, one I just talked about in terms of field technology and customer connection technology. We're going to continue to invest there, make sure that we have a leadership position. We already have a huge installed base of information collection capability. We want to make sure that we fully leverage that to our advantage and our customers' advantage moving forward. So that's going to get an area. The second would be talent. And so we have had a lot of success, I think, attracting great people, but we want to continue to improve our capabilities there. We track by business, by market--we're in more than 172 of them, how we do in terms of keeping our people, developing our people and promoting our people, and we want to continue to increase our capabilities in all those areas because we think that's going to increasingly become a very important source of long-term competitiveness."

It's also impossible to predict, I guess, I just did. So that would be the wild card. Again, I don't think it's fundamental to what's going on in the business. In long term, that turns the other way some day. I just don't know when it is. The other area I think would be just kind of world economic health. I don't think the world's going to turn to recession, but it's kind of a flaky world right now, and it's almost a binary, things turn on and off much more rapidly than they did before. I think that's something we're just going to have to manage and be nimble. And then finally, oil, which I would say is probably more likely an upside than downside to price, but it could go either way as we all know. Oil will be the other one that you would say I think we've got this in cast fairly in kind of a comfortable zone. We are not expecting any really upside benefit from a big market upturn from oil. I don't think you're going to see it in any case in the first half. Second half, you could start arguing a case, probably more likely upside versus our forecast than downside."

And so what we've been able to do in a number of what I would call is the Asia Pacific and Latin America markets is continuing to drive density, which will continue to drive much better leverage. Right now if you look at those markets, they are the lowest OI margins that we have, and it's really a consequence of the makeup of the business, i.e., smaller businesses that are growing but haven't quite achieved what I would call margin-efficient density level, but they will. So that's one of the reasons, I think, to be bullish in that business. All of them are growing quite well, and the growth in particularly Latin America and Asia Pacific is going to have outsize margin contribution as it starts overwhelming the overhead investments that we've already made."

I mean, I guess, we had open minds and it proved to us to be a lot more valuable to us than we suspected going in, but we never saw that business as a great fit for the way that we conduct the business. It's a good business. It's just not necessarily a good business for us to own. And so as a consequence, we divested it. We thought we'd be able to divest that a lot quicker than we did. If anything, it slowed us down on a few areas of synergies that we are now getting after, i.e., we have to keep our Operating Center in Charlotte open much longer than we anticipated and some other things because that's where that business is going to run out of. And so we'll get on with it. The Swisher acquisition I would say it's largely on track if you're going to pin me down and say where is it exactly, I mean, it's behind by weeks and it's in a position where that team will catch-up quite quickly now that, that divestiture is behind us. So that deals going to ultimately turn out to be an absolute home run financially for us. It's just been a heck of a lot of work in terms of transitioning all the products in our formulas, moving them, we're still during production. One, their warehouse to our warehouse and their factory to our factory, changing the way that they distribute because a lot of it was distributed by individual salespeople. It went in Swisher, and obviously, that's not how we distribute our product for safety reasons as well as just control reasons and utilization of sales time efficiency, so for all kinds of reasons. So there's been a lot of transitioning going on, all of it's going quite well, but it's a lot of work.

And then we had a couple of world events that I would say also nicked us-- pipelines breaking, pulling out of Iraq, et cetera. But I don't know that that's really a material part of the story. I think the story on energy is it's been a dramatic headwind for us over the last, if you will, 6, 7 quarters. We're now starting to enter a period where we're going to start lapping, and it's going to quickly move from a headwind to a tailwind almost under any normal scenario if you don't believe oil is going to decline further from here. All of this is stabilized, I think it's accretive. If it happens to start picking up, it's going to be more accretive as we go forward.

Also have one-timers in that business last year. WellChem's going to be a little better also Q4 to Q3. So kind of across the board, we see minor sequential strengthening, but I underline minor.
