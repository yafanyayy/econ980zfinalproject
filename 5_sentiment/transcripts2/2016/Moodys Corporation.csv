I will then conclude with comments on our outlook for 2016. After our prepared remarks, we'll be happy to respond to your questions.
In the fourth quarter, Moody's delivered revenue of $866 [ph] million, a decline of 1% from the fourth quarter of 2014, but an increase of 2% on a constant-currency basis. Operating expense for the fourth quarter was $533 million, flat to the fourth quarter of 2014. Operating income was $333 million down 3% from the prior year period. And adjusted operating income, defined as operating income, less depreciation and amortization, was $362 million, also down 3% from the same period last year. Operating margin for the fourth quarter of 2015 was 38.5% and the adjusted operating margin was 41.8%. Diluted earnings per share of $1.09 was down 3% from the prior year period.
For full year 2015, Moody's achieved revenue and EPS growth for the 6 consecutive year despite difficult market conditions. Moody's revenue was $3.5 billion, an increase of 5% from the prior year or 9% on a constant-currency basis. Revenue at Moody's Investors Service was $2.3 billion, an increase of 3% from 2014 or 8% on a constant-currency basis. Revenue of Moody's Analytics was $1.2 billion, 8% higher than the prior year period or 12% on a constant-currency basis.
Operating expense for full year 2015 was $2 billion, up 6% from 2014. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted operating expense by 4%. Operating income of $1.5 billion increased 2% from 2014. Adjusted operating income of $1.6 billion increased 3% from the prior year period. Operating margin for full year 2015 was 42.3% and the adjusted operating margin was 45.5%. On a constant-currency basis and excluding our 2014 and 2015 acquisitions, operating margin and adjusted operating margin would have increased approximately 40 and 50 basis points respectively year-over-year.
Full year 2015 earnings per share of $4.63 increased from $4.61 in 2014. Non-GAAP EPS of $4.60 was up 9% from $4.21 in 2014. In both years, non-GAAP EPS excluded a $0.03 benefit from legacy tax matters. Full year 2014 non-GAAP EPS also excluded a $0.37 gain resulting from Moody's acquisition of a controlling interest in ICRA Ltd. in the second quarter of 2014.

As Ray mentioned, Moody's total revenue for the fourth quarter decreased 1% to $866 million, but was up 2% on a constant-currency basis. U.S. revenue of $481 million was up 1% from the fourth quarter of 2014. Non-U.S. revenue of $385 million is down 4%, but up 4% on a constant-currency basis. Revenue generated outside the U.S. represented 44% of Moody's total revenue. Recurring revenue of $446 million represented 51% of total revenue. 
Looking now at each of our businesses starting with Moody's Investors Service. Total MIS revenue for the quarter was $545 million, down 4% from the prior year period, but flat on a constant-currency basis. U.S. revenue decreased 2% to $338 million. Non-U.S. revenue of $206 million declined 7%, but was us up 2% on a constant-currency basis. Revenue generated outside the U.S. represented 38% of total earnings revenue.
Moving now to the lines of business for MIS. First, global corporate finance revenue in the fourth quarter was $246 million, down 7% from the prior year period or 4% on a constant-currency basis. This result reflected lower levels of non-U.S. investment grade and global speculative grade bond issuance, partially offset by improved levels of U.S. and European bank loan issuance. U.S. corporate finance revenue increased 1%, while non-U.S. revenue decreased 20%.
Second, global structure finance revenue for the fourth quarter was $114 million, down 4% from the prior year period, but flat on a constant-currency basis. Increased activity across most areas of structured finance partially offset lower CLO issuance. U.S. structured finance revenue was down 3% and non-U.S. revenue was down 9%.
Third, global financial institutions revenue of $92 million was up 8% from the prior year period or 13% on a constant-currency basis. This revenue was driven primarily by the U.S. insurance in European banking sector. U.S. financial institutions revenue was up 7% and non-U.S. revenue was up 8%. [ph] 
Fourth, global public project and infrastructure finance revenue of $85 million was down by 1% versus the prior year period or 2% on a constant-currency basis, primarily as a result of decreased U.S. public finance activity. U.S. public-private and infrastructure finance revenue was down 10%, while non-U.S. revenue was up 4%.
MIS other, which consists of non-rating revenue from Moody's majority-owned joint ventures ICRA and Korean Investors Service or KIS, contributed $7 million to MIS revenue in the fourth quarter compared to $8 million in the prior year period.
And turning now to Moody's Analytics. Global revenue for MA of $321 million was up 3% from the fourth quarter of 2014, or 6% on a constant-currency basis. U.S. revenue of $143 million was up 6% year-over-year. Non-U.S. revenue of $178 million was up 1% or 6% on a constant-currency basis. Revenue generated outside the U.S. represented 56% of total MA revenue.
And moving now to the lines of business for MA. First, global research data and analytics or RD&A revenue of $161 million was up 8% from the prior year period or 11% on constant-currency basis and represented 50% of total MA revenue. Growth was mainly due to strong new sales and product upgrades, coupled with record customer retention.  U.S. revenue was up 10% and non-U.S. revenue was up 5% or 11% on a constant-currency basis. 
Second, Enterprise Risk Solutions or ERS generated record revenue of $122 million and was up 1% from last year or 4% on a constant-currency basis. Growth was driven by strength in the credit assessment and originations and stress testing businesses. U.S. and non-U.S. ERS revenue were each up 1%. Trailing 12-month revenue in sales for ERS increased 14% and 11%, respectively. As we've noted in the past, due to the variable nature of product timing -- excuse me, project timing and completion, ERS revenue remains subject to quarterly volatility. 
Third, global professional services revenue of $38 million was down 10% from the prior year period or 6% on a constant-currency basis. This result was primarily due to lower net new business at Copal Amba as well as the of unfavorable impact of foreign exchange on the credentials and licensing business.
U.S. professional services revenue was down 7%, while non-U.S. revenue was down 11%.
And turning now to expenses. Moody's fourth quarter expense was $533 million, flat to the prior year period. An increase in compensation expense and merit increases in hiring was entirely offset by reduced incentive compensation. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted expense by 3%. Operating margin for the fourth quarter of 2015 of 38.5% was down from 39.3% in 2014. Adjusted operating margin of 41.8% was down from 42.4%. On a constant-currency basis and excluding our 2014 and 2015 acquisition, operating margin for the quarter would've been flat year-over-year and adjusted operating margin would have increased approximately 20 basis points.
Moody's effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 29.4% compared with 28.1% for the prior year period. This increase was primarily due to a reduced percentage of income from lower tax rate jurisdictions primarily offset by the favorable resolution of tax audits.
And now I'll provide an update on capital allocation. On December 15, 2015, Moody's increase its quarterly dividend by 9% from $0.34 to $0.37 per share of common stock. Over the course of 2015, Moody's return $272 million to its shareholders via dividend payment. And with regard to share repurchase, during the fourth quarter of 2015, Moody's repurchased 2 [ph] million shares at a total cost of $193 million or an average cost of $100.09 per share, and issued 261,000 shares as part of this employee stock-based compensation plans. Full year 2015, Moody's repurchased 10.9 million shares or $1.1 billion or $101.14 per share and issued 32 -- excuse me, 3.2 million shares under employee stock-based compensation plans. Outstanding shares as of December 31, 2015, totaled 196.1 million shares down 4% from December 31, 2014. In December 2015, the Board of Directors authorized a $1 billion share repurchase program to commence following the completion of the existing program. Including this  incremental program as of December 31, 2015, Moody's had $1.5 billion of share repurchase authority remaining.
Turning now to Moody's leverage. In November 2015, Moody's issued $300 million of 5.25% senior unsecured notes due 2044. At the end of 2015, Moody's had $3.4 billion of outstanding debt and $1 billion of additional debt capacity available under its revolving credit facility. Total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at quarter end were $2.2 billion, up $555 million from December 31, 2014. As of December 31, 2015, approximately 68% of Moody's cash and cash equivalents were maintained outside of the U.S. Free cash flow for the full year of 2015 was $1.1 billion, up 13% for full year 2014, primarily due to changes in working capital.
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Ray."

I'll conclude this morning's prepared comments by discussing our full year guidance for 2016. Moody's outlook for 2016 is based on assertions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, corporate profitability and business investment spending, mergers and acquisitions, consumer borrowing and securitization and the amount of debt issued. These essentials are subject to some degree of uncertainty and the results for the year could differ materially from our current outlook.
Moody's guidance assumes foreign currency translation for the British pound of $1.42 to GBP 1, and for the euro of $1.09 to the EUR 1. For all other currencies, Moody's assumes end of 2015 exchange rates.
Although we expect continued market volatility, we're projecting mid-single-digit percent revenue growth in 2016 as well as EPS of $4.75 to $4.85. Operating expense is expected to grow in the mid-single-digit expense range. Moody's projects and operating margin of approximately 42% and an adjusted operating margin of approximately 45%. The effective tax rate is expected to be 32% to 32.5%. 
2016 free cash flow is expected to be approximately $1.1 billion. Moody's expect share repurchases to be approximately $1 billion, subject to available cash, market conditions and other ongoing capital allocation decisions. Capital expenditures are projected to be $125 million to $135 million. Depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be approximately $130 [ph] million. 
For MIS, we expect 2016 revenue to grow in the mid-single-digit percent range. Both U.S. and non-U.S. MIS revenues are also expected to increase in the mid-single digit percent range.
Corporate finance revenue is expected to be flat. Structured finance revenue and public project and infrastructure finance revenue are each expected to grow in the high-single-digit percent range.
Financial institutions revenue is expected to grow in the mid-single-digit percent range. For MA, 2016 revenue is expected to increase in the mid-single-digit expense range. U.S. revenues is expected to go in the high-single-digit percent range and non-U.S. revenues is expected to be flat. Research, data and analytics revenues is projected to grow in the mid-single-digit percent range. Enterprise Risk Solutions revenues is expected to grow in the low-single-digit percent range following earlier-than-anticipated recognition of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2015. Professional services revenue is expected to decline in the low single-digit-percent range.
This concludes our prepared remarks, and joining us for the question-and-answer session is Michel Madalyn, President and Chief Operating Officer of Moody's Investors Service; and Mark Almeida, President of Moody's Analytics. We'll be pleased to take your questions."

This is solely U.S. issuance information, though, and it is for both financial and non-financial leverage bonds and leverage loans. I'll go through each of the categories that  hopefully you can see up on the screen. Finally, I'll conclude by making some quick comments on the a European outlook. So firstly, investment-grade for January, we saw about $125 billion of issuance and it was the fourth highest volume month ever. However, $46 billion of that issuance came from 1 deal, the Ambet deal. We are encouraged by approximately $200 billion in the visible M&A pipeline, but volatility is impacting the pace of that issuance. So the pipeline is healthy, but we do seem to have some backup in the issuance pipeline. All-in funding costs are generally quite attractive. And lastly, the last point there in relation to M&A, shareholder-friendly  activities continue to be cited as the use of proceeds. So for the year, we see about $1.2 trillion in investment grade issuance in the U.S., which is about flat year-over-year. And that's a reasonable outlook that we can work with. Move onto the speculative-grade categories, high-yield bonds. January, about $7 billion of issuance. The leverage market was soft in December. That tone has continued into January and that makes us cautious. $35 billion is in the forward pipeline. And again, we see 2 classes of issuers, both with higher-quality speculative-grade names have access and those with lower ratings don't. Continue with headwinds coming from the commodities' volatility issue and default rate concerns. And last week, we saw in-flows back into high-yield bonds, which we haven't seen since the start of the year, which may indicate that perhaps we are establishing some stability, which will be helpful. So for the year, estimates range pretty widely on high-yield bond. About $240 billion is the sort of main number that we are seeing. That's down 15% year-over-year. Last year, I think we did about $275 billion and this numbers come down as we move to this point in time. Leverage loans, we saw $20 billion of issuance left in January and expecting $260 billion, which is down 10% for the year. So we've seen low volumes in the high-yield bond market and loans were about on pace with 2015. Leverage loan activity was consistent week-to-week in January and banks expects us to continue. Again, we can see $45 billion in the forward pipeline, but the timing of that is very much open to discussion. And uptick into fall could cause the loan space to be impacted negatively, but less so than the high-yield bond market. So investment-grade in summary in the U.S., about flat this year. High-yield bonds down 15 and leverage loans down about 10. Now in Europe, just in terms of what we're seeing there, generally we see broader uses to what can happen this year in terms of issuance. But generally, for Europe from the banks, we're seeing investment-grade up about 10%, high-yield bonds down about 10% and leverage loans up about 5%. On -- in terms of what we're seeing, the 10-year [ph] is quite tame at this point about 1 84, 1 85. And spreads on U.S. investment-grade bonds about 216 bps and in high yield about 765 bps. So spreads have widened with the 10 years come in, so we think all-in financing costs are relatively attractive. In Europe, the spread numbers are about 154 basis points for investment-grade, and for high-yield, about 538 basis points. So with that, I'll turn it over to Ray, and potentially, Michel may have some other color as well."

But it's -- we take that as a good sign in terms of the pipeline of new activity, fresh names."

The only incremental piece that we really need to pay will be incentive compensation. So we look at maybe $0.60, $0.70 on a dollar of revenue, so that is very helpful. As you pointed out, the top line is the tricky part for this year and we're looking at margin being about flat. We finished last year at 42 3 and we're saying the we'll be about flat this year. To be perfectly honest, it's a little tough for us to have the margin come in exactly at where we expect it to, but we are reinvesting in our business and we think flat margin is fine. From an FX-adjusted basis, we're planning for expenses to increase by about $100 million in 2016 and those are about evenly split between 3 different things: The first is the role forward of the hiring we did in 2015; second will be the hiring we're doing in 2016; and the third will really be around technology and real estate changes that we're making. On the technology piece, we are investing in our system. Cyber security is a piece of that, which I think every financial corporation is looking at right now. And then we do have a bit heavier than usual real estate these. I think you've probably seen, we've taken 2 floors over at One World Trade Center at very attractive rates and the 52nd floor here in the center at 7 World Trade, also a very attractive rate. But we really need to get those new floors online here and there will be some expense associated with that. So nothing the exciting. But to draw the top line, which we think is pretty healthy, given what other companies are putting up. To drive mid-single-digit we do need to spend some money and our plans are modest, but we are thinking revenue will be about flat. I don't know if Ray or the division has anything more to say on that."

I'll just remind you that over the last -- well, we had 1% growth in the fourth quarter in '15, but that was off of a very strong 42% growth in the fourth quarter of '14. So that was pretty good.

So we're going to look at 4 different areas, investment-grade, spec-grade, bank loans and other. The total revenue for this category for the fourth quarter was $246 million. So investment grade was $71 million, about flat from the fourth quarter last year in terms of percentages, a little bit down on dollar basis. Spec-grade decreased to $26.5 million from last year's $34.1 million in the fourth quarter. Bank loans interestingly increased in the fourth quarter 2015 to $44 million from last year's $37 million, and bank loans were 18% of [ph] this total corporate line. Other was $104.4 million, down from last year's $112 million and represented 42% of the split. And again corporates represented 45% off the MIS revenues for the fourth quarter of '15. Moving onto structured, we'll go through 5 different lines. The total for structured was $114 million in 2015. First, we'll look at ABS and that was about $24 million, up a little bit from last year's $22 million. Second is residential mortgage-backed securities, $23 million, up a bit from last year's $20 million. Commercial real estate, $37.5 million, up from last year's about $36 million. And structured credit at about $30 million, down from last year's $40 million. And others, pretty negligible. So again that all sums to $114 million. If we move on to FIG, total's about $92 million for the fourth quarter. And we'll look at banking insurance, managed investments and the other. So banking's about $61 million, about flat from last year's $60 million; insurance at about $24 million is up nicely from last year's $19 million; managed investments at $4.4 million was flat to last year. And other at 2 [indiscernible] was also flat to last year. And then lastly, we go to PPIF. Total is $85 million here. We've got 3 categories, which include PFG and sovereign first, which is about $46 million. Last year we're about $48 million on this line for the fourth quarter. Project and infrastructure is the second category. About $40 million here, which is down from last year's $42 million and then other is negligible, really, in both periods. So I think that's the total split of the big categories, Craig. Is that -- did that get it done for your?"

So for fourth quarter of 2015, incentive compensation was 13% of our total comp expenses of $336 million for the quarter, which was just about flat to what we did for last year, but the components were quite different. So this year, we put up $44 million in the fourth quarter for incentive compensation. Last year, we put up $53 million. So this was a delta of almost $9 million. The fourth quarter of '15 didn't come in as strong as we might have liked, and therefore, the incentive compensation accrual backed off by quite a bit. Also what was interesting is last year, we did have $7 million of profit sharing in the fourth quarter. And for this fourth quarter, we did not have any profit sharing, and so that saved another $7 million. So really, $16 million there, a reduction in those 2 lines. Now on salaries and benefits, we did move up from $255 million last year to about $272 million this year. So again that increase in salaries and benefits, that was completely offset by what happened with the incentive compensation. Stock-based comp was about flat at $20.5 million, so not much going on differently there. But I think what we want to demonstrate here, Doug, is we pulled the incentive comp lever pretty hard if things are a little bit weaker than we think. And the first reduction there goes to, unfortunately, to the employees. So that's how we've handled it. I hope that's helpful."

Over the course of '16, we're looking at expenses to generally ramp from $35 million to $45 million from the first quarter to the fourth quarter. We would caution everyone that expense timing, FX movements and particularly incentive compensation can move that number around, as we've seen in previous years. We'll continue to manage the costs carefully. We have about $50 [ph] million of expense flexibility that we can move on. If we did encounter a more dramatic situation, we could probably about double that, but we're not expecting anything like that. And as the year progresses, of course, those amounts come down. Similarly, we didn't have any questions on the tax rate. We're looking at 32 to 32.5. We can't do exactly the same thing on the tax rate every year, because we are impacted by individual audit results. So we do expect with the U.S. being the balance of our income potentially for '16, that we might have a little bit more to pay on the tax rate. So again, 32 to 32.5. And our CapEx guidance, I think, most of you saw, had moved up a bit, and that is primarily because some of the things that we're doing in technology and real estate as we have said before, which is I just want to make sure that everyone was aware of those numbers so that can fit in your modeling effort.

In the fourth quarter, Moody's delivered revenue of $866 million, a decline of 1% from the fourth quarter of 2014, but an increase of 2% on a constant currency basis. Operating expense for the fourth quarter was $533 million, flat to the fourth quarter of 2014. Operating income was $333 million, down 3% from the prior year period. And adjusted operating income, defined as operating income less depreciation and amortization, was $362 million, also down 3% from the same period last year. Operating margin for the fourth quarter of 2015 was 38.5% and the adjusted operating margin was 41.8%. Diluted earnings per share of $1.09 was down 3% from the prior year period.
For full year 2015, Moody's achieved revenue and EPS growth for the 6 consecutive year despite difficult market conditions. Moody's revenue was $3.5 billion, an increase of 5% from the prior year or 9% on a constant currency basis. Revenue at Moody's Investors Service was $2.3 billion, an increase of 3% from 2014 or 8% on a constant currency basis. Revenue of Moody's Analytics was $1.2 billion, 8% higher than the prior year period, or 12% on a constant currency basis.
Operating expense for full year 2015 was $2 billion, up 6% from 2014. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted operating expense by 4%. Operating income of $1.5 billion increased 2% from 2014. Adjusted operating income of $1.6 billion increased 3% from the prior year period. Operating margin for full year 2015 was 42.3% and the adjusted operating margin was 45.5%. On a constant currency basis and excluding our 2014 and 2015 acquisitions, operating margin and adjusted operating margin would have increased approximately 40 and 50 basis points, respectively, year-over-year.
Full year 2015 earnings per share of $4.63 increased from $4.61 in 2014. Non-GAAP EPS of $4.60 was up 9% from $4.21 in 2014. In both years, non-GAAP EPS excluded a $0.03 benefit from legacy tax matters. Full year 2014 non-GAAP EPS also excluded a $0.37 gain resulting from Moody's acquisition of a controlling interest in ICRA Ltd. in the second quarter of 2014.

As Ray mentioned, Moody's total revenue for the fourth quarter decreased 1% to $866 million, but was up 2% on a constant currency basis. U.S. revenue of $481 million was up 1% from the fourth quarter of 2014. Non-U.S. revenue of $385 million is down 4%, but up 4% on a constant currency basis. Revenue generated outside the U.S. represented 44% of Moody's total revenue. Recurring revenue of $446 million represented 51% of total revenue. 
Looking now at each of our businesses, starting with Moody's Investors Service. Total MIS revenue for the quarter was $545 million, down 4% from the prior year period, but flat on a constant currency basis. U.S. revenue decreased 2% to $338 million. Non-U.S. revenue of $206 million declined 7%, but was us up 2% on a constant currency basis. Revenue generated outside the U.S. represented 38% of total ratings revenue.
Moving now to the lines of business for MIS. First, global corporate finance revenue in the fourth quarter was $246 million, down 7% from the prior year period, or 4% on a constant currency basis. This result reflected lower levels of non-U.S. investment grade and global speculative grade bond issuance, partially offset by improved levels of U.S. and European bank loan issuance. U.S. corporate finance revenue increased 1%, while non-U.S. revenue decreased 20%.
Second, global structure finance revenue for the fourth quarter was $114 million, down 4% from the prior year period, but flat on a constant currency basis. Increased activity across most areas of structured finance partially offset lower CLO issuance. U.S. structured finance revenue was down 3% and non-U.S. revenue was down 5%.
Third, global financial institutions revenue of $92 million was up 8% from the prior year period, or 13% on a constant currency basis. This revenue was driven primarily by the U.S. insurance and European banking sectors. U.S. financial institutions revenue was up 7% and non-U.S. revenue was up 8%.
Fourth, global public, project and infrastructure finance revenue of $85 million was down 5% versus the prior year period, or 2% on a constant currency basis, primarily as a result of decreased U.S. public finance activity. U.S. public, project and infrastructure finance revenue was down 10%, while non-U.S. revenue was up 4%.
MIS other which consists of non-rating revenue from Moody's majority-owned joint ventures ICRA and Korea Investors Service or KIS, contributed $7 million to MIS revenue for the fourth quarter compared to $8 million in the prior year period.
And turning now to Moody's Analytics. Global revenue for MA of $321 million was up 3% from the fourth quarter of 2014, or 6% on a constant currency basis. U.S. revenue of $143 million was up 6% year-over-year. Non-U.S. revenue of $178 million was up 1% or 6% on a constant currency basis. Revenue generated outside the U.S. represented 56% of total MA revenue.
And moving now to the lines of business for MA. First, global research, data and analytics or RD&A revenue of $161 million was up 8% from the prior year period, or 11% on constant currency basis and represented 50% of total MA revenue. Growth was mainly due to strong new sales and product upgrades, coupled with record customer retention.  U.S. revenue was up 10% and non-U.S. revenue was up 5% or 11% on a constant currency basis.
Second, enterprise risk solutions or ERS generated record revenue of $122 million and was up 1% from last year or 4% on a constant currency basis. Growth was driven by strength in the credit assessment and originations and stress testing businesses. U.S. and non-U.S. ERS revenue were each up 1%. Trailing 12-month revenue in sales for ERS increased 14% and 11%, respectively. As we've noted in the past, due to the variable nature of product timing -- excuse me, project timing and completion, ERS revenue remains subject to quarterly volatility. 
Third, global professional services revenue of $38 million was down 10% from the prior year period, or 6% on a constant currency basis. This result was primarily due to lower net new business at Copal Amba as well as the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange on the credentials and licensing business.
U.S. professional services revenue was down 7%, while non-U.S. revenue was down 11%.
And turning now to expenses. Moody's fourth quarter expense was $533 million, flat to the prior year period. An increase in compensation expense for merit increases in hiring was entirely offset by reduced incentive compensation. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted expense by 3%. Operating margin for the fourth quarter of 2015 of 38.5% was down from 39.3% in 2014. Adjusted operating margin of 41.8% was down from 42.4%. On a constant currency basis and excluding our 2014 and 2015 acquisition, operating margin for the quarter would have been flat year-over-year and adjusted operating margin would have increased approximately 20 basis points.
Moody's effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 29.4% compared with 28.1% for the prior year period. This increase was primarily due to a reduced percentage of income from lower tax rate jurisdictions, primarily offset by the favorable resolution of tax audits.
And now I'll provide an update on capital allocation. On December 15, 2015, Moody's increased its quarterly dividend by 9% from $0.34 to $0.37 per share of common stock. Over the course of 2015, Moody's returned $272 million to its shareholders via dividend payment. And with regard to share repurchase, during the fourth quarter of 2015, Moody's repurchased 2 million shares at a total cost of $193 million, or an average cost of $100.09 per share, and issued 261,000 shares as part of its employee stock-based compensation plans. Full year 2015, Moody's repurchased 10.9 million shares for $1.1 billion, or $101.14 per share, and issued 32 -- excuse me, 3.2 million shares under employee stock-based compensation plans. Outstanding shares as of December 31, 2015, totaled 196.1 million shares, down 4% from December 31, 2014. In December 2015, the Board of Directors authorized a $1 billion share repurchase program to commence following the completion of the existing program. Including this incremental program, as of December 31, 2015, Moody's had $1.5 billion of share repurchase authority remaining.
Turning now to Moody's leverage. In November 2015, Moody's issued $300 million of 5.25% senior unsecured notes due 2044. At the end of 2015, Moody's had $3.4 billion of outstanding debt and $1 billion of additional debt capacity available under its revolving credit facility. 
Total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at quarter end were $2.2 billion, up $555 million from December 31, 2014. As of December 31, 2015, approximately 68% of Moody's cash and cash equivalents were maintained outside the U.S. 
Free cash flow for the full year of 2015 was $1.1 billion, up 13% from full year 2014, primarily due to changes in working capital.
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Ray."

I'll conclude this morning's prepared comments by discussing our full year guidance for 2016. Moody's outlook for 2016 is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, corporate profitability and business investment spending, mergers and acquisitions, consumer borrowing and securitization and the amount of debt issued. These assumptions are subject to some degree of uncertainty and results for the year could differ materially from our current outlook.
Moody's guidance assumes foreign currency translation for the British pound of $1.42 to GBP 1, and for the euro of $1.09 to the EUR 1. For all other currencies, Moody's assumes end of 2015 exchange rates.
Although we expect continued market volatility, we're projecting mid-single-digit percent revenue growth in 2016 as well as EPS of $4.75 to $4.85. Operating expense is expected to grow in the mid-single-digit percent range. Moody's projects an operating margin of approximately 42% and an adjusted operating margin of approximately 45%. The effective tax rate is expected to be 32% to 32.5%. 
2016 free cash flow is expected to be approximately $1.1 billion. Moody's expect share repurchases to be approximately $1 billion, subject to available cash, market conditions and other ongoing capital allocation decisions. Capital expenditures are projected to be $125 million to $135 million. Depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be approximately $130 million. 
For MIS, we expect 2016 revenue to grow in the mid-single-digit percent range. Both U.S. and non-U.S. MIS revenues are also expected to increase in the mid-single-digit percent range.
Corporate finance revenue is expected to be flat. Structured finance revenue and public, project and infrastructure finance revenue are each expected to grow in the high single-digit percent range. Financial institutions revenue is expected to grow in the mid-single-digit percent range. 
For MA, 2016 revenue is expected to increase in the mid-single-digit percent range. U.S. revenue is expected to grow in the high single-digit percent range and non-U.S. revenue is expected to be flat. 
Research, data and analytics revenues is projected to grow in the mid-single-digit percent range. 
Enterprise risk solutions revenue is expected to grow in the low single-digit percent range following earlier than anticipated recognition of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2015.

Could you just help give us a little bit more color on your underlying assumptions in terms of the global issuance, volume forecast and just -- maybe some of the moving pieces within those categories?

So I was just hoping you could shed some color on those pieces there."

This is solely U.S. issuance information, though, and it",629,"Sure. Manav, Salli is going to put up a new slide, which looks at the summation of the years the we've gotten from a number of investment banks, and we received this on the afternoon of February 3. This is solely U.S. issuance information, though, and it is for both financial and non-financial bonds and leveraged loans. I'll go through each of the categories that hopefully you can see up on the screen. Finally, I'll conclude by making some quick comments on the European outlook. So firstly, investment-grade, for January, we saw about $125 billion of issuance and it was the fourth highest volume month ever. However, $46 billion of that issuance came from one deal, the InBev deal. We are encouraged by approximately $200 billion in the visible M&A pipeline, but volatility is impacting the pace of that issuance. So the pipeline is healthy, but we do seem to have some backup in the issuance pipeline. All-in funding costs are generally quite attractive. And lastly, the last point there in relation to M&A, shareholder-friendly activities continue to be cited as the use of proceeds. So for the year, we see about $1.2 trillion in investment grade issuance in U.S., which is about flat year-over-year. And that's a reasonable outlook that we can work with. Moving onto the speculative-grade categories, high-yield bonds. January, about $7 billion of issuance. The leverage market was soft in December. That tone has continued into January and that makes us cautious. $35 billion is in the forward pipeline. And again, we see 2 classes of issuers, those with higher-quality speculative-grade names have access and those with lower ratings don't; continued headwinds coming from the commodities' volatility issues and default rate concerns. And last week, we saw in-flows back into high-yield funds, which we haven't seen since the start of the year, which may indicate that perhaps we are establishing some stability, which would be helpful. So for the year, estimates range pretty widely on high-yield bonds. About $240 billion is the sort of mean number that we're seeing. That's down to 15% year-over-year. Last year, I think we did about $275 billion and these numbers come down as we move to this point in time. Leveraged loans, we saw $20 billion of issuance left in January and expecting $260 billion, which is down 10% for the year. So we've seen low volumes in the high-yield bond market and loans were about on pace with 2015. Leveraged loan activity was consistent week-to-week in January and banks expect this to continue. Again, we can see $45 billion in the forward pipeline, but the timing of that is very much open to discussion. And an uptick in defaults could cause the loan space to be impacted negatively, but less so than the high-yield bond market. So investment-grade, in summary, in the U.S., about flat this year, high-yield bonds down 15% and leveraged loans down about 10%. Now in Europe, just in terms of what we're seeing there. Generally, we see broader uses to what could happen this year in terms of issuance. But generally, for Europe, from the banks, we're seeing investment-grade up about 10%, high-yield bonds down about 10% and leveraged loans up about 5%. On -- in terms of what we're seeing, the 10-year is quite tame at this point about 184, 185. And spreads on U.S. investment-grade bonds about 216 bps and in high-yield about 765 bps. So spreads have widened with the 10 years come in, so we think all-in financing costs are relatively attractive. In Europe, the spread numbers are about 154 basis points for investment-grade and for high-yield, about 538 basis points. So with that, I'll turn it over to Ray, and potentially, Michel may have some other color as well."

But it's -- we take that as a good sign in terms of the pipeline of new activity of fresh names."

So we expect to have a strong year for CMBS, in particular, but also we expect to continue to see growth in the asset-backed and residential mortgage-backed securities sectors. That is -- and that improvement, we anticipate in really all geographies. Probably stronger in the U.S. except for the CLO area than in Europe, but we do expect to see growth around the world."

And with incentive comp, we offset any other increase in compensation. So we're pretty aggressive about managing expenses, as you had noted. Just a couple of comments. If, in fact, the top line does pick up, we get pretty good operating leverage on those increases in the top line. The only incremental piece that we really need to pay would be incentive compensation. So we look at maybe $0.60, $0.70 on a dollar of revenue, so that is very helpful. As you pointed out, the top line is the tricky part for this year, and we're looking at margin being about flat. We finished last year at 42.3% and we're saying that we'll be about flat this year. To be perfectly honest, it's a little tough for us to have the margin come in exactly at where we expect it to, but we are reinvesting in our business and we think flat margin is fine. From an FX-adjusted basis, we're planning for expenses to increase by about $100 million in 2016, and those are about evenly split between 3 different things. The first is the role forward of the hiring we did in 2015; second would be the hiring we're doing in 2016; and the third would really be around technology and real estate changes that we're making. On the technology piece, we are investing in our system. Cyber security is a piece of that, which I think every financial corporation is looking at right now. And then we do have a bit heavier than usual real estate piece. I think you've probably seen, we've taken 2 floors over at One World Trade Center at very attractive rates and the 52nd floor here in this building at 7 World Trade, also at very attractive rate. But we do need to get those new floors online here and there'll be some expense associated with that. So nothing very exciting. But to draw as a top line, which we think is pretty healthy, given what other companies are putting up, to drive mid-single digits, we do need to spend some money, and our plans are modest, but we are thinking revenue will be about flat. I don't know if Ray or the division heads had anything more to say on that."

So we're going to look at 4 different areas, investment-grade, spec-grade, bank loans and other. The total revenue for this category for the fourth quarter was $246 million. So investment grade was $71 million, about flat from the fourth quarter last year in terms of percentages, a little bit down on dollar basis. Spec-grade decreased to $26.5 million from last year's $34.1 million in the fourth quarter. Bank loans, interestingly increased in the fourth quarter 2015 to $44 million from last year's $37 million, and bank loans were 18% of this total corporate line. Other was $104.4 million, down from last year's $112 million and represented 42% of the split. And again, corporates represented 45% off the MIS revenues for the fourth quarter of '15. Moving onto structured, we'll go through 5 different lines. The total for structured was $114 million in 2015. First, we'll look at ABS and that was about $24 million, up a little bit from last year's $22 million. Second is residential mortgage-backed securities, $23 million, up a bit from last year's $20 million. Commercial real estate, $37.5 million, up from last year's about $36 million. And structured credit at about $30 million, down from last year's $40 million. And others, pretty negligible. So again, that all sums to $114 million. If we move on to FIG, total is about $92 million for the fourth quarter. And we'll look at banking insurance, managed investments and other. So banking is now at $61 million, about flat from last year's $60 million; insurance at about $24 million is up nicely from last year's $19 million; managed investments at $4.4 million was flat to last year; and other at $2 million, unchanged results or flat to last year. And then lastly, we go to PPIF. Total is $85 million here. We've got 3 categories, which include PFG and sovereign first, which is about $46 million. Last year, we're about $48 million on this line for the fourth quarter. Project and infrastructure is the second category. About $40 million here, which is down from last year's $42 million and then other is negligible, really, in both periods. So I think that's the total split of the big categories, Craig.

So for fourth quarter of 2015, incentive compensation was 13% of our total comp expenses of $336 million for the quarter, which was just about flat to what we did for last year, but the components were quite different. So this year, we put up $44 million in the fourth quarter for incentive compensation. Last year, we put up $53 million. So this was a delta of almost $9 million. The fourth quarter of '15 didn't come in as strong as we might have liked, and therefore, the incentive compensation accrual backed off by quite a bit. Also what was interesting is, last year, we did have $7 million of profit sharing in the fourth quarter. And for this fourth quarter, we did not have any profit sharing, and so that saved another $7 million. So really $16 million there, a reduction in those 2 lines. Now on salaries and benefits, we did move up from $255 million last year to about $272 million this year. So again, that increase in salaries and benefits were -- that was completely offset by what happened with the incentive compensation. Stock-based comp was about flat at $20.5 million, so not much going on differently there. But I think what we want to demonstrate here, Doug, is we pulled the incentive comp lever pretty hard if things are a little bit weaker than we think. And the first reduction there goes to, unfortunately, to the employees. So that's how we handled it. I hope that's helpful."

We'll wait and see where things go with the Fed potentially in March. But when we can see the pipelines there, it does give us some view to be a bit more optimistic. The timing is the tricky thing and that's why at Moody's, we don't give quarterly guidance because it's very difficult to predict. But we do expect that M&A is continuing and that a lot of companies have bridged loans in place for financing, and eventually, they're going to have to be taken out. So it's a matter of when.

So that companies feel that they have visibility in what their issuance would look like. Obviously, rates and spreads are relevant. I don't think that movement on the short-term rates is going to be particularly impactful. It's really looking more at the long term rates for the bond issuance. And it also has to do with economic momentum in the economy and refinancing needs. So if we have relatively wide spreads or volatility in the market and we don't see a lot of economic momentum to encourage capital expenditure and business expansion, and we don't have refinancing needs, then issuance is going to be more subdued. But when that combination of factors starts to come into better alignment, stability spreads narrowing and the need to refinance, either for business expansion -- or the need to finance, either for refinancing or business expansion, that's the virtuous cycle."

In high-yield bonds for 2015, we did $183 million of revenue. That's about 5% of the corporation's revenue. Again, high-yield in 2015, only 5% of the corporation's revenue. Bank loans, a little over $200 million, about 6% of the corporation's revenue. And in the fourth quarter of '15, as I had said to Craig, our spec-grade revenue was down to $26.5 million. We fought very hard about high-yield for 2016, and we think that the Q4 run rate in 2015, we hope, is low. So we have reduced our high-yield view. We've been very thoughtful about that, but we don't think it's going to be quite as bad as it was in the fourth quarter of 2015. We're watching this very carefully.

We would caution everyone that expense timing, FX movements and particularly incentive compensation can move that number around, as we've seen in previous years. We'll continue to manage the costs carefully. We have about $50 million of expense flexibility that we can move on. If we did encounter a more dramatic situation, we could probably about double that, but we're not expecting anything like that. And as the year progresses, of course, those amounts come down. Similarly, we didn't have any questions on the tax rate. We're looking at 32% to 32.5%. We can't do exactly the same thing on the tax rate every year because we are impacted by individual audit results.

I'll begin by summarizing Moody's fourth quarter and full year 2015 results. Linda will follow with additional financial detail and operating highlights. I will then conclude with comments on our outlook for 2016. After our prepared remarks, we'll be happy to respond to your questions.
In the fourth quarter, Moody's delivered revenue of $866 million, a decline of 1% from the fourth quarter of 2014, but an increase of 2% on a constant currency basis. Operating expense for the fourth quarter was $533 million, flat to the fourth quarter of 2014. Operating income was $333 million, down 3% from the prior year period. And adjusted operating income, defined as operating income less depreciation and amortization, was $362 million, also down 3% from the same period last year. Operating margin for the fourth quarter of 2015 was 38.5% and the adjusted operating margin was 41.8%. Diluted earnings per share of $1.09 was down 3% from the prior year period.
For full year 2015, Moody's achieved revenue and EPS growth for the 6th consecutive year despite difficult market conditions. Moody's revenue was $3.5 billion, an increase of 5% from the prior year or 9% on a constant currency basis. Revenue at Moody's Investors Service was $2.3 billion, an increase of 3% from 2014 or 8% on a constant currency basis. Revenue at Moody's Analytics was $1.2 billion, 8% higher than the prior year period, or 12% on a constant currency basis.
Operating expense for full year 2015 was $2 billion, up 6% from 2014. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted operating expense by 4%. Operating income of $1.5 billion increased 2% from 2014. Adjusted operating income of $1.6 billion increased 3% from the prior year period. Operating margin for full year 2015 was 42.3% and the adjusted operating margin was 45.5%. On a constant currency basis and excluding our 2014 and 2015 acquisitions, operating margin and adjusted operating margin would have increased approximately 40 and 50 basis points, respectively, year-over-year.
Full year 2015 earnings per share of $4.63 increased from $4.61 in 2014. Non-GAAP EPS of $4.60 was up 9% from $4.21 in 2014. In both years, non-GAAP EPS excluded a $0.03 benefit from legacy tax matters. Full year 2014 non-GAAP EPS also excluded a $0.37 gain resulting from Moody's acquisition of a controlling interest in ICRA Ltd. in the second quarter of 2014.
I'll now turn the call over to Linda to provide further commentary on our financial results and other updates."

As Ray mentioned, Moody's total revenue for the fourth quarter decreased 1% to $866 million, but was up 2% on a constant currency basis. U.S. revenue of $481 million was up 1% from the fourth quarter of 2014. Non-U.S. revenue of $385 million is down 4%, but up 4% on a constant currency basis. Revenue generated outside the U.S. represented 44% of Moody's total revenue. Recurring revenue of $446 million represented 51% of total revenue. 
Looking now at each of our businesses, starting with Moody's Investors Service. Total MIS revenue for the quarter was $545 million, down 4% from the prior year period, but flat on a constant currency basis. U.S. revenue decreased 2% to $338 million. Non-U.S. revenue of $206 million declined 7%, but was us up 2% on a constant currency basis. Revenue generated outside the U.S. represented 38% of total ratings revenue.
Moving now to the lines of business for MIS. First, global corporate finance revenue in the fourth quarter was $246 million, down 7% from the prior year period, or 4% on a constant currency basis. This result reflected lower levels of non-U.S. investment grade and global speculative grade bond issuance, partially offset by improved levels of U.S. and European bank loan issuance. U.S. corporate finance revenue increased 1%, while non-U.S. revenue decreased 20%.
Second, global structure finance revenue for the fourth quarter was $114 million, down 4% from the prior year period, but flat on a constant currency basis. Increased activity across most areas of structured finance partially offset lower CLO issuance. U.S. structured finance revenue was down 3% and non-U.S. revenue was down 5%.
Third, global financial institutions revenue of $92 million was up 8% from the prior year period, or 13% on a constant currency basis. This revenue was driven primarily by the U.S. insurance and European banking sectors. U.S. financial institutions revenue was up 7% and non-U.S. revenue was up 8%.
Fourth, global public, project and infrastructure finance revenue of $85 million was down 5% versus the prior year period, or 2% on a constant currency basis, primarily as a result of decreased U.S. public finance activity. U.S. public, project and infrastructure finance revenue was down 10%, while non-U.S. revenue was up 4%.
MIS other which consists of non-rating revenue from Moody's majority-owned joint ventures ICRA and Korea Investors Service or KIS, contributed $7 million to MIS revenue for the fourth quarter compared to $8 million in the prior year period.
And turning now to Moody's Analytics. Global revenue for MA of $321 million was up 3% from the fourth quarter of 2014, or 6% on a constant currency basis. U.S. revenue of $143 million was up 6% year-over-year. Non-U.S. revenue of $178 million was up 1% or 6% on a constant currency basis. Revenue generated outside the U.S. represented 56% of total MA revenue.
And moving now to the lines of business for MA. First, global research, data and analytics or RD&A revenue of $161 million was up 8% from the prior year period, or 11% on constant currency basis and represented 50% of total MA revenue. Growth was mainly due to strong new sales and product upgrades, coupled with record customer retention.  U.S. revenue was up 10% and non-U.S. revenue was up 5% or 11% on a constant currency basis.
Second, enterprise risk solutions or ERS generated record revenue of $122 million and was up 1% from last year or 4% on a constant currency basis. Growth was driven by strength in the credit assessment and originations and stress testing businesses. U.S. and non-U.S. ERS revenue were each up 1%. Trailing 12-month revenue in sales for ERS increased 14% and 11%, respectively. As we've noted in the past, due to the variable nature of product timing -- excuse me, project timing and completion, ERS revenue remains subject to quarterly volatility. 
Third, global professional services revenue of $38 million was down 10% from the prior year period, or 6% on a constant currency basis. This result was primarily due to lower net new business at Copal Amba as well as the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange on the credentials and licensing business.
U.S. professional services revenue was down 7%, while non-U.S. revenue was down 11%.
And turning now to expenses. Moody's fourth quarter expense was $533 million, flat to the prior year period. An increase in compensation expense for merit increases in hiring was entirely offset by reduced incentive compensation. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted expense by 3%. Operating margin for the fourth quarter of 2015 of 38.5% was down from 39.3% in 2014. Adjusted operating margin of 41.8% was down from 42.4%. On a constant currency basis and excluding our 2014 and 2015 acquisition, operating margin for the quarter would have been flat year-over-year and adjusted operating margin would have increased approximately 20 basis points.
Moody's effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 29.4% compared with 28.1% for the prior year period. This increase was primarily due to a reduced percentage of income from lower tax rate jurisdictions, primarily offset by the favorable resolution of tax audits.
And now I'll provide an update on capital allocation. On December 15, 2015, Moody's increased its quarterly dividend by 9% from $0.34 to $0.37 per share of common stock. Over the course of 2015, Moody's returned $272 million to its shareholders via dividend payment. And with regard to share repurchase, during the fourth quarter of 2015, Moody's repurchased 2 million shares at a total cost of $193 million, or an average cost of $100.09 per share, and issued 261,000 shares as part of its employee stock-based compensation plans. Full year 2015, Moody's repurchased 10.9 million shares for $1.1 billion, or $101.14 per share, and issued 32 -- excuse me, 3.2 million shares under employee stock-based compensation plans. Outstanding shares as of December 31, 2015, totaled 196.1 million shares, down 4% from December 31, 2014. In December 2015, the Board of Directors authorized a $1 billion share repurchase program to commence following the completion of the existing program. Including this incremental program, as of December 31, 2015, Moody's had $1.5 billion of share repurchase authority remaining.
Turning now to Moody's leverage. In November 2015, Moody's issued $300 million of 5.25% senior unsecured notes due 2044. At the end of 2015, Moody's had $3.4 billion of outstanding debt and $1 billion of additional debt capacity available under its revolving credit facility. 
Total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at quarter end were $2.2 billion, up $555 million from December 31, 2014. As of December 31, 2015, approximately 68% of Moody's cash and cash equivalents were maintained outside the U.S. 
Free cash flow for the full year of 2015 was $1.1 billion, up 13% from full year 2014, primarily due to changes in working capital.
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Ray."

I'll conclude this morning's prepared comments by discussing our full year guidance for 2016. Moody's outlook for 2016 is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, corporate profitability and business investment spending, mergers and acquisitions, consumer borrowing and securitization and the amount of debt issued. These assumptions are subject to some degree of uncertainty and results for the year could differ materially from our current outlook.
Moody's guidance assumes foreign currency translation for the British pound of $1.42 to GBP 1, and for the euro of $1.09 to the EUR 1. For all other currencies, Moody's assumes end of 2015 exchange rates.
Although we expect continued market volatility, we're projecting mid-single-digit percent revenue growth in 2016 as well as EPS of $4.75 to $4.85. Operating expense is expected to grow in the mid-single-digit percent range. Moody's projects an operating margin of approximately 42% and an adjusted operating margin of approximately 45%. The effective tax rate is expected to be 32% to 32.5%. 
2016 free cash flow is expected to be approximately $1.1 billion. Moody's expect share repurchases to be approximately $1 billion, subject to available cash, market conditions and other ongoing capital allocation decisions. Capital expenditures are projected to be $125 million to $135 million. Depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be approximately $130 million. 
For MIS, we expect 2016 revenue to grow in the mid-single-digit percent range. Both U.S. and non-U.S. MIS revenues are also expected to increase in the mid-single-digit percent range.
Corporate finance revenue is expected to be flat. Structured finance revenue and public, project and infrastructure finance revenue are each expected to grow in the high single-digit percent range. Financial institutions revenue is expected to grow in the mid-single-digit percent range. 
For MA, 2016 revenue is expected to increase in the mid-single-digit percent range. U.S. revenue is expected to grow in the high single-digit percent range and non-U.S. revenue is expected to be flat. 
Research, data and analytics revenues is projected to grow in the mid-single-digit percent range. 
Enterprise risk solutions revenue is expected to grow in the low single-digit percent range following earlier than anticipated recognition of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
Professional services revenue is expected to decline in the low single-digit percent range.

Manav, Salli is going to put up a new slide, which looks at the summation of the years the we've gotten from a number of investment banks, and we received this on the afternoon of February 3. This is solely U.S. issuance information, though, and it is for both financial and non-financial bonds and leveraged loans. I'll go through each of the categories that hopefully you can see up on the screen. Finally, I'll conclude by making some quick comments on the European outlook. So firstly, investment-grade, for January, we saw about $125 billion of issuance and it was the fourth highest volume month ever. However, $46 billion of that issuance came from one deal, the InBev deal. We are encouraged by approximately $200 billion in the visible M&A pipeline, but volatility is impacting the pace of that issuance. So the pipeline is healthy, but we do seem to have some backup in the issuance pipeline. All-in funding costs are generally quite attractive. And lastly, the last point there in relation to M&A, shareholder-friendly activities continue to be cited as the use of proceeds. So for the year, we see about $1.2 trillion in investment grade issuance in U.S., which is about flat year-over-year. And that's a reasonable outlook that we can work with. Moving onto the speculative-grade categories, high-yield bonds. January, about $7 billion of issuance. The leverage market was soft in December. That tone has continued into January and that makes us cautious. $35 billion is in the forward pipeline. And again, we see 2 classes of issuers, those with higher-quality speculative-grade names have access and those with lower ratings don't; continued headwinds coming from the commodities' volatility issues and default rate concerns. And last week, we saw in-flows back into high-yield funds, which we haven't seen since the start of the year, which may indicate that perhaps we are establishing some stability, which would be helpful. So for the year, estimates range pretty widely on high-yield bonds. About $240 billion is the sort of mean number that we're seeing. That's down to 15% year-over-year. Last year, I think we did about $275 billion and these numbers come down as we move to this point in time. Leveraged loans, we saw $20 billion of issuance left in January and expecting $260 billion, which is down 10% for the year. So we've seen low volumes in the high-yield bond market and loans were about on pace with 2015. Leveraged loan activity was consistent week-to-week in January and banks expect this to continue. Again, we can see $45 billion in the forward pipeline, but the timing of that is very much open to discussion. And an uptick in defaults could cause the loan space to be impacted negatively, but less so than the high-yield bond market. So investment-grade, in summary, in the U.S., about flat this year, high-yield bonds down 15% and leveraged loans down about 10%. Now in Europe, just in terms of what we're seeing there. Generally, we see broader views to what could happen this year in terms of issuance. But generally, for Europe, from the banks, we're seeing investment-grade up about 10%, high-yield bonds down about 10% and leveraged loans up about 5%. On -- in terms of what we're seeing, the 10-year is quite tame at this point about 184, 185. And spreads on U.S. investment-grade bonds about 216 bps and in high-yield about 765 bps. So spreads have widened with the 10-year's come in, so we think all-in financing costs are relatively attractive. In Europe, the spread numbers are about 154 basis points for investment-grade and for high-yield, about 538 basis points. So with that, I'll turn it over to Ray, and potentially, Michel may have some other color as well."

The only thing I would add is with respect to new rating mandates, we did have a healthy pace of new mandates throughout the year in 2015 coming in at about 770 new mandates, and that has continued to be a healthy pipeline early this year. So there's obviously going to be decisions by potential new issuers about when and if they want to get in the market. And I agree with Linda's comments, some stability will encourage them in. But it's -- we take that as a good sign in terms of the pipeline of new activity of fresh names."

And with incentive comp, we offset any other increase in compensation. So we're pretty aggressive about managing expenses, as you had noted. Just a couple of comments. If, in fact, the top line does pick up, we get pretty good operating leverage on those increases in the top line. The only incremental piece that we really need to pay would be incentive compensation. So we look at maybe $0.60, $0.70 on $1 of revenue, so that is very helpful. As you pointed out, the top line is the tricky part for this year, and we're looking at margin being about flat. We finished last year at 42.3% and we're saying that we'll be about flat this year. To be perfectly honest, it's a little tough for us to have the margin come in exactly at where we expect it to, but we are reinvesting in our business and we think flat margin is fine. From an FX-adjusted basis, we're planning for expenses to increase by about $100 million in 2016, and those are about evenly split between 3 different things. The first is the roll forward of the hiring we did in 2015; second would be the hiring we're doing in 2016; and the third would really be around technology and real estate changes that we're making. On the technology piece, we are investing in our system. Cyber security is a piece of that, which I think every financial corporation is looking at right now. And then we do have a bit heavier than usual real estate piece. I think you've probably seen, we've taken 2 floors over at One World Trade Center at very attractive rates and the 52nd floor here in this building at 7 World Trade, also at very attractive rates. But we do need to get those new floors online here and there'll be some expense associated with that. So nothing very exciting. But to drive the top line, which we think is pretty healthy, given what other companies are putting up, to drive mid-single digits, we do need to spend some money, and our plans are modest, but we are thinking revenue will be about flat. I don't know if Ray or the division heads had anything more to say on that."

So we're going to look at 4 different areas, investment-grade, spec-grade, bank loans and other. The total revenue for this category for the fourth quarter was $246 million. So investment grade was $71 million, about flat from the fourth quarter last year in terms of percentages, a little bit down on dollar basis. Spec-grade decreased to $26.5 million from last year's $34.1 million in the fourth quarter. Bank loans, interestingly increased in the fourth quarter 2015 to $44 million from last year's $37 million, and bank loans were 18% of this total corporate line. Other was $104.4 million, down from last year's $112 million and represented 42% of the split. And again, corporates represented 45% of the MIS revenues for the fourth quarter of '15. Moving onto structured, we'll go through 5 different lines. The total for structured was $114 million in 2015. First, we'll look at ABS and that was about $24 million, up a little bit from last year's $22 million. Second is residential mortgage-backed securities, $23 million, up a bit from last year's $20 million. Commercial real estate, $37.5 million, up from last year's about $36 million. And structured credit at about $30 million, down from last year's $40 million. And others, pretty negligible. So again, that all sums to $114 million. If we move on to FIG, total is about $92 million for the fourth quarter. And we'll look at banking insurance, managed investments and other. So banking is now at $61 million, about flat from last year's $60 million; insurance at about $24 million is up nicely from last year's $19 million; managed investments at $4.4 million was flat to last year; and other at $2 million and change was also flat to last year. And then lastly, we go to PPIF. Total is $85 million here. We've got 3 categories, which include PFG and sovereign first, which is about $46 million. Last year, we were about $48 million on this line for the fourth quarter. Project and infrastructure is the second category. About $40 million here, which is down from last year's $42 million and then other is negligible, really, in both periods. So I think that's the total split of the big categories, Craig. Is that -- does that get it done for your?"

So for fourth quarter of 2015, incentive compensation was 13% of our total comp expenses of $336 million for the quarter, which was just about flat to what we did for last year, but the components were quite different. So this year, we put up $44 million in the fourth quarter for incentive compensation. Last year, we put up $53 million. So this was a delta of almost $9 million. The fourth quarter of '15 didn't come in as strong as we might have liked, and therefore, the incentive compensation accrual backed off by quite a bit. Also what was interesting is, last year, we did have $7 million of profit sharing in the fourth quarter. And for this fourth quarter, we did not have any profit sharing, and so that saved another $7 million. So really $16 million there, reduction in those 2 lines. Now on salaries and benefits, we did move up from $255 million last year to about $272 million this year. So again, that increase in salaries and benefits were -- that was completely offset by what happened with the incentive compensation. Stock-based comp was about flat at $20.5 million, so not much going on differently there. But I think what we want to demonstrate here, Doug, is we pull the incentive comp lever pretty hard if things are a little bit weaker than we think. And the first reduction there goes to, unfortunately, to the employees. So that's how we handled it. I hope that's helpful."

And if we assume -- and that 4% would line up with the guidance for MIS for 2016. If we assume that, that 4% 2-year comp is kind of the target for 2016 and we go through by the quarters and keeping at 4%, it would imply Q1 would be about -- down about 10%, Q2 up about 2%, Q3 up about 4% and Q4 up about 7% to 8%. And I just wanted to run that by to see if that methodology was okay? Or maybe you could suggest a better one in terms of looking at how to think about the progression of MIS throughout the year, given uncertainties of market?"

I have to be honest, I didn't quite keep up with all the math. But maybe what I can do to be helpful is to remind listeners that our revenue typically follows a sawtooth pattern, with the second and fourth quarters being stronger, first and third quarters being softer. We did not see that pattern strongly in 2015 because of weakness in the fourth quarter, and I would anticipate, at this point in time, that we would be back to more of the traditional sawtooth going into 2016, so second and fourth quarters. And I would also anticipate that as I had mentioned a little while ago, that we may see momentum picking up in the second half of the year this year."

The timing is the tricky thing and that's why at Moody's, we don't give quarterly guidance because it's very difficult to predict.

So that companies feel that they have visibility in what their issuance would look like. Obviously, rates and spreads are relevant. I don't think that movement on the short-term rates is going to be particularly impactful. It's really looking more at the long term rates for the bond issuance. And it also has to do with economic momentum in the economy and refinancing needs. So if we have relatively wide spreads or volatility in the market and we don't see a lot of economic momentum to encourage capital expenditure and business expansion, and we don't have refinancing needs, then issuance is going to be more subdued. But when that combination of factors starts to come into better alignment, stability spreads narrowing and the need to refinance, either for business expansion -- or the need to finance, either for refinancing or business expansion, that's the virtuous cycle."

And just to make sure that we're level setting, we often comment on the expense ramp at this time in the year and we hadn't done that yet, so I want to make sure that everybody is on the same page with that. Over the course of '16, we're looking at expenses to generally ramp from $35 million to $45 million from the first quarter to the fourth quarter. We would caution everyone that expense timing, FX movements and particularly incentive compensation can move that number around, as we've seen in previous years. We'll continue to manage the costs carefully. We have about $50 million of expense flexibility that we can move on. If we did encounter a more dramatic situation, we could probably about double that, but we're not expecting anything like that. And as the year progresses, of course, those amounts come down. Similarly, we didn't have any questions on the tax rate. We're looking at 32% to 32.5%. We can't do exactly the same thing on the tax rate every year because we are impacted by individual audit results. So we do expect with the U.S. being the balance of our income potentially for '16, that we might have a little bit more to pay on the tax rate. So again, 32% to 32.5%. And our CapEx guidance, I think, most of you saw, had moved up a bit, and that is primarily because of some of the things that we're doing in technology and real estate as we had said before, but just wanted to make sure that everyone was aware of those numbers so that can fit in your modeling effort.

I will then conclude with comments on our outlook for 2016. After our prepared remarks, we'll be happy to respond to your questions.
In the fourth quarter, Moody's delivered revenue of $866 million, a decline of 1% from the fourth quarter of 2014, but an increase of 2% on a constant currency basis. Operating expense for the fourth quarter was $533 million, flat to the fourth quarter of 2014. Operating income was $333 million, down 3% from the prior year period. And adjusted operating income, defined as operating income less depreciation and amortization, was $362 million, also down 3% from the same period last year. Operating margin for the fourth quarter of 2015 was 38.5% and the adjusted operating margin was 41.8%. Diluted earnings per share of $1.09 was down 3% from the prior year period.
For full year 2015, Moody's achieved revenue and EPS growth for the 6th consecutive year despite difficult market conditions. Moody's revenue was $3.5 billion, an increase of 5% from the prior year or 9% on a constant currency basis. Revenue at Moody's Investors Service was $2.3 billion, an increase of 3% from 2014 or 8% on a constant currency basis. Revenue at Moody's Analytics was $1.2 billion, 8% higher than the prior year period, or 12% on a constant currency basis.
Operating expense for full year 2015 was $2 billion, up 6% from 2014. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted operating expense by 4%. Operating income of $1.5 billion increased 2% from 2014. Adjusted operating income of $1.6 billion increased 3% from the prior year period. Operating margin for full year 2015 was 42.3% and the adjusted operating margin was 45.5%. On a constant currency basis and excluding our 2014 and 2015 acquisitions, operating margin and adjusted operating margin would have increased approximately 40 and 50 basis points, respectively, year-over-year.
Full year 2015 earnings per share of $4.63 increased from $4.61 in 2014. Non-GAAP EPS of $4.60 was up 9% from $4.21 in 2014. In both years, non-GAAP EPS excluded a $0.03 benefit from legacy tax matters. Full year 2014 non-GAAP EPS also excluded a $0.37 gain resulting from Moody's acquisition of a controlling interest in ICRA Ltd. in the second quarter of 2014.
I'll now turn the call over to Linda to provide further commentary on our financial results and other updates."

As Ray mentioned, Moody's total revenue for the fourth quarter decreased 1% to $866 million, but was up 2% on a constant currency basis. U.S. revenue of $481 million was up 1% from the fourth quarter of 2014. Non-U.S. revenue of $385 million is down 4%, but up 4% on a constant currency basis. Revenue generated outside the U.S. represented 44% of Moody's total revenue. Recurring revenue of $446 million represented 51% of total revenue. 
Looking now at each of our businesses, starting with Moody's Investors Service. Total MIS revenue for the quarter was $545 million, down 4% from the prior year period, but flat on a constant currency basis. U.S. revenue decreased 2% to $338 million. Non-U.S. revenue of $206 million declined 7%, but was us up 2% on a constant currency basis. Revenue generated outside the U.S. represented 38% of total ratings revenue.
Moving now to the lines of business for MIS. First, global corporate finance revenue in the fourth quarter was $246 million, down 7% from the prior year period, or 4% on a constant currency basis. This result reflected lower levels of non-U.S. investment grade and global speculative grade bond issuance, partially offset by improved levels of U.S. and European bank loan issuance. U.S. corporate finance revenue increased 1%, while non-U.S. revenue decreased 20%.
Second, global structure finance revenue for the fourth quarter was $114 million, down 4% from the prior year period, but flat on a constant currency basis. Increased activity across most areas of structured finance partially offset lower CLO issuance. U.S. structured finance revenue was down 3% and non-U.S. revenue was down 5%.
Third, global financial institutions revenue of $92 million was up 8% from the prior year period, or 13% on a constant currency basis. This revenue was driven primarily by the U.S. insurance and European banking sectors. U.S. financial institutions revenue was up 7% and non-U.S. revenue was up 8%.
Fourth, global public, project and infrastructure finance revenue of $85 million was down 5% versus the prior year period, or 2% on a constant currency basis, primarily as a result of decreased U.S. public finance activity. U.S. public, project and infrastructure finance revenue was down 10%, while non-U.S. revenue was up 4%.
MIS other which consists of non-rating revenue from Moody's majority-owned joint ventures ICRA and Korea Investors Service or KIS, contributed $7 million to MIS revenue for the fourth quarter compared to $8 million in the prior year period.
And turning now to Moody's Analytics. Global revenue for MA of $321 million was up 3% from the fourth quarter of 2014, or 6% on a constant currency basis. U.S. revenue of $143 million was up 6% year-over-year. Non-U.S. revenue of $178 million was up 1% or 6% on a constant currency basis. Revenue generated outside the U.S. represented 56% of total MA revenue.
And moving now to the lines of business for MA. First, global research, data and analytics or RD&A revenue of $161 million was up 8% from the prior year period, or 11% on constant currency basis and represented 50% of total MA revenue. Growth was mainly due to strong new sales and product upgrades, coupled with record customer retention. U.S. revenue was up 10% and non-U.S. revenue was up 5% or 11% on a constant currency basis.
Second, enterprise risk solutions or ERS generated record revenue of $122 million and was up 1% from last year or 4% on a constant currency basis. Growth was driven by strength in the credit assessment and originations and stress testing businesses. U.S. and non-U.S. ERS revenue were each up 1%. Trailing 12-month revenue in sales for ERS increased 14% and 11%, respectively. As we've noted in the past, due to the variable nature of product timing -- excuse me, project timing and completion, ERS revenue remains subject to quarterly volatility. 
Third, global professional services revenue of $38 million was down 10% from the prior year period, or 6% on a constant currency basis. This result was primarily due to lower net new business at Copal Amba as well as the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange on the credentials and licensing business.
U.S. professional services revenue was down 7%, while non-U.S. revenue was down 11%.
And turning now to expenses. Moody's fourth quarter expense was $533 million, flat to the prior year period. An increase in compensation expense for merit increases in hiring was entirely offset by reduced incentive compensation. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted expense by 3%. Operating margin for the fourth quarter of 2015 of 38.5% was down from 39.3% in 2014. Adjusted operating margin of 41.8% was down from 42.4%. On a constant currency basis and excluding our 2014 and 2015 acquisition, operating margin for the quarter would have been flat year-over-year and adjusted operating margin would have increased approximately 20 basis points.
Moody's effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 29.4% compared with 28.1% for the prior year period. This increase was primarily due to a reduced percentage of income from lower tax rate jurisdictions, primarily offset by the favorable resolution of tax audits.
And now I'll provide an update on capital allocation. On December 15, 2015, Moody's increased its quarterly dividend by 9% from $0.34 to $0.37 per share of common stock. Over the course of 2015, Moody's returned $272 million to its shareholders via dividend payment. And with regard to share repurchase, during the fourth quarter of 2015, Moody's repurchased 2 million shares at a total cost of $193 million, or an average cost of $100.09 per share, and issued 261,000 shares as part of its employee stock-based compensation plans. Full year 2015, Moody's repurchased 10.9 million shares for $1.1 billion, or $101.14 per share, and issued 32 -- excuse me, 3.2 million shares under employee stock-based compensation plans. Outstanding shares as of December 31, 2015, totaled 196.1 million shares, down 4% from December 31, 2014. In December 2015, the Board of Directors authorized a $1 billion share repurchase program to commence following the completion of the existing program. Including this incremental program, as of December 31, 2015, Moody's had $1.5 billion of share repurchase authority remaining.
Turning now to Moody's leverage. In November 2015, Moody's issued $300 million of 5.25% senior unsecured notes due 2044. At the end of 2015, Moody's had $3.4 billion of outstanding debt and $1 billion of additional debt capacity available under its revolving credit facility. 
Total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at quarter end were $2.2 billion, up $555 million from December 31, 2014. As of December 31, 2015, approximately 68% of Moody's cash and cash equivalents were maintained outside the U.S. 
Free cash flow for the full year of 2015 was $1.1 billion, up 13% from full year 2014, primarily due to changes in working capital.
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Ray."

I'll conclude this morning's prepared comments by discussing our full year guidance for 2016. Moody's outlook for 2016 is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, corporate profitability and business investment spending, mergers and acquisitions, consumer borrowing and securitization and the amount of debt issued. These assumptions are subject to some degree of uncertainty and results for the year could differ materially from our current outlook.
Moody's guidance assumes foreign currency translation for the British pound of $1.42 to GBP 1, and for the euro of $1.09 to the EUR 1. For all other currencies, Moody's assumes end of 2015 exchange rates.
Although we expect continued market volatility, we're projecting mid-single-digit percent revenue growth in 2016 as well as EPS of $4.75 to $4.85. Operating expense is expected to grow in the mid-single-digit percent range. Moody's projects an operating margin of approximately 42% and an adjusted operating margin of approximately 45%. The effective tax rate is expected to be 32% to 32.5%. 
2016 free cash flow is expected to be approximately $1.1 billion. Moody's expect share repurchases to be approximately $1 billion, subject to available cash, market conditions and other ongoing capital allocation decisions. Capital expenditures are projected to be $125 million to $135 million. Depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be approximately $130 million. 
For MIS, we expect 2016 revenue to grow in the mid-single-digit percent range. Both U.S. and non-U.S. MIS revenues are also expected to increase in the mid-single-digit percent range.
Corporate finance revenue is expected to be flat. Structured finance revenue and public, project and infrastructure finance revenue are each expected to grow in the high single-digit percent range. Financial institutions revenue is expected to grow in the mid-single-digit percent range. 
For MA, 2016 revenue is expected to increase in the mid-single-digit percent range. U.S. revenue is expected to grow in the high single-digit percent range and non-U.S. revenue is expected to be flat. 
Research, data and analytics revenues is projected to grow in the mid-single-digit percent range. 
Enterprise risk solutions revenue is expected to grow in the low single-digit percent range following earlier than anticipated recognition of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
Professional services revenue is expected to decline in the low single-digit percent range.
This concludes our prepared remarks, and joining us for the question-and-answer session is Michel Madelain, President and Chief Operating Officer of Moody's Investors Service; and Mark Almeida, President of Moody's Analytics. We'd be pleased to take your questions."

Manav, Salli is going to put up a new slide, which looks at the summation of the years we've gotten from a number of investment banks, and we received this on the afternoon of February 3. This is solely U.S. issuance information, though, and it is for both financial and non-financial bonds and leveraged loans. I'll go through each of the categories that hopefully you can see up on the screen. Finally, I'll conclude by making some quick comments on the European outlook. So firstly, investment-grade, for January, we saw about $125 billion of issuance and it was the fourth highest volume month ever. However, $46 billion of that issuance came from one deal, the InBev deal. We are encouraged by approximately $200 billion in the visible M&A pipeline, but volatility is impacting the pace of that issuance. So the pipeline is healthy, but we do seem to have some backup in the issuance pipeline. All-in funding costs are generally quite attractive. And lastly, the last point there in relation to M&A, shareholder-friendly activities continue to be cited as the use of proceeds. So for the year, we see about $1.2 trillion in investment grade issuance in U.S., which is about flat year-over-year. And that's a reasonable outlook that we can work with. Moving onto the speculative-grade categories, high-yield bonds. January, about $7 billion of issuance. The leverage market was soft in December. That tone has continued into January and that makes us cautious. $35 billion is in the forward pipeline. And again, we see 2 classes of issuers, those with higher-quality speculative-grade names have access and those with lower ratings don't; continued headwinds coming from the commodities' volatility issues and default rate concerns. And last week, we saw in-flows back into high-yield funds, which we haven't seen since the start of the year, which may indicate that perhaps we are establishing some stability, which would be helpful. So for the year, estimates range pretty widely on high-yield bonds. About $240 billion is the sort of mean number that we're seeing. That's down to 15% year-over-year. Last year, I think we did about $275 billion and these numbers come down as we move to this point in time. Leveraged loans, we saw $20 billion of issuance left in January and expecting $260 billion, which is down 10% for the year. So we've seen low volumes in the high-yield bond market and loans were about on pace with 2015. Leveraged loan activity was consistent week-to-week in January and banks expect this to continue. Again, we can see $45 billion in the forward pipeline, but the timing of that is very much open to discussion. And an uptick in defaults could cause the loan space to be impacted negatively, but less so than the high-yield bond market. So investment-grade, in summary, in the U.S., about flat this year, high-yield bonds down 15% and leveraged loans down about 10%. Now in Europe, just in terms of what we're seeing there. Generally, we see broader views to what could happen this year in terms of issuance. But generally, for Europe, from the banks, we're seeing investment-grade up about 10%, high-yield bonds down about 10% and leveraged loans up about 5%. On -- in terms of what we're seeing, the 10-year is quite tame at this point about 184, 185. And spreads on U.S. investment-grade bonds about 216 bps and in high-yield about 765 bps. So spreads have widened with the 10-year's come in, so we think all-in financing costs are relatively attractive. In Europe, the spread numbers are about 154 basis points for investment-grade and for high-yield, about 538 basis points. So with that, I'll turn it over to Ray, and potentially, Michel may have some other color as well."

And with incentive comp, we offset any other increase in compensation. So we're pretty aggressive about managing expenses, as you had noted. Just a couple of comments. If, in fact, the top line does pick up, we get pretty good operating leverage on those increases in the top line. The only incremental piece that we really need to pay would be incentive compensation. So we look at maybe $0.60, $0.70 on $1 of revenue, so that is very helpful. As you pointed out, the top line is the tricky part for this year, and we're looking at margin being about flat. We finished last year at 42.3% and we're saying that we'll be about flat this year. To be perfectly honest, it's a little tough for us to have the margin come in exactly at where we expect it to, but we are reinvesting in our business and we think flat margin is fine. From an FX-adjusted basis, we're planning for expenses to increase by about $100 million in 2016, and those are about evenly split between 3 different things. The first is the roll forward of the hiring we did in 2015; second would be the hiring we're doing in 2016; and the third would really be around technology and real estate changes that we're making. On the technology piece, we are investing in our system. Cyber security is a piece of that, which I think every financial corporation is looking at right now. And then we do have a bit heavier than usual real estate piece. I think you've probably seen, we've taken 2 floors over at One World Trade Center at very attractive rates and the 52nd floor here in this building at 7 World Trade, also at very attractive rates. But we do need to get those new floors online here and there'll be some expense associated with that. So nothing very exciting. But to drive the top line, which we think is pretty healthy, given what other companies are putting up, to drive mid-single digits, we do need to spend some money, and our plans are modest, but we are thinking revenue will be about flat. I don't know if Ray or the division heads had anything more to say on that."

So we're going to look at 4 different areas, investment-grade, spec-grade, bank loans and other. The total revenue for this category for the fourth quarter was $246 million. So investment grade was $71 million, about flat from the fourth quarter last year in terms of percentages, a little bit down on dollar basis. Spec-grade decreased to $26.5 million from last year's $34.1 million in the fourth quarter. Bank loans, interestingly increased in the fourth quarter 2015 to $44 million from last year's $37 million, and bank loans were 18% of this total corporate line. Other was $104.4 million, down from last year's $112 million and represented 42% of the split. And again, corporates represented 45% of the MIS revenues for the fourth quarter of '15. Moving onto structured, we'll go through 5 different lines. The total for structured was $114 million in 2015. First, we'll look at ABS and that was about $24 million, up a little bit from last year's $22 million. Second is residential mortgage-backed securities, $23 million, up a bit from last year's $20 million. Commercial real estate, $37.5 million, up from last year's about $36 million. And structured credit at about $30 million, down from last year's $40 million. And others, pretty negligible. So again, that all sums to $114 million. If we move on to FIG, total is about $92 million for the fourth quarter. And we'll look at banking insurance, managed investments and other. So banking is now at $61 million, about flat from last year's $60 million; insurance at about $24 million is up nicely from last year's $19 million; managed investments at $4.4 million was flat to last year; and other at $2 million and change was also flat to last year. And then lastly, we go to PPIF. Total is $85 million here. We've got 3 categories, which include PFG and sovereign first, which is about $46 million. Last year, we were about $48 million on this line for the fourth quarter. Project and infrastructure is the second category. About $40 million here, which is down from last year's $42 million and then other is negligible, really, in both periods. So I think that's the total split of the big categories, Craig.

So for fourth quarter of 2015, incentive compensation was 13% of our total comp expenses of $336 million for the quarter, which was just about flat to what we did for last year, but the components were quite different. So this year, we put up $44 million in the fourth quarter for incentive compensation. Last year, we put up $53 million. So this was a delta of almost $9 million. The fourth quarter of '15 didn't come in as strong as we might have liked, and therefore, the incentive compensation accrual backed off by quite a bit. Also what was interesting is, last year, we did have $7 million of profit sharing in the fourth quarter. And for this fourth quarter, we did not have any profit sharing, and so that saved another $7 million. So really $16 million there, reduction in those 2 lines. Now on salaries and benefits, we did move up from $255 million last year to about $272 million this year. So again, that increase in salaries and benefits were -- that was completely offset by what happened with the incentive compensation. Stock-based comp was about flat at $20.5 million, so not much going on differently there. But I think what we want to demonstrate here, Doug, is we pull the incentive comp lever pretty hard if things are a little bit weaker than we think. And the first reduction there goes to, unfortunately, to the employees. So that's how we handled it. I hope that's helpful."

And as I noted earlier, we've got about $200 billion in the investment-grade M&A pipeline and we've got about $35 billion in the high-yield pipeline that's kind of sitting there waiting to move. We've seen this situation before. We're in a risk-off part of the market. We've had a lot of volatility, but these pipelines will move eventually. We'll wait and see where things go with the Fed potentially in March. But when we can see the pipelines there, it does give us some view to be a bit more optimistic. The timing is the tricky thing and that's why at Moody's, we don't give quarterly guidance because it's very difficult to predict. But we do expect that M&A is continuing and that a lot of companies have bridge loans in place for financing, and eventually, they're going to have to be taken out. So it's a matter of when. And I'll let Ray say some more about that."

So that companies feel that they have visibility in what their issuance would look like. Obviously, rates and spreads are relevant. I don't think that movement on the short-term rates is going to be particularly impactful. It's really looking more at the long term rates for the bond issuance. And it also has to do with economic momentum in the economy and refinancing needs. So if we have relatively wide spreads or volatility in the market and we don't see a lot of economic momentum to encourage capital expenditure and business expansion, and we don't have refinancing needs, then issuance is going to be more subdued. But when that combination of factors starts to come into better alignment, stability spreads narrowing and the need to refinance, either for business expansion -- or the need to finance, either for refinancing or business expansion, that's the virtuous cycle."

We've been very thoughtful about that, but we don't think it's going to be quite as bad as it was in the fourth quarter of 2015. We're watching this very carefully.

We would caution everyone that expense timing, FX movements and particularly incentive compensation can move that number around, as we've seen in previous years. We'll continue to manage the costs carefully. We have about $50 million of expense flexibility that we can move on. If we did encounter a more dramatic situation, we could probably about double that, but we're not expecting anything like that. And as the year progresses, of course, those amounts come down. Similarly, we didn't have any questions on the tax rate. We're looking at 32% to 32.5%. We can't do exactly the same thing on the tax rate every year because we are impacted by individual audit results. So we do expect with the U.S. being the balance of our income potentially for '16, that we might have a little bit more to pay on the tax rate. So again, 32% to 32.5%.

Linda will follow with additional financial detail and operating highlights. I will then conclude with comments about our updated outlook for 2016. After our prepared remarks, we'll be happy to respond to your questions.
In the first quarter of 2016, reduced global bond issuance weighed on Moody's financial performance despite Moody's Investors Services, consistent market coverage and additional ratings mandates as well as strong results at Moody's Analytics, which is not sensitive to debt issuance activity.
Overall revenue for Moody's Corporation of $816 million declined 6%. Operating expense for the first quarter was $512 million, up 4% from the first quarter of 2015. Operating income was $304 million, an 18% decline from the prior year period. The impact of foreign currency translation on operating income was negligible. Adjusted operating income, defined as operating income before depreciation and amortization, was $334 million, down 16% from the same period last year. Operating margin for the first quarter of 2016 was 37.3%. The adjusted operating margin was 40.9%. Diluted earnings per share of $0.93 was down 16% from the prior year period.
Given market conditions, we have scaled back our revenue and earnings expectations for full year 2016 and are managing our cost base accordingly. Our 2016 EPS guidance is now $4.55 to $4.65.
Before I turn the call over to Linda, I'd like to highlight 2 investments we made in the first quarter. In March, Moody's Analytics announced the acquisition of GGY, a leading provider of actuarial software for the life insurance industry. The addition of GGY's products and specialized expertise accelerates MA's expansion into financial risk management for life insurers, complementing our already strong position with global banks. As part of the enterprise risk solutions line of business, GGY will contribute to MA's regulatory solvency and capital management solutions.
We also announced the minority investment in Finegra, a provider of cloud-enabled automated financial data collection in business intelligence solutions for private entities. This investment underscores Moody's commitment to innovative financial technologies to better address the needs of our customers. Inegra's information and analytical solutions represent important advancement in bank's risk assessment of small and medium-size businesses, thus improving access to credit for this underserved segment of the market.
I'll now turn the call over to Linda to provide further commentary on our financial results and other updates."

I'll Begin with revenue at the company level. As Ray mentioned, Moody's total revenue for the first quarter declined 6% to $816 million. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted revenue by 2%. U.S. revenue of $480 million was down 4%",1009,"Thanks, Ray. I'll Begin with revenue at the company level. As Ray mentioned, Moody's total revenue for the first quarter declined 6% to $816 million. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted revenue by 2%. U.S. revenue of $480 million was down 4% from the first quarter of 2015. Non-U.S. revenue of $336 million was down 8% and represented 41% of Moody's total revenue. Recurring revenue of $452 million increased by 7% and represented 55% of total revenue.
Looking now at each of our businesses, starting with Moody's Investors Service. Total MIS revenue for the quarter was $525 million, down 13% from the prior year period. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted MIS revenue by 1%. U.S. revenue declined 10% to $336 million while non-U.S. revenue of $189 million declined 18% and represented 36% of total ratings revenue. Recurring revenue of $231 million increased 4% and represented 44% of ratings revenue.
Moving now to the lines of business for MIS. First, global corporate finance revenue of $240 million for the quarter was down 20% from the prior year period. This result reflected lower levels of global speculative grade issuance as well as the kind in the number of U.S. investment-grade bond offerings and in the volume of European investment-grade issuance. U.S. corporate finance revenue decreased 10% while non-U.S. revenue decreased 36%.
Second. Global structured finance revenue for the first quarter was $91 million, down 11% from the prior year period. This represented the lowest revenue quarter for structured finance that we have seen in 10 quarters. U.S. securitization activity slowed, primarily within the CMBS and CLL markets, due to widening spreads, regulatory requirements and reduced availability of bank loan collateral. U.S. structured finance revenue was down 15%. Non-U.S. revenue was flat, with a modest increase in Europe.
Third. Global financial institutions revenue of $95 million was up 1% from the prior year period. U.S. financial institutions revenue was down 3% while non-U.S. revenue was up 4%.
Fourth. Global public, project and infrastructure finance revenue of $92 million was down 9% versus the prior year period, as U.S. project finance activity and European infrastructure-related issuance fell amid choppy market conditions. U.S. public, project and infrastructure finance revenue was down 6% while non-U.S. revenue was down 14%.
MIS other, which consists of non-rating revenue from Moody's majority-owned joint venture of interest in ICRA and Korea investors service, contributed $8 million to MIS revenue for the first quarter, flat to the prior year period.
And turning now to Moody's Analytics. Global revenue for MA of $291 million was up 11% from the first quarter of 2015. Excluding revenue from our March 2016 acquisition of GGY, MA revenue grew by 10%. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted MA revenue by 2%. U.S. revenue of $144 million fell [ph] 12% year-over-year, and non-U.S. revenue of $147 million was up 9% and represented 51% of total MA revenue. Recurring revenue of $222 million increased 9% and represented 76% of MA's revenue.
Moving now to the lines of business for MA. First, global research data and analytics or RD&A. Revenue of $165 million was up 10% from the prior year period and represented 57% of total MA revenue. This was mainly due to strong new sales of research and data as well as record customer retention. U.S. RD&A revenue was up 14% while non-U.S. revenue was up 5%.
Second. Global Enterprise Risk Solutions or ERS revenue of $90 million was up 16% from last year, primarily from accelerated project delivery. U.S. ERS revenue was up 14% while non-U.S. revenue was up 17%. Excluding revenue from GGY, ERS revenue grew 13%. 
And as we've noted in the past, due to the variable nature of project timing and completion, ERS revenue remained subject to quarterly volatility. Trailing 12-month sales for ERS increased 1%, reflecting a very difficult comparison with the first quarter of 2015.
Third. Global professional services revenue of $37 million was flat to the prior year period. U.S. professional services revenue was down 6% while non-U.S. revenue was up 3%.
Turning now to expense. Moody's first quarter expense was $512 million, up 4% from 2015. The increase was primarily due to higher compensation costs in MA, reflecting addition headcount required to support business growth as well as Moody's ongoing technology investments. Expenses in MIS were down slightly compared to the prior year period. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted expense by 2%.
As Ray noted, Moody's reported operating margin and adjusted operating margin were 37.3% and 40.9%, respectively, for the first quarter. Moody's effective tax rate for the quarter was 32.3% versus 32.9% for the same period last year. The year-over-year decline was primarily due to a change in New York City tax laws relating to income apportionment.
And now I'll provide an update on capital allocation. During the first quarter of 2016, Moody's returned $334 million to shareholders via share repurchase is an dividends. The company repurchased 2.9 million shares at a total cost of $262 million or an average cost of $89.83 per share and issued 1.6 million shares under its annual employee stock-based compensation plans.
Moody's also paid $72.1 million in dividends during the quarter. And on April 11, announced a quarterly dividend of $0.37 per share of Moody's common stock payable June 10 to stockholders of record at the close of business on May 20.
Outstanding shares as of March 31, 2016, totaled 194.3 million, down 4% from the prior year period. As of March 31, 2016, Moody's had $1.2 billion of share repurchase authority remaining.
At quarter end, Moody's had $3.4 billion of outstanding debt and $1 billion of additional debt capacity available under its revolving credit facility. Total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at quarter end were [ph] $2.1 billion was approximately 73% held outside the U S.
Free cash flow for the first 3 months of 2016 was $211 million, down 13% from the first 3 months of 2015, primarily due to the year-over-year decline in net income and changes in working capital.
And with that, I'll turn the call back to Ray."

I'll conclude this morning's prepared comments by discussing the changes to our full year guidance for 2016. A full list of Moody's guidance is included in our first quarter 2016 earnings press release, which can be found on Moody's Investo",638,"Thanks, Linda. I'll conclude this morning's prepared comments by discussing the changes to our full year guidance for 2016. A full list of Moody's guidance is included in our first quarter 2016 earnings press release, which can be found on Moody's Investor Relations website at ir.moodys.com.
Moody's updated outlook for 2016 is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, corporate profitability and business investment spending, mergers and acquisitions, consumer borrowing and securitization and the amount of debt issued. These assumptions are subject to uncertainty, and results for the year could differ materially from our current outlook. Our guidance assumes foreign currency translation at end of quarter exchange rates. Specifically, our forecast reflects exchange rates for the British pound and the euro at $1.44 to GBP 1 [ph] and $1.14 to EUR 1, respectively.
As I noted earlier, the company now expects 2016 EPS of $4.55 to $4.65, inclusive of $0.02 dilution from the acquisition of GGY.
Moody's full year 2016 revenue is now expected to increase in the low single-digit percent range. In response to this revised revenue outlook, we have lowered our projected base business spending for the year by approximately $50 million through expense management actions and reduced incentive compensation. These savings allow Moody's to maintain guidance for operating expenses to increase in the mid-single-digit percent range, despite the addition of GGY's operating expenses and the negative impact of foreign currency translation. Moody's now projects an operating margin of approximately 41% while adjusted operating margin is still expected to be approximately 45%.
Free cash flow is now expected to be approximately $1 billion. Capital expenditures are now expected to be approximately $125 million.
For MIS, 2016 revenue is now expected to be approximately flat. U.S. revenue is now expected to decrease in the low single-digit percent range while non-U.S. revenue is now expected to increase in the low single-digit percent range.
Corporate finance revenue is now expected to decrease in the low single-digit percent range, reflecting weak issuance in the first quarter as well as expectations for variable issuance activity for the remainder of the year.
Structured finance revenue is now expected to decrease in the mid-single-digit percent range as a result of continued challenges to U.S. securitization activity.
Public, project and infrastructure finance revenue is now expected to increase in the mid-single-digit percent range, which assumes weakness in the first quarter is not offset to the remainder of the year.
For Moody's Analytics, 2016 revenue is now expected to increase in the high single-digit percent range. U.S. revenue is now expected to increase in the low double-digit percent range while non-U.S. revenue is now expected to increase in the mid-single-digit percent range. 
Research, data and analytics revenue is now expected to increase in the high single-digit percent range as a result of new business and an increased customer retention rate. Enterprise risk solutions revenue is now expected to increase in the high single-digit percent range, including revenue associated with the March 2016 acquisition of GGY.
Before we move to the Q&A, I'd like to highlight MIS management change that we announced on April 4t. Effective June 1, 2016, Michel Madelain will retire as President and Chief Operating Officer of MIS and will assume the role of Vice Chairman for MIS and will also remain on the MIS Board of Directors and MIS European boards. Rob Fauber, who's been with Moody's for 11 years, will succeed Michel Maddalena as President of MIS. I'd like to extend my thanks to Michel and congratulate Rob on his new role.
This concludes our prepared remarks, and joining us for the question-and-answer session is Michel Meadowland, President and Chief Operating Officer of MIS; and Mark Almeida, President of Moody's Analytics. We'll be pleased to take any questions you may have."

One is as you pointed out, we feel there's still quite a bit of uncertainty for the remainder of this year at a macro level between [indiscernible] and potential rate for increases in the fact that we saw have some tough comps in the second quarter in particular. We do expect more momentum in the second half of the year than we've had in the first half, and we've already seen improvement in late March and April compared to the very weak beginning to the year in January, February. The other thing I'd point you to though is structured finance, and the conditions for the structured finance market have been very challenged so far this year, and we think that they're going to continue to be challenged, especially in the U.S. There are a number of reasons for this, but it's -- not always is it credit spreads, which can affect the economics of the transaction, but also regulatory requirements that are being implemented and interpreted, and a lot of the market participants are sorting out the appropriate interpretation for new regulatory requirements around risk retention and disclosure of underlying asset information. And that, in combination with a challenging interest rate environment or spread environment and issues around the appropriate availability of collateral in areas such as CLOs, has really impacted our outlook for structured finance in the United States, for not only the first quarter results but our outlook for the remaining 9 months."

You should consider 40% of that is what we've already seen as weakness in the first quarter. 60% of it comes from the rest of the year forecasts. And in terms of that remaining 60%, about 60% of that is a reduction in structured finance and the balance about 40% is in corporate. So that should give you something to work with in terms of what we're seeing. So we've taken it down for the first quarter, but also we've moderated our expectations. The balance back being structure and the remainder being incorporate for the rest of the year."

Can you talk about the cost side on the equation a little bit in more detail? I think in the past, you've done a great job kind of talking about on in absolute dollar base how the trajectory looks like. It seems like you've really now cut all the flex that you have so you should have a pretty good visibility for the second, third and fourth quarter. And if there's any variability to what you're hopefully going to give me now is that basically if revenues actually ended up being a little bit better, some of the negative flex comes back and maybe some of the bonuses come back. And so basically what I'm saying is in a weaker revenue environment, there's not much that's a going to change on the cost side on an absolute basis.

We moved aggressively and we moved hard against that situation. We have taken steps in T&E and most importantly, in hiring. For 2 of the divisions, this excludes Moody's Analytics, we are back to what I would call essential hiring, and we're looking at hiring on a person-by-person basis in terms of backfilling. So really clampdown on that front for 2 of the divisions. Now we can't turn the ship that quickly, and that's the issue. So we often talk about $50 million of expense flex, so we have that in train already. And about half of that is from reduced incentive compensation because we've just taken the guidance down. The other half is from the expense management actions that I spoke about earlier. Now if this gets worse, we have another $50 million, which again is about half a pound between incentive compensation and other expense saving measures that we could take. But as we move into that second $50 million, this does get tougher and we've already taken down our incentive compensation with this first half by about $20 million. So we'll see how we go, and we'll see what we want to do. But we have been very clear about this, and we started these actions again in February, but you're going to have to wait for the rest of the year to see this flow-through. And I'll ask if Ray has any further comment."

Andre, maybe this is a good time for us to talk about what we're hearing from the banks. And again, this is issuance views for both financial and non-financial U.S. dollar issuance and then we'll go over to Europe. So I think you should be able to see a slide that we've put up. Now investment-grade bonds, serious situation. For the first quarter of 2016, $340 billion in issuance, about flat year-over-year. That's good. What was less good is that the deal count, the number of transactions was down by about 20%. Though dollar volume, dollar value, about the same but deal count down, which is not helpful to us. Moving across the column, months to date for April, about $65 [ph] billion and for the full year, we're looking at $1.2 trillion, which is about flat. So right now, for investment-grade, the pipeline is robust. It's good and we expect the market to remain active in the backdrop is stable, and companies are coming out of the blackout. So it looks like there's quite a bit to the right now. So investment-grade, positive the issue here has been the deal count. The going down to high-yield, looking at $40 billion of issuance so far, that's down 60% year-over-year. Month-to-date April, $25 billion. Year-to-date, we're looking at $230 billion, down 15%. The market tone is better this some deals the market there been deals in the market this week. There's one in the market today. It's a Friday, that's unusual. The market tone has improved but the market is still bifurcated SEC in the second point between have and have-nots, the stronger credit is doing better. Red tinning has already happened. We're in about 160 basis points. The question is, is that enough? And if the spreads continue to tighten, we may see some progress. Conversely if they would, now again we may see further backup. So we're going to have to watch that closely. 
Leveraged loans, we see $40 billion in the first quarter, which is down 25% year-over-year. $15 billion month-to-date and $260 billion for the year, which is down 10% year-over-year. So stability in the macro backdrop as you see in the first point is also aiding the leverage loan market. It's weaker than high-yield bond market though because the fund outflows and the slowdown in CLO formation that goes back to the risk retention requirement which can talk a bit more about if you want and some increased fall activity services a bit of a headman.
Now if we go over to Europe, looking at the next slide. Again, these are the views of the banks. Investment-grade in Europe, pipeline is robust and can't pick up further because of the ECB's corporate bond purchasing program. Our exit though in the second point is an uncertainty and that could sideline issuers and be harmful to the summer season, which is traditionally weaker depending on what happens when that will. And you was corporate continues to see that there's mid-value in accessing euro market what we would call reverse Yankee from and we expect that to be a heavy component of supply as it has been and will be, we think, going forward. Sect grade in Europe, the market was muted [indiscernible] down 70%, a volatile first quarter. Again, the ECB's move has sparked a renewed risk appetite and is leading to pick up a high-yield activity in Europe and better spreads again may encourage further issuance. So overall on Europe, the ECB's move make us more optimistic, but it has been a very slow first quarter in Europe.

It's really centered -- our change in outlook for structured finance is really centered on the U S. And within the U.S., it's focused on primarily the CMBS market and the CLO market. As you know from our prior comments in the commercial mortgage-backed securities area, there is a lot of refinancing that needs to occur. Some of that refinancing is occurring outside of securitization, and we are also expecting to see the volume and activity pickup in the third and fourth quarters of this year, because there was very little conduit lending early in this year and the conduits have increased their financing, but it will take some months for that to feed into CMBS.
In the CLO area, it's -- the market dealing with both the risk retention requirements and the interpretations for other regulatory requirements that having to do with transparency around underlying assets. And the suitability of the collateral itself. So assuming that we see the market sort out how it is going to meet the new regulatory requirements and the suitability of collateral, again, we could see a pickup in CLOs later in the year. Pipelines are not bad. As a matter of fact, in Europe, pipeline is up quite substantially. And so some of the issues that we're seeing in the U.S. are being partially offset by the international business, but it's still not enough to allow us to come anywhere close to holding our original guidance"

As I'd said previously, high-yield bond issuance down 60% in the first quarter is a pretty heavy hit. Leveraged loans, down 25% also is a pretty heavy hit. So you had the risk off mode happening, you had oil prices collapsing, concerns about China and growth concerns. So we went through a pretty heavy risk off phase there, which is now starting to write itself. So generally around here we're okay if we have one segment of but having corporate hit hard as well as having structured, having had the worst quarter it's had in 10 quarters, we frankly didn't see that. Now as Ray said, that is what we would view as a cyclical issue in structure until the participants in that market figure out how to deal with some of the different conditions. And we'll -- we do think that, that situation will ease as we go into the end of the year. But I don't think we expect to the total risk off environment in the first quarter. We were thoughtful, but it was worse than we thought. And as we said, there are a number of factors that make the rest of the year a little bit tricky to predict.

You're correct, we have seen slower activity in our rating assessment service, coincident with reduced activity in issuance. As far as the cyclicality of the conditions, clearly in the corporate sector, this is cyclical. There are significant refinancing walls that begin to build in 2017 and really build for several years after that. So we're going to see a large amount of activity associated with refinancing. M&A, there had been some bumps in the road with M&A, but it has been strong for a while. And to the extent that we're in a low-growth environment, that has and probably will continue to encourage M&A. Where we see the erosion in M&A driven, that is at least at the margins around some of the tax-driven deals and things of that sort. So really I view the corporate story as being very much a cyclical story with a significant refinancing wall coming upon us beginning next year. On the structured finance again, I think it's largely cyclical. But we have to watch and see how the market deals with new requirements and what economically the market determines make sense. So that's an area to keep our collective eye on in terms of how much of it is cyclical and whether there are some structural changes to that market."

So that would probably be the reason while we're seeing a slight reduction in voluntary turnover. Now for incentive compensation, let's talk about that. We have started the year with 100% of our bonus target being set up to $4.80 we had previously seen for guidance. We pulled that down to $4.60. And as a result of that, we have taken down our incentive compensation. For example, for the first quarter last year, incentive compensation was $38 million and this year in the first quarter, it's come down to $32 million. So we pulled down incentive compensation, pretty hard to deal with this new lower forecasts. And if we're not going to hit our numbers, the employees are not paid as well. That's just the way it goes. In terms of $32 million number, we would see that it will ramp a bit as we go into the fourth quarter if things go right. But if we do considerably better than the 4 60 we're predicting, now, Joe you would expect that we would take incentive compensation back up.

In this first quarter of '16, in fact, expenses increased 4% over '15 and you might want to ask why that was. The majority of that growth was to continue to grow in Moody's Analytics, which as you can see is performing beautifully. So MA expenses grew 9%, which reported revenue growth, which was even greater. MIS expenses though were slightly down, and of course we're trying to match the expense support for the revenue growth in the business, and we can't do that instantaneously. Most of the $50 million that we have already put in process on expense management will come from shared services. That's the support part of the business, which I run for the most part; and then also to MIS. Moody's Analytics is performing well, and we will continue to invest in it. And its compensation view will be slightly different perhaps than the rest of the corporation if it performs according to its target, which through the first quarter, it has and even better, its incentive compensation would be at target or perhaps even higher. So we're being very cautious to match what we're doing here with where we're seeing growth. And the further reason for the growth in that incentive compensation for the first quarter year-over-year was because of some of the additions that we made in headcount last year and that some of the things we'd already started at the very beginning of '16. We had a very good handle on that right now. And of course, we did see the acquisition of GGY, which added some expense and we continue to make prudent technology investments. But this is very carefully planned expense management where we needed to support the growth areas, and we're throttling back on those areas, particularly the support areas where we can do that.

IFRS 9 we think is going to be a very nice growth driver for the business. We actually think that the prospect for IFRS 9 is probably richer for us than what we've gotten from stress testing because it's applicable to many, many more institutions all over the world. So we're very optimistic about IFRS 9. It's still early days frankly for that initiative. We've had some success thus far, we have a good pipeline and we have big expectations for what we can do there. But you're absolutely right, we had good strength across MA in the first quarter. really very broad-based strength for Moody's Analytics. On a constant dollar basis, every region was up double digits organically. So we feel that the business is just performing very well, and demand for the things that we're doing continues to be very strong. So we're thinking up guidance in ERS because of the GGY acquisition, but we've also taken up guidance in RD&A, just reflecting strong underlying growth in the business."

So I was a little surprised that only roughly 25% of the annual buyback rate occurred in the first quarter. Is there -- was there something kind of stopping you from -- or do the formula not come out was more aggressive by batch in that quarter? And is this something that maybe we could increase that number if there's an attractive opportunity with the price in the second quarter or third quarter?

So we started out spreading our money pro rata across the year. Now we had some heavy tearing a place and when the stock price fell to 78, we were able to buy back more shares quite cheaply. And in fact, we were at $89 in change per average for purchase price in the first quarter. Until yesterday, the stock was in the high 90s and $100. So we felt pretty good about that. We have to see where we want to go with that allocation over the rest of the year.

I'll start with the corporate sector, and we'll start with investment grade and we're looking at Q1 2016 compared to 2015. So for investment grade in 2016, we had $66 million of revenue from investment grade. That was 28% of the total for CFG, which is $240 million. Last year, we had $87 million in investment grade and $298 million in corporate. So the percentage have stayed about the same at 28%. That grade is where the story is. For the first quarter, this year, we had $30.3 million. That is less than half of last year's $62.7 million. And this year, we're looking at set grade being 13% of the total. Bank loans down a bit, $41.3 million versus $44.5 million last year and 17% of the total and other, about flat, 102.6; and 43% of the total for CFG. Going to structured, again, quarter-over-quarter '16 versus '16. ABS, asset-backed securities, pretty close, about $20 million for the first quarter this year versus $21 million last year; percentage is about flat at 22%; RMBS also not that much movement in fact, it was up in the first quarter of 2016 to almost $21 million versus about $18 million last year. Percentage was up to 23%. Commercial real estate here again was where we saw the more dramatic difference, about [ph] $28 million in the first quarter of this year versus $33 million last year. Percentage is about 31% this year. Structured credit also a more dramatic change, $22 million this year versus almost $29 million last year and 24% of the total. So that's the story in structured. FIG -- not too much difference in FIG. Total $95 million for the first quarter of '16, about flat to last year's, about $94 million. FIG does not move around as much as the other line. So for banks, we're about $59 million, last year was about $63 million. Percentage is about 62%. Insurance did perform better. We're close to $30 million in insurance versus $25 million last year. That's 31% of the FIG total. Managed investment's about $4 million flat to last year in dollar and percent. Other, also flat in dollar and percent to about $2.5 million and 3%. And PPIF, again this was another less than pleasant surprise. Last year in the first quarter, PPIF in 2015 did $100 million. This year, we have a little bit less than $92 million. So PFG sovereigns is about $55 million, about flat to last year's $56 million. Projects and infrastructures is where we saw some weakness, about 36.5 versus last year's 44.5. So that's about 40% of the PPIF line and about an 18% decline, which was obviously not helpful. Then the other line is negligible for PPIF. So again PPIF in total, down 9% year-over-year. So we had 3 out of 4 of the businesses having some challenges with corporate down the most in dollar and percent terms. Structured, which is our second FIG of business, so off and then PPIF, off 9% as well with banking about the same. So again, if we had one of these engines had a bit of a challenge, we can usually figure it out, make it up somewhere else but 3 out of 4 MIS engine's down. That's a little bit tricky and so you see the results in the quarter number."

It's a subscription business and so having sales come in a bit stronger than we expected, that's going to result in more revenue as it gets recognized for the full year in 2016. And it was a combination of a number of things. Customer retention continues to improve, so we got a little bit of a bump from that. New sales production has been very strong, so that contributed. Pricing has been good. So I guess, on the RD&A side, one way to say it is we're firing on all cylinders. We're just -- we're doing quite well there and as I mentioned earlier, we're doing well all over the world. So the business is just quite strong and it added to the expectation for the year and prompted us to just move the guidance up."

We'll wait and see to what the end of the year looks like but yes, we could potentially put on a little bit more debt. We're watching the markets very closely. Your point is very good that we have a private placement with a particularly high coupon coming due in '17 and we're running the breakevens on that right now and we'll take a look at that. If we do decide to move toward the end of the year, that may or may not be included depending on what the breakeven looks like. But we're marching the markets carefully. But since we did $300 million more in the fourth quarter, in November, as I just said, I think if we do anything, it might be more weighted toward the back half of the year. Our cash position is fine to continue with our share repurchase, and we'll continue to run our plans this week as we have guided."

We received a question why did we deal with our guidance right now on the first quarter call. That's a little bit early for us. Part of the reason why we did that is a change in guidance triggers the reduction in incentive compensation for us. In other words, we've just taken out about close to $20 million in incentive compensation for the first quarter and the rest of the year. That is the result of our pulling down the guidance. So we will look at now how we perform according to where we are with the midpoint being $4.60. So the next thing that would happen on $50 million is will be about evenly split between another $25 million in incentive compensation, if our performance is weaker than we expect now, and other some other cost cuts that we can make. We probably need to keep with some essential hiring, less so in shared services, but certainly in MIS. We'd like Mark to continue with his hirings plans in MA because they're doing really well as he's outlined. And we've got to be thoughtful about what we're doing with our technology spend. Projects that we could postpone or dial back, I think we've largely done that. We're taking another path through that. But again, there are certain things that we need to do around here and it gets harder with the second pass. Again, we've had tough conditions in the first quarter. We view that as cyclical. We have better coverage proportionately in structured finance, which has been hit hard in the first quarter and we're waiting to see what happens for the rest of the year. So we think we're being prudent and incentive compensation is what we're going to do in order to keep the margin from being hit. Now we've moved the margin guidance down from about 42 to about 41, so we are holding the margin for the most part down 100 bps perhaps in the guidance. But the first hit goes to incentive compensation and we would like the shareholders to note that this my intention to hold the margin at about 41%, which is still pretty healthy. So hope that helps in terms your questions, Tim. If I missed anything, let me know."

Linda will follow with additional financial detail and operating highlights. I will then conclude with comments about our updated outlook for 2016. After our prepared remarks, we'll be happy to respond to your questions.
In the first quarter of 2016, reduced global bond issuance weighed on Moody's financial performance despite Moody's Investors Services, consistent market coverage and additional ratings mandates as well as strong results at Moody's Analytics, which is not sensitive to debt issuance activity.
Overall revenue for Moody's Corporation of $816 million declined 6%. Operating expense for the first quarter was $512 million, up 4% from the first quarter of 2015. Operating income was $304 million, an 18% decline from the prior-year period. The impact of foreign currency translation on operating income was negligible. Adjusted operating income, defined as operating income before depreciation and amortization, was $334 million, down 16% from the same period last year. Operating margin for the first quarter of 2016 was 37.3%. The adjusted operating margin was 40.9%. Diluted earnings per share of $0.93 was down 16% from the prior-year period.
Given market conditions, we have scaled back our revenue and earnings expectations for full year 2016, and are managing our cost base accordingly. Our 2016 EPS guidance is now $4.55 to $4.65.
Before I turn the call over to Linda, I'd like to highlight 2 investments we made in the first quarter. In March, Moody's Analytics announced the acquisition of GGY, a leading provider of actuarial software for the life insurance industry. The addition of GGY's products and specialized expertise accelerates MA's extension into financial risk management for life insurers, complementing our already strong position with global banks. As part of the enterprise risk solutions line of business, GGY will contribute to MA's regulatory solvency and capital management solutions.
We also announced the minority investment in Finagraph, a provider of cloud-enabled automated financial data collection and business intelligence solutions for private entities. This investment underscores Moody's commitment to innovative financial technologies to better address the needs of our customers. Finagraph's information and analytical solutions represent important advances in bank's risk assessments of small and medium-sized businesses, thus improving access to credit for this underserved segment of the market.
I'll now turn the call over to Linda to provide further commentary on our financial results and other updates."

I'll begin with revenue at the company level. As Ray mentioned, Moody's total revenue for the first quarter declined 6% to $816 million. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted revenue by 2%. U.S. revenue of $480 million was down 4%",995,"Thanks, Ray. I'll begin with revenue at the company level. As Ray mentioned, Moody's total revenue for the first quarter declined 6% to $816 million. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted revenue by 2%. U.S. revenue of $480 million was down 4% from the first quarter of 2015. Non-U.S. revenue of $336 million was down 8% and represented 41% of Moody's total revenue. Recurring revenue of $452 million increased by 7% and represented 55% of total revenue.
Looking now at each of our businesses, starting with Moody's Investors Service. Total MIS revenue for the quarter was $525 million, down 13% from the prior-year period. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted MIS revenue by 1%. U.S. revenue declined 10% to $336 million, while non-U.S. revenue of $189 million declined 18% and represented 36% of total ratings revenue. Recurring revenue of $231 million increased 4% and represented 44% of ratings revenue.
Moving now to the lines of business for MIS. First, Global Corporate Finance revenue of $240 million for the quarter was down 20% from the prior-year period. This result reflected lower levels of global speculative grade issuance as well as declines in the number of U.S. investment-grade bond offerings and in the volume of European investment-grade issuance. U.S. Corporate Finance revenue decreased 10%, while non-U.S. revenue decreased 36%.
Second, Global Structured Finance revenue for the first quarter was $91 million, down 11% from the prior-year period. This represented the lowest revenue quarter for structured finance that we have seen in 10 quarters. U.S. securitization activity slowed, primarily within the CMBS and CLO markets, due to widening spreads, regulatory requirements and reduced availability of bank loan collaterals. U.S. Structured Finance revenue was down 15%. Non-U.S. revenue was flat, with a modest increase in Europe.
Third, Global Financial Institutions revenue of $95 million was up 1% from the prior-year period. U.S. Financial Institutions revenue was down 3%, while non-U.S. revenue was up 4%.
Fourth, Global Public, Project and Infrastructure finance revenue of $92 million was down 9% versus the prior-year period, as U.S. project finance activity and European infrastructure-related issuance fell amid choppy market conditions. U.S. Public, Project and Infrastructure finance revenue was down 6%, while non-U.S. revenue was down 14%.
MIS other, which consists of non-rating revenue from Moody's majority-owned joint venture of interest in ICRA and Korea Investors Service, contributed $8 million to MIS revenue for the first quarter, flat to the prior-year period.
And turning now to Moody's Analytics. Global revenue for MA of $291 million was up 11% from the first quarter of 2015. Excluding revenue from our March 2016 acquisition of GGY, MA revenue grew by 10%. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted MA revenue by 2%. U.S. revenue of $144 million was up 12% year-over-year, and non-U.S. revenue of $147 million was up 9% and represented 51% of total MA revenue. Recurring revenue of $222 million increased 9% and represented 76% of MA's revenue.
Moving now to the lines of business for MA. First, Global Research, Data and Analytics, or RD&A. Revenue of $165 million was up 10% from the prior-year period and represented 57% of total MA revenue. This was mainly due to strong new sales of research and data as well as record customer retention. U.S. RD&A revenue was up 14%, while non-U.S. revenue was up 5%.
Second, Global Enterprise Risk Solutions, or ERS, revenue of $90 million was up 16% from last year, primarily from accelerated project delivery. U.S. ERS revenue was up 14%, while non-U.S. revenue was up 17%. Excluding revenue from GGY, ERS revenue grew 13%. 
And as we've noted in the past, due to the variable nature of project timing and completion, ERS revenue remained subject to quarterly volatility. Trailing 12-month sales for ERS increased 1%, reflecting a very difficult comparison with the first quarter of 2015.
Third, Global Professional Services revenue of $37 million was flat to the prior-year period. U.S. Professional Services revenue was down 6%, while non-U.S. revenue was up 3%.
Turning now to expense. Moody's first quarter expense was $512 million, up 4% from 2015. The increase was primarily due to higher compensation costs in MA, reflecting additional headcount required to support business growth as well as Moody's ongoing technology investments. Expenses in MIS were down slightly compared to the prior-year period. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted expense by 2%.
As Ray noted, Moody's reported operating margin and adjusted operating margin were 37.3% and 40.9%, respectively, for the first quarter. Moody's effective tax rate for the quarter was 32.3% versus 32.9% for the same period last year. The year-over-year decline was primarily due to a change in New York City tax law, relating to income apportionment.
And now, I'll provide an update on capital allocation. During the first quarter of 2016, Moody's returned $334 million to shareholders via share repurchase and dividends. The company repurchased 2.9 million shares at a total cost of $262 million on an average cost of $89.83 per share and issued 1.6 million shares under its annual employee stock-based compensation plans.
Moody's also paid $72.1 million in dividends during the quarter, and on April 11, announced a quarterly dividend of $0.37 per share of Moody's common stock, payable June 10, to stockholders of record at the close of business on May 20.
Outstanding shares as of March 31, 2016, totaled 194.3 million, down 4% from the prior-year period. As of March 31, 2016, Moody's had $1.2 billion of share repurchase authority remaining.
At quarter end, Moody's had $3.4 billion of outstanding debt and $1 billion of additional debt capacity available under its revolving credit facility. Total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at quarter end were $2.1 billion, was approximately 73% held outside the U.S.
Free cash flow for the first 3 months of 2016 was $211 million, down 13% from the first 3 months of 2015, primarily due to the year-over-year decline in net income and changes in working capital.

I'll conclude this morning's prepared comments by discussing the changes to our full year guidance for 2016. A full list of Moody's guidance is included in our first quarter 2016 earnings press release, which can be found on Moody's Investo",636,"Thanks, Linda. I'll conclude this morning's prepared comments by discussing the changes to our full year guidance for 2016. A full list of Moody's guidance is included in our first quarter 2016 earnings press release, which can be found on Moody's Investor Relations website, at ir.moodys.com.
Moody's updated outlook for 2016 is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, corporate profitability and business investment spending, mergers and acquisitions, consumer borrowing and securitization and the amount of debt issued. These assumptions are subject to uncertainty, and results for the year could differ materially from our current outlook. Our guidance assumes foreign currency translation at end-of-quarter exchange rates. Specifically, our forecast reflects exchange rates for the British pound and the euro at $1.44 to GBP 1 and $1.14 to EUR 1, respectively.
As I noted earlier, the company now expects 2016 EPS of $4.55 to $4.65, inclusive of $0.02 dilution from the acquisition of GGY.
Moody's full year 2016 revenue is now expected to increase in the low single-digit percent range. In response to this revised revenue outlook, we have lowered our projected base business spending for the year by approximately $50 million through expense management actions and reduced incentive compensation. These savings allow Moody's to maintain guidance for operating expenses to increase in the mid-single-digit percent range, despite the addition of GGY's operating expenses and the negative impact of foreign currency translation. Moody's now projects an operating margin of approximately 41%, while adjusted operating margin is still expected to be approximately 45%.
Free cash flow is now expected to be approximately $1 billion. Capital expenditures are now expected to be approximately $125 million.
For MIS, 2016 revenue is now expected to be approximately flat. U.S. revenue is now expected to decrease in the low single-digit percent range, while non-U.S. revenue is now expected to increase in the low single-digit percent range.
Corporate Finance revenue is now expected to decrease in the low single-digit percent range, reflecting weak issuance in the first quarter as well as expectations for variable issuance activity for the remainder of the year.
Structured Finance revenue is now expected to decrease in the mid-single-digit percent range as a result of continued challenges to U.S. securitization activity.
Public, Project and Infrastructure finance revenue is now expected to increase in the mid-single-digit percent range, which assumes weakness in the first quarter is not offset to the remainder of the year.
For Moody's Analytics, 2016 revenue is now expected to increase in the high single-digit percent range. U.S. revenue is now expected to increase in the low double-digit percent range, while non-U.S. revenue is now expected to increase in the mid-single-digit percent range. 
Research, Data and Analytics revenue is now expected to increase in the high single-digit percent range as a result of new business and an increased customer retention rate. 
Enterprise Risk Solutions revenue is now expected to increase in the high single-digit percent range, including revenue associated with the March 2016 acquisition of GGY.
Before we move to the Q&A, I'd like to highlight MIS management change that we announced on April 4. Effective June 1, 2016, Michel Madelain will retire as President and Chief Operating Officer of MIS and will assume the role of Vice Chairman for MIS and will also remain on the MIS Board of Directors and MIS European boards. Rob Fauber, who has been with Moody's for 11 years, will succeed Michel Madelain as President of MIS. I'd like to extend my thanks to Michel and congratulate Rob on his new role.
This concludes our prepared remarks, and joining us for the question-and-answer session is Michel Madelain, President and Chief Operating Officer of MIS; and Mark Almeida, President of Moody's Analytics. We'll be pleased to take any questions you may have."

At a high level, Alex, I would point to 2 things. One is as you pointed out, we feel there is still quite a bit of uncertainty for the remainder of this year at a macro level, between Brexit and the potential for interest rate increases and the fact that we still have some tough comps in the second quarter in particular. We do expect more momentum in the second half of the year than we've had in the first half, and we've already seen improvement in late March and April compared to the very weak beginning to the year in January and February. The other thing I'd point you to, though, is structured finance, and the conditions for the structured finance market have been very challenged so far this year, and we think that they're going to continue to be challenged, especially in the U.S. This -- there are a number of reasons for this, but it's -- not always is it credit spreads, which can affect the economics of the transaction, but also regulatory requirements that are being implemented and interpreted, and a lot of the market participants are sorting out the appropriate interpretation for new regulatory requirements around risk retention and disclosure of underlying asset information. And that, in combination with a challenging interest rate environment or spread environment and issues around the appropriate availability of collateral in areas such as CLOs, has really impacted our outlook for structured finance in the United States, for not only the first quarter results, but our outlook for the remaining 9 months."

You should consider 40% of that is what we've already seen as weakness in the first quarter. 60% of it comes from the rest of the year forecasts. And in terms of that remaining 60%, about 60% of that is a reduction in structured finance and the balance, about 40%, is in corporate. So that should give you something to work with in terms of what we're seeing. So we've taken it down for the first quarter, but also we've moderated our expectations. The balance that being structured and the remainder being incorporated for the rest of the year."

I think in the past, you've done a great job kind of talking on an absolute dollar base and how the trajectory looks like. And it seems like you've really now cut all the flex that you have. So you should probably have a pretty good visibility for the second, third and fourth quarter. And then, if there's any variability to what you're hopefully going to give me now, is it basically if revenues actually end up being a little bit better, some of the negative flex comes back and maybe some of the bonuses come back. And so basically, what I'm saying is, in a weaker revenue environment, there's not much that's going to change on the cost side on an absolute basis.

We moved aggressively and we moved hard against that situation. We have taken steps in T&E, and most importantly, in hiring. For 2 of the divisions, this excludes Moody's Analytics, we are back to what I would call essential hiring, and we're looking at hiring on a person-by-person basis in terms of backfilling. So really clamped down on that front for 2 of the divisions. Now we can't turn the ship that quickly, and that's the issue. So we often talk about $50 million of expense flex. So we have that in train already. And about half of that is from reduced incentive compensation, because we've just taken the guidance down. The other half is from the expense management actions that I spoke about earlier. Now if this gets worse, we have another $50 million, which again is split, about half and half, between incentive compensation and other expense saving measures that we could take. But as we move into that second $50 million, this does get tougher and we've already taken down our incentive compensation with this first half by about $20 million. So we'll see how we go, and we'll see what we want to do. But we have been very clear about this. And we started these actions again in February, but you're going to have to wait for the rest of the year to see this flow through. And I'll ask if Ray has any further comment."

Andre, maybe this is a good time for us to talk about what we're hearing from the banks. And again, this is issuance views for both financial and non-financial U.S. dollar issuance, and then we'll go over to Europe. So I think you should be able to see a slide that we've put up. Now investment-grade bonds, serious situation. For the first quarter of 2016, $340 billion in issuance, about flat year-over-year. That's good. What was less good is that the deal count, the number of transactions was down by about 20%. Though dollar volume, dollar value, about the same, but deal count is down, which is not helpful to us. Moving across the column, month-to-date for April, about $65 billion, and for the full year, we're looking at $1.2 trillion, which is about flat. So right now, for investment grade, the pipeline is robust. It's good, and we expect the market to remain active and the backdrop is stable, and companies are coming out of blackouts. So it looks like there's quite a bit to do right now. So investment grade, positive. The issue here has been the deal count. Going down to high yield, looking at $40 billion of issuance so far, that's down 60% year-over-year. Month-to-date April, $25 billion. Year-to-date, we're looking at $230 billion, down 15%. The market tone is better. There are some deals in the market -- there have been deals in the market this week. There's one in the market today. It's a Friday, that's unusual. The market tone has improved, but the market is still bifurcated, as you see in the second point, between haves and have-nots. The stronger credits are doing better. Red tightening has already happened. We're in about 160 basis points. The question is, is that enough? And if spreads continue to tighten, we may see some progress. Conversely if they widen out again, we may see further backup. So we're going to have to watch that closely. Leveraged loans, we see $40 billion in the first quarter, which is down 25% year-over-year, $15 billion month-to-date and $260 billion for the year, which is down 10% year-over-year. So stability in the macro backdrop, as you see in the first point, is also aiding the leveraged loan market. It's weaker than high-yield bond market though, because the fund outflows and the slowdown in CLO formation that goes back to the risk retention requirements, which we can talk a bit more about, if you want, and some increased fall activity services are a bit of a headwind. Now if we go over to Europe, looking at the next slide. Again, these are the views of the banks. Investment grade in Europe, pipeline is robust and can pick up further because of the ECB's corporate bond purchasing program. Brexit though, in the second point, is an uncertainty and that could sideline issuers and be harmful to the summer season, which is traditionally weaker, depending on what happens with that growth. And U.S. corporate continues to see that there is good value in accessing euro market, what we would call Reverse Yankee, and we expect that to be a heavy component of supply, as it has been and will be, we think, going forward. Spec grade in Europe, the market was muted. The supply was down 70%, a very volatile first quarter. Again, the ECB's move has sparked a renewed risk appetite and is leading to pick up in high-yield activity in Europe and tighter spreads again may encourage further issuance. So overall on Europe, the ECB's move makes us more optimistic, but it has been a very slow first quarter in Europe. I think the overall view on the more speculative asset classes across the world would be, keep an eye on spreads as they continue to tighten. We may see the outlook improve, and conversely if they widen, particularly as we go into the Brexit road, that will be detrimental. So hope that's helpful to you, Andre."

And within the U.S., it's focused on, primarily, the CMBS market and the CLO market. As you know from our prior comments in the commercial mortgage-backed securities area, there is a lot of refinancing that needs to occur. Some of that refinancing is occurring outside of securitization, and we are also expecting to see the volume and activity pick up in the third and fourth quarters of this year, because there was very little conduit lending early in this year and the conduits have increased their financing, but it will take some months for that to feed into CMBS.
In the CLO area, it's -- the market dealing with both the risk retention requirements and the interpretations for other regulatory requirements that having to do with transparency around underlying assets, and the suitability of the collateral itself. So assuming that we see the market sort out how it is going to meet the new regulatory requirements and the suitability of collateral, again, we could see a pickup in CLOs later in the year. Pipelines are not bad. As a matter of fact, in Europe, pipeline is up quite substantially. And so some of the issues that we're seeing in the U.S. are being partially offset by the international business, but it's still not enough to allow us to come anywhere close to holding our original guidance."

So you had the risk-off mode happening, you had oil prices collapsing, concerns about China and growth concerns. So we went through a pretty heavy risk-off phase there, which is now starting to write itself. So generally around here, we're okay if we have one segment off, but having corporate hit hard as well as having structured, having had the worst quarter it's had in 10 quarters, we frankly didn't see that. Now as Ray said, that is what we would view as a cyclical issue in structured until the participants in that market figure out how to deal with some of these different conditions. And we'll -- we do think that, that situation will ease as we go into the end of the year. But I don't think we expect to the total risk-off environment in the first quarter.

We have seen slower activity in our rating assessment service, coincident with reduced activity in issuance. As far as the cyclicality of the conditions, clearly in the corporate sector, this is cyclical. There are significant refinancing walls that begin to build in 2017 and really build for several years after that. So we're going to see a large amount of activity associated with refinancing. M&A, there had been some bumps in the road with M&A, but it has been strong for a while. And to the extent that we're in a low-growth environment, that has and probably will continue to encourage M&A. Where we see the erosion in M&A-driven debt is at least at the margins around some of the tax-driven deals and things of that sort. So really, I view the corporate story as being very much a cyclical story with a significant refinancing wall coming upon us beginning next year. On the structured finance side, again, I think it's largely cyclical. But we have to watch and see how the market deals with new requirements and what economically the market determines make sense. So that's an area to keep our collective eye on, in terms of how much of it is cyclical and whether there are some structural changes to that market."

If one is looking for a job in the financial sector right now, particularly if one is looking for a job in the banking sector, that's a pretty challenging place to look at this point in time. So that would probably be the reason why we're seeing a slight reduction in voluntary turnover. Now for incentive compensation, let's talk about that. We had started the year with 100% of our bonus targets being set up to $4.80 we had previously seen for guidance. We pulled that down to $4.60. And as a result of that, we have taken down our incentive compensation. For example, for the first quarter last year, incentive compensation was $38 million and this year in the first quarter, it's come down to $32 million. So we pulled down incentive compensation pretty hard to deal with this new lower forecast. And if we're not going to hit our numbers, the employees are not paid as well, that's just the way it goes. In terms of $32 million number, we would see that it will ramp a bit as we go into the fourth quarter if things go right. But if we do considerably better than the $4.60 we're predicting, now, Joe, you would expect that we would take incentive compensation back up. So $4.80 was a 100% and $4.60 is below that so we've cut incentive comp accordingly."

In this first quarter of '16, in fact, expenses increased 4% over '15 and you might want to ask why that was. The majority of that growth was to continue to grow corporate growth in Moody's Analytics, which as you can see is performing beautifully. So MA expenses grew 9%, which reported revenue growth, which was even greater. MIS expenses though were slightly down. And of course we're trying to match the expense support for the revenue growth in the business, and we can't do that instantaneously. Most of the $50 million that we have already put in process on expense management will come from shared services, that's the support part of the business, which I run for the most part; and then also to MIS. Moody's Analytics is performing well, and we will continue to invest in it. And its compensation view will be slightly different perhaps than the rest of the corporation if it performs according to its targets, which through the first quarter, it has and even better, its incentive compensation would be at target or perhaps even higher. So we're being very cautious to match what we're doing here with where we're seeing growth. And the further reason for the growth in that incentive compensation for the first quarter year-over-year was because of some of the additions that we made in headcount last year and that some of the things we'd already started at the very beginning of '16. We had a very good handle on that right now. And of course, we did see the acquisition of GGY, which added some expense and we continue to make prudent technology investments. But this is very carefully planned expense management where we needed to support the growth areas, and we're throttling back on those areas, particularly the support areas, where we can do that.

I'll start with the corporate sector, and we'll start with investment grade and we're looking at Q1 2016 compared to 2015. So for investment grade in 2016, we had $66 million of revenue from investment grade, that was 28% of the total for CFG, which is $240 million. Last year, we had $87 million in investment grade and $298 million in corporate. So the percentage have stayed about the same at 28%. That grade is where the story is. For the first quarter, this year, we had $30.3 million, that is less than half of last year's $62.7 million. And this year, we're looking at spec-grade being 13% of the total. Bank loans down a bit, $41.3 million versus $44.5 million last year and 17% of the total and other, about flat, 102.6; and 43% of the total for CFG. Going to structured, again, quarter-over-quarter '16 versus '15. ABS, asset-backed securities, pretty close, about $20 million for the first quarter this year versus $21 million last year; percentage is about flat at 22%; RMBS also not that much movement. In fact, it was up in the first quarter of 2016 to almost $21 million versus about $18 million last year. Percentage was up to 23%. Commercial real estate here again was where we saw a more dramatic difference, $28 million in the first quarter of this year versus $33 million last year. Percentage is about 31% this year. Structured credit also a more dramatic change, $22 million this year versus almost $29 million last year and 24% of the total. So that's the story in structured. FIG, not too much difference in FIG. Total of $95 million for the first quarter of '16, about flat to last year's, about $94 million. FIG does not move around as much as the other line. So for banks, we're about $59 million, last year was about $63 million. Percentage is about 62%. Insurance did perform better. We're close to $30 million in insurance versus $25 million last year, that's 31% of the FIG total. Managed investment's about $4 million flat to last year in dollar and percent. Other, also flat in dollar and percent to about $2.5 million and 3%. And PPIF, again this was another less than pleasant surprise. Last year in the first quarter, PPIF in 2015 did $100 million. This year, we have a little bit less than $92 million. So PFG sovereigns is about $55 million, about flat to last year's $56 million. Projects and infrastructure is where we saw some weakness, about 36.5 versus last year's 44.5. So that's about 40% of the PPIF line and about an 18% decline, which was obviously not helpful. Then the other line is negligible for PPIF. So again PPIF in total, down 9% year-over-year. So we had 3 out of 4 of the businesses having some challenges with corporates down the most in dollar and percent terms. Structured, which is our second biggest business, fell off, and then PPIF, off 9% as well, with banking about the same. So again, if we have one or -- one of these engines have a bit of a challenge, we can usually figure it out, and make it up somewhere else, but 3 out of 4 of the MIS engine is down, that's a little bit tricky. And so you see the results in the quarter numbers."

We received a question why did we deal with our guidance right now on the first quarter call, that's a little bit early for us. Part of the reason why we did that is a change in guidance triggers the reduction in incentive compensation for us. In other words, we've just taken out about close to $20 million in incentive compensation for the first quarter and the rest of the year, that is the result of our pulling down the guidance. So we will look at now how we perform according to where we are with the midpoint being $4.60. So the next thing that would happen on $50 million is, we'd be about evenly split between another $25 million in incentive compensation, if our performance is weaker than we expect now, and some other cost cuts that we could make. We probably need to keep with some essential hiring, less so in shared services, but certainly in MIS. We'd like Mark to continue with his hiring plans in MA because they're doing really well as he's outlined. And we've got to be thoughtful about what we're doing with our technology spend. Projects that we could postpone or dial back, I think we've largely done that. We're taking another pass through that. But again, there are certain things that we need to do around here and it gets harder with the second pass. Again, we've had tough conditions in the first quarter. We view that as cyclical. We have better coverage proportionately in structured finance, which has been hit hard in the first quarter and we're waiting to see what happens for the rest of the year. So we think we're being prudent and incentive compensation is what we're going to do in order to keep the margin from being hit. Now we've moved the margin guidance down from about 42% to about 41%,  so we are holding the margin for the most part down 100 bps perhaps in the guidance. But the first hit goes to incentive compensation. And we would like the shareholders to note that it is our intention to hold the margin at about 41%, which is still pretty healthy. I hope that helps in terms of your questions, Tim. If I missed anything, let me know."

After our prepared remarks, we'll be happy to respond to your questions.
In the first quarter of 2016, reduced global bond issuance weighed on Moody's financial performance despite Moody's Investors Services' consistent market coverage and additional ratings mandates as well as strong results at Moody's Analytics, which is not sensitive to debt issuance activity.
Overall revenue for Moody's Corporation of $816 million declined 6%. Operating expense for the first quarter was $512 million, up 4% from the first quarter of 2015. Operating income was $304 million, an 18% decline from the prior-year period. The impact of foreign currency translation on operating income was negligible. Adjusted operating income, defined as operating income before depreciation and amortization, was $334 million, down 16% from the same period last year. Operating margin for the first quarter of 2016 was 37.3%. The adjusted operating margin was 40.9%. Diluted earnings per share of $0.93 was down 16% from the prior-year period.
Given market conditions, we have scaled back our revenue and earnings expectations for full year 2016, and are managing our cost base accordingly. Our 2016 EPS guidance is now $4.55 to $4.65.
Before I turn the call over to Linda, I'd like to highlight 2 investments we made in the first quarter. In March, Moody's Analytics announced the acquisition of GGY, a leading provider of actuarial software for the life insurance industry. The addition of GGY's products and specialized expertise accelerates MA's extension into financial risk management for life insurers, complementing our already strong position with global banks. As part of the enterprise risk solutions line of business, GGY will contribute to MA's regulatory solvency and capital management solutions.
We also announced the minority investment in Finagraph, a provider of cloud-enabled automated financial data collection and business intelligence solutions for private entities. This investment underscores Moody's commitment to innovative financial technologies to better address the needs of our customers. Finagraph's information and analytical solutions represent important advances in banks' risk assessments of small and medium-sized businesses, thus improving access to credit for this underserved segment of the market.
I'll now turn the call over to Linda to provide further commentary on our financial results and other updates."

I'll begin with revenue at the company level. As Ray mentioned, Moody's total revenue for the first quarter declined 6% to $816 million.

As Ray mentioned, Moody's total revenue for the first quarter declined 6% to $816 million. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted revenue by 2%. U.S. revenue of $480 million was down 4% from the first quarter of 2015. Non-U.S. revenue of $336 million was down 8% and represented 41% of Moody's total revenue. Recurring revenue of $452 million increased by 7% and represented 55% of total revenue.
Looking now at each of our businesses, starting with Moody's Investors Service. Total MIS revenue for the quarter was $525 million, down 13% from the prior-year period. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted MIS revenue by 1%. U.S. revenue declined 10% to $336 million, while non-U.S. revenue of $189 million declined 18% and represented 36% of total ratings revenue. Recurring revenue of $231 million increased 4% and represented 44% of ratings revenue.
Moving now to the lines of business for MIS. First, Global Corporate Finance revenue of $240 million for the quarter was down 20% from the prior-year period. This result reflected lower levels of global speculative grade issuance as well as declines in the number of U.S. investment-grade bond offerings and in the volume of European investment-grade issuance. U.S. Corporate Finance revenue decreased 10%, while non-U.S. revenue decreased 36%.
Second, Global Structured Finance revenue for the first quarter was $91 million, down 11% from the prior-year period. This represented the lowest revenue quarter for structured finance that we have seen in 10 quarters. U.S. securitization activity slowed, primarily within the CMBS and CLO markets, due to widening spreads, regulatory requirements and reduced availability of bank loan collateral. U.S. Structured Finance revenue was down 15%. Non-U.S. revenue was flat, with a modest increase in Europe.
Third, Global Financial Institutions revenue of $95 million was up 1% from the prior-year period. U.S. Financial Institutions revenue was down 3%, while non-U.S. revenue was up 4%.
Fourth, Global Public, Project and Infrastructure finance revenue of $92 million was down 9% versus the prior-year period, as U.S. project finance activity and European infrastructure-related issuance fell amid choppy market conditions. U.S. Public, Project and Infrastructure finance revenue was down 6%, while non-U.S. revenue was down 14%.
MIS other, which consists of non-rating revenue from Moody's majority-owned joint venture of interest in ICRA and Korea Investors Service, contributed $8 million to MIS revenue for the first quarter, flat to the prior-year period.
And turning now to Moody's Analytics. Global revenue for MA of $291 million was up 11% from the first quarter of 2015. Excluding revenue from our March 2016 acquisition of GGY, MA revenue grew by 10%. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted MA revenue by 2%. U.S. revenue of $144 million was up 12% year-over-year, and non-U.S. revenue of $147 million was up 9% and represented 51% of total MA revenue. Recurring revenue of $222 million increased 9% and represented 76% of MA's revenue.
Moving now to the lines of business for MA. First, Global Research, Data and Analytics, or RD&A. Revenue of $165 million was up 10% from the prior-year period and represented 57% of total MA revenue. Growth was mainly due to strong new sales of research and data as well as record customer retention. U.S. RD&A revenue was up 14%, while non-U.S. revenue was up 5%.
Second, Global Enterprise Risk Solutions, or ERS, revenue of $90 million was up 16% from last year, primarily from accelerated project delivery. U.S. ERS revenue was up 14%, while non-U.S. revenue was up 17%. Excluding revenue from GGY, ERS revenue grew 13%. 
And as we've noted in the past, due to the variable nature of project timing and completion, ERS revenue remained subject to quarterly volatility. Trailing 12-month sales for ERS increased 1%, reflecting a very difficult comparison with the first quarter of 2015.
Third, Global Professional Services revenue of $37 million was flat to the prior-year period. U.S. Professional Services revenue was down 6%, while non-U.S. revenue was up 3%.
Turning now to expense. Moody's first quarter expense was $512 million, up 4% from 2015. The increase was primarily due to higher compensation costs in MA, reflecting additional headcount required to support business growth as well as Moody's ongoing technology investments. Expenses in MIS were down slightly compared to the prior-year period. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted expense by 2%.
As Ray noted, Moody's reported operating margin and adjusted operating margin were 37.3% and 40.9%, respectively, for the first quarter. Moody's effective tax rate for the quarter was 32.3% versus 32.9% for the same period last year. The year-over-year decline was primarily due to a change in New York City tax law, relating to income apportionment.
And now I'll provide an update on capital allocation. During the first quarter of 2016, Moody's returned $334 million to shareholders via share repurchase and dividends. The company repurchased 2.9 million shares at a total cost of $262 million or an average cost of $89.83 per share and issued 1.6 million shares under its annual employee stock-based compensation plans.
Moody's also paid $72.1 million in dividends during the quarter, and on April 11, announced a quarterly dividend of $0.37 per share of Moody's common stock, payable June 10, to stockholders of record at the close of business on May 20.
Outstanding shares as of March 31, 2016, totaled 194.3 million, down 4% from the prior-year period. As of March 31, 2016, Moody's had $1.2 billion of share repurchase authority remaining.
At quarter end, Moody's had $3.4 billion of outstanding debt and $1 billion of additional debt capacity available under its revolving credit facility. Total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at quarter end were $2.1 billion, with approximately 73% held outside the U.S.
Free cash flow for the first 3 months of 2016 was $211 million, down 13% from the first 3 months of 2015, primarily due to the year-over-year decline in net income and changes in working capital.
And with that, I'll turn the call back to Ray."

I'll conclude this morning's prepared comments by discussing the changes to our full year guidance for 2016. A full list of Moody's guidance is included in our first quarter 2016 earnings press release, which can be found on Moody's Investor Relations website, at ir.moodys.com.
Moody's updated outlook for 2016 is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, corporate profitability and business investment spending, mergers and acquisitions, consumer borrowing and securitization and the amount of debt issued. These assumptions are subject to uncertainty, and results for the year could differ materially from our current outlook. Our guidance assumes foreign currency translation at end-of-quarter exchange rates. Specifically, our forecast reflects exchange rates for the British pound and the euro at $1.44 to GBP 1 and $1.14 to EUR 1, respectively.
As I noted earlier, the company now expects 2016 EPS of $4.55 to $4.65, inclusive of $0.02 dilution from the acquisition of GGY.
Moody's full year 2016 revenue is now expected to increase in the low single-digit percent range. In response to this revised revenue outlook, we have lowered our projected base business spending for the year by approximately $50 million through expense management actions and reduced incentive compensation. These savings allow Moody's to maintain guidance for operating expenses to increase in the mid-single-digit percent range, despite the addition of GGY's operating expenses and the negative impact of foreign currency translation. Moody's now projects an operating margin of approximately 41%, while adjusted operating margin is still expected to be approximately 45%.
Free cash flow is now expected to be approximately $1 billion. Capital expenditures are now expected to be approximately $125 million.
For MIS, 2016 revenue is now expected to be approximately flat. U.S. revenue is now expected to decrease in the low single-digit percent range, while non-U.S. revenue is now expected to increase in the low single-digit percent range.
Corporate Finance revenue is now expected to decrease in the low single-digit percent range, reflecting weak issuance in the first quarter as well as expectations for variable issuance activity for the remainder of the year.
Structured Finance revenue is now expected to decrease in the mid-single-digit percent range as a result of continued challenges to U.S. securitization activity.
Public, Project and Infrastructure finance revenue is now expected to increase in the mid-single-digit percent range, which assumes weakness in the first quarter is not offset to the remainder of the year.
For Moody's Analytics, 2016 revenue is now expected to increase in the high single-digit percent range. U.S. revenue is now expected to increase in the low double-digit percent range, while non-U.S. revenue is now expected to increase in the mid-single-digit percent range. 
Research, Data and Analytics revenue is now expected to increase in the high single-digit percent range as a result of new business and an increased customer retention rate. 
Enterprise Risk Solutions revenue is now expected to increase in the high single-digit percent range, including revenue associated with the March 2016 acquisition of GGY.
Before we move to the Q&A, I'd like to a highlight MIS management change that we announced on April 4. Effective June 1, 2016, Michel Madelain will retire as President and Chief Operating Officer of MIS and will assume the role of Vice Chairman for MIS. He will also remain on the MIS Board of Directors and MIS European boards. Rob Fauber, who has been with Moody's for 11 years, will succeed Michel Madelain as President of MIS. I'd like to extend my thanks to Michel and congratulate Rob on his new role.
This concludes our prepared remarks, and joining us for the question-and-answer session is Michel Madelain, President and Chief Operating Officer of MIS; and Mark Almeida, President of Moody's Analytics. We'll be pleased to take any questions you may have."

The other thing I'd point you to, though, is structured finance, and the conditions for the structured finance market have been very challenged so far this year, and we think that they're going to continue to be challenged, especially in the U.S. This -- there are a number of reasons for this, but it's -- not always is it credit spreads, which can affect the economics of the transaction, but also regulatory requirements that are being implemented and interpreted, and a lot of the market participants are sorting out the appropriate interpretation for new regulatory requirements around risk retention and disclosure of underlying asset information. And that, in combination with a challenging interest rate environment or spread environment and issues around the appropriate availability of collateral in areas such as CLOs, has really impacted our outlook for structured finance in the United States, for not only the first quarter results, but our outlook for the remaining 9 months."

So you should probably have a pretty good visibility for the second, third and fourth quarter. And then, if there's any variability to what you're hopefully going to give me now, is it basically if revenues actually end up being a little bit better, some of the negative flex comes back and maybe some of the bonuses come back. And so basically, what I'm saying is, in a weaker revenue environment, there's not much that's going to change on the cost side on an absolute basis.

We moved aggressively and we moved hard against that situation. We have taken steps in T&E, and most importantly, in hiring. For 2 of the divisions, this excludes Moody's Analytics, we are back to what I would call essential hiring, and we're looking at hiring on a person-by-person basis in terms of backfilling. So really clamped down on that front for 2 of the divisions. Now we can't turn the ship that quickly, and that's the issue. So we often talk about $50 million of expense flex. So we have that in train already. And about half of that is from reduced incentive compensation, because we've just taken the guidance down. The other half is from the expense management actions that I spoke about earlier. Now if this gets worse, we have another $50 million, which again is split, about half and half, between incentive compensation and other expense saving measures that we could take. But as we move into that second $50 million, this does get tougher and we've already taken down our incentive compensation with this first half by about $20 million. So we'll see how we go, and we'll see what we want to do. But we have been very clear about this.

Andre, maybe this is a good time for us to talk about what we're hearing from the banks. And again, this is issuance views for both financial and non-financial U.S. dollar issuance, and then we'll go over to Europe. So I think you should be able to see a slide that we've put up. Now investment-grade bonds, a curious situation. For the first quarter of 2016, $340 billion in issuance, about flat year-over-year. That's good. What was less good is that the deal count, the number of transactions was down by about 20%. So dollar volume, dollar value, about the same, but deal count is down, which is not helpful to us. Moving across the column, month-to-date for April, about $65 billion, and for the full year, we're looking at $1.2 trillion, which is about flat. So right now, for investment grade, the pipeline is robust. It's good, and we expect the market to remain active and the backdrop is stable, and companies are coming out of blackouts. So it looks like there's quite a bit to do right now. So investment grade, positive. The issue here has been the deal count. Going down to high yield, looking at $40 billion of issuance so far, that's down 60% year-over-year. Month-to-date April, $25 billion. Year-to-date, we're looking at $230 billion, down 15%. The market tone is better. There are some deals in the market -- there have been deals in the market this week. There's one in the market today. It's a Friday, that's unusual. The market tone has improved, but the market is still bifurcated, as you see in the second point, between haves and have-nots. The stronger credits are doing better. Spread tightening has already happened. We're in about 160 basis points. The question is, is that enough? And if spreads continue to tighten, we may see some progress. Conversely if they widen out again, we may see further backup. So we're going to have to watch that closely. Leveraged loans, we see $40 billion in the first quarter, which is down 25% year-over-year, $15 billion month-to-date and $260 billion for the year, which is down 10% year-over-year. So stability in the macro backdrop, as you see in the first point, is also aiding the leveraged loan market. It's weaker than high-yield bond market though, because the fund outflows and the slowdown in CLO formation that goes back to the risk retention requirements, which we can talk a bit more about, if you want, and some increased fall activity serves as a bit of a headwind. Now if we go over to Europe, looking at the next slide. Again, these are the views of the banks. Investment grade in Europe, pipeline is robust and can pick up further because of the ECB's corporate bond purchasing program. Brexit though, in the second point, is an uncertainty and that could sideline the issuers and be harmful to the summer season, which is traditionally weaker, depending on what happens with that growth. And U.S. corporate continues to see that there is good value in accessing euro market, what we would call reverse-Yankee, and we expect that to be a heavy component of supply, as it has been and will be, we think, going forward. Spec-grade in Europe, the market was muted. Supply was down 70%, a very volatile first quarter. Again, the ECB's move has sparked a renewed risk appetite and is leading to pickup in high-yield activity in Europe and tighter spreads again may encourage further issuance. So overall on Europe, the ECB's move makes us more optimistic, but it has been a very slow first quarter in Europe. I think the overall view on the more speculative asset classes across the world would be, keep an eye on spreads as they continue to tighten. We may see the outlook improve, and conversely if they widen, particularly as we go into the Brexit boat, that will be detrimental. So hope that's helpful to you, Andre."

And within the U.S., it's focused on, primarily, the CMBS market and the CLO market. As you know from our prior comments in the commercial mortgage-backed securities area, there is a lot of refinancing that needs to occur. Some of that refinancing is occurring outside of securitization, and we are also expecting to see the volume and activity pick up in the third and fourth quarters of this year, because there was very little conduit lending early in this year and the conduits have increased their financing, but it will take some months for that to feed into CMBS.
In the CLO area, it's -- the market dealing with both the risk retention requirements and the interpretations for other regulatory requirements that -- having to do with transparency around underlying assets, and the suitability of the collateral itself. So assuming that we see the market sort out how it is going to meet the new regulatory requirements and the suitability of collateral, again, we could see a pickup in CLOs later in the year. Pipelines are not bad. As a matter of fact, in Europe, pipeline is up quite substantially. And so some of the issues that we're seeing in the U.S. are being partially offset by the international business, but it's still not enough to allow us to come anywhere close to holding our original guidance."

So you had the risk-off mode happening, you had oil prices collapsing, concerns about China and growth concerns. So we went through a pretty heavy risk-off phase there, which is now starting to right itself. So generally around here, we're okay if we have one segment off, but having corporate hit hard as well as having structured having had the worst quarter it's had in 10 quarters, we frankly didn't see that. Now as Ray said, that is what we would view as a cyclical issue in structured until the participants in that market figure out how to deal with some of these different conditions. And we'll -- we do think that, that situation will ease as we go into the end of the year. But I don't think we expected the total risk-off environment in the first quarter. We were thoughtful, but it was worse than we thought. And as we've said, there are a number of factors that make the rest of the year a little bit tricky to predict.

As far as the cyclicality of the conditions, clearly in the corporate sector, this is cyclical. There are significant refinancing walls that begin to build in 2017 and really build for several years after that. So we're going to see a large amount of activity associated with refinancing. M&A, there had been some bumps in the road with M&A, but it has been strong for a while. And to the extent that we're in a low-growth environment, that has and probably will continue to encourage M&A. Where we see the erosion in M&A-driven debt is at least at the margins around some of the tax-driven deals and things of that sort. So really, I view the corporate story as being very much a cyclical story with a significant refinancing wall coming upon us beginning next year. On the structured finance side, again, I think it's largely cyclical. But we have to watch and see how the market deals with new requirements and what economically the market determines make sense. So that's an area to keep our collective eye on, in terms of how much of it is cyclical and whether there are some structural changes to that market."

If one is looking for a job in the financial sector right now, particularly if one is looking for a job in the banking sector, that's a pretty challenging place to look at this point in time. So that would probably be the reason why we're seeing a slight reduction in voluntary turnover. Now for incentive compensation, let's talk about that. We had started the year with 100% of our bonus targets being set up to $4.80 we had previously seen for guidance. We pulled that down to $4.60. And as a result of that, we have taken down our incentive compensation. For example, for the first quarter last year, incentive compensation was $38 million and this year in the first quarter, it's come down to $32 million. So we pulled down incentive compensation pretty hard to deal with this new lower forecast. And if we're not going to hit our numbers, the employees are not paid as well, that's just the way it goes. In terms of $32 million number, we would see that it will ramp a bit as we go into the fourth quarter if things go right. But if we do considerably better than the $4.60 we're predicting, now, Joe, you would expect that we would take incentive compensation back up. So $4.80 was a 100% and $4.60 is below that so we've cut incentive comp accordingly."

In this first quarter of '16, in fact, expenses increased 4% over '15 and you might want to ask why that was. The majority of that growth was to continue to grow corporate growth in Moody's Analytics, which, as you can see, is performing beautifully. So MA expenses grew 9%, which reported revenue growth, which was even greater. MIS expenses, though were slightly down. And of course we're trying to match the expense support for the revenue growth in the business, and we can't do that instantaneously. Most of the $50 million that we have already put in process on expense management will come from shared services. That's the support part of the business, which I run for the most part; and then also to MIS. Moody's Analytics is performing well, and we will continue to invest in it. And its compensation view will be slightly different perhaps than the rest of the corporation if it performs according to its targets, which through the first quarter, it has and even better, its incentive compensation would be at target or perhaps even higher. So we're being very cautious to match what we're doing here with where we're seeing growth. And the further reason for the growth in that incentive compensation for the first quarter year-over-year was because of some of the additions that we made in headcount last year and that some of the things we'd already started at the very beginning of '16. We had a very good handle on that right now. And of course, we did see the acquisition of GGY, which added some expense and we continue to make prudent technology investments. But this is very carefully planned expense management where we needed to support the growth areas, and we're throttling back on those areas, particularly the support areas, where we can do that. So very careful, very active management of our expense base."

I'll start with the corporate sector, and we'll start with investment grade and we're looking at Q1 2016 compared to 2015. So for investment grade in 2016, we had $66 million of revenue from investment grade, that was 28% of the total for CFG, which is $240 million. Last year, we had $87 million in investment grade and $298 million in corporate. So the percentage stayed about the same at 28%. That grade is where the story is. For the first quarter, this year, we had $30.3 million, that is less than half of last year's $62.7 million. And this year, we're looking at spec-grade being 13% of the total. Bank loans down a bit, $41.3 million versus $44.5 million last year and 17% of the total and other, about flat, 102.6; and 43% of the total for CFG. Going to structured, again, quarter-over-quarter '16 versus '15. ABS, asset-backed securities, pretty close, about $20 million for the first quarter this year versus $21 million last year; percentage is about flat at 22%; RMBS also not that much movement. In fact, it was up in the first quarter of 2016 to almost $21 million versus about $18 million last year. Percentage was up to 23%. Commercial real estate here again was where we saw a more dramatic difference, about $28 million in the first quarter of this year versus $33 million last year. Percentage is about 31% this year. Structured credit also a more dramatic change, $22 million this year versus almost $29 million last year and 24% of the total. So that's the story in structured. FIG, not too much difference in FIG. Total of $95 million for the first quarter of '16, about flat to last year's, about $94 million. FIG does not move around as much as the other line. So for banks, we're about $59 million, last year was about $63 million. Percentage is about 62%. Insurance did perform better. We're close to $30 million in insurance versus $25 million last year, that's 31% of the FIG total. Managed investment's about $4 million flat to last year in dollar and percent. Other, also flat in dollar and percent to about $2.5 million and 3%. And PPIF, again this was another less than pleasant surprise. Last year in the first quarter, PPIF in 2015 did $100 million. This year, we have a little bit less than $92 million. So PFG sovereigns is about $55 million, about flat to last year's $56 million. Projects and infrastructure is where we saw some weakness, about 36.5 versus last year's 44.5. So that's about 40% of the PPIF line and about an 18% decline, which was obviously not helpful. Then the other line is negligible for PPIF. So again PPIF in total, down 9% year-over-year. So we had 3 out of 4 of the businesses having some challenges with corporates down the most in dollar and percent terms. Structured, which is our second biggest business, fell off, and then PPIF, off 9% as well, with banking about the same. So again, if we have one or -- one of these engines have a bit of a challenge, we can usually figure it out, and make it up somewhere else, but 3 out of 4 of the MIS engine is down, that's a little bit tricky. And so you see the results in the quarter numbers."

Customer retention continues to improve, so we got a little bit of a bump from that. New sales production has been very strong, so that contributed. Pricing has been good.

Your point is very good that we have a private placement with a particularly high coupon coming due in '17 and we're running the breakevens on that right now and we'll take a look at that.

We received a question why did we deal with our guidance right now on the first quarter call, that's a little bit early for us. Part of the reason why we did that is a change in guidance triggers the reduction in incentive compensation for us. In other words, we've just taken out about close to $20 million in incentive compensation for the first quarter and the rest of the year, that is the result of our pulling down the guidance. So we will look at now how we perform according to where we are with the midpoint being $4.60. So the next thing that would happen on $50 million is, we'd be about evenly split between another $25 million in incentive compensation, if our performance is weaker than we expect now, and some other cost cuts that we could make. We probably need to keep with some essential hiring, less so in shared services, but certainly in MIS. We'd like Mark to continue with his hiring plans in MA because they're doing really well as he's outlined. And we've got to be thoughtful about what we're doing with our technology spend. Projects that we could postpone or dial back, I think we've largely done that. We're taking another pass through that. But again, there are certain things that we need to do around here and it gets harder with the second pass. Again, we've had tough conditions in the first quarter. We view that as cyclical. We have better coverage proportionately in structured finance, which has been hit hard in the first quarter and we're waiting to see what happens for the rest of the year. So we think we're being prudent and incentive compensation is what we're going to do in order to keep the margin from being hit. Now we've moved the margin guidance down from about 42% to about 41%, so we are holding the margin for the most part down 100 bps perhaps in the guidance. But the first hit goes to incentive compensation. And we would like the shareholders to note that it is our intention to hold the margin at about 41%, which is still pretty healthy. I hope that helps in terms of your questions, Tim. If I missed anything, let me know."

I will then conclude with comments on our current outlook for 2016. After our prepared remarks, we'll be happy to respond to your questions.
In the second quarter, Moody's revenue of $929 million increased 1% from the second quarter of 2015 despite a challenging year-on-year comparable. Moody's Analytics delivered its 34th consecutive quarter of revenue growth while Moody's Investors Service attained its second highest quarterly revenue ever, only surpassed by its performance in the same period last year.
Operating expense for the second quarter was $519 million, up 4% from the second quarter of 2015. Operating income was $410 million, a 2% decline from the prior year period. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted operating income by 1%. Adjusted operating income, defined as operating income before depreciation and amortization, was $441 million, down 1% from the same period last year. Operating margin for the second quarter of 2016 was 44.2%. The adjusted operating margin was 47.5%. Diluted earnings per share of $1.30 was up 2% from the prior year period.
Turning to year-to-date performance. Moody's revenue for the first half of 2016 was $1.7 billion, a decline of 2% from the prior year period. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, revenue declined 1%. Revenue at Moody's Investors Service was $1.2 billion, a decline of 7% from 2015. Revenue at Moody's Analytics was $594 million, 10% higher than the prior year period.
Operating expense from the first half of 2016 was $1 billion, up 4% from the prior period. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, operating expense was up 6%. Operating income was $714 million, down 10% from the -- was down 10% from the first half of 2015. The impact of foreign currency translation was negligible. Adjusted operating income of $775 million was down 8% from the prior year period. Moody's reported operating margin was 40.9% and its adjusted operating margin was 44.4%. The effective tax rate for the first half of 2016 was 32.1%, up from 31.5% from the prior year period.
Despite a good second quarter, we have modestly reduced certain elements of our revenue guidance due to our more cautious outlook for issuance outside the U.S. following the British referendum to leave the European Union and the expected a negative impact of foreign currency translation. As a result, we expect to be at the lower end of our $4.55 to $4.65 EPS guidance range.
I'll now turn the call over to Linda to provide further commentary on our financial results and other updates"

As Ray mentioned, Moody's total revenue for the second quarter was $929 million, up 1% from the prior year period. U.S. revenue of $546 million was flat to the second quarter of 2015. Non-U.S. revenue of $383 million was up 3% and represented 41% of Moody's total revenue. The impact of foreign currency translation on MCO revenue was negligible.
Recurring revenue of $467 million was up 6% and represented 50% of total revenue. Looking now at each of our businesses, starting with Moody's Investors Service. Total MIS revenue for the quarter was $626 million, down 2% from the prior year period but up 19% from the first quarter. U.S. revenue declined 3% to $399 million while non-U.S. revenue of $227 million was flat to the prior period and represented 36% of total ratings revenue. The impact of foreign currency translation on MIS revenue was negligible.
Moving to the lines of business for MIS. First, global corporate finance revenue of $305 million in the second quarter was down 5% from the prior year period. This result primarily reflected lower levels of U.S. speculative-grade and Asian investment-grade issuance despite increased activity from the first quarter. U.S. and non-U.S. corporate finance revenues were down 4% and 6%, respectively.
Second, global structured finance revenue for the second quarter was $112 million, down 8% from the prior year period as reduced U.S. CLO and CMBS activity was only partially offset by increased European structured finance activity. U.S. structured finance revenue was down 16% while non-U.S. revenue was up 14%.
Third, the global financial institutions revenue of $90 million was down 1% from the prior year period. U.S. financial institutions revenue was up 7% while non-U.S. revenue was down 7%.
Fourth, global public project and infrastructure finance revenue of $112 million was up 12% versus the prior year period, primarily as a result of increased global infrastructure-related issuance. U.S. and non-U.S. public project and infrastructure finance revenues were up 11% and 16%, respectively.
MIS other, which consists of non-rating revenues from ICRA and India and Korea Investors Service, contributed $7 million to MIS revenue for the second quarter, down 10% from the prior year period.
And turning now to Moody's Analytics. Global revenue for MA of $303 million was up 9% from the second quarter of 2015. U.S. revenue of $147 million was up 10% year-over-year. Non-U.S. revenue of $156 million was up 8% and represented 52% of total MA revenue. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted MA revenue by 1%. Excluding revenue from our March 2016 acquisition of GGY, MA revenue grew 6%.
Moving now to the lines of business for MA. First, global research data and analytics or RD&A revenue of $168 million was up 7% from the prior year period and represented 55% of total MA revenue. Growth was mainly due to strength in the sales of credit research and ratings data fees. U.S. and non-U.S. RD&A revenues were each up 7%.
Second, global enterprise resolutions or ERS revenue of $98 million was up 17% from last year. The growth was driven primarily by the acquisition of GGY as well as growth across all product lines with particular strength from regulatory and risk measurement product revenues. U.S. and non-U.S. ERS revenues were up 21% and 15%, respectively.
Trailing 12-month revenue in sales for ERS increased 11% and 6%, respectively. As we've noted in the past, due to the variable nature of project timing and completion, ERS revenue and sales remain subject to quarterly volatility.
Third, global professional services revenue of $38 million was down 2% from the prior year period. This result was primarily due to the impact of customer attrition identified last year as well as the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange on the credentials and licensing business. U.S. professional services revenue was flat to the prior year period, while non-U.S. revenue was down 3%.
Turning now to expense. Moody's second quarter expense was $519 million, up 4% from 2015. The increase was primarily due to higher compensation costs in MA, reflecting additional headcount to support business growth and the acquisition of GGY. MIS expense was down slightly compared to the prior year period. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted expense by 2%.
As Ray noted, Moody's reported operating margin and adjusted operating margin were 44.2% and 47.5%, respectively, for the second quarter. Moody's effective tax rate for the quarter was 31.9%, up from 30.4% in the second quarter of 2015.
Now I'll provide an update on capital allocation. During the second quarter of 2016, Moody's repurchased 2.3 million shares at a total cost of $224 million or an average cost of $96.60 per share and issued 249,000 shares as part of its employee stock compensation -- stock-based compensation plans. Moody's also paid $72 million in dividends during the quarter. And on July 12, announced a quarterly dividend of $0.37 per share as Moody's common stock payable September 12 to stockholders of record at the close of business on August 22. [indiscernible] first half of 2016, Moody's repurchased 5.2 million shares at a total cost of $486 million or an average cost of $92.83 per share. The company also returned $144 million to its shareholders via dividend payment during the same period.
Outstanding shares as of June 30, 2016, totaled 192 million, down 4% from June 30, 2015. As of June 30, 2016, Moody's had $1 billion of share repurchase authority remaining. 
At quarter end, Moody's had $3.4 billion of outstanding debt and $1 billion of additional debt capacity available under its revolving credit facility. Total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at quarter end were $2 billion, with approximately 78% held outside the U S. Free cash flow in the first 6 months of 2016 was $475 million, down 14% from the first 6 months of 2015, primarily due to lower net income.
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Ray."
528325,370137186,1010831,"Moody's Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 22, 2016",2016-07-22,"Earnings Calls","Moody's Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Linda. I'll conclude this morning's prepared comments by discussing changes to our full year guidance for 2016. A full list of Moody's guidance is included in our second quarter 2016 earnings press release, which can be found on Moody's Investor R",632,"Thanks, Linda. I'll conclude this morning's prepared comments by discussing changes to our full year guidance for 2016. A full list of Moody's guidance is included in our second quarter 2016 earnings press release, which can be found on Moody's Investor Relations website at ir.moodys.com. Moody's current outlook for 2016 is based on assumptions about many geopolitical conditions in macroeconomic and capital market factors. Including interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, corporate profit ability, business investment spending, mergers and acquisitions, consumer borrowing and securitization and the amount of debt issued. These assumptions are subject to uncertainty, and results for the full year could differ materially from our current outlook.
Our guidance assumes foreign currency translation at end-of-quarter exchange rates. Specifically our forecast of flex exchange rates for the British pound of $1.34 to GBP 1 and for the euro of $1.11 to EUR 1. Based on our current business mix, the annualized impact of a $0.01 decline in the euro against the U.S. dollar equals approximately a $0.01 decline in our annualized EPS. On the other hand, a $0.01 decline in the British pound against the U.S. dollar has a minimal impact to EPS.
As I noted earlier, Moody's is reaffirming our full year 2016 EPS guidance of $4.55 to $4.65 and expects to be toward the lower end of the range. Moody's full year 2016 revenue is still expected to increase in the low single-digit percent range. Moody's operating expense still expected to increase in the mid-single-digit percent range. 
For MIS, Moody's now expects 2016 revenue to decrease in the low-single-digit percent range, reflecting reduced guidance for our non-U.S. MIS revenue, which we now also expect to decrease in the low single-digit percent range. U.S. revenue is still expected to decrease in the low single-digit percent range.
Structured finance revenue is now expected to decrease in the high single-digit percent range. For MA, 2016 revenue is now expected to increase in the mid-single-digit percent range. U.S. revenue is still expected to increase in the low double-digit percent range while non-U.S. revenue is now expected to increase in the low single-digit percent range.
Before we move to the Q&A, I would like to highlight 3 items, including investments we made earlier this week in Korea and award won by MIS and the launch of a new MA product. On Monday, Moody's announced it just acquired full ownership of Korean Investors Service or KIS, a leading provider of domestic credit ratings in Korea. Moody's and KIS have had a long-standing and productive relationship since 2001. We believe that an even closer partnership and continued investment in the business will enable us to capitalize on the opportunities for growth and better serve the market in Korea. The acquisition is not expected to have a significant impact on Moody's earnings per share for 2016 and has been funded from international cash on hand.
Additionally, MIS was voted Best Credit-Rating Agency in a 2016 poll of U.S. fixed income investors conducted by the Publisher Institutional Investor. This is the fifth year in a row that MIS has won this award. I appreciate the market's recognition of our efforts, and I applaud the accomplishments of our MIS colleagues.
And finally, yesterday, we announced the launch of Moody's Analytics Risk Quality Score or MARK, a total private companies understand the credit profile and support bank lending to small businesses. The MARK score and the related Web portal are results of our collaboration with Finagraph, a financial technology company in which we made a minority investment earlier this year.
This concludes our prepared remarks. And joining Linda and me for the question-and-answer session are Mark Almeida, President of Moody's Analytics; and Robert Fauber, President of Moody's Investors Service. We'll be pleased to take any questions that you might have."

As we said in the prepared remarks, it's really uncertainty about international issuance activity that's driving a somewhat more cautious outlook. And I would ask to have that since the Brexit vote on June 23, we haven't seen much activity in international issuance, average daily issuance volumes are down and are really all key markets except for U.S. investment grade. That being said, the timing of the vote does coincide with a seasonal decline in issuance that we typically see in July and August, especially again in the euro market. So trying to assess at this point the decrease in issuance for as a result of uncertainty about the lead vote versus normal seasonal factors actually is a bit difficult. So hopefully, we are being more cautious than we need to be, but that's what's influencing our thinking. And we also think it's going to have an impact outside the corporate sector in structured finance. So that's really what's informing our views at this point."

So we'll put up now the slide that talkies about our usual views from investment banks and capital markets economists, and the points here cover both financial and nonfinancial U.S. dollar issuance and their ways of counting things may not align with our revenue categorization. But looking at U.S. investment grade, the market has been quite resilient post Brexit. All-in yields are below previous record lows. The tenure's at 1.59 this morning and spreads are quite attractive. M&A-related financing continues to be a strong driver. Favorable market conditions are expected to encourage opportunistic issuance post earnings blackouts. So as Ray said, this is typically a slow period. And full year estimated issuance forecast range from flat to up 10%. Our yield new issuance in Q2 was the strongest it's been in a year, but we expected to see that given that the Brexit situation had backed up that market a bit. We expect as we move forward in the year, the issuance windows may be shorter. So again, the risk-on, risk-off phenomenon. Full year issuance forecast range from down 10% to down 20%. Leveraged loans, we're pls to see CLO issuance started to reemerge, $30 billion of issuance in CLOs year-to-date. Pipeline is categorized as modest. And full year 2016 estimated issuance forecast range from down 10% to down 20%. Looking at Europe. record low coupons as ECB's corporate buying program continues to help the market and keeps yields low. U.S. corporates are seeing value in moving to Europe, and we expect that to continue throughout the rest of the year. And supplies slowed as we've entered the traditional summer period, and many issuers came to market before the Brexit vote on June 23. European high-yield, the markets reopened after a period of new issuance following the Brexit vote. But again, issuance windows are going to be shorter due to the macro economic view and the summer slowdown and investors are moving down to speculative-grade securities to search for yield given the low prevailing yield climate rate at the moment. So with that backdrop, I'll ask Rob if he wants to speak a little bit further about how we came to this view on MIS' components and guidance. Rob?"

And we will make appropriate decisions for ourselves and for Moody's as decisions are being made in terms of the nature of the U.K's participation in the European economic on a going forward basis.

Tim, this is a little tricky to follow so let me try to lay this out, and I'm going to need a paragraph or 2 here to explain this appropriately. So last quarter, we told you we've lowered our projected base business setting for the year by about $50 million, and we commented on the fact it comes from expense management action and reduced incentive compensation. So that was $50 million in reduction, which was great but those savings were entirely offset by the addition of the GGY acquisition's operating expenses and the negative impact of foreign currency translation. So we were down 50 but 50 came back from GGY and FX. Now since last quarter, we've done better with our cost savings than we thought we would. And additionally, we expect less negative impact from FX. So while we still have partial offset from adding GGY's expenses, we now think we're going to be about $20 million in lower expenses versus the 0 net impact before. So we continue to work on this. We're very committed to ensuring that our expenses are in the right place but again, the nature of the company is that we can't reduce things immediately given the more challenging revenue quarter like we had in the first quarter, but we do think we've made good progress on bending the curve and moving the run rate, which will continue to show you but probably more heavily in the fourth quarter than the third quarter. So I hope that's thorough enough for you and sorry it's not a particularly simple explanation. That worked for you, Tim?"

So currently, our entity structure takes away some of that benefit. And reported revenue and expense activities in British pound essentially offset each other given the way we have some of our legal entities and tax structuring setup. The existing structure reflects various operational financial and legal considerations, and we look at those and make adjustments when appropriate. Following the Brexit vote, we're frankly going to have to wait and see what happens to see how we best might react to that, but right now the situation's very unclear. So you're correct, there is a mismatch but as you move down through the operating structure we presently have in place, those numbers become more evenly matched. So hope, Toni, that, that's thorough enough explanation for year."

I don't know if one of my colleagues can quantify that, but we clearly saw a very active second quarter in issuance activity coming out of Europe. The corporate finance was -- and structured finance were both up double digits in Europe in the second quarter. And we are attributing a portion of that to likely pull forward. And the fact that post Brexit, we went several weeks without really seeing much of any activity in terms of European issuance. Just reinforces that belief that we had some pull forward. I would also, I guess, take this opportunity to just highlight that if we are correct though about that pull forward and correct about the slump in issuance activity being a result of Brexit as opposed to just seasonal, we would expect to see a more pronounced sawtooth pattern this year than we might have otherwise expected, so less issuance and revenue in the third quarter. And as a timing matter, probably more than we had anticipated in the fourth quarter. So I think it's not going to change sawtooth. It's just going to emphasize that."

If there is a different tax regime in the U.S., potentially we can make some changes there but for right now, we think that this situation is advantageous for us. And we continue to look at everything but we like global acquisitions and it's a place where we'll continue to look. So we are where we are for right now."

I will then conclude with comments on our current outlook for 2016. After our prepared remarks, we'll be happy to respond to your questions.
In the second quarter, Moody's revenue of $929 million increased 1% from the second quarter of 2015 despite a challenging year-on-year comparable. Moody's Analytics delivered its 34th consecutive quarter of revenue growth while Moody's Investors Service attained its second highest quarterly revenue ever, only surpassed by its performance in the same period last year.
Operating expense for the second quarter was $519 million, up 4% from the second quarter of 2015. Operating income was $410 million, a 2% decline from the prior year period. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted operating income by 1%. Adjusted operating income, defined as operating income before depreciation and amortization, was $441 million, down 1% from the same period last year. Operating margin for the second quarter of 2016 was 44.2%. The adjusted operating margin was 47.5%. Diluted earnings per share of $1.30 was up 2% from the prior year period.
Turning to year-to-date performance. Moody's revenue for the first half of 2016 was $1.7 billion, a decline of 2% from the prior year period. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, revenue declined 1%. Revenue at Moody's Investors Service was $1.2 billion, a decline of 7% from 2015. Revenue at Moody's Analytics was $594 million, 10% higher than the prior year period.
Operating expense from the first half of 2016 was $1 billion, up 4% from the prior period. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, operating expense was up 6%. Operating income was $714 million, down 10% from the -- was down 10% from the first half of 2015. The impact of foreign currency translation was negligible. Adjusted operating income of $775 million was down 8% from the prior year period. Moody's reported operating margin was 40.9% and its adjusted operating margin was 44.4%. The effective tax rate for the first half of 2016 was 32.1%, up from 31.5% from the prior year period.
Despite a good second quarter, we have modestly reduced certain elements of our revenue guidance due to our more cautious outlook for issuance outside the U.S. following the British referendum to leave the European Union and the expected negative impact of foreign currency translation. As a result, we expect to be at the lower end of our $4.55 to $4.65 EPS guidance range.
I'll now turn the call over to Linda to provide further commentary on our financial results and other updates."

As Ray mentioned, Moody's total revenue for the second quarter was $929 million, up 1% from the prior year period. U.S. revenue of $546 million was flat to the second quarter of 2015. Non-U.S. revenue of $383 million was up 3% and represented 41% of Moody's total revenue. The impact of foreign currency translation on MCO revenue was negligible.
Recurring revenue of $467 million was up 6% and represented 50% of total revenue. Looking now at each of our businesses. Starting with Moody's Investors Service. Total MIS revenue for the quarter was $626 million, down 2% from the prior year period but up 19% from the first quarter. U.S. revenue declined 3% to $399 million while non-U.S. revenue of $227 million was flat to the prior period and represented 36% of total ratings revenue. The impact of foreign currency translation on MIS revenue was negligible.
Moving to the lines of business for MIS. First, Global Corporate Finance revenue of $305 million in the second quarter was down 5% from the prior year period. This result primarily reflected lower levels of U.S. speculative-grade and Asian investment-grade issuance despite increased activity from the first quarter. U.S. and non-U.S. corporate finance revenues were down 4% and 6%, respectively.
Second, Global Structured Finance revenue for the second quarter was $112 million, down 8% from the prior year period as reduced U.S. CLO and CMBS activity was only partially offset by increased European structured finance activity. U.S. structured finance revenue was down 16% while non-U.S. revenue was up 14%.
Third, Global Financial Institutions revenue of $90 million was down 1% from the prior year period. U.S. financial institutions revenue was up 7% while non-U.S. revenue was down 7%.
Fourth, Global Public, Project and Infrastructure finance revenue of $112 million was up 12% versus the prior year period, primarily as a result of increased global infrastructure-related issuance. U.S. and non-U.S. public project and infrastructure finance revenues were up 11% and 16%, respectively.
MIS other, which consists of non-rating revenues from ICRA in India and Korea Investors Service, contributed $7 million to MIS revenue for the second quarter, down 10% from the prior year period.
And turning now to Moody's Analytics. Global revenue for MA of $303 million was up 9% from the second quarter of 2015. U.S. revenue of $147 million was up 10% year-over-year. Non-U.S. revenue of $156 million was up 8% and represented 52% of total MA revenue. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted MA revenue by 1%. Excluding revenue from our March 2016 acquisition of GGY, MA revenue grew 6%.
Moving now to the lines of business for MA. First, Global Research Data and Analytics or RD&A revenue of $168 million was up 7% from the prior year period and represented 55% of total MA revenue. Growth was mainly due to strength in the sales of credit research and ratings data fees. U.S. and non-U.S. RD&A revenues were each up 7%.
Second, Global Enterprise Risk Solutions, or ERS, revenue of $98 million was up 17% from last year. The growth was driven primarily by the acquisition of GGY as well as growth across all product lines, with particular strength from regulatory and risk measurement product revenues. U.S. and non-U.S. ERS revenues were up 21% and 15%, respectively.
Trailing 12-month revenue in sales for ERS increased 11% and 6%, respectively. As we've noted in the past, due to the variable nature of project timing and completion, ERS revenue and sales remain subject to quarterly volatility.
Third, Global Professional Services revenue of $38 million was down 2% from the prior year period. This result was primarily due to the impact of customer attrition identified last year as well as the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange on the credentials and licensing business. U.S. professional services revenue was flat to the prior year period, while non-U.S. revenue was down 3%.
Turning now to expense. Moody's second quarter expense was $519 million, up 4% from 2015. The increase was primarily due to higher compensation costs in MA, reflecting additional headcount to support business growth and the acquisition of GGY. MIS expense was down slightly compared to the prior year period. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted expense by 2%.
As Ray noted, Moody's reported operating margin and adjusted operating margin were 44.2% and 47.5%, respectively, for the second quarter. Moody's effective tax rate for the quarter was 31.9%, up from 30.4% in the second quarter of 2015.
Now I'll provide an update on capital allocation. During the second quarter of 2016, Moody's repurchased 2.3 million shares at a total cost of $224 million or an average cost of $96.60 per share and issued 249,000 shares as part of its employee stock compensation -- stock-based compensation plans.
Moody's also paid $72 million in dividends during the quarter. And on July 12, announced a quarterly dividend of $0.37 per share of Moody's common stock, payable September 12, to stockholders of record at the close of business on August 22. [indiscernible] first half of 2016, Moody's repurchased 5.2 million shares at a total cost of $486 million or an average cost of $92.83 per share. The company also returned $144 million to its shareholders via dividend payment during the same period.
Outstanding shares as of June 30, 2016, totaled 192 million, down 4% from June 30, 2015. As of June 30, 2016, Moody's had $1 billion of share repurchase authority remaining.
At quarter end, Moody's had $3.4 billion of outstanding debt and $1 billion of additional debt capacity available under its revolving credit facility. Total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at quarter end were $2 billion, with approximately 78% held outside the U S.
Free cash flow in the first 6 months of 2016 was $475 million, down 14% from the first 6 months of 2015, primarily due to lower net income.
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Ray."
528325,370137186,1010935,"Moody's Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 22, 2016",2016-07-22,"Earnings Calls","Moody's Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Linda. I'll conclude this morning's prepared comments by discussing changes to our full year guidance for 2016. A full list of Moody's guidance is included in our second quarter 2016 earnings press release, which can be found on Moody's Investor R",631,"Thanks, Linda. I'll conclude this morning's prepared comments by discussing changes to our full year guidance for 2016. A full list of Moody's guidance is included in our second quarter 2016 earnings press release, which can be found on Moody's Investor Relations website at ir.moodys.com.
Moody's current outlook for 2016 is based on assumptions about many geopolitical conditions and macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, corporate profitability, business investment spending, mergers and acquisitions, consumer borrowing and securitization and the amount of debt issued. These assumptions are subject to uncertainty, and results for the full year could differ materially from our current outlook.
Our guidance assumes foreign currency translation at end-of-quarter exchange rates. Specifically our forecast reflects exchange rates for the British pound of $1.34 to GBP 1 and for the euro of $1.11 to EUR 1. Based on our current business mix, the annualized impact of a $0.01 decline in the euro against the U.S. dollar equals approximately a $0.01 decline in our annualized EPS. On the other hand, a $0.01 decline in the British pound against the U.S. dollar has a minimal impact to EPS.
As I noted earlier, Moody's is reaffirming a full year 2016 EPS guidance of $4.55 to $4.65 and expects to be toward the lower end of the range. Moody's full year 2016 revenue is still expected to increase in the low single-digit percent range. Moody's operating expense still expected to increase in the mid-single-digit percent range.
For MIS, Moody's now expects 2016 revenue to decrease in the low-single-digit percent range, reflecting reduced guidance for our non-U.S. MIS revenue, which we now also expect to decrease in the low single-digit percent range. U.S. revenue is still expected to decrease in the low single-digit percent range.
Structured finance revenue is now expected to decrease in the high single-digit percent range. For MA, 2016 revenue is now expected to increase in the mid-single-digit percent range. U.S. revenue is still expected to increase in the low double-digit percent range while non-U.S. revenue is now expected to increase in the low single-digit percent range.
Before we move to the Q&A, I would like to highlight 3 items, including investments we made earlier this week in Korea and award won by MIS and the launch of a new MA product. On Monday, Moody's announced it just acquired full ownership of Korean Investors Service or KIS, a leading provider of domestic credit ratings in Korea. Moody's and KIS have had a long-standing and productive relationship since 2001. We believe that an even closer partnership and continued investment in the business will enable us to capitalize on the opportunities for growth and better serve the market in Korea. The acquisition is not expected to have a significant impact on Moody's earnings per share for 2016 and has been funded from international cash on hand.
Additionally, MIS was voted Best Credit-Rating Agency in a 2016 poll of U.S. fixed income investors conducted by the Publisher Institutional Investor. This is the fifth year in a row that MIS has won this award. I appreciate the market's recognition of our efforts, and I applaud the accomplishments of our MIS colleagues.
And finally, yesterday, we announced the launch of Moody's Analytics Risk Quality Score or MARK, a total private companies understand their credit profile and support bank lending to small businesses. The MARK score and the related Web portal are a result of our collaboration with Finagraph, a financial technology company in which we made a minority investment earlier this year.
This concludes our prepared remarks. And joining Linda and me for the question-and-answer session are Mark Almeida, President of Moody's Analytics; and Robert Fauber, President of Moody's Investors Service. We'll be pleased to take any questions that you might have."

As we said in the prepared remarks, it's really uncertainty about international issuance activity that's driving a somewhat more cautious outlook. And I would have to have that since the Brexit vote on June 23, we haven't seen much activity in international issuance, average daily issuance volumes are down and, really, all key markets except for U.S. investment grade. That being said, the timing of the vote does coincide with a seasonal decline in issuance that we typically see in July and August, especially again in the euro market. So trying to assess at this point the decrease in issuance for as a result of uncertainty about the lead vote versus normal seasonal factors actually is a bit difficult. So hopefully, we are being more cautious than we need to be, but that's what influencing our thinking. And we also think it's going to have an impact outside the corporate sector in structured finance. So that's really what's informing our views at this point."

So we'll put up now the slide that talks about our usual views from investment banks and capital markets economists, and the points here cover both financial and nonfinancial U.S. dollar issuance and their ways of counting things may not align with our revenue categorization. But looking at U.S. investment grade, the market has been quite resilient post Brexit. All-in yields are below previous record lows. The tenure's at 1.59 this morning and spreads are quite attractive. M&A-related financing continues to be a strong driver. Favorable market conditions are expected to encourage opportunistic issuance post earnings blackouts. So as Ray said, this is typically a slow period. And full year estimated issuance forecast range from flat to up 10%. Our yield new issuance in Q2 was the strongest it's been in a year, but we expected to see that given that the Brexit situation had backed up that market a bit. We expect as we move forward in the year, the issuance windows may be shorter. So again, the risk-on, risk-off phenomenon. Full year issuance forecast range from down 10% to down 20%. Leveraged loans, we're pleased to see CLO issuance started to reemerge, $30 billion of issuance in CLOs year-to-date. The pipeline is categorized as modest. And full year 2016 estimated issuance forecast range from down 10% to down 20%. Looking at Europe. Record low coupons as ECB's corporate buying program continues to help the market and keeps yields low. U.S. corporates are seeing value in moving to Europe, and we expect that to continue throughout the rest of the year. And supplies slowed as we've entered the traditional summer period, and many issuers came to the market before the Brexit vote on June 23. European high-yield, the markets reopened after a period of new [ph] issuance following the Brexit vote. But again, issuance windows are going to be shorter due to the macroeconomic view and the summer slowdown and investors are moving down to speculative-grade securities to search for yield, given the low prevailing yield climate right at the moment. So with that backdrop, I'll ask Rob if he wants to speak a little bit further about how we came to this view on MIS' components and guidance. Rob?"

We've seen a pickup then in the U.S. high-yield, European investment-grade markets. And this week, as Linda mentioned, we've seen some activity in the European high-yield market. So we have resumed issuance activity. I would say we just balanced out with, as Linda said, the potential for some headline risk and these risk-on, risk-off windows as we go through the year and I think the greater sensitivity to these windows will be in European leverage finance."

And we will make appropriate decisions for ourselves and for Moody's, as decisions are being made in terms of the nature of the U.K's participation in the European economic on a going forward basis.

Tim, this is a little tricky to follow so let me try to lay this out, and I'm going to need a paragraph or 2 here to explain this appropriately. So last quarter, we told you we've lowered our projected base business spending for the year by about $50 million, and we commented on the fact that it comes from expense management action and reduced incentive compensation. So that was $50 million in reduction, which was great. But those savings were entirely offset by the addition of the GGY acquisition's operating expenses and the negative impact of foreign currency translation. So we were down 50, but 50 came back from GGY and FX. Now since last quarter, we've done better with our cost savings than we thought we would. And additionally, we expect less negative impact from FX. So while we still have to partial offset from adding GGY's expenses, we now think we're going to be about $20 million in lower expenses versus the 0 net impact before. So we continue to work on this. We're very committed to ensuring that our expenses are in the right place. But again, the nature of the company is that we can't reduce things immediately given a more challenging revenue quarter like we had in the first quarter, but we do think we've made good progress on bending the curve and moving the run rate, which will continue to show you but probably more heavily in the fourth quarter than the third quarter. So I hope that's thorough enough for you and sorry it's not a particularly simple explanation. That worked for you, Tim?"

So we did anticipate this question as to why this haven't been more helpful to our EPS. So while those numbers are correct, as you look down the P&L, the benefit is not as strong. So currently, our entity structure takes away some of that benefit, and reported revenue and expense activities in British pound essentially offset each other given the way we have some of our legal entities and tax structuring setup. The existing structure reflects various operational, financial and legal considerations, and we look at those and make adjustments when appropriate. Following the Brexit vote, we're frankly going to have to wait and see what happens to see how we best might react to that, but right now the situation's very unclear. So you're correct, there is a mismatch, but as you move down through the operating structure we presently have in place, those numbers become more evenly matched.

The corporate finance was -- and structured finance were both up double digits in Europe in the second quarter. And we are attributing a portion of that to likely pull forward. And the fact that post Brexit, we went several weeks without really seeing much of any activity in terms of European issuance just reinforces that belief that we had some pull forward. I would also, I guess, take this opportunity to just highlight that if we are correct about that pull forward and correct about the slump in issuance activity being a result of Brexit as opposed to just seasonal, we would expect to see a more pronounced sawtooth pattern this year than we might have otherwise expected, so less issuance and revenue in the third quarter and, as a timing matter, probably more than we had anticipated in the fourth quarter.

I will then conclude with comments on our current outlook for 2016. After our prepared remarks, we'll be happy to respond to your questions.
In the second quarter, Moody's revenue of $929 million increased 1% from the second quarter of 2015 despite a challenging year-on-year comparable. Moody's Analytics delivered its 34th consecutive quarter of revenue growth while Moody's Investors Service attained its second highest quarterly revenue ever, only surpassed by its performance in the same period last year.
Operating expense for the second quarter was $519 million, up 4% from the second quarter of 2015. Operating income was $410 million, a 2% decline from the prior year period. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted operating income by 1%. Adjusted operating income, defined as operating income before depreciation and amortization, was $441 million, down 1% from the same period last year. Operating margin for the second quarter of 2016 was 44.2%. The adjusted operating margin was 47.5%. Diluted earnings per share of $1.30 was up 2% from the prior year period.
Turning to year-to-date performance. Moody's revenue for the first half of 2016 was $1.7 billion, a decline of 2% from the prior year period. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, revenue declined 1%. Revenue at Moody's Investors Service was $1.2 billion, a decline of 7% from 2015. Revenue at Moody's Analytics was $594 million, 10% higher than the prior year period.
Operating expense in the first half of 2016 was $1 billion, up 4% from the prior period. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, operating expense was up 6%. Operating income was $714 million, down 10% from the -- was down 10% from the first half of 2015. The impact of foreign currency translation was negligible. Adjusted operating income of $775 million was down 8% from the prior year period. Moody's reported operating margin was 40.9% and its adjusted operating margin was 44.4%. The effective tax rate for the first half of 2016 was 32.1%, up from 31.5% from the prior year period.
Despite a good second quarter, we have modestly reduced certain elements of our revenue guidance due to our more cautious outlook for issuance outside the U.S. following the British referendum to leave the European Union and the expected negative impact of foreign currency translation. As a result, we expect to be at the lower end of our $4.55 to $4.65 EPS guidance range.
I'll now turn the call over to Linda to provide further commentary on our financial results and other updates."

As Ray mentioned, Moody's total revenue for the second quarter was $929 million, up 1% from the prior year period. U.S. revenue of $546 million was flat to the second quarter of 2015. Non-U.S. revenue of $383 million was up 3% and represented 41% of Moody's total revenue. The impact of foreign currency translation on MCO revenue was negligible.
Recurring revenue of $467 million was up 6% and represented 50% of total revenue. Looking now at each of our businesses. Starting with Moody's Investors Service. Total MIS revenue for the quarter was $626 million, down 2% from the prior year period but up 19% from the first quarter. U.S. revenue declined 3% to $399 million while non-U.S. revenue of $227 million was flat to the prior period and represented 36% of total ratings revenue. The impact of foreign currency translation on MIS revenue was negligible.
Moving to the lines of business for MIS. First, global corporate finance revenue of $305 million in the second quarter was down 5% from the prior year period. This result primarily reflected lower levels of U.S. speculative-grade and Asian investment-grade issuance despite increased activity from the first quarter. U.S. and non-U.S. corporate finance revenues were down 4% and 6%, respectively.
Second, global structured finance revenue for the second quarter was $112 million, down 8% from the prior year period as reduced U.S. CLO and CMBS activity was only partially offset by increased European structured finance activity. U.S. structured finance revenue was down 16% while non-U.S. revenue was up 14%.
Third, global financial institutions revenue of $90 million was down 1% from the prior year period. U.S. financial institutions revenue was up 7% while non-U.S. revenue was down 7%.
Fourth, global public, project and infrastructure finance revenue of $112 million was up 12% versus the prior year period, primarily as a result of increased global infrastructure-related issuance. U.S. and non-U.S. public, project and infrastructure finance revenues were up 11% and 16%, respectively.
MIS other, which consists of non-rating revenues from ICRA in India and Korea Investors Service, contributed $7 million to MIS revenue for the second quarter, down 10% from the prior year period.
And turning now to Moody's Analytics. Global revenue for MA of $303 million was up 9% from the second quarter of 2015. U.S. revenue of $147 million was up 10% year-over-year. Non-U.S. revenue of $156 million was up 8% and represented 52% of total MA revenue. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted MA revenue by 1%. Excluding revenue from our March 2016 acquisition of GGY, MA revenue grew 6%.
Moving now to the lines of business for MA. First, global research, data and analytics or RD&A revenue of $168 million was up 7% from the prior year period and represented 55% of total MA revenue. Growth was mainly due to strength in the sales of credit research and ratings data fees. U.S. and non-U.S. RD&A revenues were each up 7%.
Second, global enterprise risk solutions or ERS revenue of $98 million was up 17% from last year. The growth was driven primarily by the acquisition of GGY as well as growth across all product lines, with particular strength from regulatory and risk measurement product revenues. U.S. and non-U.S. ERS revenues were up 21% and 15%, respectively.
Trailing 12-month revenue and sales for ERS increased 11% and 6%, respectively. As we've noted in the past, due to the variable nature of project timing and completion, ERS revenue and sales remain subject to quarterly volatility.
Third, global professional services revenue of $38 million was down 2% from the prior year period. This result was primarily due to the impact of customer attrition identified last year as well as the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange on the credentials and licensing business. U.S. professional services revenue was flat to the prior year period, while non-U.S. revenue was down 3%.
Turning now to expense. Moody's second quarter expense was $519 million, up 4% from 2015. The increase was primarily due to higher compensation costs in MA, reflecting additional headcount to support business growth, and the acquisition of GGY. MIS expense was down slightly compared to the prior year period. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted expense by 2%.
As Ray noted, Moody's reported operating margin and adjusted operating margin were 44.2% and 47.5%, respectively, for the second quarter. Moody's effective tax rate for the quarter was 31.9%, up from 30.4% in the second quarter of 2015.
Now I'll provide an update on capital allocation. During the second quarter of 2016, Moody's repurchased 2.3 million shares at a total cost of $224 million or an average cost of $96.60 per share, and issued 249,000 shares as part of its employee stock compensation -- stock-based compensation plans.
Moody's also paid $72 million in dividends during the quarter. And on July 12, announced a quarterly dividend of $0.37 per share of Moody's common stock, payable September 12, to stockholders of record at the close of business on August 22. Over the first half of 2016, Moody's repurchased 5.2 million shares at a total cost of $486 million or an average cost of $92.83 per share. The company also returned $144 million to its shareholders via dividend payments during the same period.
Outstanding shares as of June 30, 2016, totaled 192 million, down 4% from June 30, 2015. As of June 30, 2016, Moody's had $1 billion of share repurchase authority remaining.
At quarter-end, Moody's had $3.4 billion of outstanding debt and $1 billion of additional debt capacity available under its revolving credit facility. Total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at quarter-end were $2 billion, with approximately 78% held outside the U S.
Free cash flow in the first 6 months of 2016 was $475 million, down 14% from the first 6 months of 2015, primarily due to lower net income.
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Ray."
528325,370137186,1011023,"Moody's Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 22, 2016",2016-07-22,"Earnings Calls","Moody's Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Linda. I'll conclude this morning's prepared comments by discussing changes to our full year guidance for 2016. A full list of Moody's guidance is included in our second quarter 2016 earnings press release, which can be found on Moody's Investor R",635,"Thanks, Linda. I'll conclude this morning's prepared comments by discussing changes to our full year guidance for 2016. A full list of Moody's guidance is included in our second quarter 2016 earnings press release, which can be found on Moody's Investor Relations website at ir.moodys.com.
Moody's current outlook for 2016 is based on assumptions about many geopolitical conditions and macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, corporate profitability, business investment spending, mergers and acquisitions, consumer borrowing and securitization and the amount of debt issued. These assumptions are subject to uncertainty, and results for the full year could differ materially from our current outlook.
Our guidance assumes foreign currency translation at end-of-quarter exchange rates. Specifically, our forecast reflects exchange rates for the British pound of $1.34 to GBP 1 and for the euro of $1.11 to EUR 1. Based on our current business mix, the annualized impact of a $0.01 decline in the euro against the U.S. dollar equals approximately a $0.01 decline in our annualized EPS. On the other hand, a $0.01 decline in the British pound against the U.S. dollar has a minimal impact to EPS.
As I noted earlier, Moody's is reaffirming our full year 2016 EPS guidance of $4.55 to $4.65 and expects to be toward the lower end of the range. Moody's full year 2016 revenue is still expected to increase in the low single-digit percent range. Moody's operating expense is still expected to increase in the mid-single-digit percent range.
For MIS, Moody's now expects 2016 revenue to decrease in the low single-digit percent range, reflecting reduced guidance for our non-U.S. MIS revenue, which we now also expect to decrease in the low single-digit percent range. U.S. revenue is still expected to decrease in the low single-digit percent range.
Structured finance revenue is now expected to decrease in the high single-digit percent range. For MA, 2016 revenue is now expected to increase in the mid-single-digit percent range. U.S. revenue is still expected to increase in the low double-digit percent range while non-U.S. revenue is now expected to increase in the low single-digit percent range.
Before we move to the Q&A, I would like to highlight 3 items, including investments we made earlier this week in Korea, an award won by MIS and the launch of a new MA product. On Monday, Moody's announced it has acquired full ownership of Korean Investors Service or KIS, a leading provider of domestic credit ratings in Korea. Moody's and KIS have had a long-standing and productive relationship since 2001. We believe that an even closer partnership and continued investment in the business will enable us to capitalize on the opportunities for growth and better serve the market in Korea. The acquisition is not expected to have a significant impact on Moody's earnings per share for 2016 and has been funded from international cash on hand.
Additionally, MIS was voted Best Credit-Rating Agency in a 2016 poll of U.S. fixed income investors conducted by the publisher Institutional Investor. This is the fifth year in a row that MIS has won this award. I appreciate the market's recognition of our efforts, and I applaud the accomplishments of our MIS colleagues.
And finally, yesterday, we announced the launch of Moody's Analytics Risk Quality Score or MARQ, a tool to help private companies understand their credit profile and support bank lending to small businesses. The MARQ score and the related web portal are a result of our collaboration with Finagraph, a financial technology company in which we made a minority investment earlier this year.
This concludes our prepared remarks. And joining Linda and me for the question-and-answer session are Mark Almeida, President of Moody's Analytics; and Rob Fauber, President of Moody's Investors Service. We'd be pleased to take any questions that you might have."

As we said in the prepared remarks, it's really uncertainty about international issuance activity that's driving a somewhat more cautious outlook. And I would have to add that since the Brexit vote on June 23, we haven't seen much activity in international issuance. Average daily issuance volumes are down in, really, all key markets except for U.S. investment grade. That being said, the timing of the vote does coincide with a seasonal decline in issuance that we typically see in July and August, especially again in the euro market. So trying to assess at this point the decrease in issuance for -- as a result of uncertainty about the leave vote versus normal seasonal factors actually is a bit difficult. So hopefully, we are being more cautious than we need to be, but that's what's influencing our thinking. And we also think it's going to have an impact outside the corporate sector in structured finance. So that's really what's informing our views at this point."

So we'll put up now the slide that talks about our usual views from investment banks and capital markets economists, and the points here cover both financial and nonfinancial U.S. dollar issuance, and their ways of counting things may not align with our revenue categorization. But looking at U.S. investment grade, the market has been quite resilient post-Brexit. All-in yields are below previous record lows. The 10-year's at 1.59 this morning and spreads are quite attractive. M&A-related financing continues to be a strong driver. Favorable market conditions are expected to encourage opportunistic issuance post-earnings blackouts. So as Ray said, this is typically a slow period. And full year estimated issuance forecasts range from flat to up 10%. High-yield new issuance in Q2 was the strongest it's been in a year, but we expected to see that given that the Brexit situation had backed up that market a bit. We expect as we move forward in the year, the issuance windows may be shorter. So again, the risk-on, risk-off phenomenon. Full year issuance forecasts range from down 10% to down 20%. Leveraged loans, we're pleased to see CLO issuance has started to reemerge, $30 billion of issuance in CLOs year-to-date. The pipeline is categorized as modest. And full year 2016 estimated issuance forecasts range from down 10% to down 20%. Looking at Europe. Record low coupons as ECB's corporate buying program continues to help the market and keeps yields low. U.S. corporates are seeing value in moving to Europe, and we expect that to continue throughout the rest of the year. And supply has slowed as we've entered the traditional summer period, and many issuers came to the market before the Brexit vote on June 23. European high-yield, the markets reopened after a period of muted issuance following the Brexit vote. But again, issuance windows are going to be shorter due to the macroeconomic view and the summer slowdown. And investors are moving down to speculative-grade securities to search for yield, given the low prevailing yield climate right at the moment. So with that backdrop, I'll ask Rob if he wants to speak a little bit further about how we came to this view on MIS' components and guidance. Rob?"

And this week, as Linda mentioned, we've seen some activity in the European high-yield market. So we have resumed issuance activity. I would say we just balanced out with, as Linda said, the potential for some headline risk and these risk-on, risk-off windows as we go through the year. And I think the greatest sensitivity to these windows will be in European leveraged finance."

And we will make appropriate decisions for ourselves and for Moody's as decisions are being made in terms of the nature of the U.K's participation in the European economy on a going-forward basis. We really can't do anything until we see some more clarity around those decisions. And so we are obviously attentive, and we are preparing for a variety of outcomes.

Tim, this is a little tricky to follow so let me try to lay this out, and I'm going to need a paragraph or 2 here to explain this appropriately. So last quarter, we told you we've lowered our projected base business spending for the year by about $50 million, and we commented on the fact that it comes from expense management actions and reduced incentive compensation. So that was $50 million in reduction, which was great. But those savings were entirely offset by the addition of the GGY acquisition's operating expenses and the negative impact of foreign currency translation. So we were down $50 million, but $50 million came back from GGY and FX. Now since last quarter, we've done better with our cost savings than we thought we would. And additionally, we expect less negative impact from FX. So while we still have a partial offset from adding GGY's expenses, we now think we're going to be about $20 million in lower expenses versus the 0 net impact before. So we continue to work on this. We're very committed to ensuring that our expenses are in the right place. But again, the nature of the company is that we can't reduce things immediately given a more challenging revenue quarter like we had in the first quarter, but we do think we've made good progress on bending the curve and moving the run rate, which we'll continue to show you but probably more heavily in the fourth quarter than the third quarter. So I hope that's thorough enough for you, and sorry it's not a particularly simple explanation. That work for you, Tim?"

We've got 2 things hitting the margin. We've got the GGY acquisition. And the dynamics there are that in this year, we are getting more expense than revenue, not because it's not a profitable business, but just because of the accounting treatment of the acquired revenue. We take a haircut on that this year, and we've got the integration costs associated with the acquisition as well as some deal costs. So we've got -- it's certainly dilutive to the margin this year from the GGY acquisition. And then we've also got the point that Linda made about our attracting more corporate overhead as our share of total MCO revenue goes up. If you adjust for those 2 things, you'd actually see some modest margin improvement in MA. So certainly all of the work that we're doing and the plans that we have to achieve margin expansion in MA are in place. We continue to move forward on those. We like the progress we're making. So from an operational perspective, we feel very good about where we are. It's just the way the numbers move around, it's difficult to see that on the P&L in the short run."

So we did anticipate this question as to why this hasn't been more helpful to our EPS. So while those numbers are correct, as you move down the P&L, the benefit is not as strong. So currently, our entity structure takes away some of that benefit, and reported revenue and expense activities in British pounds essentially offset each other given the way we have some of our legal entities and tax structuring set up. The existing structure reflects various operational, financial and legal considerations, and we look at those and make adjustments when appropriate. Following the Brexit vote, we're frankly going to have to wait and see what happens to see how we best might react to that, but right now the situation's very unclear. So you're correct, there is a mismatch, but as you move down through the operating structure we presently have in place, those numbers become more evenly matched.

The corporate finance was -- and structured finance were both up double digits in Europe in the second quarter. And we are attributing a portion of that to likely pull-forward. And the fact that post-Brexit, we went several weeks without really seeing much of any activity in terms of European issuance, just reinforces that belief that we had some pull-forward. I would also, I guess, take this opportunity to just highlight that if we are correct about that pull-forward and correct about the slump in issuance activity being a result of Brexit as opposed to just seasonal, we would expect to see a more pronounced sawtooth pattern this year than we might have otherwise expected, so less issuance and revenue in the third quarter and, as a timing matter, probably more than we had anticipated in the fourth quarter.

It's really an intelligence-gathering phase at this point. There's not a lot that we feel we can appropriately do in terms of any changes to our activities at this point in time, but we want to be prepared to make any appropriate changes depending on how this process plays out. But I do want to emphasize that however it plays out, it looks like we're going to have a good, long lead time to respond. So I don't think this is going to be a process that surprises us in terms of some negative consequence to the company that we don't have time to adjust to well before any decisions become effective."

It's probably useful to add that we're conducting business as usual with a very close eye on our expense base. I think you saw that we've guided to 4% expense growth this year, and it's pretty simple actually. We're directing headcount and other resources toward the Moody's Analytics business in sort of a 2/3, 1/3 split, with the rating agency getting the 1/3 because the rating agency is having a little bit of a softer patch. In fact, for the rating agency, Q2 expenses were down 2% year-over-year, and most of the expense work that we've been doing comes on the T&E line and other things having to do with both the rating agency and the shared services organization. So we're -- we are investing in the businesses that are performing well. I think we're being very thoughtful on the rating agency, and we are being really thoughtful on the shared services part of the organization. So we feel good about how we're managing all of this. We continue with the acquisitions, including GGY and the remainder of KIS, but we've had these periods before, and we tend to work through them and conditions do change from quarter-to-quarter."

I will then conclude with comments on our current outlook for 2016. After our prepared remarks, we'll be happy to respond to your questions.
In the second quarter, Moody's revenue of $929 million increased 1% from the second quarter of 2015 despite a challenging year-on-year comparable. Moody's Analytics delivered its 34th consecutive quarter of revenue growth while Moody's Investors Service attained its second highest quarterly revenue ever, only surpassed by its performance in the same period last year.
Operating expense for the second quarter was $519 million, up 4% from the second quarter of 2015. Operating income was $410 million, a 2% decline from the prior year period. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted operating income by 1%. Adjusted operating income, defined as operating income before depreciation and amortization, was $441 million, down 1% from the same period last year. Operating margin for the second quarter of 2016 was 44.2%. The adjusted operating margin was 47.5%. Diluted earnings per share of $1.30 was up 2% from the prior year period.
Turning to year-to-date performance. Moody's revenue for the first half of 2016 was $1.7 billion, a decline of 2% from the prior year period. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, revenue declined 1%. Revenue at Moody's Investors Service was $1.2 billion, a decline of 7% from 2015. Revenue at Moody's Analytics was $594 million, 10% higher than the prior year period.
Operating expense in the first half of 2016 was $1 billion, up 4% from the prior period. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, operating expense was up 6%. Operating income was $714 million, down 10% from the -- was down 10% from the first half of 2015. The impact of foreign currency translation was negligible. Adjusted operating income of $775 million was down 8% from the prior year period. Moody's reported operating margin was 40.9% and its adjusted operating margin was 44.4%. The effective tax rate for the first half of 2016 was 32.1%, up from 31.5% from the prior year period.
Despite a good second quarter, we have modestly reduced certain elements of our revenue guidance due to our more cautious outlook for issuance outside the U.S. following the British referendum to leave the European Union and the expected negative impact of foreign currency translation. As a result, we expect to be at the lower end of our $4.55 to $4.65 EPS guidance range.
I'll now turn the call over to Linda to provide further commentary on our financial results and other updates."

I'll begin with revenue at the company level. As Ray mentioned, Moody's total revenue for the second quarter was $929 million, up 1% from the prior year period.

As Ray mentioned, Moody's total revenue for the second quarter was $929 million, up 1% from the prior year period. U.S. revenue of $546 million was flat to the second quarter of 2015. Non-U.S. revenue of $383 million was up 3% and represented 41% of Moody's total revenue. The impact of foreign currency translation on MCO revenue was negligible.
Recurring revenue of $467 million was up 6% and represented 50% of total revenue. Looking now at each of our businesses. Starting with Moody's Investors Service. Total MIS revenue for the quarter was $626 million, down 2% from the prior year period but up 19% from the first quarter. U.S. revenue declined 3% to $399 million while non-U.S. revenue of $227 million was flat to the prior period and represented 36% of total ratings revenue. The impact of foreign currency translation on MIS revenue was negligible.
Moving to the lines of business for MIS. First, global corporate finance revenue of $305 million in the second quarter was down 5% from the prior year period. This result primarily reflected lower levels of U.S. speculative-grade and Asian investment-grade issuance despite increased activity from the first quarter. U.S. and non-U.S. corporate finance revenues were down 4% and 6%, respectively.
Second, global structured finance revenue for the second quarter was $112 million, down 8% from the prior year period as reduced U.S. CLO and CMBS activity was only partially offset by increased European structured finance activity. U.S. structured finance revenue was down 16% while non-U.S. revenue was up 14%.
Third, global financial institutions revenue of $90 million was down 1% from the prior year period. U.S. financial institutions revenue was up 7% while non-U.S. revenue was down 7%.
Fourth, global public, project and infrastructure finance revenue of $112 million was up 12% versus the prior year period, primarily as a result of increased global infrastructure-related issuance. U.S. and non-U.S. public, project and infrastructure finance revenues were up 11% and 16%, respectively.
MIS other, which consists of non-rating revenues from ICRA in India and Korea Investors Service, contributed $7 million to MIS revenue for the second quarter, down 10% from the prior year period.
And turning now to Moody's Analytics. Global revenue for MA of $303 million was up 9% from the second quarter of 2015. U.S. revenue of $147 million was up 10% year-over-year. Non-U.S. revenue of $156 million was up 8% and represented 52% of total MA revenue. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted MA revenue by 1%. Excluding revenue from our March 2016 acquisition of GGY, MA revenue grew 6%.
Moving now to the lines of business for MA. First, global research, data and analytics or RD&A revenue of $168 million was up 7% from the prior year period and represented 55% of total MA revenue. Growth was mainly due to strength in the sales of credit research and ratings data fees. U.S. and non-U.S. RD&A revenues were each up 7%.
Second, global enterprise risk solutions or ERS revenue of $98 million was up 17% from last year. The growth was driven primarily by the acquisition of GGY as well as growth across all product lines, with particular strength from regulatory and risk measurement product revenues. U.S. and non-U.S. ERS revenues were up 21% and 15%, respectively.
Trailing 12-month revenue and sales for ERS increased 11% and 6%, respectively. As we've noted in the past, due to the variable nature of project timing and completion, ERS revenue and sales remain subject to quarterly volatility.
Third, global professional services revenue of $38 million was down 2% from the prior year period. This result was primarily due to the impact of customer attrition identified last year as well as the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange on the credentials and licensing business. U.S. professional services revenue was flat to the prior year period, while non-U.S. revenue was down 3%.
Turning now to expense. Moody's second quarter expense was $519 million, up 4% from 2015. The increase was primarily due to higher compensation costs in MA, reflecting additional headcount to support business growth, and the acquisition of GGY. MIS expense was down slightly compared to the prior year period. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted expense by 2%.
As Ray noted, Moody's reported operating margin and adjusted operating margin were 44.2% and 47.5%, respectively, for the second quarter. Moody's effective tax rate for the quarter was 31.9%, up from 30.4% in the second quarter of 2015.
Now I'll provide an update on capital allocation. During the second quarter of 2016, Moody's repurchased 2.3 million shares at a total cost of $224 million or an average cost of $96.60 per share, and issued 249,000 shares as part of its employee stock compensation -- stock-based compensation plans.
Moody's also paid $72 million in dividends during the quarter. And on July 12, announced a quarterly dividend of $0.37 per share of Moody's common stock, payable September 12, to stockholders of record at the close of business on August 22. Over the first half of 2016, Moody's repurchased 5.2 million shares at a total cost of $486 million or an average cost of $92.83 per share. The company also returned $144 million to its shareholders via dividend payments during the same period.
Outstanding shares as of June 30, 2016, totaled 192 million, down 4% from June 30, 2015. As of June 30, 2016, Moody's had $1 billion of share repurchase authority remaining.
At quarter-end, Moody's had $3.4 billion of outstanding debt and $1 billion of additional debt capacity available under its revolving credit facility. Total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at quarter-end were $2 billion, with approximately 78% held outside the U S.
Free cash flow in the first 6 months of 2016 was $475 million, down 14% from the first 6 months of 2015, primarily due to lower net income.
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Ray."

I'll conclude this morning's prepared comments by discussing changes to our full year guidance for 2016. A full list of Moody's guidance is included in our second quarter 2016 earnings press release, which can be found on Moody's Investor R",635,"Thanks, Linda. I'll conclude this morning's prepared comments by discussing changes to our full year guidance for 2016. A full list of Moody's guidance is included in our second quarter 2016 earnings press release, which can be found on Moody's Investor Relations website at ir.moodys.com.
Moody's current outlook for 2016 is based on assumptions about many geopolitical conditions and macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, corporate profitability, business investment spending, mergers and acquisitions, consumer borrowing and securitization and the amount of debt issued. These assumptions are subject to uncertainty, and results for the full year could differ materially from our current outlook.
Our guidance assumes foreign currency translation at end-of-quarter exchange rates. Specifically, our forecast reflects exchange rates for the British pound of $1.34 to GBP 1 and for the euro of $1.11 to EUR 1. Based on our current business mix, the annualized impact of a $0.01 decline in the euro against the U.S. dollar equals approximately a $0.01 decline in our annualized EPS. On the other hand, a $0.01 decline in the British pound against the U.S. dollar has a minimal impact to EPS.
As I noted earlier, Moody's is reaffirming our full year 2016 EPS guidance of $4.55 to $4.65 and expects to be toward the lower end of the range. Moody's full year 2016 revenue is still expected to increase in the low single-digit percent range. Moody's operating expense is still expected to increase in the mid-single-digit percent range.
For MIS, Moody's now expects 2016 revenue to decrease in the low single-digit percent range, reflecting reduced guidance for our non-U.S. MIS revenue, which we now also expect to decrease in the low single-digit percent range. U.S. revenue is still expected to decrease in the low single-digit percent range.
Structured finance revenue is now expected to decrease in the high single-digit percent range. For MA, 2016 revenue is now expected to increase in the mid-single-digit percent range. U.S. revenue is still expected to increase in the low double-digit percent range while non-U.S. revenue is now expected to increase in the low single-digit percent range.
Before we move to the Q&A, I would like to highlight 3 items, including investments we made earlier this week in Korea, an award won by MIS and the launch of a new MA product. On Monday, Moody's announced it has acquired full ownership of Korean Investors Service or KIS, a leading provider of domestic credit ratings in Korea. Moody's and KIS have had a long-standing and productive relationship since 2001. We believe that an even closer partnership and continued investment in the business will enable us to capitalize on the opportunities for growth and better serve the market in Korea. The acquisition is not expected to have a significant impact on Moody's earnings per share for 2016 and has been funded from international cash on hand.
Additionally, MIS was voted Best Credit-Rating Agency in a 2016 poll of U.S. fixed income investors conducted by the publisher Institutional Investor. This is the fifth year in a row that MIS has won this award. I appreciate the market's recognition of our efforts, and I applaud the accomplishments of our MIS colleagues.
And finally, yesterday, we announced the launch of Moody's Analytics Risk Quality Score or MARQ, a tool to help private companies understand their credit profile and support bank lending to small businesses. The MARQ score and the related web portal are a result of our collaboration with Finagraph, a financial technology company in which we made a minority investment earlier this year.
This concludes our prepared remarks. And joining Linda and me for the question-and-answer session are Mark Almeida, President of Moody's Analytics; and Rob Fauber, President of Moody's Investors Service. We'd be pleased to take any questions that you might have."

As we said in the prepared remarks, it's really uncertainty about international issuance activity that's driving a somewhat more cautious outlook. And I would have to add that since the Brexit vote on June 23, we haven't seen much activity in international issuance. Average daily issuance volumes are down in, really, all key markets except for U.S. investment grade. That being said, the timing of the vote does coincide with a seasonal decline in issuance that we typically see in July and August, especially again in the euro market. So trying to assess at this point the decrease in issuance for -- as a result of uncertainty about the leave vote versus normal seasonal factors actually is a bit difficult. So hopefully, we are being more cautious than we need to be, but that's what's influencing our thinking. And we also think it's going to have an impact outside the corporate sector in structured finance. So that's really what's informing our views at this point."

So we'll put up now the slide that talks about our usual views from investment banks and capital markets economists, and the points here cover both financial and nonfinancial U.S. dollar issuance, and their ways of counting things may not align with our revenue categorization. But looking at U.S. investment grade, the market has been quite resilient post-Brexit. All-in yields are below previous record lows. The 10-year's at 1.59 this morning and spreads are quite attractive. M&A-related financing continues to be a strong driver. Favorable market conditions are expected to encourage opportunistic issuance post-earnings blackouts. So as Ray said, this is typically a slow period. And full year estimated issuance forecasts range from flat to up 10%. High-yield new issuance in Q2 was the strongest it's been in a year, but we expected to see that given that the Brexit situation had backed up that market a bit. We expect as we move forward in the year, the issuance windows may be shorter. So again, the risk-on, risk-off phenomenon. Full year issuance forecasts range from down 10% to down 20%. Leveraged loans, we're pleased to see CLO issuance has started to reemerge, $30 billion of issuance in CLOs year-to-date. The pipeline is categorized as modest. And full year 2016 estimated issuance forecasts range from down 10% to down 20%. Looking at Europe. Record low coupons as ECB's corporate buying program continues to help the market and keeps yields low. U.S. corporates are seeing value in moving to Europe, and we expect that to continue throughout the rest of the year. And supply has slowed as we've entered the traditional summer period, and many issuers came to the market before the Brexit vote on June 23. European high-yield, the markets reopened after a period of muted issuance following the Brexit vote. But again, issuance windows are going to be shorter due to the macroeconomic view and the summer slowdown. And investors are moving down to speculative-grade securities to search for yield, given the low prevailing yield climate right at the moment. So with that backdrop, I'll ask Rob if he wants to speak a little bit further about how we came to this view on MIS' components and guidance. Rob?"

And this week, as Linda mentioned, we've seen some activity in the European high-yield market. So we have resumed issuance activity. I would say we just balanced out with, as Linda said, the potential for some headline risk and these risk-on, risk-off windows as we go through the year. And I think the greatest sensitivity to these windows will be in European leveraged finance."

And we will make appropriate decisions for ourselves and for Moody's as decisions are being made in terms of the nature of the U.K's participation in the European economy on a going-forward basis. We really can't do anything until we see some more clarity around those decisions. And so we are obviously attentive, and we are preparing for a variety of outcomes.

Tim, this is a little tricky to follow so let me try to lay this out, and I'm going to need a paragraph or 2 here to explain this appropriately. So last quarter, we told you we've lowered our projected base business spending for the year by about $50 million, and we commented on the fact that it comes from expense management actions and reduced incentive compensation. So that was $50 million in reduction, which was great. But those savings were entirely offset by the addition of the GGY acquisition's operating expenses and the negative impact of foreign currency translation. So we were down $50 million, but $50 million came back from GGY and FX. Now since last quarter, we've done better with our cost savings than we thought we would. And additionally, we expect less negative impact from FX. So while we still have a partial offset from adding GGY's expenses, we now think we're going to be about $20 million in lower expenses versus the 0 net impact before. So we continue to work on this. We're very committed to ensuring that our expenses are in the right place. But again, the nature of the company is that we can't reduce things immediately given a more challenging revenue quarter like we had in the first quarter, but we do think we've made good progress on bending the curve and moving the run rate, which we'll continue to show you but probably more heavily in the fourth quarter than the third quarter. So I hope that's thorough enough for you, and sorry it's not a particularly simple explanation. That work for you, Tim?"

It's meeting our expectations for when we took majority control of ICRA. I think China's a different story in the sense that really not much has developed on the policy and regulatory side in recent months, but we have seen defaults occurring in the Chinese market. And you may recall, we've talked about this before, that how that market evolves in terms of the willingness to allow credit problems to be revealed in the market rather than protected, whether through the banking system or the government, is going to be important for the role of particularly credit ratings that we're offering, but also our research. So I'm not obviously rooting for any companies to default. But in terms of the market structure development, I think it's promising to see that distressed companies are being allowed to fail. So that's a promising development."

We've got 2 things hitting the margin. We've got the GGY acquisition. And the dynamics there are that in this year, we are getting more expense than revenue, not because it's not a profitable business, but just because of the accounting treatment of the acquired revenue. We take a haircut on that this year, and we've got the integration costs associated with the acquisition as well as some deal costs. So we've got -- it's certainly dilutive to the margin this year from the GGY acquisition. And then we've also got the point that Linda made about our attracting more corporate overhead as our share of total MCO revenue goes up. If you adjust for those 2 things, you'd actually see some modest margin improvement in MA.

So we did anticipate this question as to why this hasn't been more helpful to our EPS. So while those numbers are correct, as you move down the P&L, the benefit is not as strong. So currently, our entity structure takes away some of that benefit, and reported revenue and expense activities in British pounds essentially offset each other given the way we have some of our legal entities and tax structuring set up. The existing structure reflects various operational, financial and legal considerations, and we look at those and make adjustments when appropriate. Following the Brexit vote, we're frankly going to have to wait and see what happens to see how we best might react to that, but right now the situation's very unclear. So you're correct, there is a mismatch, but as you move down through the operating structure we presently have in place, those numbers become more evenly matched.

The corporate finance was -- and structured finance were both up double digits in Europe in the second quarter. And we are attributing a portion of that to likely pull-forward. And the fact that post-Brexit, we went several weeks without really seeing much of any activity in terms of European issuance, just reinforces that belief that we had some pull-forward. I would also, I guess, take this opportunity to just highlight that if we are correct about that pull-forward and correct about the slump in issuance activity being a result of Brexit as opposed to just seasonal, we would expect to see a more pronounced sawtooth pattern this year than we might have otherwise expected, so less issuance and revenue in the third quarter and, as a timing matter, probably more than we had anticipated in the fourth quarter.

As negotiations move forward, there are elections in France and Germany and the Netherlands next year. There's a constitutional vote in Italy later this year. So there are lots of things that are going to be happening that Brexit may influence or may influence the timing of the leave decision and the notice.

So as we thought about this, we kept our range, and we indicate the lower end of the range, but I think it would be very fair to say there's an unusual amount of uncertainty around this. And it could break either way. We just don't know. If conditions continue to be very attractive and we see pull-forward in the fourth quarter, this could turn out differently, but we think it's prudent given all these various factors which are causing a lot of choppiness that we think about it in this manner. And I don't know if Rob Fauber had anything further that he wanted to say about this, but this was a tough set of guidance for us to work through."

We're directing headcount and other resources toward the Moody's Analytics business in sort of a 2/3, 1/3 split, with the rating agency getting the 1/3 because the rating agency is having a little bit of a softer patch. In fact, for the rating agency, Q2 expenses were down 2% year-over-year, and most of the expense work that we've been doing comes on the T&E line and other things having to do with both the rating agency and the shared services organization. So we're -- we are investing in the businesses that are performing well. I think we're being very thoughtful on the rating agency, and we are being really thoughtful on the shared services part of the organization. So we feel good about how we're managing all of this. We continue with the acquisitions, including GGY and the remainder of KIS, but we've had these periods before, and we tend to work through them and conditions do change from quarter-to-quarter."

I'll then conclude with a litigation update and comments on our current outlook for 2016. After our prepared remarks, we'll be happy to respond to your questions.
In the third quarter, Moody's revenue of $917 million increased 10% primarily as a result of record third quarter revenue for Moody's Investors Service, driven by higher-leveraged finance issuance in U.S. public finance activity as well as solid growth for Moody's Analytics.
Operating expense for the third quarter was $520 million, up 7% from the third quarter of 2015 and included an $8.4 million restructuring charge associated with cost management initiatives. Operating income was $398 million, a 14% increase from the prior year period.
The impact of foreign currency translation on operating income was negligible. Adjusted operating income, defined as operating income before depreciation, amortization and the aforementioned restructuring charge, was $439 million, up 16% from the same period last year. The reported operating margin for the third quarter of 2016 was 43.3%, and the adjusted operating margin was 47.8%.
GAAP EPS of $1.31 was up 15% from the third quarter of 2015. Non-GAAP EPS of $1.34 was up 21%. Third quarter 2016 non-GAAP EPS excludes a $0.03 impact from the restructuring charge. Third quarter 2015 non-GAAP EPS excludes a $0.03 benefit from a legacy tax matter.
Turning to year-to-date performance. Moody's revenue for the first 9 months of 2016 was $2.7 billion, an increase of 2% from the prior year period. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted revenue by 1%. Revenue at Moody's Investors Service was $1.8 billion, a decline of 1% from 2015.
Revenue at Moody's Analytics was $899 million, 8% higher than the prior year period. Operating expense in the first 9 months of 2016 was $1.6 billion, up 5% from the prior year. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted expense by 2%. Operating income was $1.1 billion, down 2% from the first 9 months of 2015. The impact of foreign currency translation was negligible.
Adjusted operating income of $1.2 billion was down 1% from the prior year period. Moody's reported operating margin was 41.8% and its adjusted operating margin was 45.7%. The effective tax rate for the first 9 months of 2016 was 31.5%, down from 31.7% in the same period in 2015.
In light of the strong third quarter performance, coupled with continued expense management, we are increasing our full year 2016 GAAP EPS guidance to a range of $4.76 to $4.86, which includes an anticipated noncash foreign exchange gain of $0.18 related to a subsidiary reorganization, offset in part by a $0.04 restructuring charge.
Excluding the gain and the restructuring charge, the non-GAAP EPS guidance range is now $4.62 to $4.72.
I'll turn the call over to Linda to provide further commentary on our financial results and other updates."

I'll begin with revenue at the company level. As Ray mentioned, Moody's total revenue for the third quarter was $917 million, up 10% from the prior year period.

As Ray mentioned, Moody's total revenue for the third quarter was $917 million, up 10% from the prior year period. U.S. revenue of $546 million was up 13% from the third quarter of 2015. Non-U.S. revenue of $371 million was up 5% and represented 40% of Moody's total revenue. The impact of foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted Moody's revenue by 1%. Recurring revenue of $460 million was up 3% and represented 50% of total revenue.
And looking now at each of our businesses, starting with Moody's Investors Service. Total MIS revenue for the quarter, $612 million, up 12% from the prior year period. U.S. revenue increased 11% to $391 million. Non-U.S. revenue of $221 million was up 13% to the prior year period and represented 36% of total ratings revenue. The impact of foreign currency translation on MIS revenue was negligible.
Moving to the lines of business for MIS. First, global corporate finance revenue for the third quarter of $300 million was up 21% from the prior year period. This result primarily reflected higher levels of bank loan and speculative-grade bond issuance as strong investor demand and tighter credit spreads drove debt refinancing activity. U.S. and non-U.S. corporate finance revenues were up 16% and 32% respectively.
Second, global structured finance revenue for the third quarter, $104 million, down 7% from the prior year period as reduced U.S. CMBS and CLO activity was only partially offset by increased U.S. RMBS and REIT activity. U.S. and non-U.S. structured finance revenues were down 9% and 4% respectively.
Third, global financial institutions revenue of $96 million was up 7% from the prior year period as a result of decreased -- as a result of, excuse me, increased Asian banking issuance. U.S. and non-U.S. financial institutions revenue were up 2% and 11% respectively.
Fourth, global public, project and infrastructure finance revenue of $105 million was up 16% versus the prior year period, primarily driven by strong U.S. public finance issuance. U.S. public, project and infrastructure finance revenue was up 29%, while non-U.S. revenue was down 8%. MIS Other, which consists of non-rating revenue from ICRA and India and Korea Investors Service, contributed $8 million to MIS revenue for the third quarter, up 4% from the prior year period.
And turning now to Moody's Analytics. Global revenue for MA of $305 million was up 6% from the third quarter of 2015. U.S. revenue of $154 million was up 19% year-over-year. Non-U.S. revenue of $150 million was down 4% and represented 49% of total MA revenue. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted MA revenue by 3%.
Excluding revenue from our March 2016 acquisition of GGY, MA revenue grew 3%.
Moving now to the lines of business for MA. First, global research data and analytics, or RD&A, revenue of $168 million was up 6% from the prior year period and represented 55% of total MA revenue. Growth was mainly driven by strong sales of credit research and ratings data fees. U.S. RD&A revenue was up 14%, while non-U.S. revenue was down 4%. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted RD&A revenue by 3%.
Second, global enterprise risk solutions, or ERS, revenue of $102 million was up 10% from last year. The growth was driven primarily by the March 2016 acquisition of GGY as well as growth in the credit assessment and stress testing product lines. U.S. ERS revenue was up 39%, while non-U.S. revenue was down 3%. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted ERS revenue by 4%. 
Trailing 12-month revenue and sales for ERS increased 10% and 5% respectively. 
As we've noted in the past, due to the variable nature of project timing and completion, ERS revenue and sales remain subject to quarterly volatility.
Third, global professional services revenue of $36 million was down 3% from the prior year period. U.S. professional services revenue was up 6%, while non-U.S. revenue was down 7%.
Turning now to expenses. Moody's third quarter expense was $520 million, down -- excuse me, up 7% from 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to additional headcount in MA to support business growth and from the March acquisition of GGY, the restructuring charge and increased incentive compensation across the company. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted expense by 2%.
Moody's reported operating margin increased 140 basis points to 43.3% in the third quarter, and adjusted operating margin increased by 250 basis points to 47.8%. Moody's effective tax rate for the quarter was 30.5%, down from 32% in the third quarter of 2015.
Now I'll provide an update on capital allocation. During the third quarter of 2016, Moody's repurchased 1.9 million shares at a total cost of $193 million or an average cost of $103 per share and issued 798,000 shares as part of its employee stock-based compensation plan. Moody's also paid $71 million in dividends during the quarter. On October 18, Moody's announced a quarterly dividend of $0.37 per share of Moody's common stock, payable December 12, to stockholders of record at the close of business on November 21.
Over the first 9 months of 2016, Moody's repurchased 7.1 million shares at a total cost of $679 million or an average cost of $95.51 per share and issued 2.7 million shares as part of its employee stock-based compensation plan. Additionally, Moody's returned $215 million to its shareholders via dividend payments during the first 9 months of 2016.
Outstanding shares as of September 30, 2016, totaled $191.2 million, down 3% from September 30, 2015. As of September 30, 2016, Moody's had $787 million of share repurchase authority remaining.
At quarter end, Moody's had $3.4 billion of outstanding debt and $1 billion of additional borrowing capacity under its commercial paper program, which is backstopped by an undrawn $1 billion revolving credit facility. Total cash, cash equivalent and short-term investments at quarter end were $2.1 billion with approximately 80% held outside the U.S.
Free cash flow in the first 9 months of 2016 [ph] was $772 million, down 7% from the first 9 months of 2015, primarily due to lower net income.
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Ray."

Thanks, Linda. As we disclosed in today's earnings release, on September 29, we've received a letter from the Department of Justice indicating that it is preparing a civil complaint against Moody's alleging violations of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act in connection with ratings MIS assigned to RMBS and CDOs leading up to the 2008 financial crisis.
As we've previously disclosed, following the global credit crisis of 2008, Moody's periodically receive subpoenas and inquiries from various governmental authorities, including the DOJ and state attorneys general. The DOJ has advised us that their investigation remains ongoing and may expand to include additional theories. The number of state Attorney General had also indicated they expect to pursue similar claims under state law.
Moody's is continuing to respond to the DOJ and state's subpoenas and inquiries. As I hope you'll appreciate, I'm not going to be able to add anything beyond what I've just said and what we disclosed in our earnings release.
I'll conclude this morning's prepared remarks by discussing the changes to our full year guidance for 2016. The full list of Moody's guidance has included in our third quarter 2016 earnings press release, which can be found on the Investor Relations website at ir.moodys.com.
Moody's current outlook for 2016 is based on assumptions about many geopolitical conditions and macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, corporate profitability and business investment spending, mergers and acquisitions, consumer borrowing and securitization and the amount of debt issued. 
These assumptions are subject to uncertainty and results for the year could differ materially from our current outlook. Our guidance assumes foreign currency translation at end of quarter exchange rates. Specifically, our forecast reflects exchange rates for the British pound of $1.30 to GBP 1 and for the euro of $1.12 to EUR 1. Post third quarter movements in foreign exchange rates had no meaningful impact on the full year 2016 outlook.
As I noted earlier, Moody's is increasing its full year 2016 non-GAAP EPS guidance range to $4.76 to $4.86. Excluding the foreign exchange gain and restructuring charge I mentioned earlier, the non-GAAP EPS guidance range is now $4.62 [ph] to $4.72. The company now expects share repurchases to be approximately $750 million subject to available cash, market conditions and other ongoing capital allocation decisions.
Capital expenditures are now expected to be approximately $120 million. 
For MIS, Moody's now expects 2016 revenue to be approximately flat, reflecting increased guidance for non-U.S. MIS revenue, which we also now expect to be approximately flat. U.S. revenue is still expected to be approximately flat.
Corporate finance revenue is now expected to be approximately flat and structured finance revenue is now expected to decrease in the mid-single-digit percent range. 
Financial institutions revenues now expected to increase in the low-single-digit percent range. 
For Moody's Analytics, we are not anticipating any changes to the outlook items we provided on September 28, 2016.
This concludes our prepared remarks. And joining Linda and me for the question-and-answer session are Mark Almeida, President of Moody's Analytics; and Ralph [indiscernible], President of Moody's Investors Service. We'll be pleased to take any questions you might have."

Looking out into 2017, we think that issuing conditions are probably going to be attractive, and that may encourage pull forward from 2018 and beyond. Part of the reason why we're optimistic about the current outlook for issuance conditions is driven by the fact that we think the default rate in speculative-grade arena is probably peaking right about now over the next month or so and it's going to moderate and come down, which should help spread. So even if official rates are moving up somewhat, we think there's an opportunity to spread tightening and attractive issuance environment."

I'll take a shot at this and I'll talk about the views that we get from the various investment banks. The view first will cover the U.S. and outside the U.S., this financial and non-financial U.S. dollar issuance. Before I start that, though, I think the market is cheered by some larger M&A deal talk that has happened today and recently. So I think that tends to improve confidence. But let's go through these categories. Investment-grade third quarter 2016 [ph] issuance was up 20%. Issuers are taking advantage of the historically low rate and strong investor demand. We do expect the lighter periods of issuance expected in the fourth quarter because of the following 3 factors. Earnings blackouts will continue through October. U.S. elections obviously are November 8. And the Federal Open Market Committee meeting are December 13 and 14. For the rest of 2016, we -- for full year 2016, excuse me, expect issuance in the year up 10%. You'll recall that originally, these projections have been for issuance to be sort of flat to down 10%. So this is better than had been anticipated at the beginning of the year. Our yield third quarter 2016 [ph] issuance was up 35%, which is a very good number. They're again strong investor demand, good pricing and opportunistic issuance coming through very favorable factors. Issuance volumes, though, have moderated over the last 2 to 3 weeks and spec grade market activity has shifted in favor of loans. In other words, shifting toward leveraged loans versus bond. And for the full year, we're expecting that the year will be down 5% on high yield, which is less [indiscernible] than some of those initial indications have been back in January. Leveraged loans third quarter 2016 [ph] issuance up 50% [ph], a very large number. Leveraged loan market continues to exhibit strength on the back of opportunistic wave of refinancing activity and growing CLO issuance. Our CLO pipeline is very strong right now, and full year 2016 [ph] issuance expected to end the year up 10%. Again, that's far more favorable than what was predicted at the beginning of the year. In Europe, investment-grade ECB's purchasing program continues to underpin the market. BOE's purchase program also has officially begun. And so you see a lot of U.S. corporate doing reverse-Yankee issues over in Europe as a heavy component of the supply they're in Europe. The high-yield market is also accommodated for issuers and a large portion of deal flow is coming from refinancing activity. September of 2016 [ph] on the high-yield front in Europe was the second-highest month on record and we do have some caution driven by concerns around potential ECB tapering and the timing and extent of any U.S. rate rises, some renewed speculation on hard Brexit and its rhetoric and regional European referendum and elections coming up. So I think generally, much better than we had expected. I think Rob might want to comment a little bit that we continue to see growing strength through the middle and the end of September, which was perhaps a bit better than what we had expected even at Investor Day. So Rob, you want to comment?"

And it's interesting, when you look at the funds flow both in high-yield, while last week, we saw strong small outflow, the prior 2 [ph] weeks were almost $4 billion in inflows and over $11 billion in inflows year-to-date. Similarly, on the bank lending side, that asset class had seen its 11th straight week of inflows, and that's the longest streak since 2014 and almost $3 billion over the last [indiscernible] over the last 11 [ph] weeks. So I think that really supports the market technicals."

I'll begin by summarizing Moody's third quarter and year-to-date 2016 results. Linda will follow with additional financial detail and operating highlights. I'll then conclude with a litigation update and comments on our current outlook for 2016. After our prepared remarks, we'll be happy to respond to your questions.
In the third quarter, Moody's revenue of $917 million increased 10% primarily as a result of record third quarter revenue for Moody's Investors Service, driven by higher-leveraged finance issuance in U.S. public finance activity as well as solid growth for Moody's Analytics.
Operating expense for the third quarter was $520 million, up 7% from the third quarter of 2015 and included an $8.4 million restructuring charge associated with cost management initiatives. Operating income was $398 million, a 14% increase from the prior year period.
The impact of foreign currency translation on operating income was negligible. Adjusted operating income, defined as operating income before depreciation, amortization and the aforementioned restructuring charge, was $439 million, up 16% from the same period last year. The reported operating margin for the third quarter of 2016 was 43.3%, and the adjusted operating margin was 47.8%.
GAAP EPS of $1.31 was up 15% from the third quarter of 2015. Non-GAAP EPS of $1.34 was up 21%. Third quarter 2016 non-GAAP EPS excludes a $0.03 impact from the restructuring charge. Third quarter 2015 non-GAAP EPS excludes a $0.03 benefit from a legacy tax matter.
Turning to year-to-date performance. Moody's revenue for the first 9 months of 2016 was $2.7 billion, an increase of 2% from the prior year period. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted revenue by 1%. Revenue at Moody's Investors Service was $1.8 billion, a decline of 1% from 2015.
Revenue at Moody's Analytics was $899 million, 8% higher than the prior year period. Operating expense in the first 9 months of 2016 was $1.6 billion, up 5% from the prior year. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted expense by 2%. Operating income was $1.1 billion, down 2% from the first 9 months of 2015. The impact of foreign currency translation was negligible.
Adjusted operating income of $1.2 billion was down 1% from the prior year period. Moody's reported operating margin was 41.8% and its adjusted operating margin was 45.7%. The effective tax rate for the first 9 months of 2016 was 31.5%, down from 31.7% in the same period in 2015.
In light of the strong third quarter performance, coupled with continued expense management, we are increasing our full year 2016 GAAP EPS guidance to a range of $4.76 to $4.86, which includes an anticipated noncash foreign exchange gain of $0.18 related to a subsidiary reorganization, offset in part by a $0.04 restructuring charge.
Excluding the gain and the restructuring charge, the non-GAAP EPS guidance range is now $4.62 to $4.72.
I'll turn the call over to Linda to provide further commentary on our financial results and other updates."

And looking now at each of our businesses, starting with Moody's Investors Service. Total MIS revenue for the quarter, $612 million, up 12% from the prior year period. U.S. revenue increased 11% to $391 million. Non-U.S. revenue of $221 million was up 13% to the prior year period and represented 36% of total ratings revenue. The impact of foreign currency translation on MIS revenue was negligible.
Moving to the lines of business for MIS. First, global corporate finance revenue for the third quarter of $300 million was up 21% from the prior year period. This result primarily reflected higher levels of bank loan and speculative-grade bond issuance as strong investor demand and tighter credit spreads drove debt refinancing activity. U.S. and non-U.S. corporate finance revenues were up 16% and 32% respectively.
Second, global structured finance revenue for the third quarter, $104 million, down 7% from the prior year period as reduced U.S. CMBS and CLO activity was only partially offset by increased U.S. RMBS and REIT activity. U.S. and non-U.S. structured finance revenues were down 9% and 4% respectively.
Third, global financial institutions revenue of $96 million was up 7% from the prior year period as a result of decreased -- as a result of, excuse me, increased Asian banking issuance. U.S. and non-U.S. financial institutions revenue were up 2% and 11% respectively.
Fourth, global public, project and infrastructure finance revenue of $105 million was up 16% versus the prior year period, primarily driven by strong U.S. public finance issuance. U.S. public, project and infrastructure finance revenue was up 29%, while non-U.S. revenue was down 8%. MIS Other, which consists of non-rating revenue from ICRA and India and Korea Investors Service, contributed $8 million to MIS revenue for the third quarter, up 4% from the prior year period.
And turning now to Moody's Analytics. Global revenue for MA of $305 million was up 6% from the third quarter of 2015. U.S. revenue of $154 million was up 19% year-over-year. Non-U.S. revenue of $150 million was down 4% and represented 49% of total MA revenue. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted MA revenue by 3%.
Excluding revenue from our March 2016 acquisition of GGY, MA revenue grew 3%.
Moving now to the lines of business for MA. First, global research data and analytics, or RD&A, revenue of $168 million was up 6% from the prior year period and represented 55% of total MA revenue. Growth was mainly driven by strong sales of credit research and ratings data fees. U.S. RD&A revenue was up 14%, while non-U.S. revenue was down 4%. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted RD&A revenue by 3%.
Second, global enterprise risk solutions, or ERS, revenue of $102 million was up 10% from last year. The growth was driven primarily by the March 2016 acquisition of GGY as well as growth in the credit assessment and stress testing product lines. U.S. ERS revenue was up 39%, while non-U.S. revenue was down 3%. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted ERS revenue by 4%. 
Trailing 12-month revenue and sales for ERS increased 10% and 5% respectively. 
As we've noted in the past, due to the variable nature of project timing and completion, ERS revenue and sales remain subject to quarterly volatility.
Third, global professional services revenue of $36 million was down 3% from the prior year period. U.S. professional services revenue was up 6%, while non-U.S. revenue was down 7%.
Turning now to expenses. Moody's third quarter expense was $520 million, down -- excuse me, up 7% from 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to additional headcount in MA to support business growth and from the March acquisition of GGY, the restructuring charge and increased incentive compensation across the company. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted expense by 2%.
Moody's reported operating margin increased 140 basis points to 43.3% in the third quarter, and adjusted operating margin increased by 250 basis points to 47.8%. Moody's effective tax rate for the quarter was 30.5%, down from 32% in the third quarter of 2015.
Now I'll provide an update on capital allocation. During the third quarter of 2016, Moody's repurchased 1.9 million shares at a total cost of $193 million or an average cost of $103 per share and issued 798,000 shares as part of its employee stock-based compensation plan. Moody's also paid $71 million in dividends during the quarter. On October 18, Moody's announced a quarterly dividend of $0.37 per share of Moody's common stock, payable December 12, to stockholders of record at the close of business on November 21.
Over the first 9 months of 2016, Moody's repurchased 7.1 million shares at a total cost of $679 million or an average cost of $95.51 per share and issued 2.7 million shares as part of its employee stock-based compensation plan. Additionally, Moody's returned $215 million to its shareholders via dividend payments during the first 9 months of 2016.
Outstanding shares as of September 30, 2016, totaled $191.2 million, down 3% from September 30, 2015. As of September 30, 2016, Moody's had $787 million of share repurchase authority remaining.
At quarter end, Moody's had $3.4 billion of outstanding debt and $1 billion of additional borrowing capacity under its commercial paper program, which is backstopped by an undrawn $1 billion revolving credit facility. Total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at quarter end were $2.1 billion, with approximately 80% held outside the U.S.
Free cash flow in the first 9 months of 2016 was $772 million, down 7% from the first 9 months of 2015, primarily due to lower net income.
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Ray."

Thanks, Linda. As we disclosed in today's earnings release, on September 29, we received a letter from the Department of Justice indicating that it is preparing a civil complaint against Moody's alleging violations of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act in connection with ratings MIS assigned to RMBS and CDOs leading up to the 2008 financial crisis.
As we had previously disclosed, following the global credit crisis of 2008, Moody's periodically receive subpoenas and inquiries from various governmental authorities, including the DOJ and states attorneys general. The DOJ has advised us that their investigation remains ongoing and may expand to include additional theories. A number of states attorneys general have also indicated they expect to pursue similar claims under state law.
Moody's is continuing to respond to the DOJ and states' subpoenas and inquiries. As I hope you'll appreciate, I'm not going to be able to add anything beyond what I've just said and what we disclosed in our earnings release.
I'll conclude this morning's prepared remarks by discussing the changes to our full year guidance for 2016. A full list of Moody's guidance is included in our third quarter 2016 earnings press release, which can be found on the Investor Relations website at ir.moodys.com.
Moody's current outlook for 2016 is based on assumptions about many geopolitical conditions and macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, corporate profitability and business investment spending, mergers and acquisitions, consumer borrowing and securitization and the amount of debt issued. 
These assumptions are subject to uncertainty, and results for the year could differ materially from our current outlook. Our guidance assumes foreign currency translation at end-of-quarter exchange rates. Specifically, our forecast reflects exchange rates for the British pound of $1.30 to GBP 1 and for the euro of $1.12 to EUR 1. Post-third-quarter movements in foreign exchange rates have had no meaningful impact on the full year 2016 outlook.
As I noted earlier, Moody's is increasing its full year 2016 GAAP EPS guidance range to $4.76 to $4.86. Excluding the foreign exchange gain and restructuring charge I mentioned earlier, the non-GAAP EPS guidance range is now $4.62 to $4.72. The company now expects share repurchases to be approximately $750 million, subject to available cash, market conditions and other ongoing capital allocation decisions.
Capital expenditures are now expected to be approximately $120 million. 
For MIS, Moody's now expects 2016 revenue to be approximately flat, reflecting increased guidance for non-U.S. MIS revenue, which we also now expect to be approximately flat. U.S. revenue is still expected to be approximately flat.
Corporate finance revenue is now expected to be approximately flat, and structured finance revenue is now expected to decrease in the mid-single-digit percent range. 
Financial institutions revenue is now expected to increase in the low-single-digit percent range. 
For Moody's Analytics, we are not anticipating any changes to the outlook items we provided on September 28, 2016.
This concludes our prepared remarks. And joining Linda and me for the question-and-answer session are Mark Almeida, President of Moody's Analytics; and Rob Fauber, President of Moody's Investors Service. We'll be pleased to take any questions you might have."

Looking out into 2017, we think that issuing conditions are probably going to be attractive, and that may encourage pull-forward from 2018 and beyond. Part of the reason why we're optimistic about the current outlook for issuance conditions is driven by the fact that we think the default rate in the speculative-grade arena is probably peaking right about now over the next month or so, and it's going to moderate and come down, which should help spread. So even if official rates are moving up somewhat, we think there's an opportunity for spread tightening and an attractive issuance environment."

I'll take a shot at this and I'll talk about the views that we get from the various investment banks. The view first will cover the U.S. and then outside the U.S., this financial and non-financial U.S. dollar issuance. Before I start",536,"So Andre, it's Linda. I'll take a shot at this and I'll talk about the views that we get from the various investment banks. The view first will cover the U.S. and then outside the U.S., this financial and non-financial U.S. dollar issuance. Before I start that, though, I think the market is cheered by some larger M&A deal talk that has happened today and recently. So I think that tends to improve confidence. But let's go through these categories. Investment-grade third quarter 2016 issuance was up 20%. Issuers are taking advantage of historically low rates and strong investor demand. We do expect the lighter periods of issuance expected in the fourth quarter because of the following 3 factors: earnings blackouts will continue through October; U.S. elections obviously are November 8; and the Federal -- the Fed Open Market Committee meetings are December 13 and 14. For the rest of 2016, we -- for full year 2016, excuse me, we expect issuance to end the year up 10%. You'll recall that, originally, these projections had been for issuance to be sort of flat to down 10%. So this is better than had been anticipated at the beginning of the year. Our yield third quarter 2016 issuance was up 35%, which is a very big number. There again, strong investor demand, good pricing and opportunistic issuance coming through very favorable factors. Issuance volume, though, had moderated over the last 2 to 3 weeks, and spec-grade market activity has shifted in favor of loans. In other words, shifting toward leveraged loans versus bond. And for the full year, we're expecting that the year will be down 5% on high yield, which is less that than some of those initial indications had been back in January. Leveraged loans third quarter 2016 issuance up 50%, a very large number. Leveraged loan market continues to exhibit strength on the back of an opportunistic wave of refinancing activity and growing CLO issuance. Our CLO pipeline is very strong right now. And full year 2016 issuance is expected to end the year up 10%. Again, that's far more favorable than what was predicted at the beginning of the year. In Europe, investment-grade ECB's purchasing program continues to underpin the market. BOE's purchase program also has officially begun. And so you see a lot of U.S. corporates doing reverse-Yankee issues over in Europe as a heavy component of the supply there in Europe. The high-yield market is also accommodated for issuers, and a large portion of deal flow is coming from refinancing activity. September of 2016 on the high-yield front in Europe was the second-highest month on record, and we do have some caution driven by concerns around potential ECB tapering and the timing and extent of any U.S. rate rises, some renewed speculation on hard Brexit and its rhetoric and regional European referendums and elections coming up. So I think, generally, much better than we had expected.

The only thing I might add to that, Linda, is that in the investment-grade space, we've seen continued interest from foreign investors who are looking for yield. And it's interesting, when you look at the funds flow both in high-yield, while last week, we saw a small outflow, the prior 2 weeks were almost $4 billion in inflows and over $11 billion in inflows year-to-date. Similarly, on the bank loan side, that asset class has seen its 11th straight week of inflows. And that's the longest streak since 2014 and almost $3 billion over the last 11 weeks.

In the third quarter, Moody's revenue of $917 million increased 10% primarily as a result of record third quarter revenue for Moody's Investors Service, driven by higher-leveraged finance issuance in U.S. public finance activity as well as solid growth for Moody's Analytics.
Operating expense for the third quarter was $520 million, up 7% from the third quarter of 2015 and included an $8.4 million restructuring charge associated with cost management initiatives. Operating income was $398 million, a 14% increase from the prior year period.
The impact of foreign currency translation on operating income was negligible. Adjusted operating income, defined as operating income before depreciation, amortization and the aforementioned restructuring charge, was $439 million, up 16% from the same period last year. The reported operating margin for the third quarter of 2016 was 43.3%, and the adjusted operating margin was 47.8%.
GAAP EPS of $1.31 was up 15% from the third quarter of 2015. Non-GAAP EPS of $1.34 was up 21%. Third quarter 2016 non-GAAP EPS excludes a $0.03 impact from the restructuring charge. Third quarter 2015 non-GAAP EPS excludes a $0.03 benefit from a legacy tax matter.
Turning to year-to-date performance. Moody's revenue for the first 9 months of 2016 was $2.7 billion, an increase of 2% from the prior year period. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted revenue by 1%. Revenue at Moody's Investors Service was $1.8 billion, a decline of 1% from 2015.
Revenue at Moody's Analytics was $899 million, 8% higher than the prior year period. Operating expense in the first 9 months of 2016 was $1.6 billion, up 5% from the prior year. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted expense by 2%. Operating income was $1.1 billion, down 2% from the first 9 months of 2015. The impact of foreign currency translation was negligible.
Adjusted operating income of $1.2 billion was down 1% from the prior year period. Moody's reported operating margin was 41.8% and its adjusted operating margin was 45.7%. The effective tax rate for the first 9 months of 2016 was 31.5%, down from 31.7% in the same period in 2015.
In light of the strong third quarter performance, coupled with continued expense management, we are increasing our full year 2016 GAAP EPS guidance to a range of $4.76 to $4.86, which includes an anticipated noncash foreign exchange gain of $0.18 related to a subsidiary reorganization, offset in part by a $0.04 restructuring charge.
Excluding the gain and the restructuring charge, the non-GAAP EPS guidance range is now $4.62 to $4.72.
I'll turn the call over to Linda to provide further commentary on our financial results and other updates."

I'll begin with revenue at the company level. As Ray mentioned, Moody's total revenue for the third quarter was $917 million, up 10% from the prior year period. U.S. revenue of $546 million was up 13% from the third quarter of 2015. Non-U.S.",1019,"Thanks, Ray. I'll begin with revenue at the company level. As Ray mentioned, Moody's total revenue for the third quarter was $917 million, up 10% from the prior year period. U.S. revenue of $546 million was up 13% from the third quarter of 2015. Non-U.S. revenue of $371 million was up 5% and represented 40% of Moody's total revenue. The impact of foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted Moody's revenue by 1%. Recurring revenue of $460 million was up 3% and represented 50% of total revenue.
And looking now at each of our businesses, starting with Moody's Investors Service. Total MIS revenue for the quarter, $612 million, up 12% from the prior year period. U.S. revenue increased 11% to $391 million. Non-U.S. revenue of $221 million was up 13% to the prior year period and represented 36% of total ratings revenue. The impact of foreign currency translation on MIS revenue was negligible.
Moving to the lines of business for MIS. First, global corporate finance revenue for the third quarter of $300 million was up 21% from the prior year period. This result primarily reflected higher levels of bank loan and speculative-grade bond issuance as strong investor demand and tighter credit spreads drove debt refinancing activity. U.S. and non-U.S. corporate finance revenues were up 16% and 32% respectively.
Second, global structured finance revenue for the third quarter, $104 million, down 7% from the prior year period as reduced U.S. CMBS and CLO activity was only partially offset by increased U.S. RMBS and REIT activity. U.S. and non-U.S. structured finance revenues were down 9% and 4% respectively.
Third, global financial institutions revenue of $96 million was up 7% from the prior year period as a result of decreased -- as a result of, excuse me, increased Asian banking issuance. U.S. and non-U.S. financial institutions revenue were up 2% and 11% respectively.
Fourth, global public, project and infrastructure finance revenue of $105 million was up 16% versus the prior year period, primarily driven by strong U.S. public finance issuance. U.S. public, project and infrastructure finance revenue was up 29%, while non-U.S. revenue was down 8%. MIS Other, which consists of non-rating revenue from ICRA in India and Korea Investors Service, contributed $8 million to MIS revenue for the third quarter, up 4% from the prior year period.
And turning now to Moody's Analytics. Global revenue for MA of $305 million was up 6% from the third quarter of 2015. U.S. revenue of $154 million was up 19% year-over-year. Non-U.S. revenue of $150 million was down 4% and represented 49% of total MA revenue. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted MA revenue by 3%.
Excluding revenue from our March 2016 acquisition of GGY, MA revenue grew 3%.
Moving now to the lines of business for MA. First, global research data and analytics, or RD&A, revenue of $168 million was up 6% from the prior year period and represented 55% of total MA revenue. Growth was mainly driven by strong sales of credit research and ratings data fees. U.S. RD&A revenue was up 14%, while non-U.S. revenue was down 4%. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted RD&A revenue by 3%.
Second, global enterprise risk solutions, or ERS, revenue of $102 million was up 10% from last year. The growth was driven primarily by the March 2016 acquisition of GGY as well as growth in the credit assessment and stress testing product lines. U.S. ERS revenue was up 39%, while non-U.S. revenue was down 3%. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted ERS revenue by 4%. 
Trailing 12-month revenue and sales for ERS increased 10% and 5% respectively. 
As we've noted in the past, due to the variable nature of project timing and completion, ERS revenue and sales remain subject to quarterly volatility.
Third, global professional services revenue of $36 million was down 3% from the prior year period. U.S. professional services revenue was up 6%, while non-U.S. revenue was down 7%.
Turning now to expenses. Moody's third quarter expense was $520 million, down -- excuse me, up 7% from 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to additional headcount in MA to support business growth and from the March acquisition of GGY, the restructuring charge and increased incentive compensation across the company. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted expense by 2%.
Moody's reported operating margin increased 140 basis points to 43.3% in the third quarter, and adjusted operating margin increased by 250 basis points to 47.8%. Moody's effective tax rate for the quarter was 30.5%, down from 32% in the third quarter of 2015.
Now I'll provide an update on capital allocation. During the third quarter of 2016, Moody's repurchased 1.9 million shares at a total cost of $193 million or an average cost of $103 per share and issued 798,000 shares as part of its employee stock-based compensation plan. Moody's also paid $71 million in dividends during the quarter. On October 18, Moody's announced a quarterly dividend of $0.37 per share of Moody's common stock, payable December 12, to stockholders of record at the close of business on November 21.
Over the first 9 months of 2016, Moody's repurchased 7.1 million shares at a total cost of $679 million or an average cost of $95.51 per share and issued 2.7 million shares as part of its employee stock-based compensation plan. Additionally, Moody's returned $215 million to its shareholders via dividend payments during the first 9 months of 2016.
Outstanding shares as of September 30, 2016, totaled 191.2 million, down 3% from September 30, 2015. As of September 30, 2016, Moody's had $787 million of share repurchase authority remaining.
At quarter end, Moody's had $3.4 billion of outstanding debt and $1 billion of additional borrowing capacity under its commercial paper program, which is backstopped by an undrawn $1 billion revolving credit facility. Total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at quarter end were $2.1 billion, with approximately 80% held outside the U.S.
Free cash flow in the first 9 months of 2016 was $772 million, down 7% from the first 9 months of 2015, primarily due to lower net income.
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Ray."
528325,403260905,1059011,"Moody's Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2016",2016-10-21,"Earnings Calls","Moody's Corporation","Executives","Okay. Thanks, Linda.

Thanks, Linda. As we disclosed in today's earnings release, on September 29, we received a letter from the Department of Justice indicating that it is preparing a civil complaint against Moody's alleging violations of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act in connection with ratings MIS assigned to RMBS and CDOs leading up to the 2008 financial crisis.
As we had previously disclosed, following the global credit crisis of 2008, Moody's periodically received subpoenas and inquiries from various governmental authorities, including the DOJ and states attorneys general. The DOJ has advised us that their investigation remains ongoing and may expand to include additional theories. A number of states attorneys general have also indicated they expect to pursue similar claims under state law.
Moody's is continuing to respond to the DOJ and states' subpoenas and inquiries. As I hope you'll appreciate, I'm not going to be able to add anything beyond what I've just said and what we disclosed in our earnings release.
I'll conclude this morning's prepared remarks by discussing the changes to our full year guidance for 2016. A full list of Moody's guidance is included in our third quarter 2016 earnings press release, which can be found on the Investor Relations website at ir.moodys.com.
Moody's current outlook for 2016 is based on assumptions about many geopolitical conditions and macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, corporate profitability and business investment spending, mergers and acquisitions, consumer borrowing and securitization and the amount of debt issued. 
These assumptions are subject to uncertainty, and results for the year could differ materially from our current outlook. Our guidance assumes foreign currency translation at end-of-quarter exchange rates. Specifically, our forecast reflects exchange rates for the British pound of $1.30 to GBP 1 and for the euro of $1.12 to EUR 1. Post-third-quarter movements in foreign exchange rates have had no meaningful impact on the full year 2016 outlook.
As I noted earlier, Moody's is increasing its full year 2016 GAAP EPS guidance range to $4.76 to $4.86. Excluding the foreign exchange gain and restructuring charge I mentioned earlier, the non-GAAP EPS guidance range is now $4.62 to $4.72. The company now expects share repurchases to be approximately $750 million, subject to available cash, market conditions and other ongoing capital allocation decisions.
Capital expenditures are now expected to be approximately $120 million. 
For MIS, Moody's now expects 2016 revenue to be approximately flat, reflecting increased guidance for non-U.S. MIS revenue, which we also now expect to be approximately flat. U.S. revenue is still expected to be approximately flat.
Corporate finance revenue is now expected to be approximately flat, and structured finance revenue is now expected to decrease in the mid-single-digit percent range. 
Financial institutions revenue is now expected to increase in the low-single-digit percent range. 
For Moody's Analytics, we are not anticipating any changes to the outlook items we provided on September 28, 2016.
This concludes our prepared remarks. And joining Linda and me for the question-and-answer session are Mark Almeida, President of Moody's Analytics; and Rob Fauber, President of Moody's Investors Service. We'll be pleased to take any questions you might have."

Looking out into 2017, we think that issuing conditions are probably going to be attractive, and that may encourage pull-forward from 2018 and beyond. Part of the reason why we're optimistic about the current outlook for issuance conditions is driven by the fact that we think the default rate in the speculative-grade arena is probably peaking right about now over the next month or so, and it's going to moderate and come down, which should help spread. So even if official rates are moving up somewhat, we think there's an opportunity for spread tightening and an attractive issuance environment."

The view first will cover the U.S. and then outside the U.S., this financial and non-financial U.S. dollar issuance. Before I start",536,"So Andre, it's Linda. I'll take a shot at this and I'll talk about the views that we get from the various investment banks. The view first will cover the U.S. and then outside the U.S., this financial and non-financial U.S. dollar issuance. Before I start that, though, I think the market is cheered by some larger M&A deal talk that has happened today and recently. So I think that tends to improve confidence. But let's go through these categories. Investment-grade third quarter 2016 issuance was up 20%. Issuers are taking advantage of historically low rates and strong investor demand. We do expect, though, lighter periods of issuance expected in the fourth quarter because of the following 3 factors: earnings blackouts will continue through October; U.S. elections obviously are November 8; and the Federal -- the Fed Open Market Committee meetings are December 13 and 14. For the rest of 2016, we -- for full year 2016, excuse me, we expect issuance to end the year up 10%. You'll recall that, originally, these projections had been for issuance to be sort of flat to down 10%. So this is better than had been anticipated at the beginning of the year. Our yield third quarter 2016 issuance was up 35%, which is a very big number. There again, strong investor demand, good pricing and opportunistic issuance coming through very favorable factors. Issuance volumes, though, have moderated over the last 2 to 3 weeks, as spec-grade market activity has shifted in favor of loans. In other words, shifting toward leveraged loans versus bonds. And for the full year, we're expecting that the year will be down 5% on high yields, which is less bad than some of those initial indications had been back in January. Leveraged loans third quarter 2016 issuance up 50%, a very large number. Leveraged loan market continues to exhibit strength on the back of an opportunistic wave of refinancing activity and growing CLO issuance. Our CLO pipeline is very strong right now. And full year 2016 issuance is expected to end the year up 10%. Again, that's far more favorable than what was predicted at the beginning of the year. In Europe, investment-grade ECB's purchasing program continues to underpin the market. BOE's purchase program also has officially begun. And so you see a lot of U.S. corporates doing reverse-Yankee issues over in Europe as a heavy component of the supply there in Europe. The high-yield market is also accommodated for issuers, and a large portion of deal flow is coming from refinancing activity. September of 2016 on the high-yield front in Europe was the second-highest month on record, and we do have some caution driven by concerns around potential ECB tapering and the timing and extent of any U.S. rate rises, some renewed speculation on hard Brexit and its rhetoric and regional European referendums and elections coming up. So I think, generally, much better than we had expected. I think Rob might want to comment a little bit that we continue to see growing strength through the middle and the end of September, which was perhaps a bit better than what we had expected even at Investor Day. So Rob, you want to comment?"

The only thing I might add to that, Linda, is that in the investment-grade space, we've seen continued interest from foreign investors who are looking for yield. And it's interesting, when you look at the funds flow both in high-yield, while last week, we saw a small outflow, the prior 2 weeks were almost $4 billion in inflows and over $11 billion in inflows year-to-date. Similarly, on the bank loan side, that asset class has seen its 11th straight week of inflows. And that's the longest streak since 2014 and almost $3 billion over the last 11 weeks. So I think that really supports the market technicals."

So it's good in that there is growth in the key markets that we operate in, but it is not going to be fast-paced growth in our estimation. We would also expect to see a gradual normalization of monetary policy in the U.S., but I think that will be gradual. And we're going to continue to see accommodated monetary policy outside the U.S. So I think that's going to feature in a continuation of low rates in a number of markets."

Before we begin, I call your attention to the safe harbor language, which can be found toward the end of our earnings release. Today's remarks may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. 
In accordance with the act, I also direct your attention to the Management's Discussion and Analysis section and the risk factors discussed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, and in other SEC filings made by the company, which are available on our website and on the Securities and Exchange Commission's website. 
These, together with the safe harbor statements, set forth important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any such forward-looking statements.
I would also like to point out that members of the media may be on the call this morning in a listen-only mode. 
I'll now turn the call over to Ray McDaniel."

I'll begin by summarizing Moody's third quarter and year-to-date 2016 results. Linda will follow with additional financial detail and operating highlights. I'll then conclude with a litigation update and comments on our current outlook for 2016. After our prepared remarks, we'll be happy to respond to your questions.
In the third quarter, Moody's revenue of $917 million increased 10% primarily as a result of record third quarter revenue for Moody's Investors Service, driven by higher-leveraged finance issuance in U.S. public finance activity as well as solid growth for Moody's Analytics.
Operating expense for the third quarter was $520 million, up 7% from the third quarter of 2015 and included an $8.4 million restructuring charge associated with cost management initiatives. Operating income was $398 million, a 14% increase from the prior year period.
The impact of foreign currency translation on operating income was negligible. Adjusted operating income, defined as operating income before depreciation, amortization and the aforementioned restructuring charge, was $439 million, up 16% from the same period last year. The reported operating margin for the third quarter of 2016 was 43.3%, and the adjusted operating margin was 47.8%.
GAAP EPS of $1.31 was up 15% from the third quarter of 2015. Non-GAAP EPS of $1.34 was up 21%. Third quarter 2016 non-GAAP EPS excludes a $0.03 impact from the restructuring charge. Third quarter 2015 non-GAAP EPS excludes a $0.03 benefit from a legacy tax matter.
Turning to year-to-date performance. Moody's revenue for the first 9 months of 2016 was $2.7 billion, an increase of 2% from the prior year period. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted revenue by 1%. Revenue at Moody's Investors Service was $1.8 billion, a decline of 1% from 2015.
Revenue at Moody's Analytics was $899 million, 8% higher than the prior year period. Operating expense in the first 9 months of 2016 was $1.6 billion, up 5% from the prior year. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted expense by 2%. Operating income was $1.1 billion, down 2% from the first 9 months of 2015. The impact of foreign currency translation was negligible.
Adjusted operating income of $1.2 billion was down 1% from the prior year period. Moody's reported operating margin was 41.8% and its adjusted operating margin was 45.7%. The effective tax rate for the first 9 months of 2016 was 31.5%, down from 31.7% in the same period in 2015.
In light of the strong third quarter performance, coupled with continued expense management, we are increasing our full year 2016 GAAP EPS guidance to a range of $4.76 to $4.86, which includes an anticipated noncash foreign exchange gain of $0.18 related to a subsidiary reorganization, offset in part by a $0.04 restructuring charge.
Excluding the gain and the restructuring charge, the non-GAAP EPS guidance range is now $4.62 to $4.72.
I'll turn the call over to Linda to provide further commentary on our financial results and other updates."

I'll begin with revenue at the company level. As Ray mentioned, Moody's total revenue for the third quarter was $917 million, up 10% from the prior year period. U.S. revenue of $546 million was up 13% from the third quarter of 2015. Non-U.S.",1019,"Thanks, Ray. I'll begin with revenue at the company level. As Ray mentioned, Moody's total revenue for the third quarter was $917 million, up 10% from the prior year period. U.S. revenue of $546 million was up 13% from the third quarter of 2015. Non-U.S. revenue of $371 million was up 5% and represented 40% of Moody's total revenue. The impact of foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted Moody's revenue by 1%. Recurring revenue of $460 million was up 3% and represented 50% of total revenue.
And looking now at each of our businesses, starting with Moody's Investors Service. Total MIS revenue for the quarter, $612 million, up 12% from the prior year period. U.S. revenue increased 11% to $391 million. Non-U.S. revenue of $221 million was up 13% to the prior year period and represented 36% of total ratings revenue. The impact of foreign currency translation on MIS revenue was negligible.
Moving to the lines of business for MIS. First, global corporate finance revenue for the third quarter of $300 million was up 21% from the prior year period. This result primarily reflected higher levels of bank loan and speculative-grade bond issuance as strong investor demand and tighter credit spreads drove debt refinancing activity. U.S. and non-U.S. corporate finance revenues were up 16% and 32% respectively.
Second, global structured finance revenue for the third quarter, $104 million, down 7% from the prior year period as reduced U.S. CMBS and CLO activity was only partially offset by increased U.S. RMBS and REIT activity. U.S. and non-U.S. structured finance revenues were down 9% and 4% respectively.
Third, global financial institutions revenue of $96 million was up 7% from the prior year period as a result of decreased -- as a result of, excuse me, increased Asian banking issuance. U.S. and non-U.S. financial institutions revenue were up 2% and 11% respectively.
Fourth, global public, project and infrastructure finance revenue of $105 million was up 16% versus the prior year period, primarily driven by strong U.S. public finance issuance. U.S. public, project and infrastructure finance revenue was up 29%, while non-U.S. revenue was down 8%. MIS Other, which consists of non-rating revenue from ICRA in India and Korea Investors Service, contributed $8 million to MIS revenue for the third quarter, up 4% from the prior year period.
And turning now to Moody's Analytics. Global revenue for MA of $305 million was up 6% from the third quarter of 2015. U.S. revenue of $154 million was up 19% year-over-year. Non-U.S. revenue of $150 million was down 4% and represented 49% of total MA revenue. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted MA revenue by 3%.
Excluding revenue from our March 2016 acquisition of GGY, MA revenue grew 3%.
Moving now to the lines of business for MA. First, global research data and analytics, or RD&A, revenue of $168 million was up 6% from the prior year period and represented 55% of total MA revenue. Growth was mainly driven by strong sales of credit research and ratings data fees. U.S. RD&A revenue was up 14%, while non-U.S. revenue was down 4%. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted RD&A revenue by 3%.
Second, global enterprise risk solutions, or ERS, revenue of $102 million was up 10% from last year. The growth was driven primarily by the March 2016 acquisition of GGY as well as growth in the credit assessment and stress testing product lines. U.S. ERS revenue was up 39%, while non-U.S. revenue was down 3%. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted ERS revenue by 4%. 
Trailing 12-month revenue and sales for ERS increased 10% and 5% respectively. 
As we've noted in the past, due to the variable nature of project timing and completion, ERS revenue and sales remain subject to quarterly volatility.
Third, global professional services revenue of $36 million was down 3% from the prior year period. U.S. professional services revenue was up 6%, while non-U.S. revenue was down 7%.
Turning now to expenses. Moody's third quarter expense was $520 million, down -- excuse me, up 7% from 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to additional headcount in MA to support business growth and from the March acquisition of GGY, the restructuring charge and increased incentive compensation across the company. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted expense by 2%.
Moody's reported operating margin increased 140 basis points to 43.3% in the third quarter, and adjusted operating margin increased by 250 basis points to 47.8%. Moody's effective tax rate for the quarter was 30.5%, down from 32% in the third quarter of 2015.
Now I'll provide an update on capital allocation. During the third quarter of 2016, Moody's repurchased 1.9 million shares at a total cost of $193 million or an average cost of $103 per share and issued 798,000 shares as part of its employee stock-based compensation plan. Moody's also paid $71 million in dividends during the quarter. On October 18, Moody's announced a quarterly dividend of $0.37 per share of Moody's common stock, payable December 12, to stockholders of record at the close of business on November 21.
Over the first 9 months of 2016, Moody's repurchased 7.1 million shares at a total cost of $679 million or an average cost of $95.51 per share and issued 2.7 million shares as part of its employee stock-based compensation plan. Additionally, Moody's returned $215 million to its shareholders via dividend payments during the first 9 months of 2016.
Outstanding shares as of September 30, 2016, totaled 191.2 million, down 3% from September 30, 2015. As of September 30, 2016, Moody's had $787 million of share repurchase authority remaining.
At quarter end, Moody's had $3.4 billion of outstanding debt and $1 billion of additional borrowing capacity under its commercial paper program, which is backstopped by an undrawn $1 billion revolving credit facility. Total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at quarter end were $2.1 billion, with approximately 80% held outside the U.S.
Free cash flow in the first 9 months of 2016 was $772 million, down 7% from the first 9 months of 2015, primarily due to lower net income.
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Ray."

Thanks, Linda. As we disclosed in today's earnings release, on September 29, we received a letter from the Department of Justice indicating that it is preparing a civil complaint against Moody's alleging violations of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act in connection with ratings MIS assigned to RMBS and CDOs leading up to the 2008 financial crisis.
As we had previously disclosed, following the global credit crisis of 2008, Moody's periodically received subpoenas and inquiries from various governmental authorities, including the DOJ and states attorneys general. The DOJ has advised us that their investigation remains ongoing and may expand to include additional theories. A number of states attorneys general have also indicated they expect to pursue similar claims under state law.
Moody's is continuing to respond to the DOJ and states' subpoenas and inquiries. As I hope you'll appreciate, I'm not going to be able to add anything beyond what I've just said and what we disclosed in our earnings release.
I'll conclude this morning's prepared remarks by discussing the changes to our full year guidance for 2016. A full list of Moody's guidance is included in our third quarter 2016 earnings press release, which can be found on the Investor Relations website at ir.moodys.com.
Moody's current outlook for 2016 is based on assumptions about many geopolitical conditions and macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, corporate profitability and business investment spending, mergers and acquisitions, consumer borrowing and securitization and the amount of debt issued. 
These assumptions are subject to uncertainty, and results for the year could differ materially from our current outlook. Our guidance assumes foreign currency translation at end-of-quarter exchange rates. Specifically, our forecast reflects exchange rates for the British pound of $1.30 to GBP 1 and for the euro of $1.12 to EUR 1. Post-third-quarter movements in foreign exchange rates have had no meaningful impact on the full year 2016 outlook.
As I noted earlier, Moody's is increasing its full year 2016 GAAP EPS guidance range to $4.76 to $4.86. Excluding the foreign exchange gain and restructuring charge I mentioned earlier, the non-GAAP EPS guidance range is now $4.62 to $4.72. The company now expects share repurchases to be approximately $750 million, subject to available cash, market conditions and other ongoing capital allocation decisions.
Capital expenditures are now expected to be approximately $120 million. 
For MIS, Moody's now expects 2016 revenue to be approximately flat, reflecting increased guidance for non-U.S. MIS revenue, which we also now expect to be approximately flat. U.S. revenue is still expected to be approximately flat.
Corporate finance revenue is now expected to be approximately flat, and structured finance revenue is now expected to decrease in the mid-single-digit percent range. 
Financial institutions revenue is now expected to increase in the low-single-digit percent range. 
For Moody's Analytics, we are not anticipating any changes to the outlook items we provided on September 28, 2016.
This concludes our prepared remarks. And joining Linda and me for the question-and-answer session are Mark Almeida, President of Moody's Analytics; and Rob Fauber, President of Moody's Investors Service. We'll be pleased to take any questions you might have."

Looking out into 2017, we think that issuing conditions are probably going to be attractive, and that may encourage pull-forward from 2018 and beyond. Part of the reason why we're optimistic about the current outlook for issuance conditions is driven by the fact that we think the default rate in the speculative-grade arena is probably peaking right about now over the next month or so, and it's going to moderate and come down, which should help spread. So even if official rates are moving up somewhat, we think there's an opportunity for spread tightening and an attractive issuance environment."

I'll take a shot at this and I'll talk about the views that we get from the various investment banks. The view first will cover the U.S. and then outside the U.S., this financial and non-financial U.S. dollar issuance. Before I start",536,"So Andre, it's Linda. I'll take a shot at this and I'll talk about the views that we get from the various investment banks. The view first will cover the U.S. and then outside the U.S., this financial and non-financial U.S. dollar issuance. Before I start that, though, I think the market is cheered by some larger M&A deal talk that has happened today and recently. So I think that tends to improve confidence. But let's go through these categories. Investment-grade third quarter 2016 issuance was up 20%. Issuers are taking advantage of historically low rates and strong investor demand. We do expect, though, lighter periods of issuance expected in the fourth quarter because of the following 3 factors: earnings blackouts will continue through October; U.S. elections obviously are November 8; and the Federal -- the Fed Open Market Committee meetings are December 13 and 14. For the rest of 2016, we -- for full year 2016, excuse me, we expect issuance to end the year up 10%. You'll recall that, originally, these projections had been for issuance to be sort of flat to down 10%. So this is better than had been anticipated at the beginning of the year. Our yield third quarter 2016 issuance was up 35%, which is a very big number. There again, strong investor demand, good pricing and opportunistic issuance coming through very favorable factors. Issuance volumes, though, have moderated over the last 2 to 3 weeks, as spec-grade market activity has shifted in favor of loans. In other words, shifting toward leveraged loans versus bonds. And for the full year, we're expecting that the year will be down 5% on high yields, which is less bad than some of those initial indications had been back in January. Leveraged loans third quarter 2016 issuance up 50%, a very large number. Leveraged loan market continues to exhibit strength on the back of an opportunistic wave of refinancing activity and growing CLO issuance. Our CLO pipeline is very strong right now. And full year 2016 issuance is expected to end the year up 10%. Again, that's far more favorable than what was predicted at the beginning of the year. In Europe, investment-grade ECB's purchasing program continues to underpin the market. BOE's purchase program also has officially begun. And so you see a lot of U.S. corporates doing reverse-Yankee issues over in Europe as a heavy component of the supply there in Europe. The high-yield market is also accommodated for issuers, and a large portion of deal flow is coming from refinancing activity. September of 2016 on the high-yield front in Europe was the second-highest month on record, and we do have some caution driven by concerns around potential ECB tapering and the timing and extent of any U.S. rate rises, some renewed speculation on hard Brexit and its rhetoric and regional European referendums and elections coming up. So I think, generally, much better than we had expected. I think Rob might want to comment a little bit that we continue to see growing strength through the middle and the end of September, which was perhaps a bit better than what we had expected even at Investor Day. So Rob, you want to comment?"

The only thing I might add to that, Linda, is that in the investment-grade space, we've seen continued interest from foreign investors who are looking for yield. And it's interesting, when you look at the funds flow both in high-yield, while last week, we saw a small outflow, the prior 2 weeks were almost $4 billion in inflows and over $11 billion in inflows year-to-date. Similarly, on the bank loan side, that asset class has seen its 11th straight week of inflows. And that's the longest streak since 2014 and almost $3 billion over the last 11 weeks. So I think that really supports the market technicals."

We're looking to invest in technology to support what MIS is doing to ensure that our rating analysts are as efficient as they can be and that we're handling our regulatory requirements as efficiently as we can for those analysts. So that continues. We're pleased that perhaps that rate of technology spending might be largely having peaked in '16. So we'll have to see how that goes, but we don't have the forecast for '17 baked yet fully. For Moody's Analytics, Mark is running a very nicely growing business and we will continue to invest in that business. And for the commercial operation for Moody's Investors Service, we want to be thoughtful about the ability to do business with us in a constructive way. So we might continue to invest there. But the investment outlook, I suspect, will look pretty much like it has, but again, a very cautious eye on expense control, and we will talk more about potential for margin expansion for '17 when we give guidance for '17. But we would like to be able to show some margin expansion, but we're going to have to see. And I don't know if Ray or others of my colleagues want to comment any further on that."

We would also expect to see a gradual normalization of monetary policy in the U.S., but I think that will be gradual.
