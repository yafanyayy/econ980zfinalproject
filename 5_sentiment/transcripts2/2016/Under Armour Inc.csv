I want to wish you all belated happy new year and wish those in China, an early [Foreign Language]. 
While this earnings call is to report on our 2015 fourth quarter and the past year as a whole, I want to focus for a moment on the year ahead. 
This year, 2016 is Under Armour's 20th-year in business. It's an incredible milestone for any company and for us, it means a few things. It means that the next generation entering the workforce doesn't know a world where Under Armour doesn't exist. 
This generation doesn't recognize us as the underdogs but as it always was. It means that we're  not a passing fad or a flavor of the month. The interlocking UA logo has become globally recognized symbol for being aggressive, young and fearless. It means we are brand that resonates with athletes, all athletes, and we will continue to thrive because we remain as humble and hungry as we were 20 years ago with plenty of room left to grow. 
And with that, our scoreboard remains strong. We are entering this milestone positioned for success, capping off the past year with yet another solid finish. 
Total net revenues for the fourth quarter were up 31%, marking our 23rd consecutive quarter of 20-plus percent net revenue growth. 
And since this call is about our most recent fourth quarter, let me throw out a few more numbers to you that our fourth quarterly related. 36, 34, 26, 35 and 31. Those are the percentages we have grown in each of the previous 5 fourth quarters. 
Each year around this time, weather inevitably plays part of the conversation and each year, we enter those who doubt us with extremely strong growth numbers in the fourth quarter. Whether it's 72 degrees on the East Coast this past Christmas, it was. It affects our business the way some thought it would, no, it did not. Because here in the U.S. where we currently do the majority of our business, we know that football will be played in the fall, basketball will be played in the winter, baseball will be played in the spring and like soccer, personal health and fitness is a year-round all weather. 
Our business is more diversified than it's ever been. We do not let weather play a decisive role in dictating our success. 
As we move into 2016, we have become a global brand capable of meeting athletes needs from head-to-toe. 
In the fourth quarter, we posted strong gains across our business illustrating the broad base strength and demand for our brand with apparel growing 22%, Direct-to-Consumer growing 25%, International growing 70% and Footwear growing a whopping 95%. 
While our growth drivers have not changed since we went public more than 10 years ago, these numbers show how diverse our portfolio has become and reinforces the continued success of our largest category, apparel. 
Ten years ago, we were $281 million company with apparel representing 93% of our revenues and compression, representing 64% of the entire business. 
Today, our Apparel business represents 71% of our revenues and compression is less than 10%. 
We closed 2015 with more balance and breadth of product across our businesses, Men's, Women's and Youth driving our Apparel business over $2.8 billion from just a $260 million it was a decade ago. 
In the fourth quarter, apparel growth of 22% showcases that our brand has products for all seasons and temperatures and perhaps more importantly, that today, our athletes have the complete head-to-toe assortment available to them in more channels globally than ever before. 
Ten years ago, our Direct-to-Consumer business represented 6% of our net revenue, consisting of a single website and just 4 domestic Factory House stores. Today, our Direct-to-Consumer business represents 30% of net revenues, made up of 25 global website and nearly 400 Under Armour owned and partner retail doors around the world. It impossible not to talk about the strength of E-Commerce when we look at our Direct-to-Consumer  business. This business continues to be on fire, not only in the United States, but also around the world. 
In China on singles day, this past November, we had our first million dollar revenue the online, while in the U.S., mobile has grown to almost 50% of the traffic to our site and represented 23% of E-Commerce revenues in the fourth quarter. 
Consumers continue to look for us in multiple places, and we will be wherever they are, whether it's on the device or in physical doors. 
Globally, we continue to drive both awareness and revenue growth as we expand our retail footprint outside the United States.  Closing out 2015 with almost 3x as many doors in total from just a year ago. 
10 years ago, we just entered Europe and our International business was $6 million, primarily driven by our partners in Japan. 
Today, International has become almost $0.5 billion business with our brand being sold in more than 60 countries. 
Last week, I visited our Amsterdam office that serves our European headquarters for the past 10 years located in historic Olympic Stadium where the energy and enthusiasm has been more confident in our team and their ability than ever before. 
In 2015, every region, every category and every channel exceeded our plans for International business, driving 70% growth in the fourth quarter and 69% growth year-over-year. 
Two years ago, our International business was 6% of revenues. Today, it's 11% and by 2018 as we said at our Investor Day, we expected to be 18%.  Our brand certainly translates. 
Ten years ago, we've not sold a single pair of shoes. Today, Footwear represents 17% of our business, closing in on $700 million in revenues. 
This past quarter, our Footwear revenues grew 95%, driven in part by the success of our expanded running lines, which will feature 8 different offerings all over the $100 price points compared to the 4 lines offered in the previous year. 
Also driving our growth and more importantly, creating an incredible connection with our young consumer is our Stephen Curry signature basketball shoe line that launched almost a year ago today. The sell-through on the Curry Two was like nothing we've ever seen before. The same words that people tend to say after watching Stephen play live. 
We're just beginning to see we are partnering with the right athlete like Stephen Curry can do for our business. It's difficult to underestimate the power of having the best sell-through of any signature basketball shoe this past season. It clearly lifted our brand in a mall channel and positioned us for aggressive growth, not only in signature, but overall with this most important consumer base. 
Footwear, and to be clear, premium Footwear continues to be an accelerator to our top line and a huge part of our growth story with our sights set on building $1 billion plus Footwear brand, it is becoming a bigger and more important component of our business and the result will be a more balanced blend of Apparel and Footwear within UA. Posting a 57% growth in Footwear for the full year in 2015 is evident of our ability to resonate with the consumer and provide them with a breadth of products unmatched in years past. 
The strength of our Footwear product coming from our outstanding team of designers and developers helped us celebrate our business above $100 at retail by 1,000% this past year. And we're even more excited and proud of the products that is coming out in 2016. 
We're seeing with Stephen has done for our basketball business. What basketball has done for our Footwear business and from there, what Footwear has done for our brand. This story is being told in our numbers but it's also being told on the courts, fields and pitches around the world show up at any Golden State Warriors game, home or away, it doesn't matter. And you will see that thousands of people who show up early just to see Stephen Curry's warm-up routine. That, as I've described to you before, is the power of sports. 
Speaking of our MVPs, we are continuing on last year's theme of UA and masters dominating very respective sports, thanks to our roster of athletes who continue to win on the world's biggest stages. 
Since the last time we spoke in baseball, Bryce Harper the Washington nationals name the Major League Baseball MVP in the national league. 
In tennis, Andy Murray, won the Davis Cup for Britain for the first time in 79 years. And in boxing, Alvarez became the WBC middleweight champion of the world with his victory over Miguel Cotto. They join Stephen, Jordan, Misty and others in our Europe champion solidifying UA as the home for winners. 
Now with the Super Bowl just over a week away, we will see yet another UA MVP, Cam Newt, compete at the highest level of the sport, while, representing our brand. Cam has been football success with the Highlight Cleat and the Super Bowl will introduce into a brand-new set of consumers. It is a platform where companies pay $5 million 32nd TV spot during the broadcast, while our guy will wear his UA fleets throughout the entire 3 plus hours of the game. 
And finally, we ended 2015 with a key personnel announcement. Last month, we announced Brad Dickerson's successor as CFO will be Chip Molloy. Chip comes to us with significant financial executive experience, the consumer retail sector, having served as EVP and CFO for PetSmart from 2007 until 2013. And where in 2011, he was named institutional investors CFO of the year for specialty retail. 
Chip is a Maryland native and a graduate of one of our partner schools, the United States Naval Academy. He also graduated from Navy Fighter Weapon School or Top Gun as it is known, where he served for 15 years in the United States Navy. 
With my new partner in place, Chip will work together with Brad over the next month to ensure a smooth transition. 
So that's how we closed 2015. Now let's talk about how we kick off 2016. 
We started the year off with a bang at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas unveiling a suite of products that will change the way athletes live. Many of you who have heard me talk about Connected Fitness on these calls at our Investor Day. In the past 3 weeks, we've seen the vision of this platform truly come to life. 
First, we announced the launch of UA Record, 1 of our 4 mobile app platforms that collectively earning more than 130,000 new users a day since just beginning of the year. UA Record is the digital dashboard that displays everything you need to know about your health in 4 quadrants: Sleep, fitness, activity and micturition. 
Combined with your body weight and our own cognitive measurement of how do you feel, it collects and displays a complete picture of your health in the easiest, most simple way possible. 
Second, we introduced the Under Armour HealthBox, the world's first Connected Fitness system which consist of a band, a heart rate strap and a smart scale, all in 1 package. Built in partnership with HTC, these tools work together to capture data pertaining for your health and fitness. And again, doing it in the easiest, most simple way possible. 
Because music is such an important part of how people exercise, we also partnered with Harman Cardin JVL, who launched Bluetooth-enabled wireless headphone, including an updated version to be released later this year that will also read heartrate in lieu of the strap. 
Finally, we launched our first smart shoe with the Gemini 2 RE, which stands for record equipped. This shoe tracks every step and upload data, including time, date, duration and distant directly into our platforms. 
This cutting-edge Footwear provides an experience and allows the athlete to run device free. There is no start or stop button. When the shoe is on your feet, it's ready and tracking. 
One of the collect feature of this shoe is it attracts its lifespan will send a notification when it's time for a new pair. 
All of these products feed into UA Record as well as more than 400 different connected devices to create the ultimate open platform destination to measure your health and fitness. 
Additionally, we announced our partnership with IBM in our Watson platform to help build the insights capability for Under Armour record. Wearables have been effective in telling you how many steps you took or the hours you slept, but they haven't been effective in giving you practical information on how you to utilize that data to make your life better. 
Put simply, there was no call to action until now. IBM's Watson, a platform that executes cognitive thinking, will provide personalized insights in realtime to the user based on the information we collect for UA Record and will take the experience and service the whole new level. 
By adding Watson's insights to UA Record, we deliver direction to help you reach your personal goal whether you want to lose 10 pounds or simply just feel better. This is what differentiates UA Record from the rest of the fitness tracking apps and will gives us confidence that the consumer experience we are building to help change the way athletes live. 
Now let me complete the vision for Connected Fitness. Beyond enriching lives, it will propel our business forward. This is not a tech initiative. This is a digital transformation and therefore, a business transformation for Under Armour. 
Before Connected Fitness, we only had retail transaction information for less than 10 million people that stores an E-Commerce combine. Now we have daily activity level data from our community members who log nearly 8 billion foods and 2 billion activities last year alone. 
Not only do we have people going into our stores and visiting our E-Commerce sites, but we also have a deeper understanding of our consumer based on information collected using Connected Fitness, including sleep, fitness, activity, nutrition, weight, and how do you feel. This gives us an unparalleled view of their life and needs.  I refer to it as our mouth house during our last call, but we're also calling it the single view of the consumer. 
All of this is possible because of the near 10-year partnership we have established with SAP. The single view of the consumer is something we're building with a team at SAP that combines global point-of-sale, E-Commerce and transactional information through a single sign-on capability together with our Connected Fitness business to create an insight engine that will inform and guide our decision to help grow and scale our brand. This will build on our existing SAP platform as we double down, continue to make big bets with big partners. 
We believe that this unique technological advancement will position UA as a best-in-class realtime digital enterprise. 
At Under Armour, we focus on creating products you don't know you need yet but once you have it, you want to remember how you lived without it. Just like our very first T-shirt. 
So great example of this are the types of innovation we'll bring to the market that will further elevate and diversify our product and continue to distinguish Under Armour. 
For example, this year, we will launch Microthread, a new cooling technology comprised of elastomeric thread that dry 30% faster and 70% more breathable than similar lycra construction. 
Then on the heating side, there's Reactor, an insulation that combines warmth and breathability to keep you comfortable without overheating. 
This is an addition to many other new innovation like CoolSwitch and on the footwear side, Slingshot. New innovations like the ones I just mentioned bring new opportunities for growth, which lead to revenue driving platforms. 
Our goal is that this new innovation will develop as strongly as some of our key revenue driving platforms from prior years like ColdGear Infrared and Armour in apparel and the signature Curry line in Footwear. 
Our relentless pursuit of innovation is just that, relentless, it never stops. 
When I first began Under Armour 20 years ago, I didn't set out to make just another T-shirt. I set out to make a better T-shirt, one that solve the problem and gives whoever wears it an advantage. With our Connected Fitness business, we're not releasing another fitness app or tracking device, we're building a complete ecosystem to manage your health and fitness with actionable insights to make you better. Finding a better way has been a running theme for us over the past 20 years, whether it's through the products we offer or the way we operate our business, and we'll keep finding a better way for another 20 years because we are just getting started. 
So now, I'd like to introduce Chip Molloy before Brad takes us through the numbers. Chip?"

I would now like to spend reviewing our fourth quarter and full year financial results followed by our updated outlook for 2016. Our net revenues for the fourth quarter of 2015 increased 31% to $1.17 billion. On a currency-neutra",2096,"Thanks, Kevin and Chip. I would now like to spend reviewing our fourth quarter and full year financial results followed by our updated outlook for 2016. 
Our net revenues for the fourth quarter of 2015 increased 31% to $1.17 billion. On a currency-neutral basis, fourth quarter net revenues increased 33%. For the full year, net revenues increased 28% to $3.96 billion, which compared to our most recent full year guidance of $3.91 billion. On a currency-neutral basis, full year net revenues increased 31%. 
Focusing on the fourth quarter, we grew apparel net revenues 22% to $865 million compared to $708 million in the prior year's quarter. 
With our efforts to build a more diversified business we posted impressive growth across channels and categories despite the well-documented weather challenges. Our focus on building brand equity around the globe through elevated product and experiences was evident in a strong growth of International and Direct-to-Consumer in the quarter. 
We also saw success around our continued expansion in key product categories like training, running, golf, team sports and basketball. 
Fourth quarter footwear net revenues increased 95% to $167 million from $86 million in the prior year. Broad-based Footwear strength has been the consistent theme in 2015 though the exceptional performance of our Curry Two signature basketball line was clearly a fourth quarter standout. 
Our accessories net revenue during the fourth quarter increased 23% to $97 million from $79 million last year and really driven by continued strong demand for our line of bags. 
Our global direct-to-consumer net revenues increased 25% for the quarter, representing approximately 36% of net revenues. In global retail, we ended the fourth quarter with 191 owned stores, including 161 Factory House stores and 30 Brand House stores. 
With our retail business still heavily weighted to North America Factory House stores, we did experience some of the similar weather-related challenges as our overall Apparel business. However, our strong E-Commerce business continues to diversify how we reach global consumers, and we continue to capitalize on our investments in mobile and International, where we more than doubled our in country website during 2015. 
Looking at our region, North American revenues increased 26% to $1.02 billion in the fourth quarter compared to $808 million in the prior year's quarter. 
On a currency-neutral basis, North America net revenue increased 27% accelerating from the growth rate posted last quarter despite the warm weather backdrop. 
The strength demonstrate the diversity of our product mix, including accelerated Footwear growth and consistent apparel performance as well as channel mix between our wholesale partners and our direct-to-consumer business. 
International net revenues increased 70% to $139 million in the fourth quarter and represented 12% of total net revenues. On a currency-neutral basis, International net revenues increased 85% for the period. 
In the EMEA region, our heightened focus on the U.K. and Germany continues to drive our momentum in these 2 core markets. While growth remains strong across all channels our E-Commerce strategy, including 9 new in countryside launched in 2015 is playing a key role in broadening our reach and awareness in the region. 
In Asia Pacific, we continue to see tremendous demand for the brand, driving triple-digit growth across Greater China and our Southeast Asian distributor, led by the success and expansion of our Brand House stores. 
And in Latin America, we are building momentum with many of our recent country expansions like Chile, more than offsetting the well-documented macro challenges in Brazil. 
Moving on to margin. Fourth quarter gross margins contracted 190 basis points to 48% compared to 49.9% in the prior years period. The following factors were the primary drivers during the quarter. First, sales mix negatively impacted gross margin by approximately 90 basis points in the fourth quarter versus the prior year, primarily driven by the continued strong performance of our Footwear business. Second, the continued strength of the U.S. dollar negatively impacted gross margin by approximately 80 basis points versus the prior year. Third, higher inventory liquidation negatively impacted gross margin by approximately 30 basis points. 
Before I move on with other elements of the quarter, I wanted to provide a quick snapshot of our gross margin performance for the full year. Our full year rate in 2015 declined 90 basis points to 48.1% compared to 49% in the prior years period. 
Of this 90 basis point decline, 70 basis points resulted from a continued strength in the U.S. dollar. 
While we also faced additional gross margin headwinds from adverse sales mix impact given the strong growth of our International Footwear businesses, higher inventory liquidation, specifically in the fourth quarter and higher freight expenses from port disruptions and efforts to better service our business, we were able to offset most of the non-currency related pressure through more favorable product margins in both our North America and International businesses. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues leveraged 80 basis points to 32.8% in the fourth quarter of 2015 from 33.6% in the prior years period. SG&A details for the fourth quarter are as follows: Marketing costs decreased  to 7.9% of net revenues for the quarter from 8.4% in the prior year period primarily reflecting the timing of our global marketing campaigns. Other SG&A costs decreased to 24.9% of net revenues for the quarter from 25.2% in the prior year, driven primarily by lower incentive compensation expense. 
Operating income for the fourth quarter increased 21% to $178 million compared with $146 million in the prior year period. 
For the full year, operating income increased 15% to $409 million compared to our most recent guidance of $408 million. The 2 Connected Fitness acquisitions we made in 2015 negatively impacted full year operating income by approximately $23 million. 
Interest in other expense in the fourth quarter increased to $6 million compared with $4 million in the prior year period primarily reflecting increased interest expense associated with the financing of our Connected Fitness acquisition. 
Our fourth quarter tax rate of 38.4% was consistent with the prior year. 
Our fourth quarter net income increased 21% to $106 million compared to $88 million in the prior year period, while our diluted earnings per share increased $0.48 from $0.40 in the prior years period. 
Full year diluted earnings per share increased 11% to $1.05 compared to $0.95 in 2014. The $1.05 earnings per share in 2015 is inclusive of a $0.10 impact from the 2 Connected Fitness acquisitions we made in 2015. 
On the balance sheet, total cash and cash equivalence for the quarter decreased to $130 million compared with $593 million at December 31, 2014. 
Accounts receivable increased 55% to $434 million compared with '$280 million at December 31, 2014, primarily related to the timing of shipments within the quarter. 
Inventory for the quarter increased 46% to $783 million compared to $537 million at December 31, 2014. 
Back at our Investor Day in September and again, on our third quarter earnings call, we discussed elevated inventory growth from the 36% rate posted in the third quarter. This growth is largely result of our strategy to focus on delivering our products to our consumers in a more timely manner and thus, drive higher fill rate. This strategy includes going back to our customers earlier to meet key seasonal core set dates as well as strategic investments and auto replenishment products. 
While these efforts are driving much of the elevated inventory growth rate in the near term, they're also delivering meaningful improvements in our service levels year-over-year in support of our revenue growth. 
In addition, the recent weather trends have led to some excess inventory creation, which we'll continue to work through across our normal liquidation channels during the first half of 2016. 
Total debt increased to $669 million as compared to $284 million at December 31, 2014, primarily reflecting the financing of our 2 Connected Fitness acquisitions. 
Looking at our cash flows, our invested capital expenditures was $85 million for the fourth quarter compared to $59 million in the prior year's period, driven primarily by our investment in our global headquarters in Baltimore and our SAP platform. 
Full year capital expenditures were $325 million compared to our prior guidance range of $350 million to $360 million, primarily due to timing of our investments. 
Now moving on to 2016. Based on our current visibility, we expect 2016 at revenues of approximately $4.95 billion, representing growth of 25% and 2016 operating income approximately $503 million representing growth of 23%. These growth rates remain in line with the long term growth rates laid out at the Investor Day lights September also consistent with our previous guidance in our third quarter earnings call. 
Below the operating lines, we expect interest expense increased approximately $35 million in 2016 as we expect increased debt level to support our business and look for opportunities to refinance our debt with more long-term financing. 
In addition, we expect the full you tax rate of approximately 38.5% and fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 223 million. 
Now I'd like to provide more color on our expected results for 2016. First, with net revenues, we currently anticipate the growth rate for the first half of the year to be above our expected full year growth rate. 
Specifically, looking at the first quarter, we expect the growth rate to be in the high 20s, led by many of the same factors from our fourth quarter, including strength in Footwear International higher planned inventory liquidations and strategies to better serve our customers year-over-year. 
As is typical at this point in the year, as we gain better visibility on orders, specifically for the fourth quarter, we provide updates on our progress on future calls. 
Next on gross margin, we expect a relatively consistent year-over-year rate in 2016 as compared to 2015. For the first quarter of 2016, we anticipate similar year-over-year dynamics as our just completed fourth quarter results, including higher liquidations through excess inventory, along with continued currency headwinds. Thus, we expect our largest gross margin headwind for the year during the first quarter.  We are planning an approximate 150 basis points decline year-over-year. 
Shifting to SG&A. We expect deleverage expenses in 2016 as our focus remains on making the right investments to drive our long term global success. 
Looking at the marketing portion of SG&A, we expect to continue to invest across our sports marketing assets, global brand campaigns and retail market. In other SG&A,-comcomma we are focused on key branded enhancing initiatives that we outlined at our Investor Day such as Connected Fitness and global retail as well strategic investments -- strategic business areas, including category management and innovation. 
With the higher top line growth rate currently expected that in the front half of the year, we expect modest overall SG&A leverage in the front half of the year and modest deleverage in the second half of the year. 
Looking at capital expenditures in 2016. We are currently planning to invest at the midpoint of our 8% to 10% of net revenues target range outlined at our Investor Day. Our investments include our global headquarters as well as our expanding SAP platform that will serve as the architecture for our future growth, while also driving our insights engine how our single view of the consumer that Kevin spoke about. 
Finally, inventory. As we previously stated, our focus is in delivering our products to our consumers and more timely manner and improving our customer service levels. As a result, we continue to expect inventory growth rate to be slightly elevated above revenue growth rate in the front half of 2016, with growth rates expected to level off and be in line with revenue growth in the back half of 2016. 
Before we turn it over to Q&A, I wanted to take just a moment to express my thanks to Kevin and the team. It has been a real privilege and honor over the last 11-plus years to work for Kevin in this great brand and have been part of such a strong leadership team, an amazing group of teammates that now top more than 12,000. 
In addition, today marks the 37th UA earnings call I have participated in. And I would like to thank the analysts and investors and the call today, many of whom I spent time with over the years telling the Under Armour story.

And then planning our business in 2016 at 25%. There's a lot of growth in multitude of places and I think there's -- we talked about this in the past it's a little bit of a danger in looking at some of the data sets that are out there, specific of data sets like sports can. It can be challenging looking at our business relative to something like Sports Can where that data is only capturing actually less than 40% of our business, specifically in the fourth quarter. It's missing take key data inputs like our Direct-to-Consumer  business, our International business, and it's actually extrapolating some of our key accounts that are pretty large like the Dick's and the Footlocker. It obviously also includes accounts that we do not service. So utilizing that data as a proxy for our success especially in the fourth quarter, it can be a little bit challenged as we've seen obviously because we posted another strong quarter and apparel growing over 20%. So I just want to start that answer with the careful and some of this data sets that's out there, who how they relate to our business, in particular."

So let me begin with Footwear and out in North America and, and I'll close with Women's. So I think the best way for us to",2091,"Thanks, Brad. And I think it's important just to put some context. So let me just take a couple minutes and address your questions. So let me begin with Footwear and out in North America and, and I'll close with Women's. So I think the best way for us to start is about growth. It goes without saying that any of these questions come down to what is our growth look like. And in the fourth quarter with 31% growth, frankly marking our 23rd consecutive quarter of 20-plus percent top line revenue growth, our gross story is strong. We remain a growth company and none of that is waivered. But I also want to give you some context begin with Footwear about just our businesses has changed really just 2012. It evolving into a true Footwear brand. Remember, 10 years ago, we celebrated -- we went public, we haven't even launched our first shoe until we launched football cleats in June of 2006. So we're, long way from there. So beginning with Footwear just going back to 2012 was 13% of our business. And since then we've added, I don't know, a couple billion dollars of revenue. And today, Footwear is nearly 17% of our business, representing a 42% CAGR over the last just few years. The diversity -- again back in 2012, our mix of products was 33% of our Footwear in 2012 was cleats. Cleats today are down to 22% with plans of being the #1 shoe in the market in football, and I'll get back to that in just a second. In my prepared remarks, I mentioned that doubling our running styles over $100 and I just want to make for context, and I talked about increasing over 1000%. Across all of our Footwear, we've more than tripled our Footwear styles priced over $100, while quadrupling the volume. Like Footwear for us couldn't be more and better position to be truly a premium Footwear brand. And the best way for me to articulate that, let me start about basketball for a second. First of all, we have the right athlete in Stephen Curry, and he is without question the #1 basketball player on the planet today. We've got the right product that's led by the Curry Two and to be clear, we launched the Curry One just a year ago at $120 price point. We then came back on a tour that we did with Stephen in the fall of September, and we launched the Curry Two at $130 price point, and we've learned a tremendous amount over the last year of what we can do, primarily what we can do a signature basketball product and feel incredibly bullish about our ability to continue to raise ASPs going forward. In Youth, we've heightened our focus to capture the next athlete, driving nearly 50% CAGR just since 2012 in Youth Footwear. And again, building out these of departments, building out the teams has never been more important. And speaking of teams, we more than doubled the size of our Footwear team to nearly 230 people, including the recent addition of a dedicated Women's team and I want to be clear, we didn't have a dedicated Women's team in 2012, let alone 18 months ago. So we are certainly not done, we continue to build a team out and growing our presence in Portland with our new headquarters that will be opening [indiscernible]. So these investments in our team they all mean that these trends are expected to accelerate in 2016. And again, that's an awful whopping 95% in the quarter and 57% for the full year. So some of the ways we expect to leverage that success. First, expanding Curry throughout the upcoming All-Star game, the playoffs, finals and then the Olympics later this fall. And then ultimately, we're elevating it further when we launch the Curry Three later this year. We also this year entering the golf category with the most exciting player in the planet as well as the #1 player in the world in Jordan Spieth, where we have a new line of Footwear that will be debuting around the masters. In addition, we're going to be doubling our and expensed price over $100 led by Slingshot and Slingride, the knit offerings that we have. In 2012, we have just 1 . Today, we have more than 8 over $100. We're also be doing things like debuting our first Smart shoe, the SpeedForm Gemini 2 RE, record equipped and that's going to be at $150 price point, a $20 premium with the standard $130 Gemini price points. And an estimate shows that earlier impact our roots success of Cam Newton who will be playing next week in the Super Bowl wearing the Highlight Cleat that depending on where you look is the #1 selling cleat in America at the highest price point continuing to drive us toward becoming the #1 American football cleats in the market. And again, our goal, talk about impossible back in 2006. I will say it's a small category as domestic only. Our brand, our presence our ability to drive ASPs have never been stronger in North America and I believe that Footwear is the best example we have of how we are truly just getting started. So let me take a second just talk about North America. I want to level set the context of how our distribution is aligned. So often we're compared to our competition, well our largest competitor in North America has approximately 24,000 points of distribution just in North America. At Under Armour, we have 11,000 and we have the ability to expand that, but we haven't. We stay committed to our sporting goods, to our mall, to our department stores channel and again, this doesn't make going anywhere else impossible for us, but it certainly makes it an opportunity particularly as we add things like the new merchandising team, which just joined and frankly we're just in putting Under Armour through 2015. To be clear, prior to 2015, we didn't have a merchandising team. So our structure is changed and frankly it has evolved. And we talked about North American growth. In the third quarter North America, we grew 25%. In the fourth quarter, in North America, we grew 26%. I don't know if I call that accelerating, but I certainly call it strong. So I way this is happening 1 simple word, 1 simple phrase. When we innovate, we win. Bringing new technologies and styles in 2016. I mentioned in my prepared remarks things like CoolSwitch to Microthread and Cooling. On heating side, we have products like Reactor, a new price point that -- around $200 that complements our current styles that we have. And also new product items like the Swacket, which will elevate our fleet assortment. You'll start to see us move away from things like the big logo hoodie that's been very important to us. But again, you continue to see us learn, and you'll  continue to see has evolved but not just where the market is heading, but most importantly, where we're taking the market to. As you think about North America, Footwear is such an extraordinary opportunity for us from the signature Curry product to running, to kids. We have more styles at higher price points than ever before in 2015 and it will absolutely be the case in 2016. We've also become the #1 brand in many places most recently where we took the title with the SportScheck in Canada so across apparel, Footwear and Accessories, we are the #1 vendor for SportScheck a very important sporting good account. And we're closing on that in the majority in many of our other distribution. Supreme in story telling. This is not just lip service that we are committed to our existing distribution, our existing base. And so what is storytelling and the way we show up at retail and places like the armory with our partners of, where the blue-chip shops that we're building at Dick's Sporting Goods, we're going to make continued investments in premium brand statements with our partners. And the way we can do this is that very well, the first handshake that we have with that consumer will more than likely be a digital handshake because across the Connected Fitness platform that we've implemented over the last 2.5 years, we now have more than 90 million domestic athletes amplifying our message and driving access to the brand. And finally, Direct-to-Consumer. Unfortunately, this is an area the market doesn't have preview too until we ever tell you our numbers. It's the place though that we typically have the ability to tell our typical brand stories. Beginning with E-Commerce. Meeting the consumer where they want to be met. Capitalizing on investments that we've made to leverage things like mobile trends, which now is 50% of our fourth quarter traffic. And in terms of retail, we added 5 new Brand House stores in 2015. Again, I want to emphasize, we are wholesale manufacturer, but we do have this Direct-to-Consumer component that gives us I think a great complement to again meet the consumer where they want to. Adding 5 new Brand House stores in 2015 with roughly 5 to as many as 8 planned in 2015, including looking back at the year, we launched our 30,000 square-foot flagship on the Magnificent Mile in Chicago that really I think is one of the best examples of our brand we've ever opened anywhere in the world. So to be clear about North America, we still see abundant opportunities across the continent. And as we said at our Investor Day in September, we believe that we will double this business by 2018. And we say all of these, recognizing, acknowledging, yes, we have of course have places we can be better we're certainly not perfect, but we are learning everyday and we're putting a team, and we make that happen, and so we say all of this about our confidence incredibly humbly as well is that we have work to be done. So finally, let me just address Women's. This business I want to be clear is incredibly important to our account, and it's important to us. And while we believe we have huge opportunity to get better, we deliver yet another quarter of double-digit growth in Women's. Now approaching 3 quarters of $1 billion in revenue. So 2014 was a year that we define and we described as the year of the woman. We netted his conversation of the market side with a female consumer that's really taking the brand to new levels engagement and expectation. And we did that through people, through personalities. Personalities is like Misty and Gisele. But we also recognize of our products as get to meet that expectation but what we learned is that she likes it and she wants to have relationship with the Under Armour brand. And so you've seen our product evolve. And just as importantly, in 2015 for us, you watch our team evolved. As we've been investing in our foundation, we've been investing in our team and not just any 1 individual, but throughout our product duration engine, our merchandising team and our new category management with our new leader in Pam who will be heading of our Women's management to brings 20 years experience in the business. This will all better enable us to create and deliver a 365-day year experience for her. 2016 is about execution in both Apparel and Footwear. And to be clear, we didn't even have a Women's Footwear team just a little more than a year ago. So building out these resources for us to really capitalize on the opportunity where she, just like the men's, want to address total ahead. So we expect to see improved merchandise assortments across our premium distribution, and we also expect to continue to elevate our brand where women want us in places like E-Commerce and to be clear, on E-Commerce, Women's was our #1 and a largest selling and fastest-growing category that we had, faster than Men's and faster than Youth. So we merchandise correctly, we believe we will win. Listen, we understand that her expectations are incredibly high for us, and that's exactly where we want them be. We firmly believe that our Women's business should be as we said a very long time at least as large if not larger than our men's business. Thanks, Matt."

Obviously even with those improvements, Footwear margins are well below our apparel margins, and we talked about that consistently over the years. So we do anticipate still a lot of room on the Footwear side, a lot of that come our ability to sell premium pricing points specifically categories like running and basketball which are historically more are higher margin products sold maybe, bigger part of our portfolio that will help our margins from mix perspective. We put a lot of investment in energy into the sourcing inside of our business and development side of our businesses, in Footwear also, so we're seeing some benefit there on the costing side. And I think it's Kevin talked about too, the ability to utilize the strength of our brand in these categories too from a pricing perspective. So we do see Footwear margins they have improved from the last few years today. We see them improving in the next few years also, but again, just in the caution that day will continue to be overall apparel margins. That being said though, as we often talked about in the past that you got to keep in mind from an operating margin perspective with a higher price points in footwear and higher ASPs in footwear compared to apparel, we do have the ablated to leverage SG&A all the better. We do see a long run even though gross margins will improve in Footwear, but we'll be below apparel that our operating margins in the longer run should look pretty similar to our Apparel business."

So one thing we've learned is [indiscernible] is a 10 years, 10,000 hours to perfect something so I'm not sure that we perfected the Footwear, but we really feel strong about the position in the game right now. And that begins, of course, I think with the athletes that make it real, and are winning in our Footwear, out in the field, out of pitch, out-of-court, whether Cam Newton, hopefully, he'll do in football in the Super Bowl next week, Jordan Spieth in golf or Stephen Curry and basketball you talk about International we have no greater global ambassadors than the ones that we have here today. And as recent as just this past week, we also launched Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson that will be sporting Under Armour. It official brand of shorts. So what we built I Footwear is impressive, but again, we still think we have room to grow. The franchise is that the bill from highlight to SpeedForm, to Gemini, to Gemini record, to the new Curry product, to Slingshot, to Bandit, I mean I think we've done a great job of building, as I said, franchise business across the sports where we want to win and that typically begins in running, and it begins and basketball. And so we love our positioning there as I mentioned a product about $100 and again, hitting some of those sweet spot for direct distribution that meets again the consumer where they want to be met. So I think we feel very bullish about what we're doing on the International front. Again some of that evolution, too Jim has been things like we launched product in the United States, and then it was 6-month or 1 year later that we launch it in a global basis. So the ability to truly with a trolley to team we have an International side of building launching those things the way within that we've done I think we demonstrated our ability to do really about our company. I mean a great example again is last year when I mentioned going on the Curry tour, the purpose of that there was launching the Curry Two in China. Almost 6 weeks ahead when we launched here in North America us, so I think that truly becoming a global business not being a North American company that sells things in other market for truly being a global business that has global presence and the global position that sells things the same time equally. we're evolving toward that, but we really like our progress in incredibly excited about where we're heading with it."

First of all, and apparel side, again, the majority of our business 70-plus percent of our business is still at apparel so it is our focus largest team here and frankly it's where we both our brand as innovators. And so some of the things that I mentioned on the call, Reactor, Swack it, CoolSwitch some of the product that we have in the product offering all that continue to support our existing ColdGear business. and We effectively built the $25 price point for HeatGear and the $50 price for ColdGear and since then, we've been evolving those. So as we look where premium brands. One of the other things that I mentioned that maybe going a little more depth on is our ability now to have merchandising, and you talked about ASPs and price points. Again, we didn't have a merchandising team in 2014. It was a category that we started the building out for ourselves in 2015, 2015, process about building the team. In 2016, it's about segmenting and playing it out in the market. What that means is again having the right product, the right place, the right time. And truly having a team just assign the same's times to everyone is equal basis between space and diversity what we did in the mall versus what to do in the sporting goods, let alone with what we do at Dick's sporting goods versus what we do in one of our other accounts. So we are being incredibly thoughtful about that the way that we drive. As we look forward into 2017, we really drive efficiency, really looking at pricing really look at the ability for us to maximize and optimize things like margin but also again making sure that you put the right product sell-through because some of the things that we dealt with this year is bringing product and having and our floor set in time for January and no one can predict things like what happens in this fourth quarter, but I think one of the things we're most proud of is that in spite of what happens with weather, we still have -- close to 31% top line growth. So we'd love that to see -- continue to translate and drive margin. It's one of our key barometer that we use here in the company and I think frankly as Brad will tell you right now, we're doing a good job and more important to playing going forward we continue to drive and demonstrate the premium positioning in the marketplace."

A lot of other things going on the rest of that 20 basis points, but the fact of the matter is we had some pretty strong headwinds in 2015 relative to airfreight as we're looking at servicing our customers during the year and port disruption earlier in the year makes we talked a lot about during the year Footwear International working against us from a gross marketing perspective we do significantly. And we are able to offset a lot of that just through our general increase improvement and product margins specifically and apparel side. So as you look forward in 2016 and beyond, you should see continued improvement in places like our Footwear product margin, like our apparel product margins. International, to some degree as we go forward should get better as the businesses in countries we do directly, whether it's through our DTC or through wholesale become larger part of our share with some of the distributors that we do today. So I think in all aspect of our business, you will see that improve over time. Mix will definitely work against us because these businesses are still Footwear International, still lower-margin businesses. But to your point, our ability to improve those margin is great and our ability to improve margin I apparel is not only possible, but it's happening right now as we speak."

We had some warm fourth quarters, some colder fourth quarters and so forth. So I know answer is pretty consistent. Over the last few years, there's obviously going to be a little bit of an impact on weather, there's no doubt about that. And it impacts our business, too. And we said the last few years probably a couple percentage points of growth impact relative to whether specifically, 1 where the other, whether it's warm or cold. So there's no doubt that fourth quarter distributed a little bit of that impact, and we talked about the fact that managing our way through that and liquidating some excess inventory and taking care of that also in the front half of next year specifically in the first quarter. But overall, from a top line perspective, it's really only a couple percentage point of growth one way or the other probably. And that and again, when you look at specifically this fourth quarter, that was more of a North American dynamics in places where you'd see probably impact the most via our North America wholesale Apparel business and our he Factory House business. But again, with the diversity of our product lines and apparel Footwear strong growth International strong growth, which is much more going more in our business that offsets some of those weather impacts, which, again, probably a couple percentage points of growth, one way or the other. So going forward, I think continuously being careful how we plan Q3 and specifically Q4 in the years not being overly optimistic on weather but being prudent and putting ourselves in a position to be opportunistic if weather behaves for us. I think it's really important. To the same extent that weather doesn't behave, it will impact us a little bit, and we can manage our way through the specifically with the strong Factory House channel we have."

I want to wish you all a belated happy new year and wish those in China, an early [Foreign Language].
While this earnings call is a report on our 2015 fourth quarter and the past year as a whole, I want to focus for a moment on the year ahead. This year, 2016, is Under Armour's 20th year in business. It's an incredible milestone for any company, and for us, it means a few things. It means that the next generation entering the workforce doesn't know a world where Under Armour didn't exist.
This generation doesn't recognize us as the underdogs, but as the always was. It means that we are not a passing fad or a flavor of the month. The interlocking UA logo has become a globally recognized symbol for being aggressive, young and fearless. It means we are a brand that resonates with athletes, all athletes, and we will continue to thrive because we remain as humble and hungry as we were 20 years ago with plenty of room left to grow.
And with that, our scoreboard remains strong. We are entering this milestone positioned for success, capping off the past year with yet another solid finish. Total net revenues for the fourth quarter were up 31%, marking our 23rd consecutive quarter of 20-plus percent net revenue growth. And since this call is about our most recent fourth quarter, let me throw out a few more numbers to you that are fourth quarterly related. 36%, 34%, 26%, 35% and 31%. Those are the percentages we have grown in each of the previous 5 fourth quarters.
Each year around this time, weather inevitably plays part of the conversation. And each year, we answer those who doubt us with extremely strong growth numbers in the fourth quarter. Was it 72 degrees on the East Coast this past Christmas? It was. Did it affect our business the way some thought it would? No, it did not. Because here in the U.S. where we currently do the majority of our business, we know that football will be played in the fall, basketball will be played in the winter, baseball will be played in the spring and like soccer, personal health and fitness is a year-round all-weather interest. Our business is more diversified than it's ever been. We do not let weather play a decisive role in dictating our success. As we move into 2016, we have become a global brand capable of meeting athletes' need from head to toe.
In the fourth quarter, we posted strong gains across our business, illustrating the broad base strength and demand for our brand, with apparel growing 22%, Direct-to-Consumer growing 25%, International growing 70% and Footwear growing a whopping 95%. While our growth drivers have not changed since we went public more than 10 years ago, these numbers show how diverse our portfolio has become and reinforces the continued success of our largest category, apparel.
Ten years ago, we were a $281 million company, with apparel representing 93% of our revenues and compression representing 64% of the entire business. Today, our apparel business represents 71% of our revenues and compression is less than 10%.
We closed 2015 with more balance and breadth of product across our businesses, men's, women's and Youth driving our apparel business to over $2.8 billion from just $260 million it was a decade ago. In the fourth quarter, apparel growth of 22% showcases that our brand has products for all seasons and temperatures and perhaps more importantly, that today, our athletes have the complete head-to-toe assortment available to them in more channels globally than ever before.
Ten years ago, our Direct-to-Consumer business represented 6% of our net revenues, consisting of a single website and just 4 domestic Factory House stores. Today, our Direct-to-Consumer business represents 30% of net revenues, made up of 25 global websites and nearly 400 Under Armour owned and partner retail doors around the world. It impossible not to talk about the strength of E-Commerce when we look at our Direct-to-Consumer business. This business continues to be on fire, not only in the United States, but also around the world.
In China, on Singles Day this past November, we had our first million-dollar revenue day online, while in the U.S., mobile has grown to almost 50% of the traffic to our site and represented 23% of E-Commerce revenues in the fourth quarter. Consumers continue to look for us in multiple places, and we will be wherever they are, whether it's on the device or in physical doors.
Globally, we continue to drive both awareness and revenue growth as we expand our retail footprint outside the United States, closing out 2015 with almost 3x as many doors in total from just a year ago. 10 years ago, we just entered Europe and our international business was $6 million, primarily driven by our partners in Japan. Today, international has become almost $0.5 billion business, with our brand being sold in more than 60 countries.
Last week, I visited our Amsterdam office that it serves as our European headquarters for the past 10 years, located in the historic Olympic Stadium where the energy and enthusiasm has me more confident in our team and their ability than ever before. In 2015, every region, every category and every channel exceeded our plans for our international business, driving 70% growth in the fourth quarter and 69% growth year-over-year. 2 years ago, our international business was 6% of revenues. Today, it's 11%. And by 2018, as we said at our Investor Day, we expect it to be 18%.
Our brand certainly translates. 10 years ago, we've not sold a single pair of shoes. Today, footwear represents 17% of our business, closing in on $700 million in revenues. This past quarter, our footwear revenues grew 95%, driven in part by the success of our expanded running line, which will feature 8 different offerings all over the $100 price point compared to the 4 lines offered in the previous year.
Also driving our growth and more importantly, creating an incredible connection with our young consumer is our Stephen Curry signature basketball shoe line that launched almost a year ago today. The sell-through on the Curry Two was like nothing we've ever seen before, the same words that people tend to say after watching Stephen play live.
We're just beginning to see what partnering with the right athlete like Stephen Curry can do for our business. It's difficult to underestimate the power of having the best sell-through of any signature basketball shoe this past season. It clearly lifted our brand in the mall channel and positioned us for aggressive growth, not only in signature, but overall with this most important consumer base.
Footwear, and to be clear, premium footwear, continues to be an accelerator to our top line and a huge part of our growth story. With our sights set on building $1 billion plus footwear brand, it is becoming a bigger and more important component of our business, and the result will be a more balanced blend of apparel and footwear within UA. Posting a 57% growth in footwear for the full year in 2015 is evidence of our ability to resonate with the consumer and provide them with a breadth of products unmatched in years past.
The strength of our footwear product coming from our expanding team of designers and developers helped us elevate our business above $100 at retail by 1,000% this past year. And we're even more excited and proud of the product that is coming out in 2016.
We're seeing what Stephen has done for our basketball business, what basketball has done for our footwear business and from there, what footwear has done for our brand. This story is being told in our numbers, but it is also being told on the courts, fields and pitches around the world. Show up at any Golden State Warriors game, home or away, it doesn't matter, and you will see that thousands of people who show up early just to see Stephen Curry's warm-up routine. That, as I have described to you before, is the power of sports.
Speaking of our MVPs, we're continuing on last year's theme of UA ambassadors dominating their respective sports. Thanks to our roster of athletes who continue to win on the world's biggest stages. Since the last time we spoke, in baseball, Bryce Harper of the Washington Nationals is named the Major League Baseball MVP in the National League. In tennis, Andy Murray, won the Davis Cup for Britain for the first time in 79 years. And in boxing, Canelo Alvarez became the WBC Middleweight Champion of the world with his victory over Miguel Cotto. They joined Stephen, Jordan, Misty and others in our year of champions, solidifying UA as the home for winners.
Now with the Super Bowl just over a week away, we will see yet another UA MVP, Cam Newton, compete at the highest level of this sport while representing our brand. Cam has been a critical driver of our footwear success with the Highlight Cleat, and the Super Bowl will introduce into a brand-new set of consumers. It is a platform where companies pay $5 million to air a simple 30-second TV spot during the broadcast, while our guy will wear his UA cleats throughout the entire 3-plus hours of the game.
And finally, we ended 2015 with a key personnel announcement. Last month, we announced Brad Dickerson's successor as CFO will be Chip Molloy. Chip comes to us with significant financial executive experience at the consumer retail sector, having served as EVP and CFO for PetSmart from 2007 until 2013, and where in 2011, he was named Institutional Investors CFO of the Year for Specialty Retail. 
Chip is a Maryland native and a graduate of one of our partner schools, the United States Naval Academy. He also graduated from Navy Fighter Weapons School or Top Gun as it is known, where he served for 15 years in the United States Navy. With my new partner in place, Chip will work together with Brad over the next month to ensure a smooth transition.
So that's how we closed 2015. Now let's talk about how we kicked off 2016. We started this year off with a bang at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, unveiling a suite of products that will change the way athletes live. Many of you have heard me talk about Connected Fitness on these calls or at our Investor Day. In the past 3 weeks, we've seen the vision of this platform truly come to life.
First, we announced the launch of UA Record, 1 of our 4 mobile app platforms that collectively are earning more than 130,000 new users a day since just beginning of the year. UA Record is the digital dashboard that displays everything you need to know about your health in 4 quadrants: Sleep, fitness, activity and nutrition. Combined with your body weight and our own cognitive measurement of how do you feel, it collects and displays a complete picture of your health in the easiest, most simple way possible.
Second, we introduced the Under Armour HealthBox, the world's first complete connected fitness system, which consists of a band, a heart rate strap and a smart scale, all in one package. Built in partnership with HTC, these tools work together to capture data pertaining to your health and fitness and again, doing it in the easiest, most simple way possible.
Because music is such an important part of how people exercise, we also partnered with Harman Kardon JBL, who launched Bluetooth-enabled wireless headphones, including an updated version to be released later this year that will also read heart rate in lieu of a strap. Finally, we launched our first smart shoe with the Gemini 2 RE, which stands for Record Equipped.
This shoe tracks every step and uploads the data, including time, date, duration and distance directly into our platforms. This cutting-edge footwear provides an untethered experience and allows the athlete to run device free. There is no start or stop button. When the shoe is on your feet, it's ready and tracking. And one of the cool features of this shoe is that it tracks its own lifespan and will send a notification when it's time for a new pair.
All of these products feed into UA Record as well as more than 400 different connected devices to create the ultimate open platform destination to measure your health and fitness.
Additionally, we announced our partnership with IBM and their Watson platform to help build the insights capability for Under Armour Record. Wearables have been effective in telling you how many steps you took or the hours you slept, but they haven't been effective in giving you proactive information on how to utilize that data to make your life better. Put simply, there was no call to action until now. IBM's Watson, a platform that executes cognitive thinking, will provide personalized insights in real time to the user based on the information we collect for UA Record and will take the experience and service to a whole new level.
By adding Watson's insights to UA Record, we deliver direction to help you reach your personal goal, whether you want to lose 10 pounds or simply just feel better. This is what differentiates UA Record from the rest of the fitness tracking apps and what gives us confidence to the consumer experience we are building to help change the way athletes live.
Now let me complete the vision for Connected Fitness. Beyond enriching lives, it will propel our business forward. This is not a tech initiative. This is a digital transformation and therefore, a business transformation for Under Armour. Before Connected Fitness, we only had retail transaction information for less than 10 million people that stores and E-Commerce combine. Now we have daily activity level data from our community members who log nearly 8 billion foods and 2 billion activities last year alone.
Not only do we have people going into our stores and visiting our E-Commerce sites, but we also have a deeper understanding of our consumer based on the information collected using Connected Fitness, including sleep, fitness, activity, nutrition, weight and how do you feel. This gives us an unparalleled view of their life and needs. I refer to it as our mouth house [ph] during our last call, but we're also calling it the single view of the consumer.
All of this is possible because of the near 10-year partnership we have established with SAP. The single view of the consumer is something we're building with the team at SAP that combines global point-of-sale, E-Commerce and transactional information through a single sign-on capability together with our Connected Fitness business to create an insight engine that will inform and guide our decision to help grow and scale our brand. This will build on our existing SAP platform as we double down and continue to make big bets with big partners. We believe that this unique technological advancement will position UA as a best-in-class real-time digital enterprise.
At Under Armour, we focus on creating products you don't know you need yet. But once you have it, you won't remember how you live without it, just like our very first T-shirt. Some great example of this are the types of innovation we'll bring to the market that will further elevate and diversify our product and continue to distinguish Under Armour.
For example, this year, we will launch Microthread, a new cooling technology comprised of elastomeric thread that dries 30% faster and is 70% more breathable than similar lycra construction. Then on the heating side, there's Reactor, an insulation that combines warmth and breathability to keep you comfortable without overheating. This is in addition to many other new innovations like CoolSwitch, and on the footwear side, Slingshot. New innovations like the ones I just mentioned bring new opportunities for growth, which lead to revenue-driving platforms.
Our goal is that these new innovations will develop as strongly as some of our key revenue-driving platforms from prior years like ColdGear Infrared and Armour in apparel and the signature Curry line in footwear. Our relentless pursuit of innovation is just that, relentless, it never stops.
When I first began Under Armour 20 years ago, I didn't set out to make just another T-shirt. I set out to make a better T-shirt, one that solves the problem and gives whoever wears it an advantage. With our Connected Fitness business, we're not releasing another fitness app or tracking device. We're building a complete ecosystem to manage your health and fitness with actionable insights to make you better. Finding a better way has been a running theme for us over the past 20 years, whether it's through the products we offer or the way we operate our business. And we'll keep finding a better way for another 20 years because we are just getting started.
So now I'd like to introduce Chip Molloy before Brad takes us through the numbers. Chip?"

I would now like to spend some time reviewing our fourth quarter and full year 2015 financial results, followed by our updated outlook for 2016.Our net revenues for the fourth quarter of 2015 increased 31% to $1.17 billion. On a",2116,"Thanks, Kevin and Chip. I would now like to spend some time reviewing our fourth quarter and full year 2015 financial results, followed by our updated outlook for 2016.
Our net revenues for the fourth quarter of 2015 increased 31% to $1.17 billion. On a currency-neutral basis, fourth quarter net revenues increased 33%. For the full year, net revenues increased 28% to $3.96 billion, which compared to our most recent full year guidance of $3.91 billion. On a currency-neutral basis, full year net revenues increased 31%.
Focusing on the fourth quarter, we grew apparel net revenues 22% to $865 million compared to $708 million in the prior year's quarter. With our efforts to build a more diversified business, we posted impressive growth across channels and categories despite well-documented weather challenges. Our focus on brand -- on building brand equity around the globe through elevated product and experiences was evident in the strong growth of international and Direct-to-Consumer in the quarter. We also saw success around our continued expansion in key product categories like training, running, golf, team sports and basketball.
Fourth quarter footwear net revenues increased 95% to $167 million from $86 million in the prior year. Broad-based footwear strength has been the consistent theme in 2015 though the exceptional performance of our Curry Two signature basketball line was clearly a fourth quarter standout. Our accessories net revenues during the fourth quarter increased 23% to $97 million from $79 million last year and really driven by continued strong demand for our line of bags.
Our global Direct-to-Consumer net revenues increased 25% for the quarter, representing approximately 36% of net revenues. In global retail, we ended the fourth quarter with 191 owned stores, including 161 Factory House stores and 30 Brand House stores. With our retail business still heavily weighted to North America Factory House stores, we did experience some of the similar weather-related challenges as our overall apparel business. However, our strong E-Commerce business continues to diversify how we reach global consumers. And we continue to capitalize on our investments in mobile and international, where we more than doubled our in-country websites during 2015.
Looking at our regions, North America net revenues increased 26% to $1.02 billion in the fourth quarter compared to $808 million in the prior year's quarter. On a currency-neutral basis, North America net revenues increased 27%, accelerating from the growth rate posted last quarter despite the warm weather backdrop. This strength demonstrates the diversity of our product mix, including accelerated footwear growth and consistent apparel performance as well as channel mix between our wholesale partners and our Direct-to-Consumer businesses.
International net revenues increased 70% to $139 million in the fourth quarter and represented 12% of total net revenues. On a currency-neutral basis, international net revenues increased 85% for the period.
In the EMEA region, our heightened focus on the U.K. and Germany continues to drive momentum in these 2 core markets. While growth remains strong across all channels, our E-Commerce strategy, including 9 new in-country sites launched in 2015, is playing a key role in broadening our reach and awareness in the region.
In Asia Pacific, we continue to see tremendous demand for the brand, driving triple-digit growth across Greater China and our Southeast Asia distributor, led by the success and expansion of our Brand House stores. And in Latin America, we are building momentum with many of our recent country expansions like Chile, more than offsetting the well-documented macro challenges in Brazil.
Moving on to margins. Fourth quarter gross margins contracted 190 basis points to 48% compared to 49.9% in the prior year's period. The following factors were the primary drivers during the quarter. First, sales mix negatively impacted gross margin by approximately 90 basis points in the fourth quarter versus the prior year, primarily driven by the continued strong performance of our footwear business. Second, the continued strength of the U.S. dollar negatively impacted gross margin by approximately 80 basis points versus the prior year. Third, higher inventory liquidations negatively impacted gross margin by approximately 30 basis points.
Before I move on with other elements of the quarter, I wanted to provide a quick snapshot of our gross margin performance for the full year. Our full year rate in 2015 declined 90 basis points to 48.1% compared to 49% in the prior year's period. Of this 90 basis point decline, 70 basis points resulted from the continued strength of the U.S. dollar.
While we also face additional gross margin headwinds from adverse sales mix impact given the strong growth of our international and footwear businesses, higher inventory liquidation specifically in the fourth quarter and higher freight expenses from port disruptions and efforts to better service our business, we were able to offset most of the noncurrency-related pressure through more favorable product margins in both our North America and international businesses.
Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues leveraged 80 basis points to 32.8% in the fourth quarter of 2015 from 33.6% in the prior year's period. SG&A details for the fourth quarter are as follows. Marketing costs decreased to 7.9% of net revenues for the quarter from 8.4% in the prior year period, primarily reflecting the timing of our global marketing campaigns. Other SG&A costs decreased to 24.9% of net revenues for the quarter from 25.2% in the prior year, driven primarily by lower incentive compensation expense.
Operating income for the fourth quarter increased 21% to $178 million compared with $146 million in the prior year period. For the full year, operating income increased 15% to $409 million compared to our most recent guidance of $408 million. The 2 Connected Fitness acquisitions we made in 2015 negatively impacted full year operating income by approximately $23 million.
Interest and other expense in the fourth quarter increased to $6 million compared with $4 million in the prior year period, primarily reflecting increased interest expense associated with the financing of our Connected Fitness acquisition.
Our fourth quarter tax rate of 38.4% was consistent with the prior year. Our fourth quarter net income increased 21% to $106 million compared to $88 million in the prior year period, while our diluted earnings per share increased to $0.48 from $0.40 in the prior year's period.
Full year diluted earnings per share increased 11% to $1.05 compared to $0.95 in 2014. The $1.05 earnings per share in 2015 is inclusive of a $0.10 impact from the 2 Connected Fitness acquisitions we made in 2015.
On the balance sheet, total cash and cash equivalents for the quarter decreased to $130 million compared with $593 million at December 31, 2014. Accounts receivable increased 55% to $434 million compared with $280 million at December 31, 2014, primarily related to the timing of shipments within the quarter.
Inventory for the quarter increased 46% to $783 million compared to $537 million at December 31, 2014. Back at our Investor Day in September and again, on our third quarter earnings call, we discussed elevated inventory growth from the 36% rate posted in the third quarter. This growth is largely a result of our strategy to focus on delivering our products to our consumers in a more timely manner and thus drive higher fill rates. This strategy includes flowing product to our customers earlier to meet key seasonal floor set dates as well as strategic investments in auto-replenishment products.
While these efforts are driving much of the elevated inventory growth rates in the near term, they are also delivering meaningful improvements in our service levels year-over-year in support of our revenue growth. In addition, the recent weather trends have led to some excess inventory creation, which we will continue to work through across our normal liquidation channels during the first half of 2016.
Total debt increased to $669 million as compared to $284 million at December 31, 2014, primarily reflecting the financing of our 2 Connected Fitness acquisitions.
Looking at our cash flows, our investment and capital expenditures was $85 million for the fourth quarter compared to $59 million in the prior year's period, driven primarily by our investment on our global headquarters in Baltimore and our SAP platform. Full year capital expenditures were $325 million compared to our prior guidance range of $350 million to $360 million, primarily due to timing of our investments.
Now moving on to 2016. Based on our current visibility, we expect 2016 net revenues of approximately $4.95 billion, representing growth of 25%, and 2016 operating income of approximately $503 million, representing growth of 23%. These growth rates remain in line with the long-term growth rates laid out at our Investor Day last September and are also consistent with our previous guidance on our third quarter earnings call.
Below the operating line, we expect interest expense to increase to approximately $35 million in 2016 as we expect the increased debt levels to support our business and look for opportunities to refinance our debt with more long-term financing. In addition, we expect the full year tax rate of approximately 38.5% and fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 223 million.
Now I'd like to provide more color on our expected results for 2016. First, with net revenues, we currently anticipate the growth rate for the first half of the year to be above our expected full year growth rate. Specifically looking at the first quarter, we expect the growth rate to be in the high 20s, led by many of the same factors from our fourth quarter, including strength in footwear and international, higher planned inventory liquidations and strategies to better service our customers year-over-year. As is typical at this point in the year, as we gain better visibility on orders, specifically for the fourth quarter, we provide updates on our progress on future calls.
Next, on gross margin, we expect a relatively consistent year-over-year rate in 2016 as compared to 2015. For the first quarter of 2016, we anticipate similar year-over-year dynamics as our just completed fourth quarter results, including higher liquidations to clear through excess inventory, along with continued currency headwinds. Thus, we expect our largest gross margin headwind for the year during the first quarter. We are planning an approximate 150 basis point decline year-over-year.
Shifting to SG&A. We expect to deleverage expenses in 2016 as our focus remains on making the right investments to drive our long-term global success. Looking at the marketing portion of SG&A, we expect to continue to invest across our sports marketing assets, global brand campaigns and retail market.
In other SG&A, we are focused on key brand-enhancing initiatives that we outlined at our Investor Day such as Connected Fitness and global retail as well strategic investments -- strategic business areas, including category management and innovation. With the higher top line growth rate currently expected that in the front half of the year, we expect modest overall SG&A leverage in the front half of the year and modest deleverage in the second half of the year.
Looking at capital expenditures in 2016. We are currently planning to invest at the midpoint of our 8% to 10% of net revenues target range outlined at our Investor Day. Our investments include our global headquarters as well as our expanding SAP platform that will serve as the architecture for our future growth while also driving our insights engine to power our single view of the consumer that Kevin spoke about.
Finally, inventory. As we previously stated, our focus is on delivering our products to our consumers in a more timely manner and improving our customer service levels. As a result, we continue to expect inventory growth rates to be slightly elevated above revenue growth rate in the front half of 2016, with growth rates expected to level off and be in line with revenue growth in the back half of 2016.
Before we turn it over to Q&A, I wanted to take just a moment to express my thanks to Kevin and the team. It has been a real privilege and honor over the last 11-plus years to work for Kevin and this great brand and have been part of such a strong leadership team, an amazing group of teammates that now tops more than 12,000.
In addition, today marks the 37th UA earnings call I have participated in. And I would like to thank the analysts and investors on the call today, many of whom I spent time with over the years telling the Under Armour story. I'm excited to pass the CFO reins to Chip, a proven leader. And I am confident that Chip and the talented team supporting him will continue the strong growth for this great brand.
Now let me turn over to your questions. Operator?"

I think one of the things that's important, there's a lot of noise this time of year with the weather and so forth in the fourth quarter. And I think it was important, especially in Kevin's prepared remarks, around the track record we've had with the 23 straight quarters above 20% growth and then even in the fourth quarter, in the last 6 years, a CAGR in the fourth quarter of about 32% growth and then planning our business in 2016 at 25%. There's a lot of growth in multitude of places. And I think there's -- we've talked about this in the past too. I think there's a little bit of a danger in looking at some of the data sets that are out there, specifically a data set like sports can. And it can be challenging looking at our business relative to something like sports can [ph] where that data is only -- is capturing actually less than 40% of our business, specifically in the fourth quarter. It's missing key data inputs like our Direct-to-Consumer business, our international business, and it's actually extrapolating some of our key accounts that are pretty large like the Dick's and the Foot Locker. And it obviously also includes accounts that we do not service. So utilizing that data as a proxy for our success, especially in the fourth quarter, it can be a little bit challenged, as we've seen obviously, because we posted another strong quarter and apparel growing over 20%. So I just want to start that answer with just -- let's be careful on some of those data sets that's out there and understand how they relate to our business in particular."

And I think it's important, just to put in context -- so let me just take a couple of minutes and address your questions. So let me begin with footwear, then I'll do North America and then I'll close with women's. So I think the best place for us to start is about growth. It goes without saying, is that any of these questions come down to what does our growth look like. And in the fourth quarter with 31% growth and exactly marking our 23rd consecutive quarter of 20-plus percent top line revenue growth. Our gross story is strong. We remain a growth company and none of that is wavered. But I also want to give you some context, beginning with footwear, about just how our business has changed since really just 2012 and evolving into a true footwear brand. Remember, 10 years ago, when we celebrated -- or we went public, we haven't even launched our first shoe until we launched football cleats in June of 2006. So we've come a long way from there. So beginning with footwear, just going back to 2012, was 13% of our business. And since then, we've added, I don't know, a couple billion dollars of revenue. And today, footwear is nearly 17% of our business, representing a 42% CAGR over the last just few years. The diversity -- again back in 2012, our mix of product was -- 33% of our footwear in 2012 was cleats. Cleats today are down to 22% with plans of being the #1 shoe in the market in football, and I'll get back to that in just a second. In my prepared remarks, I mentioned us doubling our running styles over $100. And I just want to make for context, and I also talked about increasing over 1,000%, across all of our footwear, we've more than tripled our footwear styles priced over $100 while quadrupling the volume, like footwear for us couldn't be more and better positioned to be truly a premium footwear brand. And the best way for me to articulate that, let me just start about basketball for a second. First of all, we have the right athlete in Stephen Curry, and he is, without question, the #1 basketball player on the planet today. We've got the right product that's led by the Curry Two. And to be clear, we launched the Curry One just a year ago at a $120 price point. We then came back on a tour that we did with Stephen in the fall in September, and we launched the Curry Two at a $130 price point. And we've learned a tremendous amount over the last year of what we can do and primarily what we can do in signature basketball product and feel incredibly bullish about our ability to continue to raise ASPs going forward. In Youth, we've heightened our focus to capture the next athlete, driving nearly 50% CAGR just since 2012 in Youth footwear. And again, building out these departments, building out the teams has never been more important. And speaking of teams, we more than doubled the size of our footwear team to nearly 230 people, including the recent addition of a dedicated women's team. And I want to be clear, we didn't have a dedicated women's team in 2012, let alone 18 months ago. So we are certainly not done. We continue to build that team out and growing our presence in Portland with our new headquarters that will be opening [indiscernible]. So these investments in our team, they all mean that these trends are expected to accelerate in 2016. And again, that's all for [ph] a whopping 95% in the quarter and 57% for the full year. So some of the ways we expect to leverage that success: First, expanding Curry throughout the upcoming All-Star Game, the Playoffs, hopefully the Finals and then the Olympics later this fall. And then ultimately, we're elevating them further when we launch the Curry Three later this year. We're also this year going to be entering the golf category, with the most exciting player on the planet as well as the #1 player in the world in Jordan Spieth, where we have a new line of footwear that will be debuting around the Masters. In addition, we're going to be doubling our running styles priced over $100, led by Slingshot and Slingride, the knit offerings that we have. In 2012, we had just 1. Today, we have more than 8 over $100. We're also be doing things like debuting our first smart shoe, the SpeedForm Gemini 2 RE, which means Record Equipped, and that's going to be at a $150 price point, a $20 premium to the standard $130 Gemini price point. And as I mentioned a little bit earlier and back to our roots, the success of Cam Newton, who will be playing next week in the Super Bowl, wearing the Highlight Cleat, that depending on where you look, is the #1 selling cleat in America at the highest price point, continue to drive us toward becoming the #1 American football cleat in the market and again, a goal thought to be impossible back in 2006. So I will say, it's a small category. It's domestic only. Our brand, our presence, our ability to drive ASPs have never been stronger in North America. And I believe that footwear is the best example we have of how we are truly just getting started. So let me take a second, just talk about North America. I want to level set the context of how our distribution is aligned. So often, we're compared to our competition. Well, our largest competitor in North America has approximately 24,000 points of distribution just in North America. At Under Armour, we have 11,000 and we have the ability to expand that, but we haven't. We stayed committed to our sporting goods, to our mall, to our department stores channel. And again, this doesn't make going anywhere else impossible for us, but it certainly makes it an opportunity, particularly as we add things like the new merchandising team, which just joined and frankly, we're just -- input in Under Armour through 2015. To be clear, prior to 2015, we did not have a merchandising team. So our structure is changed and frankly, it's evolved. And we talk about North American growth. In the third quarter, in North America, we grew 25%. In the fourth quarter, in North America, we grew 26%. I don't know if I'd call that accelerating, but I'd certainly call it strong. So the way this is happening, one simple word, one simple phrase. When we innovate, we win, bringing new technologies and styles in 2016. I mentioned in my prepared remarks things like CoolSwitch and Microthread and cooling. In the heating side, we have products like Reactor, a new price point that -- at around $200 that complements our current -- the more current styles that we have. And also new product items like the swacket, which -- it will elevate our fleece assortment. You'll start to see us move away from things like the Big Logo hoodie that's been very important to us. But again, you continue to see us learn, and you'll continue to see us evolved to not just where the market's heading, but most importantly, where we're taking the market to. As you think about North America, footwear is such an extraordinary opportunity for us, from the signature Curry product to running to kids. We had more styles at higher price points than ever before in 2015, and that will absolutely be the case in 2016. We've also become the #1 brand in many places, most recently where we took that title was at Sport Chek in Canada. So across apparel, footwear and accessories, we are the #1 vendor for Sport Chek, a very important sporting goods account. And we're closing on that and the majority in many of our other distribution. So premium story telling. This is not just lip service that we are committed to our existing distribution, our existing base. And so whether it's storytelling and the way we show up at retail and places like The ARMOURY with our partners at Champs, with the blue-chip shops that we're building at DICK'S Sporting Goods, we're going to make continue to make investments in premium brand statements with our partners. And the way we can do this is that very well, the first handshake that we have with that consumer will more than likely be a digital handshake because across the Connected Fitness platform that we've implemented over the last 2.5 years, we now have more than 90 million domestic athletes amplifying our message and driving access to the brand. And finally, Direct-to-Consumer. Unfortunately, this is an area that the market doesn't have purview to until we ever tell you our numbers. It's the place though that we typically have the ability to tell our pinnacle brand stories. Beginning with E-Commerce, meeting the consumer where they want to be met, capitalizing on investments that we've made to leverage things like mobile trends, which now is 50% of our fourth quarter traffic. And in terms of retail, we added 5 new Brand House stores in 2015. Again, I want to emphasize, we are a wholesale manufacturer, but we do have this Direct-to-Consumer component that gives us I think a great complement to again meet the consumer where they want. Adding 5 new Brand House stores in 2015 with roughly 5 to as many as 8 planned in 2016, including -- looking back at the year, we launched our 30,000 square-foot flagship on The Magnificent Mile in Chicago that really, I think, is one of the best examples of our brand [ph] we've ever opened anywhere in the world. So to be clear about North America, we still see abundant opportunities across the continent. And as we said at our Investor Day in September, we believe that we will double this business by 2018. And we say all of this, recognizing and acknowledging, yes, we, of course, have places we can be better. We are certainly not perfect, but we are learning every day and we are putting a team in to make that happen. And so we say all of this is about our confidence, incredibly humbly as well is that we have work to be done. So finally, let me just address women's. This business, I want to be clear, is incredibly important to our account and it's important to us. And while we believe we have huge opportunity to get better, we delivered yet another quarter of double-digit growth in women's, now approaching $0.75 billion in revenue. So 2014 was a year that we defined and we described as the year of the woman. We ignited his conversation on the marketing side with the female consumer that's really taking the brand to a new level of engagement and expectation. And we did that through people, through personalities, personalities like Misty and Gisele. But we also recognize that our products has get to meet that expectation. But what we learned is that she likes this and she wants to have a relationship with the Under Armour brand. And so you've seen our product evolve. And just as importantly, in 2015, for us, you watched our team evolve as we've been investing in our foundation, as we've been investing in our team, and not just any one individual, but throughout our product duration engine, our merchandising teams and our new category at management with our new leader in Pam Catlett, who will be heading up of our women's management, who brings over 20 years experience in the business. This will all better enable us to create and deliver a 365-day year experience for her. 2016 is about execution in both apparel and footwear. And to be clear, we didn't even have a women's footwear team just a little more than a year ago, so building out these resources for us to really capitalize on the opportunity, where she, just like the men, want to dress toe to head. So we expect to see improved merchandise assortments across our premium distribution and we also expect to continue to elevate our brand where women want us, in places like E-Commerce. And to be clear, on E-Commerce, women's was our #1 and largest-selling and fastest-growing category that we had, faster than men's and faster than Youth. So when we merchandise correctly, we believe we will win. Listen, we understand that her expectations are incredibly high for us and that's exactly where we want them be. We firmly believe that our women's business should be, as we've said for a very long time, at least as large, if not larger, than our men's business. Thanks, Matt."

Yes, Jim, on the footwear market side, yes, we are definitely seeing [ph] improvements on the footwear margins in general. Obviously, even with those improvements, footwear margins are well below our apparel margins, and we've talked about that consistently over the years. So we do anticipate still a lot of room on the footwear side. A lot of that will come our ability to sell, again, more premium pricing points, specifically in categories like running and basketball, which are historically more -- are higher-margin products. So as that may become bigger part of our portfolio, that will help our margins from a mix perspective. We've put a lot of investment and energy into the sourcing side of our business and development side of our business, in footwear also, so we're seeing some benefit there on the costing side and I think, as Kevin talked about too, the ability to utilize the strength of our brand in these categories too from a pricing perspective. So we do see footwear margins, they have improved from the last few years to today. We see them improving in the next few years also, but again, just on a caution that they will continue to be lower than our overall apparel margins. That being said though, as we also talked about in the past, that you got to keep in mind, from an operating margin perspective, with the higher price points in footwear and higher ASPs in footwear compared to apparel, you do have the ability to leverage SG&A a little bit better. So we do see, in the long run, even though gross margins will improve in footwear, but we'll be below apparel that our operating margins in the longer run should look pretty similar to our apparel business."

That's the way that we'll build it out. So the one thing we've learned, as Malcolm Gladwell says, 10 years or 10,000 hours to perfect something. So I'm not sure that we perfected footwear, but we really feel strong about our position in the game right now. And that begins, of course, I think with the athletes that make it real and that are winning in our footwear out on field, out on pitch, out on court, and whether it's Cam Newton, what hopefully he'll do in football, in the Super Bowl next week, Jordan Spieth in golf or Stephen Curry in basketball. As you talk about international, we have no greater global ambassadors than the ones that we have there today. And as recent as this past week, we also launched Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson that will be sporting Under Armour as his official brand of choice. So what we've built in footwear is impressive. But again, we think we still have room to grow. But some of the franchises that we've built, from Highlight to SpeedForm, to Gemini, to Gemini Record, to the new Curry product, to Slingshot, to Bandit, I mean, we've -- I think we've done a great job of building, as I said, franchise businesses across the sports where we want to win, and that typically begins in running and it begins in basketball. And so we love our positioning there. As I mentioned, 8 product about $100 and again, hitting some of those sweet spots for the right distribution that meets, again, the consumer where they want to be met. So I think we feel very bullish about what we're doing on the international front. And again, some of that evolution too, Jim, has been things like, we'd launch a product in the United States and then it was 6 months or a year later that we'd launch it on a global basis. So the ability to truly -- with Charlie and the team that we have in the international side, of building and launching those things the way we did it, we've done -- I think we've demonstrated our ability to do has really evolved our company. I mean, a great example again is, last year, when I mentioned going on the Curry tour, the purpose of that tour was launching the Curry Two in China, almost 6 weeks ahead of when we launched it here in North America. So I think that truly becoming a global business means not being a North American company that sells things in other markets, but truly being a global business that has a global presence and a global position that sells things at the same time equally. So we're evolving toward that, but we really like our progress and incredibly excited about where we're headed with it."

So it is our focus, it's our largest team here and frankly, it's where we've built our brand as innovators. And so some of the things that I mentioned on the call, Reactor, swacket, CoolSwitch, some of the product that we have in the apparel offerings, all of that continued to support our existing ColdGear business. And we effectively built the $25 price point for HeatGear and the $50 price point for ColdGear, and since then, we've been evolving those. So as we -- look, we are a premium brand. And one of the other things that I mentioned maybe going a little more depth on is just our ability now to have merchandising. And you asked about ASPs and price points. Again, we didn't have a merchandising team in 2014. It was a category that we started building out for ourselves in 2015. And so 2015 for us is about building the team. In 2016, it's about segmenting and playing it out in the market. And what that means is again having the right product at the right place, at the right time. And truly having a team isn't just selling the same styles to everyone on an equal basis, but being specific in differentiating between what we do in the mall versus what to do in the sporting goods, let alone what we do at DICK'S Sporting Goods versus what we do in one of our other accounts. And so we will be incredibly thoughtful about that and the way that we drive. As we look forward into 2017, we really -- to the ability to drive efficiency, of really looking at pricing, really looking at the ability for us to maximize and optimize things like margin, but also, again, making sure that it's with the right product and that it sells through. It's because some of the things that we dealt with this year is bringing product and having our floor set in time for January. And no one can predict things like what happened in this fourth quarter. But I think one of the things we're most proud of is that in spite of what happens with weather, we still have close to 31% top line growth. So we'd love that to see -- continue to translate and drive margin. It's one of our key barometers that we use here in the company. And I think frankly, as Brad will tell you right now, we're doing a good job and more importantly, as the plan going forward, we continue to drive and demonstrate the premium positioning in the marketplace."

If we look at 2015 gross margins going backwards 90 basis points and the large majority of that 70 basis points coming from foreign currency impact, a lot of other things going on with the rest of that 20 basis points. But the fact of the matter is as we had some pretty strong headwinds in 2015 relative to airfreight, as we're looking at servicing our customers during the year and the port disruption earlier in the year, mix, we talked about a lot about during the year, footwear and international working against us from a gross marketing perspective pretty significantly, and we are able to offset a lot of that just through our general increase and improvement in product margins specifically on the apparel side. So as you look forward in 2016 and beyond, you should see continued improvement in places like our footwear product margins, like our apparel product margins. International, even to some degree, as we go forward, should get better as the businesses in countries we do directly, whether it's through our DTC or through wholesale become a larger part of our share versus with some of the distributors that we do today. So I think in all aspects of our business, you will see that improve over time. Mix will definitely work against us because these businesses are still -- footwear and international, still lower-margin businesses. But to your point, our ability to improve those margin is great and our ability to improve margins in apparel is not only possible, but it's happening right now as we speak."

And we've had some warm fourth quarters, some colder fourth quarters and so forth, so -- and our answer is pretty consistent. Over the last fe",350,"Yes, Kate. These questions come up a lot over the last few years on the fourth quarter, specifically on weather. And we've had some warm fourth quarters, some colder fourth quarters and so forth, so -- and our answer is pretty consistent. Over the last few years, there's obviously going to be a little bit of an impact to weather. There's no doubt about that, and it impacts our business, too. And we've said in the last few years, it's probably a couple of percentage points of growth impact relative to weather specifically, one way or the other, whether it's warm or cold. So there's no doubt, in the fourth quarter this year, we had a little bit of that impact, and we talked about the fact of managing our way through that and liquidating some excess inventory and taking care of that also in the front half of next year, specifically in the first quarter. But overall, from a top line perspective, it's really only a couple percentage point of growth one way or the other probably. And that -- and again, if -- when you look at specifically this fourth quarter, that was more of a North America dynamic in places where you'd see it probably impact the most via our North America wholesale apparel business and our Factory House business. But again, with the diversity of our product lines and apparel, with footwear's strong growth, international's strong growth, there's just much more going on in our business that offsets some of those weather impacts, which, again, are probably a couple of percentage points of growth one way or the other. So going forward, I think continuously being careful how we plan Q3 and specifically Q4 in years not being overly optimistic on weather, but being prudent and putting ourselves in a position to be opportunistic if weather behaves for us. I think it's really important. To the same extent that weather doesn't behave, it will impact us a little bit and we can manage our way through that specifically with the strong Factory House channel we have."

I want to wish you all a belated happy new year and wish those in China, an early [Foreign Language].
While this earnings call is a report on our 2015 fourth quarter and the past year as a whole, I want to focus for a moment on the year ahead. This year, 2016, is Under Armour's 20th year in business. It's an incredible milestone for any company, and for us, it means a few things. It means that the next generation entering the workforce doesn't know a world where Under Armour didn't exist.
This generation doesn't recognize us as the underdogs, but as the always was. It means that we are not a passing fad or a flavor of the month. The interlocking UA logo has become a globally recognized symbol for being aggressive, young and fearless. It means we are a brand that resonates with athletes, all athletes, and we will continue to thrive because we remain as humble and hungry as we were 20 years ago with plenty of room left to grow.
And with that, our scoreboard remains strong. We are entering this milestone positioned for success, capping off the past year with yet another solid finish. Total net revenues for the fourth quarter were up 31%, marking our 23rd consecutive quarter of 20-plus percent net revenue growth. And since this call is about our most recent fourth quarter, let me throw out a few more numbers to you that are fourth quarter related. 36%, 34%, 26%, 35% and 31%. Those are the percentages we have grown in each of the previous 5 fourth quarters.
Each year around this time, weather inevitably plays part of the conversation. And each year, we answer those who doubt us with extremely strong growth numbers in the fourth quarter. Was it 72 degrees on the East Coast this past Christmas? It was. Did it affect our business the way some thought it would? No, it did not. Because here in the U.S. where we currently do the majority of our business, we know that football will be played in the fall, basketball will be played in the winter, baseball will be played in the spring and like soccer, personal health and fitness is a year-round all-weather interest. Our business is more diversified than it's ever been. We do not let weather play a decisive role in dictating our success. As we move into 2016, we have become a global brand capable of meeting athletes' need from head to toe.
In the fourth quarter, we posted strong gains across our business, illustrating the broad base strength and demand for our brand, with apparel growing 22%, Direct-to-Consumer growing 25%, International growing 70% and Footwear growing a whopping 95%. While our growth drivers have not changed since we went public more than 10 years ago, these numbers show how diverse our portfolio has become and reinforces the continued success of our largest category, apparel.
Ten years ago, we were a $281 million company, with apparel representing 93% of our revenues and compression representing 64% of the entire business. Today, our apparel business represents 71% of our revenues and compression is less than 10%.
We closed 2015 with more balance and breadth of product across our businesses, men's, women's and Youth driving our apparel business to over $2.8 billion from just $260 million it was a decade ago. In the fourth quarter, apparel growth of 22% showcases that our brand has products for all seasons and temperatures and perhaps more importantly, that today, our athletes have the complete head-to-toe assortment available to them in more channels globally than ever before.
Ten years ago, our Direct-to-Consumer business represented 6% of our net revenues, consisting of a single website and just 4 domestic Factory House stores. Today, our Direct-to-Consumer business represents 30% of net revenues, made up of 25 global websites and nearly 400 Under Armour owned and partner retail doors around the world. It's impossible to not talk about the strength of E-Commerce when we look at our Direct-to-Consumer business. This business continues to be on fire, not only in the United States, but also around the world.
In China, on Singles Day this past November, we had our first million-dollar revenue day online, while in the U.S., mobile has grown to almost 50% of the traffic to our site and represented 23% of E-Commerce revenues in the fourth quarter. Consumers continue to look for us in multiple places, and we will be wherever they are, whether it's on a device or in physical doors.
Globally, we continue to drive both awareness and revenue growth as we expand our retail footprint outside the United States, closing out 2015 with almost 3x as many doors in total from just a year ago. 10 years ago, we just entered Europe and our international business was $6 million, primarily driven by our partners in Japan. Today, international has become almost $0.5 billion business, with our brand being sold in more than 60 countries.
Last week, I visited our Amsterdam office that has served as our European headquarters for the past 10 years, located in the historic Olympic Stadium where the energy and enthusiasm has me more confident in our team and their ability than ever before. In 2015, every region, every category and every channel exceeded our plans for our international business, driving 70% growth in the fourth quarter and 69% growth year-over-year. 2 years ago, our international business was 6% of revenues. Today, it's 11%. And by 2018, as we said at our Investor Day, we expect it to be 18%.
Our brand certainly translates. 10 years ago, we'd not sold a single pair of shoes. Today, footwear represents 17% of our business, closing in on $700 million in revenues. This past quarter, our footwear revenues grew 95%, driven in part by the success of our expanded running line, which will feature 8 different offerings all over the $100 price point compared to the 4 lines offered in the previous year.
Also driving our growth and more importantly, creating an incredible connection with our young consumer, is our Stephen Curry signature basketball shoe line that launched almost a year ago today. The sell-through on the Curry Two was like nothing we've ever seen before, the same words that people tend to say after watching Stephen play live.
We're just beginning to see what partnering with the right athlete like Stephen Curry can do for our business. It's difficult to underestimate the power of having the best sell-through of any signature basketball shoe this past season. It clearly lifted our brand in the mall channel and positioned us for aggressive growth, not only in signature, but overall with this most important consumer base.
Footwear, and to be clear, premium footwear, continues to be an accelerator to our top line and a huge part of our growth story. With our sights set on building $1 billion plus footwear brand, it is becoming a bigger and more important component of our business, and the result will be a more balanced blend of apparel and footwear within UA. Posting a 57% growth in footwear for the full year in 2015 is evidence of our ability to resonate with the consumer and provide them with a breadth of products unmatched in years past.
The strength of our footwear product coming from our expanding team of designers and developers helped us elevate our business above $100 at retail by 1,000% this past year. And we're even more excited and proud of the product that is coming out in 2016.
We're seeing what Stephen has done for our basketball business, what basketball has done for our footwear business and from there, what footwear has done for our brand. This story is being told in our numbers, but it is also being told on the courts, fields and pitches around the world. Show up at any Golden State Warriors game, home or away, it doesn't matter, and you will see the thousands of people who show up early just to see Stephen Curry's warm-up routine. That, as I have described to you before, is the power of sports.
Speaking of our MVPs, we're continuing on last year's theme of UA ambassadors dominating their respective sports. Thanks to our roster of athletes who continue to win on the world's biggest stages. Since the last time we spoke, in baseball, Bryce Harper of the Washington Nationals was named the Major League Baseball MVP in the National League. In tennis, Andy Murray won the Davis Cup for Britain for the first time in 79 years. And in boxing, Canelo Alvarez became the WBC Middleweight Champion of the world with his victory over Miguel Cotto. They joined Stephen, Jordan, Misty and others in our year of champions, solidifying UA as the home for winners.
Now with the Super Bowl just over a week away, we will see yet another UA MVP, Cam Newton, compete at the highest level of his sport while representing our brand. Cam has been a critical driver of our footwear success with the Highlight Cleat, and the Super Bowl will introduce him to a brand-new set of consumers. It is a platform where companies pay $5 million to air a simple 30-second TV spot during the broadcast, while our guy will wear his UA cleats throughout the entire 3-plus hours of the game.
And finally, we ended 2015 with a key personnel announcement. Last month, we announced Brad Dickerson's successor as CFO will be Chip Molloy. Chip comes to us with significant financial executive experience at the consumer retail sector, having served as EVP and CFO for PetSmart from 2007 until 2013, and where in 2011, he was named Institutional Investors CFO of the Year for Specialty Retail. 
Chip is a Maryland native and a graduate of one of our partner schools, the United States Naval Academy. He also graduated from Navy Fighter Weapons School or Top Gun as it is known, where he served for 15 years in the United States Navy. With my new partner in place, Chip will work together with Brad over the next month to ensure a smooth transition.
So that's how we closed 2015. Now let's talk about how we kicked off 2016. We started this year off with a bang at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, unveiling a suite of products that will change the way athletes live. Many of you have heard me talk about Connected Fitness on these calls or at our Investor Day. In the past 3 weeks, we've seen the vision of this platform truly come to life.
First, we announced the launch of UA Record, 1 of our 4 mobile app platforms that collectively are earning more than 130,000 new users a day since just beginning of the year. UA Record is the digital dashboard that displays everything you need to know about your health in 4 quadrants: Sleep, fitness, activity and nutrition. Combined with your body weight and our own cognitive measurement of how do you feel, it collects and displays a complete picture of your health in the easiest, most simple way possible.
Second, we introduced the Under Armour HealthBox, the world's first complete connected fitness system, which consists of a band, a heart rate strap and a smart scale, all in one package. Built in partnership with HTC, these tools work together to capture data pertaining to your health and fitness and again, doing it in the easiest, most simple way possible.
Because music is such an important part of how people exercise, we also partnered with Harman Kardon JBL to launch Bluetooth-enabled wireless headphones, including an updated version to be released later this year that will also read heart rate in lieu of a strap. Finally, we launched our first smart shoe with the Gemini 2 RE, which stands for Record Equipped.
This shoe tracks every step and uploads data, including time, date, duration and distance directly into our platforms. This cutting-edge footwear provides an untethered experience and allows the athlete to run device free. There is no start or stop button. When the shoe is on your feet, it's ready and tracking. And one of the cool features of this shoe is that it tracks its own lifespan and will send a notification when it's time for a new pair.
All of these products feed into UA Record as well as more than 400 different connected devices to create the ultimate open platform destination to measure your health and fitness.
Additionally, we announced our partnership with IBM and their Watson platform to help build the insights capability for Under Armour Record. Wearables have been effective in telling you how many steps you took or the hours you slept, but they haven't been effective in giving you proactive information on how to utilize that data to make your life better. Put simply, there was no call to action until now. IBM's Watson, a platform that executes cognitive thinking, will provide personalized insights in real time to the user based on the information we collect for UA Record and will take the experience and service to a whole new level.
By adding Watson's insights to UA Record, we deliver direction to help you reach your personal goal, whether you want to lose 10 pounds or simply just feel better. This is what differentiates UA Record from the rest of the fitness tracking apps and what gives us confidence to the consumer experience we are building to help change the way athletes live.
Now let me complete the vision for Connected Fitness. Beyond enriching lives, it will propel our business forward. This is not a tech initiative. This is a digital transformation and therefore, a business transformation for Under Armour. Before Connected Fitness, we only had retail transaction information for less than 10 million people -- that stores and E-Commerce combine. Now we have daily activity level data from our community members who log nearly 8 billion foods and 2 billion activities last year alone.
Not only do we have people going into our stores and visiting our E-Commerce sites, but we also have a deeper understanding of our consumer based on information collected using Connected Fitness, including sleep, fitness, activity, nutrition, weight and how do you feel. This gives us an unparalleled view of their life and needs. I referred to it as our math house during our last call, but we're also calling it the single view of the consumer.
All of this is possible because of the near 10-year partnership we have established with SAP. The single view of the consumer is something we're building with the team at SAP that combines global point-of-sale, E-Commerce and transactional information through a single sign-on capability together with our Connected Fitness business to create an insight engine that will inform and guide our decision to help grow and scale our brand. This will build on our existing SAP platform as we double down and continue to make big bets with big partners. We believe that this unique technological advancement will position UA as a best-in-class real-time digital enterprise.
At Under Armour, we focus on creating products you don't know you need yet. But once you have it, you won't remember how you lived without it, just like our very first T-shirt. Some great examples of this are the types of innovation we'll bring to the market that will further elevate and diversify our product and continue to distinguish Under Armour.
For example, this year, we will launch Microthread, a new cooling technology comprised of elastomeric thread that dries 30% faster and is 70% more breathable than similar lycra construction. Then on the heating side, there's Reactor, an insulation that combines warmth and breathability to keep you comfortable without overheating. This is in addition to many other new innovations like CoolSwitch, and on the footwear side, Slingshot. New innovations like the ones I just mentioned bring new opportunities for growth, which lead to revenue-driving platforms.
Our goal is that these new innovations will develop as strongly as some of our key revenue-driving platforms from prior years like ColdGear Infrared and Armour in apparel and the signature Curry line in footwear. Our relentless pursuit of innovation is just that, relentless. It never stops.
When I first began Under Armour 20 years ago, I didn't set out to make just another T-shirt. I set out to make a better T-shirt, one that solves a problem and gives whoever wears it an advantage. With our Connected Fitness business, we're not releasing just another fitness app or tracking device. We're building a complete ecosystem to manage your health and fitness with actionable insights to make you better. Finding a better way has been a running theme for us over the past 20 years, whether it's through the products we offer or the way we operate our business. And we'll keep finding a better way for another 20 years because we are just getting started.
So now I'd like to introduce Chip Molloy before Brad takes us through the numbers. Chip?"

I would now like to spend some time reviewing our fourth quarter and full year 2015 financial results, followed by our updated outlook for 2016.Our net revenues for the fourth quarter of 2015 increased 31% to $1.17 billion. On a",2115,"Thanks, Kevin and Chip. I would now like to spend some time reviewing our fourth quarter and full year 2015 financial results, followed by our updated outlook for 2016.
Our net revenues for the fourth quarter of 2015 increased 31% to $1.17 billion. On a currency-neutral basis, fourth quarter net revenues increased 33%. For the full year, net revenues increased 28% to $3.96 billion, which compared to our most recent full year guidance of $3.91 billion. On a currency-neutral basis, full year net revenues increased 31%.
Focusing on the fourth quarter, we grew apparel net revenues 22% to $865 million compared to $708 million in the prior year's quarter. With our efforts to build a more diversified business, we posted impressive growth across channels and categories despite well-documented weather challenges. Our focus on brand -- on building brand equity around the globe through elevated product and experiences was evident in the strong growth of international and Direct-to-Consumer in the quarter. We also saw success around our continued expansion in key product categories like training, running, golf, team sports and basketball.
Fourth quarter footwear net revenues increased 95% to $167 million from $86 million in the prior year. Broad-based footwear strength has been the consistent theme in 2015 though the exceptional performance of our Curry Two signature basketball line was clearly a fourth quarter standout. Our accessories net revenues during the fourth quarter increased 23% to $97 million from $79 million last year, primarily driven by continued strong demand for our line of bags.
Our global Direct-to-Consumer net revenues increased 25% for the quarter, representing approximately 36% of net revenues. In global retail, we ended the fourth quarter with 191 owned stores, including 161 Factory House stores and 30 Brand House stores. With our retail business still heavily weighted to North America Factory House stores, we did experience some of the similar weather-related challenges as our overall apparel business. However, our strong E-Commerce business continues to diversify how we reach global consumers. And we continue to capitalize on our investments in mobile and international, where we more than doubled our in-country websites during 2015.
Looking at our regions, North America net revenues increased 26% to $1.02 billion in the fourth quarter compared to $808 million in the prior year's quarter. On a currency-neutral basis, North America net revenues increased 27%, accelerating from the growth rate posted last quarter despite the warm weather backdrop. This strength demonstrates the diversity of our product mix, including accelerated footwear growth and consistent apparel performance as well as channel mix between our wholesale partners and our Direct-to-Consumer businesses.
International net revenues increased 70% to $139 million in the fourth quarter and represented 12% of total net revenues. On a currency-neutral basis, international net revenues increased 85% for the period.
In the EMEA region, our heightened focus on the U.K. and Germany continues to drive momentum in these 2 core markets. While growth remains strong across all channels, our E-Commerce strategy, including 9 new in-country sites launched in 2015, is playing a key role in broadening our reach and awareness in the region.
In Asia Pacific, we continue to see tremendous demand for the brand, driving triple-digit growth across Greater China and our Southeast Asia distributor, led by the success and expansion of our Brand House stores. And in Latin America, we are building momentum with many of our recent country expansions like Chile, more than offsetting the well-documented macro challenges in Brazil.
Moving on to margins. Fourth quarter gross margins contracted 190 basis points to 48% compared to 49.9% in the prior year's period. The following factors were the primary drivers during the quarter. First, sales mix negatively impacted gross margin by approximately 90 basis points in the fourth quarter versus the prior year, primarily driven by the continued strong performance of our footwear business. Second, the continued strength of the U.S. dollar negatively impacted gross margin by approximately 80 basis points versus the prior year. Third, higher inventory liquidations negatively impacted gross margin by approximately 30 basis points.
Before I move on with other elements of the quarter, I wanted to provide a quick snapshot of our gross margin performance for the full year. Our full year rate in 2015 declined 90 basis points to 48.1% compared to 49% in the prior year's period. Of this 90 basis point decline, 70 basis points resulted from the continued strength of the U.S. dollar.
While we also face additional gross margin headwinds from adverse sales mix impact given the strong growth of our international and footwear businesses, higher inventory liquidation specifically in the fourth quarter and higher freight expenses from port disruptions and efforts to better service our business, we were able to offset most of the noncurrency-related pressure through more favorable product margins in both our North America and international businesses.
Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues leveraged 80 basis points to 32.8% in the fourth quarter of 2015 from 33.6% in the prior year's period. SG&A details for the fourth quarter are as follows. Marketing costs decreased to 7.9% of net revenues for the quarter from 8.4% in the prior year period, primarily reflecting the timing of our global marketing campaigns. Other SG&A costs decreased to 24.9% of net revenues for the quarter from 25.2% in the prior year, driven primarily by lower incentive compensation expense.
Operating income for the fourth quarter increased 21% to $178 million compared with $146 million in the prior year period. For the full year, operating income increased 15% to $409 million compared to our most recent guidance of $408 million. The 2 Connected Fitness acquisitions we made in 2015 negatively impacted full year operating income by approximately $23 million.
Interest and other expense in the fourth quarter increased to $6 million compared with $4 million in the prior year period, primarily reflecting increased interest expense associated with the financing of our Connected Fitness acquisitions.
Our fourth quarter tax rate of 38.4% was consistent with the prior year. Our fourth quarter net income increased 21% to $106 million compared to $88 million in the prior year period, while our diluted earnings per share increased to $0.48 from $0.40 in the prior year's period.
Full year diluted earnings per share increased 11% to $1.05 compared to $0.95 in 2014. The $1.05 earnings per share in 2015 is inclusive of a $0.10 impact from the 2 Connected Fitness acquisitions we made in 2015.
On the balance sheet, total cash and cash equivalents for the quarter decreased to $130 million compared with $593 million at December 31, 2014. Accounts receivable increased 55% to $434 million compared with $280 million at December 31, 2014, primarily related to the timing of shipments within the quarter.
Inventory for the quarter increased 46% to $783 million compared to $537 million at December 31, 2014. Back at our Investor Day in September and again, on our third quarter earnings call, we discussed elevated inventory growth from the 36% rate posted in the third quarter. This growth is largely a result of our strategy to focus on delivering our products to our consumers in a more timely manner and thus drive higher fill rates. This strategy includes flowing product to our customers earlier to meet key seasonal floor set dates as well as strategic investments in auto-replenishment products.
While these efforts are driving much of the elevated inventory growth rates in the near term, they are also delivering meaningful improvements in our service levels year-over-year in support of our revenue growth. In addition, the recent weather trends have led to some excess inventory creation, which we will continue to work through across our normal liquidation channels during the first half of 2016.
Total debt increased to $669 million as compared to $284 million at December 31, 2014, primarily reflecting the financing of our 2 Connected Fitness acquisitions.
Looking at our cash flows, our investment and capital expenditures was $85 million for the fourth quarter compared to $59 million in the prior year's period, driven primarily by our investments on our global headquarters in Baltimore and our SAP platform. Full year capital expenditures were $325 million compared to our prior guidance range of $350 million to $360 million, primarily due to timing of our investments.
Now moving on to 2016. Based on our current visibility, we expect 2016 net revenues of approximately $4.95 billion, representing growth of 25%, and 2016 operating income of approximately $503 million, representing growth of 23%. These growth rates remain in line with the long-term growth rates laid out at our Investor Day last September and are also consistent with our previous guidance on our third quarter earnings call.
Below the operating line, we expect interest expense to increase to approximately $35 million in 2016 as we expect to increased debt levels to support our business and look for opportunities to refinance our debt with more long-term financing. In addition, we expect the full year tax rate of approximately 38.5% and fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 223 million.
Now I'd like to provide more color on our expected results for 2016. First, with net revenues, we currently anticipate the growth rate for the first half of the year to be above our expected full year growth rate. Specifically looking at the first quarter, we expect the growth rate to be in the high 20s, led by many of the same factors from our fourth quarter, including strength in footwear and international, higher planned inventory liquidations and strategies to better service our customers year-over-year. As is typical at this point in the year, as we gain better visibility on orders, specifically for the fourth quarter, we provide updates on our progress on future calls.
Next, on gross margin, we expect a relatively consistent year-over-year rate in 2016 as compared to 2015. For the first quarter of 2016, we anticipate similar year-over-year dynamics as our just completed fourth quarter results, including higher liquidations to clear through excess inventory, along with continued currency headwinds. Thus, we expect our largest gross margin headwind for the year during the first quarter. We are planning an approximate 150 basis point decline year-over-year.
Shifting to SG&A. We expect to deleverage expenses in 2016 as our focus remains on making the right investments to drive our long-term global success. Looking at the marketing portion of SG&A, we expect to continue to invest across our sports marketing assets, global brand campaigns and retail marketing.
In other SG&A, we are focused on key brand-enhancing initiatives that we outlined at our Investor Day such as Connected Fitness and global retail as well as strategic investments -- strategic business areas, including category management and innovation. With a higher top line growth rate currently expected in the front half of the year, we expect modest overall SG&A leverage in the front half of the year and modest deleverage in the second half of the year.
Looking at capital expenditures in 2016. We are currently planning to invest at the midpoint of our 8% to 10% of net revenues target range outlined at our Investor Day. Our investments include our global headquarters as well as our expanding SAP platform that will serve as the architecture for our future growth while also driving our insights engine to power our single view of the consumer that Kevin spoke about.
Finally, inventory. As we previously stated, our focus is on delivering our products to our consumers in a more timely manner and improving our customer service levels. As a result, we continue to expect inventory growth rates to be slightly elevated above revenue growth rate in the front half of 2016, with growth rates expected to level off and be in line with revenue growth in the back half of 2016.
Before we turn it over to Q&A, I wanted to take just a moment to express my thanks to Kevin and the team. It has been a real privilege and honor over the last 11-plus years to work for Kevin and this great brand and have been part of such a strong leadership team, an amazing group of teammates that now tops more than 12,000.
In addition, today marks the 37th UA earnings call I have participated in. And I would like to thank the analysts and investors on the call today, many of whom I spent time with over the years telling the Under Armour story. I'm excited to pass the CFO reins to Chip, a proven leader. And I am confident that Chip and the talented team supporting him will continue the strong growth for this great brand.

I think one of the things that's important, there's a lot of noise this time of year with the weather and so forth in the fourth quarter. And I think it was important, especially in Kevin's prepared remarks, around the track record we've had with 23 straight quarters above 20% growth and then even in the fourth quarter, in the last 6 years, a CAGR in the fourth quarter of about 32% growth and then planning our business in 2016 at 25%. There's a lot of growth in multitude of places. And I think there's -- we've talked about this in the past too. I think there's a little bit of a danger in looking at some of the data sets that are out there, specifically a data set like SportScan. And it can be challenging looking at our business relative to something like SportScan where that data is only -- is capturing actually less than 40% of our business, specifically in the fourth quarter. It's missing key data inputs like our Direct-to-Consumer business, our international business, and it's actually extrapolating some of our key accounts that are pretty large like the Dick's and the Foot Locker. And it obviously also includes accounts that we do not service. So utilizing that data as a proxy for our success, especially in the fourth quarter, it can be a little bit challenged, as we've seen obviously, because we posted another strong quarter in our apparel growing over 20%. So I just want to start that answer with just -- let's be careful on some of those data sets that's out there and understand how they relate to our business in particular."
8740684,321577444,922746,"Under Armour, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2016",2016-01-28,"Earnings Calls","Under Armour, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Brad.

And I think it's important, just to put in context -- so let me just take a couple of minutes and address your questions. So let me begin with footwear, then I'll do North America and then I'll close with women's. So I think the best place for us to start is about growth. It goes without saying, is that any of these questions come down to what does our growth look like. And in the fourth quarter with 31% growth and exactly [ph] marking our 23rd consecutive quarter of 20-plus percent top line revenue growth. Our growth story is strong. We remain a growth company and none of that is wavered. But I also want to give you some context, beginning with footwear, about just how our business has changed since really just 2012 and evolving into a true footwear brand. Remember, 10 years ago, when we celebrated -- or we went public, we hadn't even launched our first shoe until we launched football cleats in June 2006. So we've come a long way from there. So beginning with footwear, just going back to 2012, was 13% of our business. And since then, we've added, I don't know, over a couple billion dollars of revenue. And today, footwear is nearly 17% of our business, representing a 42% CAGR over the last just few years. The diversity -- again back in 2012, our mix of product was -- 33% of our footwear in 2012 was cleats. Cleats today are down to 22% with plans of being the #1 shoe in the market in football, and I'll get back to that in just a second. In my prepared remarks, I mentioned us doubling our running styles over $100. And I just want to make for context, and I also talked about increasing over 1,000%, across all of our footwear, we've more than tripled our footwear styles priced over $100 while quadrupling the volume, like footwear for us couldn't be more and better positioned to be truly a premium footwear brand. And the best way for me to articulate that, let me just talk about basketball for a second. First of all, we have the right athlete in Stephen Curry, and he is, without question, the #1 basketball player on the planet today. We've got the right product that's led by the Curry Two. And to be clear, we launched the Curry One just a year ago at a $120 price point. We then came back on a tour that we did with Stephen in the fall in September, and we launched the Curry Two at a $130 price point. And we've learned a tremendous amount over the last year of what we can do and primarily what we can do in signature basketball product and feel incredibly bullish about our ability to continue to raise ASPs going forward. In Youth, we've heightened our focus to capture the next athlete, driving nearly 50% CAGR just since 2012 in Youth footwear. And again, building out these departments, building out the teams has never been more important. And speaking of teams, we more than doubled the size of our footwear team to nearly 230 people, including the recent addition of a dedicated women's team. And I want to be clear, we didn't have a dedicated women's team in 2012, let alone 18 months ago. So we are certainly not done. We continue to build that team out and growing our presence in Portland with our new headquarters that will be opening [indiscernible]. So these investments in our team, they all mean that these trends are expected to accelerate in 2016. And again, that's off a whopping 95% in the quarter and 57% for the full year. So some of the ways we expect to leverage that success: First, expanding Curry throughout the upcoming All-Star Game, the Playoffs, hopefully the Finals and then the Olympics later this fall. And then ultimately, we're elevating them further when we launch the Curry Three later this year. We're also this year going to be entering the golf category, with the most exciting player on the planet as well as the #1 player in the world in Jordan Spieth, where we have a new line of footwear that will be debuting around the Masters. In addition, we're going to be doubling our running styles priced over $100, led by Slingshot and Slingride, the knit offerings that we have. In 2012, we had just 1. Today, we have more than 8 over $100. We're also going to be doing things like debuting our first smart shoe, the SpeedForm Gemini 2 RE, which means Record Equipped, and that's going to be at a $150 price point, a $20 premium to the standard $130 Gemini price point. And as I mentioned a little bit earlier and back to our roots, the success of Cam Newton, who will be playing next week in the Super Bowl, wearing the Highlight Cleat, that depending on where you look, is the #1 selling cleat in America at the highest price point, continuing to drive us toward becoming the #1 American football cleat in the market and again, a goal thought to be impossible back in 2006. So I want to say, it's a small category. It's domestic only. Our brand, our presence, our ability to drive ASPs have never been stronger in North America. And I believe that footwear is the best example we have of how we are truly just getting started. So let me take a second, just talk about North America. I want to level set the context of how our distribution is aligned. So often, we're compared to our competition. Well, our largest competitor in North America has approximately 24,000 points of distribution just in North America. At Under Armour, we have 11,000 and we have the ability to expand that, but we haven't. We stayed committed to our sporting goods, to our mall, to our department stores channel. And again, this doesn't make going anywhere else impossible for us, but it certainly makes it an opportunity, particularly as we add things like the new merchandising team, which just joined and frankly, were just input in Under Armour through 2015. To be clear, prior to 2015, we did not have a merchandising team. So our structure is changed and frankly, it's evolved. And we talk about North American growth. In the third quarter, in North America, we grew 25%. In the fourth quarter, in North America, we grew 26%. I don't know if I'd call that accelerating, but I'd certainly call it strong. So the way this is happening, one simple word, one simple phrase. When we innovate, we win, bringing new technologies and styles in 2016. I mentioned in my prepared remarks things like CoolSwitch and Microthread and cooling. In the heating side, we have products like Reactor, a new price point that -- at around $200 that complements our current -- the more current styles that we have. And also new product items like the swackett, which will elevate our fleece assortment. You'll start to see us move away from things like the Big Logo hoodie that's been very important to us. But again, you continue to see us learn, and you'll continue to see us evolve to not just where the market's heading, but most importantly, where we're taking the market to. As you think about North America, footwear is such an extraordinary opportunity for us, from the signature Curry product to running to kids. We had more styles at higher price points than ever before in 2015, and that will absolutely be the case in 2016. We've also become the #1 brand in many places; most recently where we took that title was at Sport Chek in Canada. So across apparel, footwear and accessories, we are the #1 vendor for Sport Chek, a very important sporting goods account. And we're closing on that in the majority in many of our other distribution. So premium story telling. This is not just lip service that we are committed to our existing distribution, our existing base. And so whether it's storytelling and the way we show up at retail in places like The ARMOURY with our partners at Champs, with the blue-chip shops that we're building at DICK'S Sporting Goods, we're going to make continue to make investments in premium brand statements with our partners. And the way we can do this is that very well, the first handshake that we have with that consumer will more than likely be a digital handshake because across the Connected Fitness platform that we've implemented over the last 2.5 years, we now have more than 90 million domestic athletes amplifying our message and driving access to the brand. And finally, Direct-to-Consumer. Unfortunately, this is an area that the market doesn't have purview to until we ever tell you our numbers. It's the place though that we typically have the ability to tell our pinnacle brand stories. Beginning with E-Commerce, meeting the consumer where they want to be met, capitalizing on investments that we've made to leverage things like mobile trends, which now is 50% of our fourth quarter traffic. And in terms of retail, we added 5 new Brand House stores in 2015. Again, I want to emphasize, we are a wholesale manufacturer, but we do have this Direct-to-Consumer component that gives us I think a great complement to again meet the consumer where they want us. Adding 5 new Brand House stores in 2015 with roughly 5 to as many as 8 planned in 2016, including -- looking back at the year, we launched our 30,000 square-foot flagship on The Magnificent Mile in Chicago that really, I think, is one of the best examples of our brand [ph] we've ever opened anywhere in the world. So to be clear about North America, we still see abundant opportunities across the continent. And as we said at our Investor Day in September, we believe that we will double this business by 2018. And we say all of this, recognizing and acknowledging, yes, we, of course, have places we can be better. We are certainly not perfect, but we are learning every day and we are putting a team in to make that happen. And so we say all of this about our confidence, incredibly humbly as well, is that we have work to be done. So finally, let me just address women's. This business, I want to be clear, is incredibly important to our account and it's important to us. And while we believe we have huge opportunity to get better, we delivered yet another quarter of double-digit growth in women's, now approaching $0.75 billion in revenue. So 2014 was a year that we defined and we described as the year of the woman. We ignited this conversation on the marketing side with the female consumer that's really taking the brand to a new level of engagement and expectation. And we did that through people, through personalities, personalities like Misty and Gisele. But we also recognize that our products has got to meet that expectation. But what we learned is that she likes this and she wants to have a relationship with the Under Armour brand. And so you've seen our product evolve. And just as importantly, in 2015, for us, you watched our team evolve as we've been investing in our foundation, as we've been investing in our team, and not just any one individual, but throughout our product creation engine, our merchandising teams and our new category in management with our new leader in Pam Catlett, who will be heading up our women's management, who brings over 20 years’ experience in the business. This will all better enable us to create and deliver a 365-day-a-year experience for her. 2016 is about execution in both apparel and footwear. And to be clear, we didn't even have a women's footwear team just a little more than a year ago, so building out these resources for us to really capitalize on the opportunity, where she, just like the men, want to dress toe to head. So we expect to see improved merchandise assortments across our premium distribution and we also expect to continue to elevate our brand where women want us, in places like E-Commerce. And to be clear, on E-Commerce, women's was our #1 and largest-selling and fastest-growing category that we had, faster than men's and faster than Youth. So when we merchandise correctly, we believe we will win. Listen, we understand that her expectations are incredibly high for us and that's exactly where we want them be. We firmly believe that our women's business should be, as we've said for a very long time, at least as large, if not larger, than our men's business. Thanks, Matt."

Yes, Jim, on the footwear market side, yes, we are definitely seeing [ph] improvements on the footwear margins in general. Obviously, even with those improvements, footwear margins are well below our apparel margins, and we've talked about that consistently over the years. So we do anticipate still a lot of room on the footwear side. A lot of that will come from our ability to sell, again, more premium pricing points, specifically in categories like running and basketball, which are historically more -- are higher-margin products. So as that may become a bigger part of our portfolio, that will help our margins from a mix perspective. We've put a lot of investment and energy into the sourcing side of our business and development side of our business, in footwear also, so we're seeing some benefit there on the costing side and I think, as Kevin talked about too, the ability to utilize the strength of our brand in these categories too from a pricing perspective. So we do see footwear margins, they have improved from the last few years to today. We see them improving in the next few years also, but again, just want to caution that they will continue to be lower than our overall apparel margins. That being said though, as we also talked about in the past, that you got to keep in mind, from an operating margin perspective, with the higher price points in footwear and higher ASPs in footwear compared to apparel, you do have the ability to leverage SG&A a little bit better. So we do see, in the long run, even though gross margins will improve in footwear, but will be below apparel, that our operating margins in the longer run should look pretty similar to our apparel business."

That's the way that we'll build it out. So the one thing we've learned, as Malcolm Gladwell says, 10 years or 10,000 hours to perfect something. So I'm not sure that we perfected footwear, but we really feel strong about our position in the game right now. And that begins, of course, I think with the athletes that make it real and that are winning in our footwear out on field, out on pitch, out on court, and whether it's Cam Newton, what hopefully he'll do in football, in the Super Bowl next week, Jordan Spieth in golf or Stephen Curry in basketball. As you talk about international, we have no greater global ambassadors than the ones that we have there today. And as recent as this past week, we also launched Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson that will be sporting Under Armour as his official brand of choice. So what we've built in footwear is impressive. But again, we think we still have room to grow. But some of the franchises that we've built, from Highlight to SpeedForm, to Gemini, to Gemini Record, to the new Curry product, to Slingshot, to Bandit, I mean, we've -- I think we've done a great job of building, as I said, franchise businesses across the sports where we want to win, and that typically begins in running and it begins in basketball. And so we love our positioning there. As I mentioned, 8 products about $100 and again, hitting some of those sweet spots for the right distribution that meets, again, the consumer where they want to be met. So I think we feel very bullish about what we're doing on the international front. And again, some of that evolution too, Jim, has been things like, we'd launch a product in the United States and then it was 6 months or a year later that we'd launch it on a global basis. So the ability to truly -- with Charlie and the team that we have in the international side, of building and launching those things the way we did it, we've done -- I think we've demonstrated our ability to do has really evolved our company. I mean, a great example again is, last year, when I mentioned going on the Curry tour, the purpose of that tour was launching the Curry Two in China, almost 6 weeks ahead of when we launched it here in North America. So I think that truly becoming a global business means not being a North American company that sells things in other markets, but truly being a global business that has a global presence and a global position that sells things at the same time equally. So we're evolving toward that, but we really like our progress and incredibly excited about where we're headed with it."

So it is our focus, it's our largest team here and frankly, it's where we've built our brand as innovators. And so some of the things that I mentioned on the call, Reactor, swackett, CoolSwitch, some of the product that we have in the apparel offerings, all of that continued to support our existing ColdGear business. And we effectively built the $25 price point for HeatGear and the $50 price point for ColdGear, and since then, we've been evolving those. So as we -- look, we are a premium brand. And one of the other things that I mentioned maybe going a little more depth on is just our ability now to have merchandising. And you asked about ASPs and price points. Again, we didn't have a merchandising team in 2014. It was a category that we started building out for ourselves in 2015. And so 2015 for us is about building the team. In 2016, it's about segmenting and playing it out in the market. And what that means is again having the right product at the right place, at the right time. And truly having a team isn't just selling the same styles to everyone on an equal basis, but being specific in differentiating between what we do in the mall versus what to do in the sporting goods, let alone what we do at DICK'S Sporting Goods versus what we do in one of our other accounts. And so we will be incredibly thoughtful about that in the way that we drive. As we look forward into 2017, we really -- to the ability to drive efficiency, of really looking at pricing, really looking at the ability for us to maximize and optimize things like margin, but also, again, making sure that it's with the right product and that it sells through. It's because some of the things that we dealt with this year is bringing product in and having our floor set in time for January. And no one can predict things like what happened in this fourth quarter. But I think one of the things we're most proud of is that in spite of what happens with weather, we still have close to 31% top line growth. So we'd love that to see -- continue to translate and drive margin. It's one of our key barometers that we use here in the company. And I think frankly, as Brad will tell you right now, we're doing a good job and more importantly, as the plan going forward, we continue to drive and demonstrate that premium positioning in the marketplace."

Like in 2015, that was probably really evident relative to my prepared remarks. If we look at 2015 gross margins going backwards 90 basis points and the large majority of that 70 basis points coming from foreign currency impact, a lot of other things going on in the rest of that 20 basis points. But the fact of the matter is we had some pretty strong headwinds in 2015 relative to airfreight, as we're looking at servicing our customers during the year and the port disruption earlier in the year, mix, we talked about a lot about during the year, footwear and international working against us from a gross marketing perspective pretty significantly, and we were able to offset a lot of that just through our general increase improvement in product margins specifically on the apparel side. So as you look forward in 2016 and beyond, you should see continued improvement in places like our footwear product margins, like our apparel product margins. International, even to some degree, as we go forward, should get better as the businesses in countries we do directly, whether it's through our DTC or through wholesale become a larger part of our share versus with some of the distributors that we do today. So I think in all aspects of our business, you will see that improve over time. Mix will definitely work against us because these businesses are still -- footwear and international, still lower-margin businesses. But to your point, our ability to improve those margin is great and our ability to improve margins in apparel is not only possible, but it's happening right now as we speak."

This question's come up a lot over the last few years on the fourth quarter, specifically on weather. We've had some warm fourth quarters, some colder fourth quarters and so forth, so -- and our answer is pretty consistent. Over the last few years, there's obviously going to be a little bit of an impact to weather. There's no doubt about that, and it impacts our business, too. And we've said in the last few years, it's probably a couple percentage points of growth impact relative to weather specifically, one way or the other, whether it's warm or cold. So there's no doubt, in the fourth quarter this year, we had a little bit of that impact, and we talked about the fact of managing our way through that and liquidating some excess inventory and taking care of that also in the front half of next year, specifically in the first quarter. But overall, from a top line perspective, it's really only a couple percentage point of growth one way or the other probably. And that -- and again, if -- when you look at specifically this fourth quarter, that was more of a North America dynamic in places where you'd see it probably impact us the most would be our North America wholesale apparel business and our Factory House business. But again, with the diversity of our product lines and apparel, with footwear's strong growth, international's strong growth, there's just much more going on in our business that offsets some of those weather impacts, which, again, are probably a couple of percentage points of growth one way or the other. So going forward, I think continuously being careful how we plan Q3 and specifically Q4 in years not being overly optimistic on weather, but being prudent and putting ourselves in a position to be opportunistic if weather behaves for us. I think it's really important. To the same extent, if weather doesn't behave, it will impact us a little bit and we can manage our way through that specifically with the strong Factory House channel we have."

I want to wish you all a belated happy new year and wish those in China, an early [Foreign Language].
While this earnings call is a report on our 2015 fourth quarter and the past year as a whole, I want to focus for a moment on the year ahead. This year, 2016, is Under Armour's 20th year in business. It's an incredible milestone for any company, and for us, it means a few things. It means that the next generation entering the workforce doesn't know a world where Under Armour didn't exist.
This generation doesn't recognize us as the underdogs, but as the always was. It means that we are not a passing fad or a flavor of the month. The interlocking UA logo has become a globally recognized symbol for being aggressive, young and fearless. It means we are a brand that resonates with athletes, all athletes, and we will continue to thrive because we remain as humble and hungry as we were 20 years ago with plenty of room left to grow.
And with that, our scoreboard remains strong. We are entering this milestone positioned for success, capping off the past year with yet another solid finish. Total net revenues for the fourth quarter were up 31%, marking our 23rd consecutive quarter of 20-plus percent net revenue growth. And since this call is about our most recent fourth quarter, let me throw out a few more numbers to you that are fourth quarter related. 36%, 34%, 26%, 35% and 31%. Those are the percentages we have grown in each of the previous 5 fourth quarters.
Each year around this time, weather inevitably plays part of the conversation. And each year, we answer those who doubt us with extremely strong growth numbers in the fourth quarter. Was it 72 degrees on the East Coast this past Christmas? It was. Did it affect our business the way some thought it would? No, it did not. Because here in the U.S. where we currently do the majority of our business, we know that football will be played in the fall, basketball will be played in the winter, baseball will be played in the spring and like soccer, personal health and fitness is a year-round all-weather interest. Our business is more diversified than it's ever been. We do not let weather play a decisive role in dictating our success. As we move into 2016, we have become a global brand capable of meeting athletes' need from head to toe.
In the fourth quarter, we posted strong gains across our business, illustrating the broad base strength and demand for our brand, with apparel growing 22%, Direct-to-Consumer growing 25%, International growing 70% and Footwear growing a whopping 95%. While our growth drivers have not changed since we went public more than 10 years ago, these numbers show how diverse our portfolio has become and reinforces the continued success of our largest category, apparel.
Ten years ago, we were a $281 million company, with apparel representing 93% of our revenues and compression representing 64% of the entire business. Today, our apparel business represents 71% of our revenues and compression is less than 10%.
We closed 2015 with more balance and breadth of product across our businesses, men's, women's and Youth driving our apparel business to over $2.8 billion from just $260 million it was a decade ago. In the fourth quarter, apparel growth of 22% showcases that our brand has products for all seasons and temperatures and perhaps more importantly, that today, our athletes have the complete head-to-toe assortment available to them in more channels globally than ever before.
Ten years ago, our Direct-to-Consumer business represented 6% of our net revenues, consisting of a single website and just 4 domestic Factory House stores. Today, our Direct-to-Consumer business represents 30% of net revenues, made up of 25 global websites and nearly 400 Under Armour owned and partner retail doors around the world. It's impossible to not talk about the strength of E-Commerce when we look at our Direct-to-Consumer business. This business continues to be on fire, not only in the United States, but also around the world.
In China, on Singles Day this past November, we had our first million-dollar revenue day online, while in the U.S., mobile has grown to almost 50% of the traffic to our site and represented 23% of E-Commerce revenues in the fourth quarter. Consumers continue to look for us in multiple places, and we will be wherever they are, whether it's on a device or in physical doors.
Globally, we continue to drive both awareness and revenue growth as we expand our retail footprint outside the United States, closing out 2015 with almost 3x as many doors in total from just a year ago. 10 years ago, we just entered Europe and our international business was $6 million, primarily driven by our partners in Japan. Today, international has become almost $0.5 billion business, with our brand being sold in more than 60 countries.
Last week, I visited our Amsterdam office that has served as our European headquarters for the past 10 years, located in the historic Olympic Stadium where the energy and enthusiasm has me more confident in our team and their ability than ever before. In 2015, every region, every category and every channel exceeded our plans for our international business, driving 70% growth in the fourth quarter and 69% growth year-over-year. 2 years ago, our international business was 6% of revenues. Today, it's 11%. And by 2018, as we said at our Investor Day, we expect it to be 18%.
Our brand certainly translates. 10 years ago, we'd not sold a single pair of shoes. Today, footwear represents 17% of our business, closing in on $700 million in revenues. This past quarter, our footwear revenues grew 95%, driven in part by the success of our expanded running line, which will feature 8 different offerings all over the $100 price point compared to the 4 lines offered in the previous year.
Also driving our growth and more importantly, creating an incredible connection with our young consumer, is our Stephen Curry signature basketball shoe line that launched almost a year ago today. The sell-through on the Curry Two was like nothing we've ever seen before, the same words that people tend to say after watching Stephen play live.
We're just beginning to see what partnering with the right athlete like Stephen Curry can do for our business. It's difficult to underestimate the power of having the best sell-through of any signature basketball shoe this past season. It clearly lifted our brand in the mall channel and positioned us for aggressive growth, not only in signature, but overall with this most important consumer base.
Footwear, and to be clear, premium footwear, continues to be an accelerator to our top line and a huge part of our growth story. With our sights set on building $1 billion plus footwear brand, it is becoming a bigger and more important component of our business, and the result will be a more balanced blend of apparel and footwear within UA. Posting a 57% growth in footwear for the full year in 2015 is evidence of our ability to resonate with the consumer and provide them with a breadth of products unmatched in years past.
The strength of our footwear product coming from our expanding team of designers and developers helped us elevate our business above $100 at retail by 1,000% this past year. And we're even more excited and proud of the product that is coming out in 2016.
We're seeing what Stephen has done for our basketball business, what basketball has done for our footwear business and from there, what footwear has done for our brand. This story is being told in our numbers, but it is also being told on the courts, fields and pitches around the world. Show up at any Golden State Warriors game, home or away, it doesn't matter, and you will see the thousands of people who show up early just to see Stephen Curry's warm-up routine. That, as I have described to you before, is the power of sports.
Speaking of our MVPs, we're continuing on last year's theme of UA ambassadors dominating their respective sports. Thanks to our roster of athletes who continue to win on the world's biggest stages. Since the last time we spoke, in baseball, Bryce Harper of the Washington Nationals was named the Major League Baseball MVP in the National League. In tennis, Andy Murray won the Davis Cup for Britain for the first time in 79 years. And in boxing, Canelo Alvarez became the WBC Middleweight Champion of the world with his victory over Miguel Cotto. They joined Stephen, Jordan, Misty and others in our year of champions, solidifying UA as the home for winners.
Now with the Super Bowl just over a week away, we will see yet another UA MVP, Cam Newton, compete at the highest level of his sport while representing our brand. Cam has been a critical driver of our footwear success with the Highlight Cleat, and the Super Bowl will introduce him to a brand-new set of consumers. It is a platform where companies pay $5 million to air a simple 30-second TV spot during the broadcast, while our guy will wear his UA cleats throughout the entire 3-plus hours of the game.
And finally, we ended 2015 with a key personnel announcement. Last month, we announced Brad Dickerson's successor as CFO will be Chip Molloy. Chip comes to us with significant financial executive experience at the consumer retail sector, having served as EVP and CFO for PetSmart from 2007 until 2013, and where in 2011, he was named Institutional Investors CFO of the Year for Specialty Retail. 
Chip is a Maryland native and a graduate of one of our partner schools, the United States Naval Academy. He also graduated from Navy Fighter Weapons School or Top Gun as it is known, where he served for 15 years in the United States Navy. With my new partner in place, Chip will work together with Brad over the next month to ensure a smooth transition.
So that's how we closed 2015. Now let's talk about how we kicked off 2016. We started this year off with a bang at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, unveiling a suite of products that will change the way athletes live. Many of you have heard me talk about Connected Fitness on these calls or at our Investor Day. In the past 3 weeks, we've seen the vision of this platform truly come to life.
First, we announced the launch of UA Record, 1 of our 4 mobile app platforms that collectively are earning more than 130,000 new users a day since just beginning of the year. UA Record is the digital dashboard that displays everything you need to know about your health in 4 quadrants: Sleep, fitness, activity and nutrition. Combined with your body weight and our own cognitive measurement of how do you feel, it collects and displays a complete picture of your health in the easiest, most simple way possible.
Second, we introduced the Under Armour HealthBox, the world's first complete connected fitness system, which consists of a band, a heart rate strap and a smart scale, all in one package. Built in partnership with HTC, these tools work together to capture data pertaining to your health and fitness and again, doing it in the easiest, most simple way possible.
Because music is such an important part of how people exercise, we also partnered with Harman Kardon JBL to launch Bluetooth-enabled wireless headphones, including an updated version to be released later this year that will also read heart rate in lieu of a strap. Finally, we launched our first smart shoe with the Gemini 2 RE, which stands for Record Equipped.
This shoe tracks every step and uploads data, including time, date, duration and distance directly into our platforms. This cutting-edge footwear provides an untethered experience and allows the athlete to run device free. There is no start or stop button. When the shoe is on your feet, it's ready and tracking. And one of the cool features of this shoe is that it tracks its own lifespan and will send a notification when it's time for a new pair.
All of these products feed into UA Record as well as more than 400 different connected devices to create the ultimate open platform destination to measure your health and fitness.
Additionally, we announced our partnership with IBM and their Watson platform to help build the insights capability for Under Armour Record. Wearables have been effective in telling you how many steps you took or the hours you slept, but they haven't been effective in giving you proactive information on how to utilize that data to make your life better. Put simply, there was no call to action until now. IBM's Watson, a platform that executes cognitive thinking, will provide personalized insights in real time to the user based on the information we collect for UA Record and will take the experience and service to a whole new level.
By adding Watson's insights to UA Record, we deliver direction to help you reach your personal goal, whether you want to lose 10 pounds or simply just feel better. This is what differentiates UA Record from the rest of the fitness tracking apps and what gives us confidence to the consumer experience we are building to help change the way athletes live.
Now let me complete the vision for Connected Fitness. Beyond enriching lives, it will propel our business forward. This is not a tech initiative. This is a digital transformation and therefore, a business transformation for Under Armour. Before Connected Fitness, we only had retail transaction information for less than 10 million people -- that stores and E-Commerce combine. Now we have daily activity level data from our community members who log nearly 8 billion foods and 2 billion activities last year alone.
Not only do we have people going into our stores and visiting our E-Commerce sites, but we also have a deeper understanding of our consumer based on information collected using Connected Fitness, including sleep, fitness, activity, nutrition, weight and how do you feel. This gives us an unparalleled view of their life and needs. I referred to it as our math house during our last call, but we're also calling it the single view of the consumer.
All of this is possible because of the near 10-year partnership we have established with SAP. The single view of the consumer is something we're building with the team at SAP that combines global point-of-sale, E-Commerce and transactional information through a single sign-on capability together with our Connected Fitness business to create an insight engine that will inform and guide our decision to help grow and scale our brand. This will build on our existing SAP platform as we double down and continue to make big bets with big partners. We believe that this unique technological advancement will position UA as a best-in-class real-time digital enterprise.
At Under Armour, we focus on creating products you don't know you need yet. But once you have it, you won't remember how you lived without it, just like our very first T-shirt. Some great examples of this are the types of innovation we'll bring to the market that will further elevate and diversify our product and continue to distinguish Under Armour.
For example, this year, we will launch Microthread, a new cooling technology comprised of elastomeric thread that dries 30% faster and is 70% more breathable than similar lycra construction. Then on the heating side, there's Reactor, an insulation that combines warmth and breathability to keep you comfortable without overheating. This is in addition to many other new innovations like CoolSwitch, and on the footwear side, Slingshot. New innovations like the ones I just mentioned bring new opportunities for growth, which lead to revenue-driving platforms.
Our goal is that these new innovations will develop as strongly as some of our key revenue-driving platforms from prior years like ColdGear Infrared and Armour in apparel and the signature Curry line in footwear. Our relentless pursuit of innovation is just that, relentless. It never stops.
When I first began Under Armour 20 years ago, I didn't set out to make just another T-shirt. I set out to make a better T-shirt, one that solves a problem and gives whoever wears it an advantage. With our Connected Fitness business, we're not releasing just another fitness app or tracking device. We're building a complete ecosystem to manage your health and fitness with actionable insights to make you better. Finding a better way has been a running theme for us over the past 20 years, whether it's through the products we offer or the way we operate our business. And we'll keep finding a better way for another 20 years because we are just getting started.
So now I'd like to introduce Chip Molloy before Brad takes us through the numbers. Chip?"

I would now like to spend some time reviewing our fourth quarter and full year 2015 financial results, followed by our updated outlook for 2016.Our net revenues for the fourth quarter of 2015 increased 31% to $1.17 billion. On a",2115,"Thanks, Kevin and Chip. I would now like to spend some time reviewing our fourth quarter and full year 2015 financial results, followed by our updated outlook for 2016.
Our net revenues for the fourth quarter of 2015 increased 31% to $1.17 billion. On a currency-neutral basis, fourth quarter net revenues increased 33%. For the full year, net revenues increased 28% to $3.96 billion, which compared to our most recent full year guidance of $3.91 billion. On a currency-neutral basis, full year net revenues increased 31%.
Focusing on the fourth quarter, we grew apparel net revenues 22% to $865 million compared to $708 million in the prior year's quarter. With our efforts to build a more diversified business, we posted impressive growth across channels and categories despite well-documented weather challenges. Our focus on brand -- on building brand equity around the globe through elevated product and experiences was evident in the strong growth of international and Direct-to-Consumer in the quarter. We also saw success around our continued expansion in key product categories like training, running, golf, team sports and basketball.
Fourth quarter footwear net revenues increased 95% to $167 million from $86 million in the prior year. Broad-based footwear strength has been the consistent theme in 2015 though the exceptional performance of our Curry Two signature basketball line was clearly a fourth quarter standout. Our accessories net revenues during the fourth quarter increased 23% to $97 million from $79 million last year, primarily driven by continued strong demand for our line of bags.
Our global Direct-to-Consumer net revenues increased 25% for the quarter, representing approximately 36% of net revenues. In global retail, we ended the fourth quarter with 191 owned stores, including 161 Factory House stores and 30 Brand House stores. With our retail business still heavily weighted to North America Factory House stores, we did experience some of the similar weather-related challenges as our overall apparel business. However, our strong E-Commerce business continues to diversify how we reach global consumers. And we continue to capitalize on our investments in mobile and international, where we more than doubled our in-country websites during 2015.
Looking at our regions, North America net revenues increased 26% to $1.02 billion in the fourth quarter compared to $808 million in the prior year's quarter. On a currency-neutral basis, North America net revenues increased 27%, accelerating from the growth rate posted last quarter despite the warm weather backdrop. This strength demonstrates the diversity of our product mix, including accelerated footwear growth and consistent apparel performance as well as channel mix between our wholesale partners and our Direct-to-Consumer businesses.
International net revenues increased 70% to $139 million in the fourth quarter and represented 12% of total net revenues. On a currency-neutral basis, international net revenues increased 85% for the period.
In the EMEA region, our heightened focus on the U.K. and Germany continues to drive momentum in these 2 core markets. While growth remains strong across all channels, our E-Commerce strategy, including 9 new in-country sites launched in 2015, is playing a key role in broadening our reach and awareness in the region.
In Asia Pacific, we continue to see tremendous demand for the brand, driving triple-digit growth across Greater China and our Southeast Asia distributor, led by the success and expansion of our Brand House stores. And in Latin America, we are building momentum with many of our recent country expansions like Chile, more than offsetting the well-documented macro challenges in Brazil.
Moving on to margins. Fourth quarter gross margins contracted 190 basis points to 48% compared to 49.9% in the prior year's period. The following factors were the primary drivers during the quarter. First, sales mix negatively impacted gross margin by approximately 90 basis points in the fourth quarter versus the prior year, primarily driven by the continued strong performance of our footwear business. Second, the continued strength of the U.S. dollar negatively impacted gross margin by approximately 80 basis points versus the prior year. Third, higher inventory liquidations negatively impacted gross margin by approximately 30 basis points.
Before I move on with other elements of the quarter, I wanted to provide a quick snapshot of our gross margin performance for the full year. Our full year rate in 2015 declined 90 basis points to 48.1% compared to 49% in the prior year's period. Of this 90 basis point decline, 70 basis points resulted from the continued strength of the U.S. dollar.
While we also face additional gross margin headwinds from adverse sales mix impact given the strong growth of our international and footwear businesses, higher inventory liquidation specifically in the fourth quarter and higher freight expenses from port disruptions and efforts to better service our business, we were able to offset most of the noncurrency-related pressure through more favorable product margins in both our North America and international businesses.
Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues leveraged 80 basis points to 32.8% in the fourth quarter of 2015 from 33.6% in the prior year's period. SG&A details for the fourth quarter are as follows. Marketing costs decreased to 7.9% of net revenues for the quarter from 8.4% in the prior year period, primarily reflecting the timing of our global marketing campaigns. Other SG&A costs decreased to 24.9% of net revenues for the quarter from 25.2% in the prior year, driven primarily by lower incentive compensation expense.
Operating income for the fourth quarter increased 21% to $178 million compared with $146 million in the prior year period. For the full year, operating income increased 15% to $409 million compared to our most recent guidance of $408 million. The 2 Connected Fitness acquisitions we made in 2015 negatively impacted full year operating income by approximately $23 million.
Interest and other expense in the fourth quarter increased to $6 million compared with $4 million in the prior year period, primarily reflecting increased interest expense associated with the financing of our Connected Fitness acquisitions.
Our fourth quarter tax rate of 38.4% was consistent with the prior year. Our fourth quarter net income increased 21% to $106 million compared to $88 million in the prior year period, while our diluted earnings per share increased to $0.48 from $0.40 in the prior year's period.
Full year diluted earnings per share increased 11% to $1.05 compared to $0.95 in 2014. The $1.05 earnings per share in 2015 is inclusive of a $0.10 impact from the 2 Connected Fitness acquisitions we made in 2015.
On the balance sheet, total cash and cash equivalents for the quarter decreased to $130 million compared with $593 million at December 31, 2014. Accounts receivable increased 55% to $434 million compared with $280 million at December 31, 2014, primarily related to the timing of shipments within the quarter.
Inventory for the quarter increased 46% to $783 million compared to $537 million at December 31, 2014. Back at our Investor Day in September and again, on our third quarter earnings call, we discussed elevated inventory growth from the 36% rate posted in the third quarter. This growth is largely a result of our strategy to focus on delivering our products to our consumers in a more timely manner and thus drive higher fill rates. This strategy includes flowing product to our customers earlier to meet key seasonal floor set dates as well as strategic investments in auto-replenishment products.
While these efforts are driving much of the elevated inventory growth rates in the near term, they are also delivering meaningful improvements in our service levels year-over-year in support of our revenue growth. In addition, the recent weather trends have led to some excess inventory creation, which we will continue to work through across our normal liquidation channels during the first half of 2016.
Total debt increased to $669 million as compared to $284 million at December 31, 2014, primarily reflecting the financing of our 2 Connected Fitness acquisitions.
Looking at our cash flows, our investment and capital expenditures was $85 million for the fourth quarter compared to $59 million in the prior year's period, driven primarily by our investments on our global headquarters in Baltimore and our SAP platform. Full year capital expenditures were $325 million compared to our prior guidance range of $350 million to $360 million, primarily due to timing of our investments.
Now moving on to 2016. Based on our current visibility, we expect 2016 net revenues of approximately $4.95 billion, representing growth of 25%, and 2016 operating income of approximately $503 million, representing growth of 23%. These growth rates remain in line with the long-term growth rates laid out at our Investor Day last September and are also consistent with our previous guidance on our third quarter earnings call.
Below the operating line, we expect interest expense to increase to approximately $35 million in 2016 as we expect to increased debt levels to support our business and look for opportunities to refinance our debt with more long-term financing. In addition, we expect the full year tax rate of approximately 38.5% and fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 223 million.
Now I'd like to provide more color on our expected results for 2016. First, with net revenues, we currently anticipate the growth rate for the first half of the year to be above our expected full year growth rate. Specifically looking at the first quarter, we expect the growth rate to be in the high 20s, led by many of the same factors from our fourth quarter, including strength in footwear and international, higher planned inventory liquidations and strategies to better service our customers year-over-year. As is typical at this point in the year, as we gain better visibility on orders, specifically for the fourth quarter, we provide updates on our progress on future calls.
Next, on gross margin, we expect a relatively consistent year-over-year rate in 2016 as compared to 2015. For the first quarter of 2016, we anticipate similar year-over-year dynamics as our just completed fourth quarter results, including higher liquidations to clear through excess inventory, along with continued currency headwinds. Thus, we expect our largest gross margin headwind for the year during the first quarter. We are planning an approximate 150 basis point decline year-over-year.
Shifting to SG&A. We expect to deleverage expenses in 2016 as our focus remains on making the right investments to drive our long-term global success. Looking at the marketing portion of SG&A, we expect to continue to invest across our sports marketing assets, global brand campaigns and retail marketing.
In other SG&A, we are focused on key brand-enhancing initiatives that we outlined at our Investor Day such as Connected Fitness and global retail as well as strategic investments -- strategic business areas, including category management and innovation. With a higher top line growth rate currently expected in the front half of the year, we expect modest overall SG&A leverage in the front half of the year and modest deleverage in the second half of the year.
Looking at capital expenditures in 2016. We are currently planning to invest at the midpoint of our 8% to 10% of net revenues target range outlined at our Investor Day. Our investments include our global headquarters as well as our expanding SAP platform that will serve as the architecture for our future growth while also driving our insights engine to power our single view of the consumer that Kevin spoke about.
Finally, inventory. As we previously stated, our focus is on delivering our products to our consumers in a more timely manner and improving our customer service levels. As a result, we continue to expect inventory growth rates to be slightly elevated above revenue growth rate in the front half of 2016, with growth rates expected to level off and be in line with revenue growth in the back half of 2016.
Before we turn it over to Q&A, I wanted to take just a moment to express my thanks to Kevin and the team. It has been a real privilege and honor over the last 11-plus years to work for Kevin and this great brand and have been part of such a strong leadership team, an amazing group of teammates that now tops more than 12,000.
In addition, today marks the 37th UA earnings call I have participated in. And I would like to thank the analysts and investors on the call today, many of whom I spent time with over the years telling the Under Armour story. I'm excited to pass the CFO reins to Chip, a proven leader. And I am confident that Chip and the talented team supporting him will continue the strong growth for this great brand.

I think one of the things that's important, there's a lot of noise this time of year with the weather and so forth in the fourth quarter. And I think it was important, especially in Kevin's prepared remarks, around the track record we've had with 23 straight quarters above 20% growth and then even in the fourth quarter, in the last 6 years, a CAGR in the fourth quarter of about 32% growth and then planning our business in 2016 at 25%. There's a lot of growth in multitude of places. And I think there's -- we've talked about this in the past too. I think there's a little bit of a danger in looking at some of the data sets that are out there, specifically a data set like SportScan. And it can be challenging looking at our business relative to something like SportScan where that data is only -- is capturing actually less than 40% of our business, specifically in the fourth quarter. It's missing key data inputs like our Direct-to-Consumer business, our international business, and it's actually extrapolating some of our key accounts that are pretty large like the Dick's and the Foot Locker. And it obviously also includes accounts that we do not service. So utilizing that data as a proxy for our success, especially in the fourth quarter, it can be a little bit challenged, as we've seen obviously, because we posted another strong quarter in our apparel growing over 20%. So I just want to start that answer with just -- let's be careful on some of those data sets that's out there and understand how they relate to our business in particular."
8740684,321577444,923030,"Under Armour, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2016",2016-01-28,"Earnings Calls","Under Armour, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Brad.

And I think it's important, just to put in context -- so let me just take a couple of minutes and address your questions. So let me begin with footwear, then I'll do North America and then I'll close with women's. So I think the best place for us to start is about growth. It goes without saying, is that any of these questions come down to what does our growth look like. And in the fourth quarter with 31% growth and exactly [ph] marking our 23rd consecutive quarter of 20-plus percent top line revenue growth. Our growth story is strong. We remain a growth company and none of that is wavered. But I also want to give you some context, beginning with footwear, about just how our business has changed since really just 2012 and evolving into a true footwear brand. Remember, 10 years ago, when we celebrated -- or we went public, we hadn't even launched our first shoe until we launched football cleats in June 2006. So we've come a long way from there. So beginning with footwear, just going back to 2012, was 13% of our business. And since then, we've added, I don't know, over a couple billion dollars of revenue. And today, footwear is nearly 17% of our business, representing a 42% CAGR over the last just few years. The diversity -- again back in 2012, our mix of product was -- 33% of our footwear in 2012 was cleats. Cleats today are down to 22% with plans of being the #1 shoe in the market in football, and I'll get back to that in just a second. In my prepared remarks, I mentioned us doubling our running styles over $100. And I just want to make for context, and I also talked about increasing over 1,000%, across all of our footwear, we've more than tripled our footwear styles priced over $100 while quadrupling the volume, like footwear for us couldn't be more and better positioned to be truly a premium footwear brand. And the best way for me to articulate that, let me just talk about basketball for a second. First of all, we have the right athlete in Stephen Curry, and he is, without question, the #1 basketball player on the planet today. We've got the right product that's led by the Curry Two. And to be clear, we launched the Curry One just a year ago at a $120 price point. We then came back on a tour that we did with Stephen in the fall in September, and we launched the Curry Two at a $130 price point. And we've learned a tremendous amount over the last year of what we can do and primarily what we can do in signature basketball product and feel incredibly bullish about our ability to continue to raise ASPs going forward. In Youth, we've heightened our focus to capture the next athlete, driving nearly 50% CAGR just since 2012 in Youth footwear. And again, building out these departments, building out the teams has never been more important. And speaking of teams, we more than doubled the size of our footwear team to nearly 230 people, including the recent addition of a dedicated women's team. And I want to be clear, we didn't have a dedicated women's team in 2012, let alone 18 months ago. So we are certainly not done. We continue to build that team out and growing our presence in Portland with our new headquarters that will be opening [indiscernible]. So these investments in our team, they all mean that these trends are expected to accelerate in 2016. And again, that's off a whopping 95% in the quarter and 57% for the full year. So some of the ways we expect to leverage that success: First, expanding Curry throughout the upcoming All-Star Game, the Playoffs, hopefully the Finals and then the Olympics later this fall. And then ultimately, we're elevating them further when we launch the Curry Three later this year. We're also this year going to be entering the golf category, with the most exciting player on the planet as well as the #1 player in the world in Jordan Spieth, where we have a new line of footwear that will be debuting around the Masters. In addition, we're going to be doubling our running styles priced over $100, led by Slingshot and Slingride, the knit offerings that we have. In 2012, we had just 1. Today, we have more than 8 over $100. We're also going to be doing things like debuting our first smart shoe, the SpeedForm Gemini 2 RE, which means Record Equipped, and that's going to be at a $150 price point, a $20 premium to the standard $130 Gemini price point. And as I mentioned a little bit earlier and back to our roots, the success of Cam Newton, who will be playing next week in the Super Bowl, wearing the Highlight Cleat, that depending on where you look, is the #1 selling cleat in America at the highest price point, continuing to drive us toward becoming the #1 American football cleat in the market and again, a goal thought to be impossible back in 2006. So I want to say, it's a small category. It's domestic only. Our brand, our presence, our ability to drive ASPs have never been stronger in North America. And I believe that footwear is the best example we have of how we are truly just getting started. So let me take a second, just talk about North America. I want to level set the context of how our distribution is aligned. So often, we're compared to our competition. Well, our largest competitor in North America has approximately 24,000 points of distribution just in North America. At Under Armour, we have 11,000 and we have the ability to expand that, but we haven't. We stayed committed to our sporting goods, to our mall, to our department stores channel. And again, this doesn't make going anywhere else impossible for us, but it certainly makes it an opportunity, particularly as we add things like the new merchandising team, which just joined and frankly, were just input in Under Armour through 2015. To be clear, prior to 2015, we did not have a merchandising team. So our structure is changed and frankly, it's evolved. And we talk about North American growth. In the third quarter, in North America, we grew 25%. In the fourth quarter, in North America, we grew 26%. I don't know if I'd call that accelerating, but I'd certainly call it strong. So the way this is happening, one simple word, one simple phrase. When we innovate, we win, bringing new technologies and styles in 2016. I mentioned in my prepared remarks things like CoolSwitch and Microthread and cooling. In the heating side, we have products like Reactor, a new price point that -- at around $200 that complements our current -- the more current styles that we have. And also new product items like the swackett, which will elevate our fleece assortment. You'll start to see us move away from things like the Big Logo hoodie that's been very important to us. But again, you continue to see us learn, and you'll continue to see us evolve to not just where the market's heading, but most importantly, where we're taking the market to. As you think about North America, footwear is such an extraordinary opportunity for us, from the signature Curry product to running to kids. We had more styles at higher price points than ever before in 2015, and that will absolutely be the case in 2016. We've also become the #1 brand in many places; most recently where we took that title was at Sport Chek in Canada. So across apparel, footwear and accessories, we are the #1 vendor for Sport Chek, a very important sporting goods account. And we're closing on that in the majority in many of our other distribution. So premium story telling. This is not just lip service that we are committed to our existing distribution, our existing base. And so whether it's storytelling and the way we show up at retail in places like The ARMOURY with our partners at Champs, with the blue-chip shops that we're building at DICK'S Sporting Goods, we're going to make continue to make investments in premium brand statements with our partners. And the way we can do this is that very well, the first handshake that we have with that consumer will more than likely be a digital handshake because across the Connected Fitness platform that we've implemented over the last 2.5 years, we now have more than 90 million domestic athletes amplifying our message and driving access to the brand. And finally, Direct-to-Consumer. Unfortunately, this is an area that the market doesn't have purview to until we ever tell you our numbers. It's the place though that we typically have the ability to tell our pinnacle brand stories. Beginning with E-Commerce, meeting the consumer where they want to be met, capitalizing on investments that we've made to leverage things like mobile trends, which now is 50% of our fourth quarter traffic. And in terms of retail, we added 5 new Brand House stores in 2015. Again, I want to emphasize, we are a wholesale manufacturer, but we do have this Direct-to-Consumer component that gives us I think a great complement to again meet the consumer where they want us. Adding 5 new Brand House stores in 2015 with roughly 5 to as many as 8 planned in 2016, including -- looking back at the year, we launched our 30,000 square-foot flagship on The Magnificent Mile in Chicago that really, I think, is one of the best examples of our brand [ph] we've ever opened anywhere in the world. So to be clear about North America, we still see abundant opportunities across the continent. And as we said at our Investor Day in September, we believe that we will double this business by 2018. And we say all of this, recognizing and acknowledging, yes, we, of course, have places we can be better. We are certainly not perfect, but we are learning every day and we are putting a team in to make that happen. And so we say all of this about our confidence, incredibly humbly as well, is that we have work to be done. So finally, let me just address women's. This business, I want to be clear, is incredibly important to our account and it's important to us. And while we believe we have huge opportunity to get better, we delivered yet another quarter of double-digit growth in women's, now approaching $0.75 billion in revenue. So 2014 was a year that we defined and we described as the year of the woman. We ignited this conversation on the marketing side with the female consumer that's really taking the brand to a new level of engagement and expectation. And we did that through people, through personalities, personalities like Misty and Gisele. But we also recognize that our products has got to meet that expectation. But what we learned is that she likes this and she wants to have a relationship with the Under Armour brand. And so you've seen our product evolve. And just as importantly, in 2015, for us, you watched our team evolve as we've been investing in our foundation, as we've been investing in our team, and not just any one individual, but throughout our product creation engine, our merchandising teams and our new category in management with our new leader in Pam Catlett, who will be heading up our women's management, who brings over 20 years’ experience in the business. This will all better enable us to create and deliver a 365-day-a-year experience for her. 2016 is about execution in both apparel and footwear. And to be clear, we didn't even have a women's footwear team just a little more than a year ago, so building out these resources for us to really capitalize on the opportunity, where she, just like the men, want to dress toe to head. So we expect to see improved merchandise assortments across our premium distribution and we also expect to continue to elevate our brand where women want us, in places like E-Commerce. And to be clear, on E-Commerce, women's was our #1 and largest-selling and fastest-growing category that we had, faster than men's and faster than Youth. So when we merchandise correctly, we believe we will win. Listen, we understand that her expectations are incredibly high for us and that's exactly where we want them be. We firmly believe that our women's business should be, as we've said for a very long time, at least as large, if not larger, than our men's business. Thanks, Matt."

Yes, Jim, on the footwear market side, yes, we are definitely seeing [ph] improvements on the footwear margins in general. Obviously, even with those improvements, footwear margins are well below our apparel margins, and we've talked about that consistently over the years. So we do anticipate still a lot of room on the footwear side. A lot of that will come from our ability to sell, again, more premium pricing points, specifically in categories like running and basketball, which are historically more -- are higher-margin products. So as that may become a bigger part of our portfolio, that will help our margins from a mix perspective. We've put a lot of investment and energy into the sourcing side of our business and development side of our business, in footwear also, so we're seeing some benefit there on the costing side and I think, as Kevin talked about too, the ability to utilize the strength of our brand in these categories too from a pricing perspective. So we do see footwear margins, they have improved from the last few years to today. We see them improving in the next few years also, but again, just want to caution that they will continue to be lower than our overall apparel margins. That being said though, as we also talked about in the past, that you got to keep in mind, from an operating margin perspective, with the higher price points in footwear and higher ASPs in footwear compared to apparel, you do have the ability to leverage SG&A a little bit better. So we do see, in the long run, even though gross margins will improve in footwear, but will be below apparel, that our operating margins in the longer run should look pretty similar to our apparel business."

That's the way that we'll build it out. So the one thing we've learned, as Malcolm Gladwell says, 10 years or 10,000 hours to perfect something. So I'm not sure that we perfected footwear, but we really feel strong about our position in the game right now. And that begins, of course, I think with the athletes that make it real and that are winning in our footwear out on field, out on pitch, out on court, and whether it's Cam Newton, what hopefully he'll do in football, in the Super Bowl next week, Jordan Spieth in golf or Stephen Curry in basketball. As you talk about international, we have no greater global ambassadors than the ones that we have there today. And as recent as this past week, we also launched Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson that will be sporting Under Armour as his official brand of choice. So what we've built in footwear is impressive. But again, we think we still have room to grow. But some of the franchises that we've built, from Highlight to SpeedForm, to Gemini, to Gemini Record, to the new Curry product, to Slingshot, to Bandit, I mean, we've -- I think we've done a great job of building, as I said, franchise businesses across the sports where we want to win, and that typically begins in running and it begins in basketball. And so we love our positioning there. As I mentioned, 8 products about $100 and again, hitting some of those sweet spots for the right distribution that meets, again, the consumer where they want to be met. So I think we feel very bullish about what we're doing on the international front. And again, some of that evolution too, Jim, has been things like, we'd launch a product in the United States and then it was 6 months or a year later that we'd launch it on a global basis. So the ability to truly -- with Charlie and the team that we have in the international side, of building and launching those things the way we did it, we've done -- I think we've demonstrated our ability to do has really evolved our company. I mean, a great example again is, last year, when I mentioned going on the Curry tour, the purpose of that tour was launching the Curry Two in China, almost 6 weeks ahead of when we launched it here in North America. So I think that truly becoming a global business means not being a North American company that sells things in other markets, but truly being a global business that has a global presence and a global position that sells things at the same time equally. So we're evolving toward that, but we really like our progress and incredibly excited about where we're headed with it."

So first of all, on the apparel side is that -- again, the majority of our business, 70-plus percent of our business is still in apparel. So it is our focus, it's our largest team here and frankly, it's where we've built our brand as innovators. And so some of the things that I mentioned on the call, Reactor, swackett, CoolSwitch, some of the product that we have in the apparel offerings, all of that continued to support our existing ColdGear business. And we effectively built the $25 price point for HeatGear and the $50 price point for ColdGear, and since then, we've been evolving those. So as we -- look, we are a premium brand. And one of the other things that I mentioned maybe going a little more depth on is just our ability now to have merchandising. And you asked about ASPs and price points. Again, we didn't have a merchandising team in 2014. It was a category that we started building out for ourselves in 2015. And so 2015 for us is about building the team. In 2016, it's about segmenting and playing it out in the market. And what that means is again having the right product at the right place, at the right time. And truly having a team isn't just selling the same styles to everyone on an equal basis, but being specific in differentiating between what we do in the mall versus what to do in the sporting goods, let alone what we do at DICK'S Sporting Goods versus what we do in one of our other accounts. And so we will be incredibly thoughtful about that in the way that we drive. As we look forward into 2017, we really -- to the ability to drive efficiency, of really looking at pricing, really looking at the ability for us to maximize and optimize things like margin, but also, again, making sure that it's with the right product and that it sells through. It's because some of the things that we dealt with this year is bringing product in and having our floor set in time for January. And no one can predict things like what happened in this fourth quarter. But I think one of the things we're most proud of is that in spite of what happens with weather, we still have close to 31% top line growth. So we'd love that to see -- continue to translate and drive margin. It's one of our key barometers that we use here in the company. And I think frankly, as Brad will tell you right now, we're doing a good job and more importantly, as the plan going forward, we continue to drive and demonstrate that premium positioning in the marketplace."

Like in 2015, that was probably really evident relative to my prepared remarks. If we look at 2015 gross margins going backwards 90 basis points and the large majority of that 70 basis points coming from foreign currency impact, a lot of other things going on in the rest of that 20 basis points. But the fact of the matter is we had some pretty strong headwinds in 2015 relative to airfreight, as we're looking at servicing our customers during the year and the port disruption earlier in the year, mix, we talked about a lot about during the year, footwear and international working against us from a gross marketing perspective pretty significantly, and we were able to offset a lot of that just through our general increase improvement in product margins specifically on the apparel side. So as you look forward in 2016 and beyond, you should see continued improvement in places like our footwear product margins, like our apparel product margins. International, even to some degree, as we go forward, should get better as the businesses in countries we do directly, whether it's through our DTC or through wholesale become a larger part of our share versus with some of the distributors that we do today. So I think in all aspects of our business, you will see that improve over time. Mix will definitely work against us because these businesses are still -- footwear and international, still lower-margin businesses. But to your point, our ability to improve those margin is great and our ability to improve margins in apparel is not only possible, but it's happening right now as we speak."

This question's come up a lot over the last few years on the fourth quarter, specifically on weather. We've had some warm fourth quarters, some colder fourth quarters and so forth, so -- and our answer is pretty consistent. Over the last few years, there's obviously going to be a little bit of an impact to weather. There's no doubt about that, and it impacts our business, too. And we've said in the last few years, it's probably a couple percentage points of growth impact relative to weather specifically, one way or the other, whether it's warm or cold. So there's no doubt, in the fourth quarter this year, we had a little bit of that impact, and we talked about the fact of managing our way through that and liquidating some excess inventory and taking care of that also in the front half of next year, specifically in the first quarter. But overall, from a top line perspective, it's really only a couple percentage point of growth one way or the other probably. And that -- and again, if -- when you look at specifically this fourth quarter, that was more of a North America dynamic in places where you'd see it probably impact us the most would be our North America wholesale apparel business and our Factory House business. But again, with the diversity of our product lines and apparel, with footwear's strong growth, international's strong growth, there's just much more going on in our business that offsets some of those weather impacts, which, again, are probably a couple of percentage points of growth one way or the other. So going forward, I think continuously being careful how we plan Q3 and specifically Q4 in years not being overly optimistic on weather, but being prudent and putting ourselves in a position to be opportunistic if weather behaves for us. I think it's really important. To the same extent, if weather doesn't behave, it will impact us a little bit and we can manage our way through that specifically with the strong Factory House channel we have."

Transformation. In 2016, the ability to adapt to the changing needs of the consumer is finding metrics of success. For Under Armour, that willingness to transform comes from our understanding that when the map differs from the terrain, we go with the terrain. 
Those words of advice came from former Navy seal and Under Armour Director, Admiral Eric T Olson, Retired. And it aptly describes how we're navigating our company as we enter our 20th year in business. 
Our focus this morning on our transformation, the evolution that is manifesting itself across multiple product categories, channels and geographies. But first, our scoreboard. 
We have started off our 20th year in business with impressive results. Our first quarter revenues grew 30% with the growth coming from every facet of our business. And to be clear, that 30 number was no accident when Stephen Curry decided to average 30 points this season to take the scoring title, while wearing the #30, we thought that putting up 30% growth on our end was the best way for us to demonstrate our pride and support of Stephen and the Warriors. 
This means our top line growth exceeded 20% for the 24th consecutive quarter, that's 6 straight years above 20%. And we saw continued acceleration in both our footwear and International businesses. 
These results are great example of what happens when we execute at a high-level and deliver compelling head to toe products for consumers. 
Last year, we achieved our first billion-dollar quarter. This year, we expect every quarter to top $1 billion in revenues based on our updated outlook of USD 5 billion, an important milestone for our brands. 
So let's focus on how and where we are transforming and driving our brand. The first example is in China, where we have patiently built the foundation we know is needed to capture the enormous growth opportunity in that market. 
In this past quarter, we earned more revenue in China in 90 days than we did in the full year of 2014. We have grown judiciously in this critical market, building a solid foundation of core product with plans to add an additional 120 owned and partner Brand House stores in Greater China throughout 2016. 
Last summer, we brought the NBA's best player, Stephen Curry, to China and his impact on the consumer there has been phenomenal. Driven by the sales of the Curry Two, footwear accounted for nearly 1/3 of our overall business in China compared with the rest of the world, which was less than 20% in 2015. 
Later this year, we'll, once again, travel to China in Southeast Asia with Stephen as we continue to drive brand awareness and consumer engagement all over the world. 
The other example that illustrates our ability to adapt is in our E-Commerce business, where we now operate 26 global sites and for the first time, more than half of our U.S. traffic this quarter came through mobile devices.  The rapid transformation in how people access our brand has been astounding. It's critically important that we reach our consumer there and how the shop and our focus is on improving our E-Commerce consumer experience on both our own site as well as our retail partners sites. 
These dynamic shifts are creating viable diversification for our business. Today, that diversification in our portfolio, whether it's wholesale versus DTC or North America versus International, is a key factor in our ability to deliver 30% revenue growth even in a quarter where one of our largest partners, The Sports Authority, filed for bankruptcy. 
China and E-Commerce are just 2 small examples of how quickly our business is transforming. We consider ourselves extremely fortunate to be in such dynamic industry one was our consumers in a constant state of change, from new ways to think about your fitness, new fashion trends or new athlete icons coming onto the scene, it's those changing dynamics that create opportunities to bring new consumers into our brand and to deepen their relationships with those already familiar with us. 
These 2 examples are also compelling statements about the speed of change in our world. We're running a much different business than we were last year and the change is perpetual. So while others may measure our growth prospects solely by more myopic metrics, we look to our ability to adapt as an equally strong indicator of our continued pace of growth.  Our growth, we have consistently delivered above 20-plus percent in top line revenue for the past 6 years. 
Whether it's evolving to our athletes like Stephen Curry, Misty Copeland, Bryce Harper, Cam Newton and Jordan Spieth are some of young faces of our brands. We're having our footwear in International businesses leading our growth. We are transforming our company and are doing so every 90 days. 
This is a velocity that growth companies need to maintain to be competitive in 2016. 
For Under Armour, it's the cadence at which we have competed since we started this race 20 years ago and the pace where our team is most comfortable. That pace of growth is most evident in our footwear business, with revenues for the first quarter up 64% and the footwear MVP for Under Armour, just like he is in the NBA, is Stephen Curry. 
Our strong momentum in the fourth quarter of 2015 carried through into the new year with the Curry Two topping the signature shoe chart consistently week after week. Stephen's phenomenal season has brought unprecedented attention to our overall footwear business and especially basketball footwear and it's driving both door expansion with our key mall partners and credibility with the hard-core basketball kid. 
With the NBA playoffs underway next month, we will be releasing the Curry 2.5 through Foot Locker and our own E-Commerce channel. It's the shoe that Stephen wore when his team accomplished its historic 73rd NBA win and it's the shoe he's now going to be wearing in the playoff. 
The Curry 2.5 will launch globally on July 1 and then we will come back this fall with the Curry Three. We 
recognize that Stephen's ascent to the top of the basketball world creates a once in a generation opportunity for our brand and our team is laser-focused on delivering against that potential. 
As strong as basketful footwear has been for Under Armour, this past quarter, we saw more premium footwear introductions entering into the marketplace than all of last year combined. 
First off was the Under Armour Gemini 2 RE, the first UA Record equipped running shoe that interfaces with our Connected Fitness platform. This shoe tracks your every step and uploads data, including time, date, duration and distance directly into your chosen Under Armour digital dashboard, 1 of our 4 apps. 
This undoubted experience allows the athlete to run device-free with no start or no stop on. So whether it's the Gemini 2 RE at $150 or its traditional counterpart at $130. When you build compelling innovative product out of a variety of price points, the consumer can select a product that is right for their needs, staying within our brand. 
Next up was UA Architect, our first shoe with a 3D printed midsole made right here in Baltimore, Maryland. The shoe sold-out 90 minutes in our E-Commerce site at a suggested retail of $300. We will continue to test and learn with this technology and customization, and you can expect new 3D printed iterations later this year. 
And earlier this month, we launched our line of golf footwear just ahead of Masters Week with 3 styles. The Tempo Tour at $220, the Drive One at $200 and the Temple Tour Hybrid at $160, driving premium as we introduce ourselves to this market. 
Jordan Spieth has energized the game of golf and continue to drive incredible brand heat for us. We're well positioned to become the authentic performance alternative for today's passionate golfer. Our entry into golf specific footwear enables us to provide a head-to-toe solution. The Drive One is already 1 of the top 5 selling items on our website despite the presale launching just a few weeks ago. 
With the Curry shoes consistently leading the signature basketball market this season, and the introduction of multiple running footwear shoes above $100, we are beginning to see meaningful growth in our footwear ASPs. 
On a global basis, our footwear ASPs grew in the high single digits in the first quarter, and we expect them to continue to grow throughout the year, including in our largest footwear category, running. 
I spoke earlier about the strength of our business in China. It was clearly a key contributor to our overall International growth of 56% in the first quarter. 
During the quarter, we also continued growth in the U.K. market. Last week, we announced our new relationship with Southampton football club starting in the 2016 and 2017 season, giving us our second UA team in an English premier shift, the world's most popular global football league. With Totham currently in second place in the EPL, we'll have a strong presence in the league next year and if things fall right, Champions League play for the Spurs next season as well. 
We continue to expand our wholesale presence in the U.K. by accelerating our business with key partners like Sports Direct and JD Sports. 
Throughout the Europe, Middle East and African region, we are seeing solid growth through our expanded Direct-to-Consumer business. The addition of 250 shop-in-shops with partners throughout Europe and this past quarter, the introductions of our brand in Turkey and North and South Africa through distributors. 
Throughout other key markets around the globe, the UA brand continues to outperform and drive momentum. And of course, with the Olympics coming up this summer, we're seeing an increasing global brand awareness as our Rule Yourself campaign kicks of this past February with memorable spots featuring the United States Women's gymnastic teams, Manchester United, Memphis Depay and in preparation for what will likely be his own Olympic goodbye, the most decorated Olympic athlete of all-time, the great Michael Phelps. 
So our core apparel products like training are driving the growth globally, our category focus in the U.S. is already helping drive strong results across multiple businesses, including basketball, golf and running. 
As we move into the balance of the year, we'll start to see a greater impact from some of our apparel product innovation like CoolSwitch that combines 3 active ingredients in a print technology that keeps you cool and performing at your best. 
We're also bringing to market something called Microthread, a new elastomeric thread that dries 30% faster and is 70% more breathable than similar lycra. 
We're focused on innovating at the yarn level and expect to drive even bigger innovation in the years to come in all of our product categories. 
In addition to this statistic I gave earlier about half of our E-Commerce traffic coming to mobile devices, our E-Commerce business provides this great visibility directly into our consumer and brings quantitative insight to how we measure our business. 
Specifically, our women's E-Commerce growth rate continues to outpace the growth on the Men's side, a direct indicator of the strength of the man for our Women's product when we deliver upon her expectations for performance and style. 
This year, our Women's business will surpass $1 billion, USD 1 billion, that's $1 billion Women's business, a milestone we are proud of that puts us among very select company in the space that continues to attract a lot of interest in competition. 
However, much like our footwear in International businesses, we are focused on a long-term prospects in Women's. We believe the continued investments we're making to create beautiful Women's performance product and deliver it to them where they shop are the key drivers of that long-term opportunity. 
In the Connected Fitness space, we saw strong activity on our website for the UA HealthBox launch of it came in as our second best selling items in the E-Commerce behind the Curry Two for the quarter. 
This great initial consumer reaction took $400 Connected Fitness bundle and broader retail rollout through spring has us excited about the opportunities in Connected Fitness. 
Beyond our opportunities in products like HealthBox, we are seeing meaningful improvements in direct revenue to E-Commerce coming from our Connected Fitness community. Monetizing our Connected Fitness space in the synergistic way that enhances consumer engagement and drives value to our community and the Under Armour brand remains the key initiative for us and in this quarter alone, we nearly matched the revenue from people interacting on our platforms compared to what we did for all of 2015. 
With there community now over 160 million registered users that continues to grow by well over 100,000 new users logging on every day and registering, we recognize the opportunity that we have through products as well as enriching lives by helping them make better decisions about their health. 
While we're still in investment mode, we believe that the future of Connected Fitness is very bright for our brand. 
In 2016, we will continue to move our digital strategy forward as we focus on driving even better consumer engagement, while also building our map house to drive insights to make better decisions and ultimately, build better products for our consumer. 
Last week, the released creative for Under Armour HealthBox, starring our newest Ambassador Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. It's been a great start to the relationship as he's not only the boys for HealthBox, but his initial launch of project Rock backpack has already sold out. 
From The Rock to Misty Copeland, we bring together diverse athletes that truly speak to our willingness of adapting to new terrain. And for Under Armour, partnerships like the ones we have with Misty, The Rock, Cam Newton, Stephen Curry, Tom Brady, Jordan Spieth, Bryce Harper, so many more all combine to make a powerful statement about how we operate as a company. 
In the specific cases of Stephen and Jordan, we can internalize the challenge of repeating, the challenge of breaking a record of setting a standard than finding the will to do it again. This is what drives us everyday and when those streaks are eclipsed, we will start a new one, whether it's in one of our regions, product categories or something that even yet created, we will deliver against a different set of metrics that inspire us to outperform our competition. Because today's record becomes tomorrow's benchmark. 
And with that, I'll pass it over to Chip."

Before I begin, I want to quickly express my gratitude to the entire Under Armour team for this opportunity to be part of such a powerful growth story. Approaching 100 days in the role, I have been extremely impressed by the unwavering drive of this culture and the strength and depth of the team across the board. 
Now I'd like to turn our focus to the details of our first quarter 2016 financial results, followed by our updated outlook for the remainder of the year. 
Our revenues for the first quarter of 2016 increased 30% to $1.05 billion. On a currency-neutral basis, first quarter revenues increased 32%. 
While we are experiencing some changing dynamics among our domestic wholesale partner base, the increased diversity of our global channels and product lines continues to drive strong results. 
During the first quarter, our wholesale revenues grew 28% to $744 million. Our Direct-to-Consumer revenues grew 33% to $266 million, holding steady year-over-year at approximately 25% of revenues in what has been our lowest quarter from a mix perspective the past 2 years. 
In Direct-to-Consumer, our store count at the end of the quarter included 198 company-owned stores globally, comprised of 162 Factory House stores and 36 Brand House stores. 
We also increased our total number of in country websites to 26 with the opening of our site in Mexico. 
During the quarter, licensing revenues grew 15% to $19 million and Connected Fitness revenues grew 119% to $19 million. 
On the product category front, apparel revenues increased 20% to $667 million compared to $555 million in the prior year's quarter, led by growth in training, golf and new innovation platforms such as Microthread and CoolSwitch. 
First quarter footwear revenues increased 64% to $264 million from $161 million in the prior year's quarter. The Curry Two signature basketball shoe continues to be a clear leader in the category and we're  also excited about their action to some of our new pinnacle running styles, including our updated SpeedForm Gemini 2 as well as our first Smart shoe, the SpeedForm Gemini 2 Record Equipped. 
Our accessories revenues during the first quarter increased 26% to $80 million from $63 million in the prior year's quarter, primarily driven by our new lines of headwear and bags. 
On our regional basis, North American revenues in the first quarter increased 26% to $881 million compared to $701 million during the same period last year. 
On a currency-neutral basis, North American revenues increased 27%. One of our key stories domestically continues to be the strategic initiatives we embarked upon early last year to improve service levels for our wholesale customers. Although these initiatives carried an associated investment in inventory beginning in the second quarter last year, we have seen significant improvement in our customer fulfillment rates supporting growth in North American sales. 
International revenues increased 56% to $149 million in the first quarter to reach 14% of total revenues, representing a 200 basis points increase from the year ago period and on pace to reach our Investor Day target of 18% of revenues by 2018.  On a currency-neutral basis, International revenues increased 65%. 
Starting with Asia Pacific. China emerged as our largest International country, nearly tripling the year ago revenue base. Our positioning as the premium performance brand in the market is resonating with consumers, and we are particularly encouraged but the relatively higher mix of footwear in Women's. 
In the EMEA region, as Kevin mentioned, we are strengthening our partnerships with key sporting goods accounts and continuing to invest in controlled retail space to elevate our positioning and brand awareness. We're also extending our brand reach by building some of our newer distributor relationships in areas such as the Middle East, Turkey and North and South Africa. 
And in Latin America, we remained in the early stages of our growth story as we build our distribution and product mix in our primary markets of Mexico, Chile and Brazil. 
Moving on to margins. First quarter gross margins decreased 100 basis points to 45.9% compared to 46.9% in the prior years period.
 As we forecasted on our last quarterly call, higher liquidations declared through excess inventory and foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted gross margin by approximately 100 basis points and 70 basis points, respectively. These negative impacts were partially offset by favorable product margins, led primarily by cost improvements, benefiting gross margin by approximately 60 basis points. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses grew 27% to $446 million compared to $350 million during the first quarter of last year. Growth was predominantly driven by investments in our Direct-to-Consumer businesses, both retail and E-Commerce and overall headcount to support our growth and strategic initiatives such as Connected Fitness and sport category management. Marketing expenses grew 14% for the quarter. 
Operating income for the first quarter increased 26% to $35 million compared with $28 million in the prior year period. Interest expense increased approximately $2 million compared to the prior year period, driven by our higher debt levels from our Connected Fitness acquisitions in 2015 and other working capital needs. 
Within our other income and expense line, we recorded a gain of $3 million, versus a $2 million loss in the prior year period. The gain was driven by an improvement in foreign currency exchange rates towards the end of the quarter, which favorably impacted our required period end balance sheet adjustments. 
In addition, the company tax rate in the first quarter was 42.0% compared to 50.3% in the prior year, primarily driven by International losses decreasing as a percentage of our overall pretax income. 
Our first quarter net income increased 63% to $19 million compared to $12 million in the prior year period, while our diluted earnings per share increased 62% to $0.04. 
As a reminder, diluted earnings per share calculations for both periods reflect the company's Class C stock dividend effective April 7, 2016, which has the same effect as the two-for-one stock split. 
On a pre-split basis, EPS would have been $0.09 for the first quarter this year compared to $0.05 in the prior year period. 
On the balance sheet, total cash and cash equivalents for the quarter decreased to $157 million compared with $225 million at March 31, 2015. Inventory for the quarter increased 44% to $834 million compared to $578 million at March 31, 2015. 
As previously mentioned, the strategy to improve wholesale customer service levels resulted in elevated inventory investments beginning in the second quarter of last year. We expect the growth in inventory will be more in line with sales as we begin to anniversary the strategy during the second quarter of this year. 
Accounts receivable grew 43% to $566 million compared to $396 million at the end of the first quarter of last year. While total debt increased to $935 million as compared to $669 million at March 31, 2015. 
Looking at our cash flows, our investments in capital expenditures was $91 million for the first quarter compared to $68 million in the prior years period. We continue to expect to spend between $450 million and $475 million for the full year, including investments in our global headquarters in Baltimore, our SAP platform and global Direct-to-Consumer. 
Now moving on to our guidance for the remainder of 2016. Based on our current visibility, we are slightly raising both our revenue expectations to approximately $5.0 billion, representing growth of 26% and our operating income expectations to a range of approximately $503 million to $507 million, representing growth of 23% to 24%. 
Gross margins for the full year is expected to be relatively flat when compared to last year, and based on our outlook of $5.0 billion in revenues, SG&A is expected to grow approximately 27%. 
The anticipated deleveraging expenses is a result of our continued focus on making the right investments to drive our long term global success. 
Below the operating line, we expect interest expense to increase to approximately $35 million in 2016 from the higher debt levels to support our business. 
In addition, we continue to expect the full year tax rate of approximately 38.5% and fully diluted  weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 446 million adjusted for the Class C stock dividend. 
For the second quarter, we expect revenues to grow at a rate in the high 20s, led by many of the same factors from our first quarter, including strength in footwear and International and continue strategies to better service our customers. 
In addition, we expect our gross margin percentage to be relatively flat and operating income of $40 million to $42 million, representing 25% to 32% growth. 
Before we turn it over to Q&A, I wanted to reiterate how excited I am to be working with Kevin and the entire Under Armour team. This is an incredible brand, and we look forward to promoting and protecting our growth ahead. 
One of the key members of this team, Dave Bergman, our SVP of Corporate Finance, will be joining us this morning to provide assistance with your questions. Dave brings nearly 12 years of finance and accounting leadership in Under Armour to the table and he will continue to assist me as I seek to understand all aspects of our global business. 
Finally, I look forward to beginning a dialogue with many of you on this call in the upcoming months. Operator?"

So it's obviously a tough quarter for some of our partners in sporting goods as we saw Sports Authority and just recently, Sport Chalet, with some of the filings that have come out. And I guess if there is anything as we think about our busin",1320,"Yes, thanks. So it's obviously a tough quarter for some of our partners in sporting goods as we saw Sports Authority and just recently, Sport Chalet, with some of the filings that have come out. And I guess if there is anything as we think about our business, the good news is that we're not strictly North American store anymore. This is a global company, and it's becoming more and more important to us as we'll be closing on 13% of our revenues and possibly north of that as we think about what the 2016 play will look like. But again, and I'm going to put this to the lens of Under Armour, which is incredibly proud of what we've done, I mean, posting 30% growth in a quarter, where 2 -- one of our largest customers, 1 of our top 2 or 3 customers just a few years ago filed for bankruptcy, I think putting that kind of number up to something that continues demonstrate the strength of the brand and how strong our portfolio ultimately is. I want to reiterate as well is that, there's definitely the things that happened in these types of situations is that it separates sort of where the best are. And I want to be clear that we do not believe that retail is dead. We do believe that there's still an underlying very strong wholesale market out there, and we expect to continue to be iconic, to be a destination. But in order to compete in today's market with what's happening on the digital side, it needs to be experiential. And one of the things we pride ourselves are is being terrific storytellers, and we've got some amazing partners out there that you'll see us continue to invest and frankly reinvest in the places where we're doing business today. That starts with our largest customer, which is DICK'S Sporting Goods and I think one of the best in the market in the field. And as I say that, I also -- I look and say , I don't know if we've been as great as we can be there and while we posted fine results, we think that there's an anonymous amount of opportunity for us to do a better job. And so, with Ed and myself, I'll let you know that we've both taken a personal interest in how we can drive and build a better business today, and that will come through in some of our collaborations on premium footwear as well as things as getting a details like elevated golf shops. But we certainly see more opportunity there. From the mall channel, partners like Champs expanding the armory concept we've got 5 large-formats Champs right now, something we see success, we'll be expanding out to over 150 doors and take down this year. Foot Locker, we've effectively doubled our store base that we've had at Foot Locker because of its success, really driven, of course, by Steph Curry. But frankly what we're doing in footwear is extraordinary that's giving us. One thing that John has said to me long time ago is the word footage was on the door. And so we can leave it our apparels and sport that we have that balance. And so I think you're seeing us drive toward that really across-the-board is we have a better even balance between, both Apparel and Footwear. And then as we look at distribution from the department stores, we got 275 women's apartment this year across department store channels like Macy's, Bon-Ton and Bloomingdale's. So we think that the key to all this is going to be merchandising efforts. As we think about distribution in North America, I just want to put in perspective sort of where we are as we think that we have been incredibly kind, I think it's one of the assets and strengths of the Under Armour brand is how narrow we have been with our distribution. And we're not looking to make any drastic changes, and I want to be clear, but the sort of set the table, Under Armour has roughly 11,000 points of retail distribution, shop-in-shops, our own stores, et  cetera in North America. One of our competitors has 24,000 points of distribution. So we just want to be really clear that there is a tremendous runway for us as we think about the opportunity in front of us. And so it gives us the luxury and the ability to really be able to pick in shoes. And probably the thing that drives this was more than anything else is just merchandising. Line segmentation is that we haven't had the sophistication and frankly, needed it, until the last several years. We were a company that built a great shirt for athletes to wear beneath their uniforms and then all of a sudden, they had bottoms, they had cold weather, and they had Women's, and we sort of added as the the consumers demanded and asked for more. And now we really gotten to a point where understanding that merchandising needs to be up core competency for us. And so bringing that Kevin that's great just gentlemen to help us build out and get China rolling for us and really building a merchandising, a key merchandising team, we are incredibly bullish about what that is going to mean. And so we really we identify it in '14 and again, this sounds may sound a little pedestrian, but we've identified it in '14, we begin building the team in '15. I think that we're building expertise in '16, and we think we're really  beginning to see the fruits of that coming and '17, which is going to leave us a lot of opportunities to look at finding were the best places where we can go to the right product at the right time and really meet our consumer where they want us to be. So we recognize there's opportunities out there. We recognize that there's frankly dissolution channels or specific partners that we're currently not doing business with today, that we're basically walking a consumer not giving them a Under Armour opportunity, which is frankly giving us competition, allowing them to go unchecked. And we believe that win or if we decide to do that, that we can be incredibly competitive and that ultimately, we believe that we can win in that type of mentality. As I also say that, it's hard to understand I think some of the data the that we realize, our DTC business is incredibly strong as well, with 30-plus percent of our business coming from DTC, you can't overlook E-Commerce, and it's one of the things with them clearly report on, but I can tell you that our E-Commerce business is outpacing our overall growth. And again, in a year where -- or a quarter we decided to honor Stephen Curry with posting that 30% number of growth, that's obviously a very, very big statement. So what we can tell you that the good news for us is that the growth right now -- we recognize what a big -- what a privilege it is to make the statement. With our growth effectively is coming from everywhere ad North America something that we feel incredibly strong about. We recognize some of the challenges, but I think as I mentioned in my written comments is that we are -- we have one thing we've developed over the last 10 years and especially the last 6 years of 20-plus percent top line revenue growth consistently is that I believe that we've assembled a team that is experts in terrain and the map will continue to change, and it will continue to underlay, But when and at it does, hopefully we demonstrated our expertise in being able to deliver results for our shareholders, our customers and ultimately, for our end consumers."

But footwear for us, it's interesting because becoming a footwear brand is not something that just happens overnight. And for us, obviously, it's taken a while. We've been making shoes since 2003, we've been selling them since 2006. So to sit here and call it, camp year in business, it's just a long road, it's a long tough log, too. But I think we're incredibly proud of A, the progress, but more importantly, where we are at the moment of time, the ability for us to stand up and declare ourselves as a footwear brand. One thing that I think the 64% growth that we demonstrated in the quarter demonstrate the diversity that we have the brand today across footwear. And again, we are to be clear driving massive growth, and we are taking share. I think there's been some -- we just want to be clear like we are premium footwear brand, we're premium footwear brand that's driving ASPs meaningfully higher as we build out our team and drive innovation across all of our categories. Again, just in the quarter alone, we saw ASPs up in the high single digits just in quarter -- in Q1. Next, it's one thing we know as well is when we can be impactful when we combine premium product and game changing athletes with powerful point-of-sale in distribution that really matters. And so we're fortunate that terrific distribution partners that have been incredibly patient with us and really helping us accelerate, whether is the guys that are exactly doing it or the guys like Foot Locker or Finish Line that lead it. But leading with signature product like that Curry Two. I mean, what Stephen Curry is doing right now is an incredibly impressive and something that is -- I think, we can only imagine just how big he is going to continue to become. But when you think about premium, just a few examples, the Curry Two basketball shoe that we put off at $130, the Curry 2.5 that when you actually broke the record of 73 games and broke the Bull's record, that shoe is heading to the market at $135. When you look at things like Football Cleats, the first category we entered in 2006, it's $140 cleat, it's the highest price point in a marketplace and frankly, we have designs on being the #1 football cleat by market share within the next, let's call, it 24 months. For us to make the statement again 10 years ago we had people laughing and say, you can't compete, it will never happen. So it's been a 10-year slog for us to do that. And so as we sit here in year 6 of running and year 5 of basketball, imagine what we're going to look like in year 10 in both those categories. And it doesn't just stop there, it's coming across the brand. Like the Jordan Spieth with the Temple Tour at $220 and the Drive One at $200, driving premium from a consumer base is really in love with the product and again, we're doing is demonstrating with the best athletes in the world that are wearing our product. One area I just want to spend a minute as I talk about footwear is running and I want to answering how we're doing with the team and supply chain, so bear with me if you can. But I just want to be clear. In running alone, in 2015, we had 4 styles above $100 in running. In 2016, we're going to have 8 styles above $100 in running. In 2017, we expect to have 14 different styles above $100. Now you can ask the question I just want to be able to set in perspective of what that means is that getting into these markets categories, there's a lot of things the supply chain has a lot to do with it. It doesn't mean we just make a prediction that we put a big price tag on it you have to earn the right to do that and that begins with a price to value relationships that the product that you're putting on the shelf ultimately has. When we do that, it's an incredibly long and difficult process because it's come down to how you actually get the shoes made and beyond just the team, and we accepted be a good about what we're building in Portland, a new 100,000 square-foot headquarters that we'll have there, based in Portland that will really us give us access to talent without having to uproot families and move them across the country. And so again, we're going to go with the [indiscernible] there. But let me use the example something like footwear ASPs in running. In 2011, we launched our real first running shoe, that is still in the market today, and this has become a heritage product for us and it's called the Under Armour Sert. And we launched it, it had a $70 price point, it started at a $90 price point, it's selling at $7 price point for us. When we launched the Sert -- by 2013, the Sert was doing about 0.5 million units for us different. In 2014, it did about 1.2 million units for us. In 2015, it did 1.7 million units. And this year, the Sert is going to be about -- close to 2.5 million units of Serts that we'll make this year. And you can say, why are we making low price point shoe. The problem that you have with the factory basis that factories mean that there's people and keeping the consistencies in the product lines for us to manufacture goods on a consistent basis, it's a really valuable thing and part of the overall strategy to make ourselves important to some of the biggest and the best footwear manufacturers in the world like the Yu Yens. So while we say that, we want you to understand we're not just driving toward lower price points by having that confidency and the consistency with our manufacturing base, in t allows us to attract better talent from our manufacturers, they're putting their A teams on our product that allows a making higher price points goods, like for instance, the SpeedForm Gemini that we launched in 2015 and we launched the Gemini, we did about a half -- close to 0.5 million units in 2015, and it will be -- over 780,000 units this year, closing on 800,000 units. Those kind of increases, and we're going to do that at $130 price point. To find and build that competency is something that just takes time and the good news is that we have the equity of brand that has allowed us to endure to get through the difficult years of building out the infrastructure, the team, the manufacturing cycle and the supply chain for us to get it there. And we've had amazing partners that are incredibly patient with us, but we understand that the patient wears out at some point. And as I said, the good news is that we've got these over 14 styles above $100 coming in '17. But we're incredibly proud I think of the product we have in the market even right now in our SpeedForm style like the Slingshot, which is a terrific all knit upper running shoe at $140. The Gemini 2 RE at $150. I mean, I think when you look at our training product line, we have a new product called The Amp at $120 versus, which is going to be new position fit technology for the midfoot. So we see ourselves taking these steps across really all us fix. But I want to be clear, building out the footwear company, it takes time. And we're incredibly proud of the growth we have and again, they're all anchors with we put 64% on the top line of growth in footwear, and it's obviously incredibly important to us as we think about the business going forward."

And for us, laying out now having a Connected Fitness community of over 160 million with adding well over 100,000 new registrants every single day that are volunteer information to us like how much they slept on how active they are, what they did in the exercise how hard the exercise and they're doing things like using our Gear Tracker up to the tune of 1 million people that are asking us to tell them what they should buy a new shoe by evaluating the type of terrain they're running on and the distance they're running on. The information we're getting is extraordinary. But frankly, we're still -- we are in the first inning of what's happening in this world. But what we do have is we have the ability to use data and the key initiative for Under Armour Connected Fitness, and I want to be clear, is that we want you to understand is that we believe in the growth opportunities. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks as well is that we did in the first quarter in revenues, what we did in all -- in just 90 days, what we did in all of 2015. So we see things like premium, we see things like subscription, we see opportunity for us there. But to understand like what exactly is the product is something is going to be a continuous work in process for us. And our job is to find synergistic ways that enhance consumer engagement and drives value to the community really, delivering great value to the community. And so we've laid that bogey out there, about $200 million in 2018, and we feel very good about that. But we also believe that speaking of map and terrain, there will be ebb and flow as to what happens with this product and as it evolves into building the best products for our consumer. So I want to let you know and just remind ourselves that we're certainly still in investment both this year, focused on engagement and what we call the single view of the consumer as it relates to SAP is that we have a major initiative with us that will give us a really one and only look as a company is that the fact that we are not burdened with so much legacy and have the ability to truly define the company the future should look like not only just guessing or using things like a recommendation engine based on previous purchasing history, but truly knowing the activities to consumers are engaging and to deliver the meet the consumer where they are and to deliver better products for them at the right time. But our investments are going to enable us to build out again what we're calling our map house with data and ultimately, we believe are going to help us and power as the sell more shirts and shoes. So we doing that, that powers us, but we brought together some really great partners, in IBM and the Watson platform where we're getting more competency and big data analytics. And again, I think we're still in the first part of this as well as something like the Under Armour HealthBox that our first reads on it are very positive, but we think it's a product that will continue to evolve, and we'll continue to find and allow the consumer to take us with the data that they want. But at the end of the day, we feel incredibly -- we feel really good about what happened in the first quarter of getting that product launch, we launch at CES, but we think that there's definitely this map and terrain will continue to evolve for us."

It's something, which is a big, big opportunity for us. And as well as you're right, Omar, we are driving consumer, so we are matching what happened in 2015 where we've been testing everything, bringing the right amount of map of driving consumers through E-Commerce, to drive ultimately selling more shirts and shoes. Again, we're really clear that the ultimate goal that we had year is that, while Connected Fitness and again, if I said  there's -- as we bought these apps, what they didn't have before is, while they had a great product for the consumer, they had no way to monetize the product. And so by combining Under Armour who is in the physical fitness space and sell shirts and shoes, it really allowed us that we had the vehicle of -- I'll use the analogy of the purpose of the brand that we bring people to the amusement park, we put them on a rollercoaster and they go up in the air and they get excited. When they come off, they go to the loop to loop, they want to engage somehow, they didn't have a way to do that other than to see the day-to-day track. With us, we have the ability to drive them through the gift shop. And with that, hopefully, we have helped them buy lots and lots of Under Armour shirts and shoes."

And so, while no hard decisions have been made now, I wanted to know is that our job in our goal is to put ourselves in the position to make those decisions when the time is right and appropriate. And so merchandising, as I said, is that identifying in '14, building the team in '15, perfecting it in '16 and really being able to hit on all cylinders in '17 is the way that we're thinking about what we're going to do. I mean, driving the right product, right place, right time is the message we have there. And you've heard how much [indiscernible]of Kevin Eskridge who run our merchandising group for us and how highly we think of him, and frankly he has the experience of having ran and built China for us and now having him back here, again. But it's not one person. Probably the best asset he has which is #1 requirement for Under Armour is he's done a group job building an expert team. So we didn't have merchandising team 2 years ago. We have merchandising throughout the building, but we didn't really have a specific merchandising team. So being prescriptive with product low, key items being reinforced with new items styles, colors and making sure their differentiation. I mean, right now, we've got the channels of sporting goods, the mall, department store as well as our own distribution and then possibly broader distributions we think about it. So again, at Under Armour, we really -- we say [indiscernible] Under Armour that's the way we've always done it. So we do believe we're different company every 6 months, and we'll continue to make those make the best decisions that allows to meet consumer where they are and we think that merchandising segmentation is going to be a critical tool for us in our toolbox as we move forward."

Transformation. In 2016, the ability to adapt to the changing needs of the consumer is a refining metric of success. For Under Armour, that willingness to transform comes from our understanding that when the map differs from the terrain, we go with the terrain. 
Those words of advice came from former Navy SEAL and Under Armour Director, Admiral Eric T. Olson, Retired. And he aptly described how we are navigating our company as we enter our 20th year in business. 
I want to focus this morning on our transformation, the evolution that is manifesting itself across multiple product categories, channels and geographies. But first, our scoreboard. 
We have started off our 20th year in business with impressive results. Our first quarter revenues grew 30% with the growth coming from every facet of our business. And to be clear, that 30 number was no accident. When Stephen Curry decided to average 30 points this season to take the scoring title, while wearing the #30, we thought that putting up 30% growth on our end was the best way for us to demonstrate our pride and support of Stephen and the Warriors. This means our top line growth exceeded 20% for the 24th consecutive quarter, that's 6 straight years above 20%. And we saw continued acceleration in both our footwear and international businesses. These results are great example of what happens when we execute at a high-level and deliver compelling head to toe product for the consumer. 
Last year, we achieved our first billion-dollar quarter. This year, we expect every quarter to top $1 billion in revenues based on our updated outlook of USD 5 billion, an important milestone for our brand. 
So let's focus on how and where we are transforming and driving our brand. The first example is in China, where we have patiently built the foundation we know is needed to capture the enormous growth opportunity in that market. 
In this past quarter, we earned more revenue in China in 90 days than we did in the full year of 2014. We have grown judiciously in this critical market, building a solid foundation of core product with plans to add an additional 120 owned and partner Brand House stores in Greater China throughout 2016. 
Last summer, we brought the NBA's best player, Stephen Curry, to China and his impact on the consumer there has been phenomenal. Driven by sales of the Curry Two, footwear accounted for nearly 1/3 of our overall business in China compared with rest of the world, which was less than 20% in 2015. 
Later this year, we'll once again travel to China in Southeast Asia with Stephen as we continue to drive brand awareness and consumer engagement all over the world. 
The other example that illustrates our ability to adapt is in our E-Commerce business, where we now operate 26 global sites, and for the first time, more than half of our U.S. traffic this quarter came through mobile devices.  The rapid transformation and how people access our brand has been astounding. It's critically important that we reach our consumer where and how they shop, and our focus is on improving our E-Commerce consumer experience on both our own site as well as our retail partner sites. 
These dynamic shifts are creating valuable diversification for our business. Today, that diversification in our portfolio, whether it's wholesale versus DTC or North America versus international, is a key factor in our ability to deliver 30% revenue growth even in a quarter where one of our largest partners, The Sports Authority, filed for bankruptcy. 
China and E-Commerce are just 2 small examples of how quickly our business is transforming. We consider ourselves extremely fortunate to be in such a dynamic industry, one where our consumer is in a constant state of change, from new ways to think about your fitness, new fashion trends or new athlete icons coming on to the scene. It's those changing dynamics that create opportunities to bring new consumers into our brand and to deepen their relationships with those already familiar with us. 
These 2 examples are also compelling statements about the speed of change in our world. We are running a much different business than we were last year and the change is perpetual. So while others may measure our growth prospects solely by more myopic metrics, we look to our ability to adapt as an equally strong indicator of our continued pace of growth. 
Our growth, we have consistently delivered above 20-plus percent in top line revenue for the past 6 years. Whether it's evolving to our athletes like Stephen Curry, Misty Copeland, Bryce Harper, Cam Newton and Jordan Spieth are some of the young faces of our brand. We're having our footwear in international businesses leading our growth. We are transforming our company and are doing so every 90 days. This is a velocity that growth companies need to maintain to be competitive in 2016. 
For Under Armour, it's the cadence at which we have competed since we started this race 20 years ago and the pace where our team is most comfortable. That pace of growth is most evident in our footwear business, with revenues for the first quarter up 64% and the footwear MVP for Under Armour, just like he is in the NBA, is Stephen Curry. 
Our strong momentum in the fourth quarter of 2015 carried through into the new year with the Curry Two topping the signature shoe charts consistently week after week. Stephen's phenomenal season has brought unprecedented attention to our overall footwear business and especially basketball footwear, and is driving both door expansion with our key mall partners and credibility with the hardcore basketball kid. 
With the NBA playoffs underway next month, we will be releasing the Curry 2.5 through Foot Locker and our own E-Commerce channel. It's the shoe that Stephen wore when his team accomplished its historic 73rd NBA win, and it's the shoe he is now going to be wearing in the playoffs. 
The Curry 2.5 will launch globally on July 1, and then we will come back this fall with the Curry Three. We recognized that Stephen's ascent to the top of the basketball world creates a once in a generation opportunity for our brand and our team is laser-focused on delivering against that potential. 
As strong as basketball footwear has been for Under Armour, this past quarter, we saw more premium footwear introductions entering into the marketplace than all of last year combined. 
First up was the Under Armour Gemini 2 RE, the first UA Record equipped running shoe that interfaces with our Connected Fitness platform. This shoe tracks your every step and uploads data, including time, date, duration and distance directly into your chosen Under Armour digital dashboard, 1 of our 4 apps. 
This untethered experience allows the athlete to run device-free with no start or no stop button. So whether it's the Gemini 2 RE at $150 or its traditional counterpart at $130, when you build compelling innovative product at a variety of price points, the consumer can select a product that is right for their needs, staying within our brand. 
Next up was UA Architect, our first shoe with a 3D printed midsole made right here in Baltimore, Maryland. The shoe sold out in 19 minutes on our E-Commerce site at a suggested retail of $300. We will continue to test and learn with this technology and customization, and you can expect new 3D printed iterations later this year. 
And earlier this month, we launched our line of golf footwear just ahead of Masters Week with 3 styles. The Tempo Tour at $220, the Drive One at $200 and the Tempo Tour Hybrid at $160, driving premium as we introduce ourselves to this market. 
Jordan Spieth has energized the game of golf and continues to drive incredible brand heat for us. We are well positioned to become the authentic performance alternative for today's passionate golfer. Our entry into golf specific footwear enables us to provide a head-to-toe solution. The Drive One is already one of the top 5 selling items on our website despite the presale launching just a few weeks ago. 
With the Curry shoes consistently leading the signature basketball market this season, and the introduction of multiple running footwear shoes above $100, we are beginning to see meaningful growth in our footwear ASPs.
On a global basis, our footwear ASPs grew in the high single digits in the first quarter, and we expect them to continue to grow throughout the year, including in our largest footwear category, running. 
I spoke earlier about the strength of our business in China. It was clearly a key contributor to our overall international growth of 56% in the first quarter. 
During the quarter, we also saw continued growth in the U.K. market. Last week, we announced our new relationship with Southampton Football Club starting in the 2016 and 2017 season, giving us our second UA team in the English Premiership, the world's most popular global football league. With Tottenham Hotspur currently in second place in the EPL, we'll have a strong presence in the league next year, and if things fall right, Champions League play for the Spurs next season as well. 
We continue to expand our wholesale presence in the U.K. by accelerating our business with key partners like Sports Direct and JD Sports. 
Throughout the Europe, Middle East and African region, we are seeing solid growth through our expanded Direct-to-Consumer business, the addition of 250 shop-in-shops with partners throughout Europe and this past quarter, the introductions of our brand in Turkey and North and South Africa through distributors. 
Throughout other key markets around the globe, the UA brand continues to outperform and drive brand momentum. And of course, with the Olympics coming up this summer, we are seeing an increasing global brand awareness as our Rule Yourself campaign kicks of this past February with memorable spots featuring the United States women's gymnastic teams, Manchester United, Memphis Depay and in preparation for what will likely be his own Olympic goodbye, the most decorated Olympic athlete of all-time, the great Michael Phelps. 
So our core apparel products like training are driving the growth globally. Our category focus in the U.S. is already helping drive strong results across multiple businesses, including basketball, golf and running. 
As we move into the balance of the year, we'll start to see a greater impact from some of our apparel product innovations like CoolSwitch that combines 3 active ingredients in a print technology that keeps you cool and performing at your best. 
We're also bringing to market something called Microthread, a new elastomeric thread that dries 30% faster and is 70% more breathable than similar Lycra. 
We're focused on innovating at the yarn level and expect to drive even bigger innovations in the years to come in all of our product categories. 
In addition to the statistic I gave earlier about more than half of our E-Commerce traffic coming through mobile devices, our E-Commerce business provides us great visibility directly into our consumer and brings quantitative insight to how we measure our business. 
Specifically, our women's E-Commerce growth rate continues to outpace the growth on the men's side, a direct indicator of the strength of the man for our women's product when we deliver upon her expectations for performance and style. 
This year, our women's business will surpass $1 billion, USD 1 billion, that's $1 billion women's business, a milestone we are proud of that puts us among very select company in a space that continues to attract a lot of interest and competition. 
However, much like our footwear in international businesses, we are focused on our long-term prospects in women's. We believe the continued investments we are making to create beautiful women's performance product and deliver it to them where they shop are the key drivers of that long-term opportunity. 
In the Connected Fitness space, we saw strong activity on our website for the UA HealthBox launch as it came in as our second best selling item on E-Commerce behind the Curry Two for the quarter. 
This great initial consumer reaction took $400 Connected Fitness bundle and broader retail rollout through spring has us excited about the opportunities in Connected Fitness. 
Beyond our opportunities in products like HealthBox, we are seeing meaningful improvements in direct revenue to E-Commerce coming from our Connected Fitness community. Monetizing our Connected Fitness space in a synergistic way that enhances consumer engagement and drives value to our community and the Under Armour brand remains the key initiative for us and in this quarter alone, we nearly matched the revenue from people interacting on our platforms compared to what we did for all of 2015. 
With a community now of over 160 million registered users that continues to grow by well over 100,000 new users logging on every day and registering, we recognize the opportunity that we have through product as well as enriching consumers' lives by helping them make better decisions about their health. 
While we are still in an investment mode, we believe that the future of Connected Fitness is very bright for our brand. In 2016, we will continue to move our digital strategy forward as we focus on driving even better consumer engagement, while also building our map house to drive insights to make better decisions and ultimately, build better products for our consumer. 
Last week, we released Creative for UA HealthBox, starring our newest ambassador, Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. It's been a great start to the relationship as he is not only the voice for our HealthBox, but his initial launch of Project Rock backpack has already sold out. 
From The Rock to Misty Copeland, we bring together diverse athletes that truly speak to our willingness of adapting to new terrain. And for Under Armour, partnerships like the ones we have with Misty, The Rock, Cam Newton, Stephen Curry, Tom Brady, Jordan Spieth, Bryce Harper, so many more all combine to make a powerful statement about how we operate as a company. 
In the specific cases of Stephen and Jordan, we can internalize the challenge of repeating, the challenge of breaking a record of setting a standard then finding the will to do it again. This is what drives us every day and when those streaks are eclipsed, we will start a new one, whether it's in one of our regions, product categories or something not even yet created, we will deliver against a different set of metrics that inspire us to outperform our competition, because today's record becomes tomorrow's benchmark. 
And with that, I'll pass it over to Chip."

Approaching 100 days in the role, I have been extremely impressed by the unwavering drive of this culture and the strength and depth of the team across the board. 
Now I'd like to turn our focus to the details of our first quarter 2016 financial results, followed by our updated outlook for the remainder of the year. 
Our revenues for the first quarter of 2016 increased 30% to $1.05 billion. On a currency-neutral basis, first quarter revenues increased 32%. 
While we are experiencing some changing dynamics among our domestic wholesale partner base, the increased diversity of our global channels and product lines continues to drive strong results. 
During the first quarter, our wholesale revenues grew 28% to $744 million. Our Direct-to-Consumer revenues grew 33% to $266 million, holding steady year-over-year at approximately 25% of revenues in what has been our lowest quarter from a mix perspective the past 2 years. 
In Direct-to-Consumer, our store count at the end of the quarter included 198 company-owned stores globally, comprised of 162 Factory House stores and 36 Brand House stores. We also increased our total number of in-country websites to 26 with the opening of our site in Mexico. 
During the quarter, licensing revenues grew 15% to $19 million and Connected Fitness revenues grew 119% to $19 million. 
On the product category front, apparel revenues increased 20% to $667 million compared to $555 million in the prior year's quarter, led by growth in training, golf and new innovation platforms such as Microthread and CoolSwitch. 
First quarter footwear revenues increased 64% to $264 million from $161 million in the prior year's quarter. The Curry Two signature basketball shoe continues to be a clear leader in the category. We are also excited about the reaction to some of our new pinnacle running styles, included our -- including our updated SpeedForm Gemini 2 as well as our first smart shoe, the SpeedForm Gemini 2 Record Equipped. 
Our accessories revenues during the first quarter increased 26% to $80 million from $63 million in the prior year's quarter, primarily driven by our new lines of headwear and bags. 
On a regional basis, North American revenues in the first quarter increased 26% to $881 million compared to $701 million during the same period last year. 
On a currency-neutral basis, North American revenues increased 27%. One of our key stories domestically continues to be the strategic initiatives we embarked upon early last year to improve service levels for our wholesale customers. Although these initiatives carried an associated investment in inventory beginning in the second quarter last year, we have seen significant improvement in our customer fulfillment rates supporting growth in North American sales. 
International revenues increased 56% to $149 million in the first quarter to reach 14% of total revenues, representing a 200 basis point increase from the year ago period and on pace to reach our Investor Day target of 18% of revenues by 2018. On a currency-neutral basis, international revenues increased 65%. 
Starting with Asia Pacific, china emerged as our largest international country, nearly tripling the year ago revenue base. Our positioning as the premium performance brand in the market is resonating with consumers, and we are particularly encouraged by the relatively higher mix of footwear in women's. 
In the EMEA region, as Kevin mentioned, we are strengthening our partnerships with key sporting goods accounts and continuing to invest in controlled retail space to elevate our positioning and brand awareness. We are also extending our brand reach by building some of our newer distributor relationships in areas such as the Middle East, Turkey and North and South Africa. 
And in Latin America, we remain in the early stages of our growth story as we build our distribution and product mix in our primary markets of Mexico, Chile and Brazil. 
Moving on to margins. First quarter gross margins decreased 100 basis points to 45.9% compared to 46.9% in the prior years period.
 As we forecasted on our last quarterly call, higher liquidations to clear through excess inventory and foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted gross margin by approximately 100 basis points and 70 basis points, respectively. These negative impacts were partially offset by favorable product margins, led primarily by cost improvements, benefiting gross margin by approximately 60 basis points. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses grew 27% to $446 million compared to $350 million during the first quarter of last year. Growth was predominantly driven by investments in our Direct-to-Consumer businesses, both retail and E-Commerce and overall headcount to support our growth and strategic initiatives such as Connected Fitness and sport category management. Marketing expenses grew 14% for the quarter. 
Operating income for the first quarter increased 26% to $35 million compared with $28 million in the prior year period. Interest expense increased approximately $2 million compared to the prior year period, driven by higher debt levels from our Connected Fitness acquisitions in 2015 and other working capital needs. 
Within our other income and expense line, we recorded a gain of $3 million versus a $2 million loss in the prior year period. The gain was driven by an improvement in foreign currency exchange rates towards the end of the quarter, which favorably impacted our required period end balance sheet adjustments. 
In addition, the company tax rate in the first quarter was 42.0% compared to 50.3% in the prior year, primarily driven by international losses decreasing as a percentage of our overall pretax income. 
Our first quarter net income increased 63% to $19 million compared to $12 million in the prior year period, while our diluted earnings per share increased 62% to $0.04. 
As a reminder, diluted earnings per share calculations for both periods reflect the company's Class C stock dividend effective April 7, 2016, which has the same effect as the two-for-one stock split. 
On a pre-split basis, EPS would have been $0.09 for the first quarter this year compared to $0.05 in the prior year period. 
On the balance sheet, total cash and cash equivalents for the quarter decreased to $157 million compared with $225 million at March 31, 2015. Inventory for the quarter increased 44% to $834 million compared to $578 million at March 31, 2015. 
As previously mentioned, the strategy to improve wholesale customer service levels resulted in elevated inventory investments beginning in the second quarter of last year. We expect the growth in inventory will be more in line with sales as we begin to anniversary the strategy during the second quarter of this year. 
Accounts receivable grew 43% to $566 million compared to $396 million at the end of the first quarter of last year, while total debt increased to $935 million as compared to $669 million at March 31, 2015. 
Looking at our cash flows, our investment in capital expenditures was $91 million for the first quarter compared to $68 million in the prior years period. We continue to expect to spend between $450 million and $475 million for the full year, including investments in our global headquarters in Baltimore, our SAP platform and global Direct-to-Consumer. 
Now moving on to our guidance for the remainder of 2016. Based on our current visibility, we are slightly raising both our revenue expectations to approximately $5.0 billion, representing growth of 26% and our operating income expectations to a range of approximately $503 million to $507 million, representing growth of 23% to 24%. 
Gross margins for the full year is expected to be relatively flat when compared to last year, and based on our outlook of $5.0 billion in revenues, SG&A is expected to grow approximately 27%. 
The anticipated deleveraging expenses is a result of our continued focus on making the right investments to drive our long term global success. 
Below the operating line, we expect interest expense to increase to approximately $35 million in 2016 from the higher debt levels to support our business. 
In addition, we continue to expect the full year tax rate of approximately 38.5% and fully diluted  weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 446 million adjusted for the Class C stock dividend. 
For the second quarter, we expect revenues to grow at a rate in the high 20s, led by many of the same factors from our first quarter, including strength in footwear and International and continued strategies to better service our customers. 
In addition, we expect our gross margin percentage to be relatively flat and operating income of $40 million to $42 million, representing 25% to 32% growth. 
Before we turn it over to Q&A, I wanted to reiterate how excited I am to be working with Kevin and the entire Under Armour team. This is an incredible brand, and we look forward to promoting and protecting our growth ahead. 
One of the key members of this team, Dave Bergman, our SVP of Corporate Finance, will be joining us this morning to provide assistance with your questions. Dave brings nearly 12 years of finance and accounting leadership in Under Armour to the table, and he will continue to assist me as I seek to understand all aspects of our global business. 
Finally, I look forward to beginning a dialogue with many of you on this call in the upcoming months. Operator?"

So it's obviously a tough quarter for some of our partners in sporting goods as we saw Sports Authority and just recently, Sport Chalet, with some of the filings that have come out. And I guess if there is anything as we think about our busin",1366,"Yes, thanks. So it's obviously a tough quarter for some of our partners in sporting goods as we saw Sports Authority and just recently, Sport Chalet, with some of the filings that have come out. And I guess if there is anything as we think about our business, the good news is that we're not strictly North American story anymore. It is that this is a global company, and it's becoming more and more important to us as we'll be closing on 13% of our revenues and possibly north of that as we think about what the 2016 play will ultimately look like. But again, and I'm going to put this through the lens of Under Armour, which is incredibly proud of what we've done, I mean, posting 30% growth in a quarter, where 2 -- one of our largest customers -- one of our top 2 or 3 customers just a few years ago filed for bankruptcy, I think putting that kind of number up to something that just continues to demonstrate the strength of the brand and how strong our portfolio ultimately is. I want to reiterate as well is that, there is definitely the things that happen in these types of situations is that it separates sort of where the best are. And I want to be clear that we do not believe that retail is dead. We do believe that there is still an underlying very strong wholesale market out there, and we expect to continue to be iconic, to be a destination. But in order to compete in today's market with what's happening on the digital side, it needs to be experiential. And one of the things we pride ourselves on is being terrific storytellers, and we've got some amazing partners out there that you'll see us continue to invest and frankly reinvest in the places where we're already doing business today. That starts with our largest customer, which is DICK'S Sporting Goods, and I think one of the best in the market in the field. And as I say that, I also -- I look and say , ""I don't know if we've been as great as we can be there."" And while we posted fine results, we think that there is an enormous amount of opportunity for us to do a better job. And so, with Ed Stack and myself, I want you to know that we've both taken a personal interest in how we can drive and build a better business today, and that will come through in some of our collaborations on premium footwear as well as things as getting the details like elevated golf shops, but we certainly see more opportunity there. From the mall channel, partners like Champs expanding the armory concept. We've got 5 large-format Champs right now, and something we've seen success and we'll be expanding that to over 150 doors to take down this year. Foot Locker, we've effectively doubled our store base that we've had at Foot Locker because of its success, really driven, of course, by Steph Curry, but frankly what we're doing in footwear is extraordinary that's giving us. One thing that Jonathan said me a long time ago is that the word foot is what's on the door, and so all we can leave with our apparels, and it's important that we have that balance. And so I think you're seeing us drive toward that really across the board that we have a better even balance between both apparel and footwear. And then as we look at distribution from the department stores, we got 275 women's departments this year across some lower department store channels like Macy's, Bon-Ton and Bloomingdale's. So we think that the key to all this is going to be merchandising efforts. As we think about distribution in the -- in North America, I just want to put in perspective sort of where we are as we think that we have been incredibly kind. I think it was one of the assets and strengths of the Under Armour brand is how narrow we have been with our distribution. And we're not looking to make any drastic changes, and I want to be clear, but to sort of set the table, Under Armour has roughly 11,000 points of retail distribution, shop-in-shops, our own stores, et  cetera in North America. One of our competitors has over 24,000 points of distribution. So we just want to be really clear that there is a tremendous runway for us as we think about the opportunity in front of us. And so it gives us the luxury and the ability to really be able to pick and choose. And probably the thing that drives that force more than anything else is just merchandising. Line segmentation is that we haven't had the sophistication, and frankly needed it until the last several years. We were a company that built a great shirt for athletes to wear beneath of uniforms and then they -- all of a sudden they had bottoms, they had cold weather and they had women's, and we sort of added this as the consumers demanded and asked for more. And now we've really gotten to a point where understanding that merchandising needs to be a core competency for us. And so bringing back Kevin Eskridge is the gentlemen that helped us build out and get China rolling for us and really building a merchandising, a key merchandising team, we are incredibly bullish about what that is going to mean. And so we really -- we identified it in '14 and again, this sounds -- may sound a little pedestrian, but we identified it in '14, we begin building the team in '15. I think that we're building expertise in '16, and we think we're really going to begin to see the fruits of that coming in '17, which is going to leave us a lot of opportunities to look at finding were the best places where we can go to the right product at the right time and really meet our consumer where they want us to be. So we recognized there is opportunities out there. We recognized that there is frankly distribution channels or specific partners that we're currently not doing business with today, that we're basically walking a consumer and not giving them an Under Armour opportunity, which is frankly giving our competition, allowing them to go unchecked. And we believe that when we -- when or if we decide to do that, that we can be incredibly competitive and that ultimately we believe that we can win in that type of mentality. As I also say that, it's hard to understand as -- I think some of the data that we realize is, our DTC business is incredibly strong as well. With 30-plus percent of our business coming from DTC, you can't overlook E-Commerce, and it's one of the things we don't clearly report on, but we can tell you that our E-Commerce business is outpacing our overall growth. And again, in a year where we -- or a quarter we decided to honor Stephen Curry with posting that 30% number of growth, that's obviously a very, very big statement. So what we can tell you is that the good news for us is that the growth right now, we recognize what a big -- how -- what a privilege it is to make this statement, but our growth is effectively coming from everywhere. And North America is something that we feel incredibly strong about. We recognized some of the challenges, but I think as I mentioned in my written comments is that we are -- we have one thing we have developed over the last 10 years and especially the last 6 years of 20-plus percent top line revenue growth consistently is that I believe that we've assembled a team that is experts in terrain and the map will continue to change, and it will continue to underlay. But when and at it does, hopefully, we've demonstrated our expertise in being able to deliver results for our shareholders, our customers and ultimately, for our end consumers."

But footwear for us, it's interesting because becoming a footwear brand is not something that just happens overnight. And for us, obviously, it's taken a while. We've been making shoes since 2003. We've been selling them since 2006. So to sit here and what you call 10th year in the business, it's just -- it's a long road. It's a long tough log, too. But I think we're incredibly proud, a, of the progress, but more importantly, where we are at the moment of time, of the ability for us to stand up and declare ourselves as a footwear brand. One thing that I think the 64% growth that we demonstrated in the quarter demonstrates the diversity that we have the brand today across footwear. And again, we are to be clear driving massive growth, and we are taking share. I think there has been some -- we just want to be clear like we are a premium footwear brand. We're a premium footwear brand that's driving ASPs meaningfully higher as we build out our team and drive innovation across all of our categories. Again, just in the quarter alone, we saw ASPs up in the high single digits just in quarter -- in Q1. Next, it's one thing we know as well is that it's when we can be impactful as when we combine premium product and game-changing athletes with powerful point-of-sale in distribution that really matters. And so we're fortunate that terrific distribution partners that have been incredibly patient with us and really helping us accelerate, whether it's the guys that are exactly doing it or the guys like Foot Locker or Finish Line that lead it. But leading with signature product like that Curry Two -- I mean, what Stephen Curry is doing right now is an incredibly impressive and something that is -- I think, we can only imagine just how big it is going to continue to become. But when you think about premium, just a few examples, the Curry Two basketball shoe that we put off at $130, the Curry 2.5 that when he actually broke the record of 73 games and broke the Bull's record, that shoes is heading to the market at $135. When you look at things like football cleats, the first category we entered in 2006, it's $140 cleat. It's the highest price point in a marketplace and frankly, we have designs on being the #1 football cleat by market share within the next, let's call it, 24 months. For us to make that statement, again, 10 years ago, we had people laughing and say, ""You can't compete, it will never happen."" So it's been a 10-year slog for us to do that. And so as we sit here in year 6 of running and year 5 of basketball, imagine what we're going to look like in year 10 in both those categories. And it doesn't just stop there, it's coming across the brand. With like the Jordan Spieth with the Tempo Tour at $220 and the Drive One at $200, driving premium from a consumer base that is really in love with the product. And again, we're doing this demonstrating with the best athletes in the world that are wearing our product. One area I just want to spend a minute on as I talk about footwear is running, and I want to get back to answering like how are we doing with the team and supply chain, so bear with me if you can. But I just want to be clear. In running alone, in 2015, we had 4 styles above $100 in running. In 2016, we're going to have 8 styles above $100 in running. In 2017, we expect to have 14 different styles above $100. Now you can ask the question and I just want to be able to set in perspective of what that means is that getting into these markets categories, there's a lot of things because supply chain has a lot to do with it. It doesn't mean we just make a pretty shoe and then we put a big price tag on it, you have to earn the right to do that and that begins with a price to value relationship that the product that you're putting on the shelf ultimately has. When we do that, it's a -- an incredibly long and difficult process because this come down to how do you actually get the shoes made, and beyond just the team. And we're incredibly excited about what we're building in Portland, a new 100,000 square-foot headquarters that we'll have there, based in Portland that will really give us access to talent without having to uproot families and move them across the country. And so again, we're going to go where the fish are there. But let me use the example of something like footwear ASPs in running. In 2011, we launched our real first running shoe, that is still in the market today, and this has become a heritage product for us and it's called the Under Armour Assert. When we launched it, it had a $70 price point. It started at a $90 price point. It settled at $7 price point for us. When we launched the Assert -- by 2013, the Assert was doing about 0.5 million units for us. In 2014, it did about 1.2 million units for us. In 2015, it did 1.7 million units. And this year, the Assert is going to be about, close to 2.5 million units of Assert's that we'll make this year. And you could say, why are we making a low price point shoe? The problem that you have with a factory basis is that factories means that there is people. And keeping the consistencies in the product lines for us to manufacture goods on a consistent basis, it's a really valuable thing and it's part of the overall strategy to make ourselves important to some of the biggest and the best footwear manufacturers in the world like the [indiscernible]. So while we say that, we want you to understand we're not just driving toward lower price points. By having the competency and the consistency with our manufacturing base, it allows us to attract better talent from our manufacturers that are putting their A teams on our product that allow us to make higher price point goods, like, for instance, the SpeedForm Gemini that we launched in 2015. And when we launched the Gemini, we did about a half -- close to 0.5 million units in 2015, and it will be over 780,000 units this year, closing on 800,000 units. Those kind of increases, and we're going to do that at $130 price point. To find and build that competency is something that just takes time and the good news is that we have the equity of brand that has allowed us to endure to get through the difficult years of building out the infrastructure, the team, the manufacturing cycle and the supply chain for us to get it there. And we've had amazing partners that are incredibly patient with us, but we understand is that, that patient wears out at some point. And as I said, the good news is that we've got these over 14 styles above $100 coming in '17. But we're incredibly proud, I think, of the product we have in the market even right now in our new SpeedForm style like the Slingshot, which is a terrific all-knit upper running shoe at $140. The Gemini 2 RE at $150. I mean, I think when you look at our training product line, we have a new product called The Amp [ph] at $120 versus, which is going to be as a new precision fit technology for the midfoot. So we see ourselves taking these steps across really all aspects, but I want to be clear, building out a footwear company, it takes time. And we're incredibly proud of the growth we have, and again, that all anchors with we put 64% on the top line of growth in footwear, and it's obviously incredibly important to us as we think about the business going forward."

I think it just -- it describes what we've been trying to put together with Connected Fitness and it's this idea, is that data is the new oil like those who have the data, those who have the understanding of the consumer, we believe are the ones that are going to win. And for us, laying out now having a Connected Fitness community of over 160 million with adding well over 100,000 new registrants every single day that are volunteering information to us like how much they slept, how active they are, what they did when they exercise, how hard they exercise and they're doing things like using our Gear Tracker up to the tune of 1 million people that are asking us to tell them when they should buy a new shoe by evaluating the type of terrain they're running on and the distance they're running on. The information we're getting is extraordinary. But frankly, we're still -- we are in the first inning of what's happening in this world. But what we do have is we have the ability to use data and a key initiative for Under Armour Connected Fitness, and I want to be clear is that we want you to understand is that we believe in the growth opportunities. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks as well is that we did in the first quarter in revenues, what we did in all -- in just 90 days, what we did in all of 2015. So we see things like premium, we see things like subscription, we see opportunity for us there. But to understand like what exactly is the product is something is going to be a continuous work in process for us. And our job is to find synergistic ways that enhance consumer engagement and drives value to the community, really delivering great value to the community. And so we've laid that bogey out there, about $200 million in 2018, and we feel very good about that. But we also believe that speaking of map and terrain, there will be ebb and flow as to what happens with this product and as it evolves into building the best product for our consumer. So I want to let you know and just remind ourselves that we are certainly still in investment more this year, focused on engagement and what we call the single view of the consumer as it relates to SAP is that we have a major initiative with us -- with them that will give us a really one and only look as a company is that the fact that we are not burdened with so much legacy and have the ability to truly define what the company -- the future should look like of not only just guessing or using things like a recommendation engine based on previous purchasing history, but truly knowing the activities that consumers are engaging in to deliver to meet the consumer where they are and deliver better products for them at the right time. But our investments are going to enable us to build out, again, what we're calling our map house with data, and ultimately, we believe are going to help us empower us to sell more shirts and shoes. So we're doing that not by ourselves, but we brought together some really great partners, in IBM in the Watson platform, where we're gaining more competency and big data analytics. And again, I think we are still in the first part of this as well as something like the Under Armour HealthBox that our first reads on it are very positive, but we think it's a product that will continue to evolve, and we'll continue to find and allow the consumer to take us with the data that they want. But at the end of the day, we feel incredibly -- we feel really good about what happened in the first quarter of getting that product launched, the launch at CES, but we think that there is -- definitely this map and terrain will continue to evolve for us."

It's something which is a big, big opportunity for us. So -- and as well as you're right, Omar, we are driving consumer. So we're matching what happened in 2015, where we've been testing everything, bringing the right amount of map of driving consumers to E-Commerce, to drive ultimately selling more shirts and shoes. Again, we are really clear that the ultimate goal that we had here is that while Connected Fitness and -- again, if I said there was -- as we bought these apps, what they didn't have before is, while they had a great product for the consumer, they had no way to monetize that product. And so by combining Under Armour who is in the physical fitness space and sells shirts and shoes, it really allowed us that we had the vehicle of -- I'll use the analogy of the purpose of a brand is that we bring people to the amusement park and we put them on the rollercoaster and they go up in the air and they get excited. When they come off, they go to loop-to-loop. They want to engage somehow. They didn't have a way to do that other than to see their day-to-day track. With us, we have the ability to drive them through the gift shop, and with that they -- hopefully, we have helped them buy lots and lots of Under Armour shirts and shoes."

So I think that what you're going to see from us is that where we've been investing in segmentation, we've been investing in merchandising, that is going to leave us the opportunity to make the best decision for the brand. Plain and simple is that we think that there are -- we think there is opportunities. We think there is moments where consumers walk into retail and frankly, they don't have an option to purchase Under Armour. And so while no hard decisions have been made now, I want you to know is that our job and our goal has been to put ourselves in a position to make those decisions when the time is right and appropriate. And so merchandising, as I said, is that identifying in '14, building the team in '15, perfecting it in '16 and really being able to hit on all cylinders in '17 is the way that we're thinking about what we're going to do. I mean, driving the right product, right place, right time is the message we have there. And you've heard how much fan I am of Kevin Eskridge, who runs our merchandising group for us and how highly we think of him and frankly, because he has had the experience of having run and built China for us and now having him back here again -- but it's not one person, probably the best asset he has which is the #1 requirement at Under Armour, as he's done a great job building an expert team. And so we didn't have a merchandising team 2 years ago. I mean, we had merchandising throughout the building, but we didn't really have a specific merchandising team. So being prescriptive with product flow, key items being reinforced with new item styles, colors and making sure there's a differentiation. I mean, right now, we've got the channels of sporting goods, the mall, department store as well as our own distribution and then possibly broader distributions we think about it. So again, at Under Armour, we really -- we say why don't you get Under Armour, someone says that's the way we've always done it. And so we do believe we're a different company every 6 months, and we'll continue to make those -- make the best decisions that allows to meet consumers where they are, and we think that merchandising segmentation is going to be a critical tool for us in our toolbox as we move forward."

Transformation. In 2016, the ability to adapt to the changing needs of the consumer is a defining metric of success. For Under Armour, that willingness to transform comes from our understanding that when the map differs from the terrain, we go with the terrain. 
Those words of advice came from former Navy SEAL and Under Armour Director, Admiral Eric T. Olson, Retired. And they aptly described how we are navigating our company as we enter our 20th year in business. 
I want to focus this morning on our transformation, the evolution that is manifesting itself across multiple product categories, channels and geographies. But first, our scoreboard. 
We have started off our 20th year in business with impressive results. Our first quarter revenues grew 30% with the growth coming from every facet of our business. And to be clear, that 30% number was no accident. When Stephen Curry decided to average 30 points this season to take the scoring title, while wearing the #30, we thought that putting up 30% growth on our end was the best way for us to demonstrate our pride and support of Stephen and the Warriors. This means our top line growth exceeded 20% for the 24th consecutive quarter, that's 6 straight years above 20%. And we saw continued acceleration in both our footwear and international businesses. These results are a great example of what happens when we execute at a high-level and deliver compelling head to toe product for the consumer. 
Last year, we achieved our first billion-dollar quarter. This year, we expect every quarter to top $1 billion in revenues based on our updated outlook of USD 5 billion, an important milestone for our brand. 
So let's focus on how and where we are transforming and driving our brand. The first example is in China, where we have patiently built the foundation we know is needed to capture the enormous growth opportunity in that market. 
In this past quarter, we earned more revenue in China in 90 days than we did in the full year of 2014. We have grown judiciously in this critical market, building a solid foundation of core product with plans to add an additional 120 owned and partner Brand House stores in Greater China throughout 2016. 
Last summer, we brought the NBA's best player, Stephen Curry, to China and his impact on the consumer there has been phenomenal. Driven by sales of the Curry Two, footwear accounted for nearly 1/3 of our overall business in China compared with rest of the world, which was less than 20% in 2015. 
Later this year, we'll once again travel to China in Southeast Asia with Stephen as we continue to drive brand awareness and consumer engagement all over the world. 
The other example that illustrates our ability to adapt is in our E-Commerce business, where we now operate 26 global sites, and for the first time, more than half of our U.S. traffic this quarter came through mobile devices. The rapid transformation in how people access our brand has been astounding. It's critically important that we reach our consumer where and how they shop, and our focus is on improving our E-Commerce consumer experience on both our own site as well as our retail partner sites. 
These dynamic shifts are creating valuable diversification for our business. Today, that diversification in our portfolio, whether it's wholesale versus DTC or North America versus international, is a key factor in our ability to deliver 30% revenue growth even in a quarter where one of our largest partners, The Sports Authority, filed for bankruptcy. 
China and E-Commerce are just 2 small examples of how quickly our business is transforming. We consider ourselves extremely fortunate to be in such a dynamic industry, one where our consumer is in a constant state of change, from new ways to think about your fitness, new fashion trends or new athlete icons coming on to the scene. It's those changing dynamics that create opportunities to bring new consumers into our brand and to deepen the relationships with those already familiar with us. 
These 2 examples are also compelling statements about the speed of change in our world. We are running a much different business than we were last year and the change is perpetual. So while others may measure our growth prospects solely by more myopic metrics, we look to our ability to adapt as an equally strong indicator of our continued pace of growth, a growth, we have consistently delivered above 20-plus percent in top line revenue for the past 6 years. 
Whether it's evolving to our athletes like Stephen Curry, Misty Copeland, Bryce Harper, Cam Newton and Jordan Spieth are some of the young faces of our brand or having our footwear in international businesses leading our growth, we are transforming our company and are doing so every 90 days. This is a velocity that growth companies need to maintain to be competitive in 2016. 
For Under Armour, it's the cadence at which we have competed since we started this race 20 years ago and the pace where our team is most comfortable. That pace of growth is most evident in our footwear business, with revenues for the first quarter up 64% and the footwear MVP for Under Armour, just like he is in the NBA, is Stephen Curry. 
Our strong momentum in the fourth quarter of 2015 carried through into the new year with the Curry Two topping the signature shoe charts consistently week after week. Stephen's phenomenal season has brought unprecedented attention to our overall footwear business and especially basketball footwear, and is driving both door expansion with our key mall partners and credibility with the hardcore basketball kid. 
With the NBA playoffs underway next month, we will be releasing the Curry 2.5 through Foot Locker and our own E-Commerce channel. It's the shoe that Stephen wore when his team accomplished its historic 73rd NBA win, and it's the shoe he is now going to be wearing in the playoffs. 
The Curry 2.5 will launch globally on July 1, and then we will come back this fall with the Curry Three. We recognized that Stephen's ascent to the top of the basketball world creates a once in a generation opportunity for our brand and our team is laser-focused on delivering against that potential. 
As strong as basketball footwear has been for Under Armour, this past quarter, we saw more premium footwear introductions entering into the marketplace than all of last year combined. 
First up was the Under Armour Gemini 2 RE, the first UA Record equipped running shoe that interfaces with our Connected Fitness platform. This shoe tracks your every step and uploads data, including time, date, duration and distance directly into your chosen Under Armour digital dashboard, one of our 4 apps. 
This untethered experience allows the athlete to run device-free with no start or no stop button. So whether it's the Gemini 2 RE at $150 or its traditional counterpart at $130, when you build compelling innovative product at a variety of price points, the consumer can select a product that is right for their needs, staying within our brand. 
Next up was UA Architect, our first shoe with a 3D printed midsole made right here in Baltimore, Maryland. The shoe sold out in 19 minutes on our E-Commerce site at a suggested retail of $300. We will continue to test and learn with this technology and customization, and you can expect new 3D printed iterations later this year. 
And earlier this month, we launched our line of golf footwear just ahead of Masters Week with 3 styles. The Tempo Tour at $220, the Drive One at $200 and the Tempo Tour Hybrid at $160, driving premium as we introduce ourselves to this market. 
Jordan Spieth has energized the game of golf and continues to drive incredible brand heat for us. We are well positioned to become the authentic performance alternative for today's passionate golfer. Our entry into golf specific footwear enables us to provide a head-to-toe solution. The Drive One is already one of the top 5 selling items on our website despite the presale launching just a few weeks ago. 
With the Curry shoes consistently leading the signature basketball market this season, and the introduction of multiple running footwear shoes above $100, we are beginning to see meaningful growth in our footwear ASPs.
On a global basis, our footwear ASPs grew in the high single digits in the first quarter, and we expect them to continue to grow throughout the year, including in our largest footwear category, running. 
I spoke earlier about the strength of our business in China. It was clearly a key contributor to our overall international growth of 56% in the first quarter. 
During the quarter, we also saw continued growth in the U.K. market. Last week, we announced our new relationship with Southampton Football Club starting in the 2016 and 2017 season, giving us our second UA team in the English Premiership, the world's most popular global football league. With Tottenham Hotspur currently in second place in the EPL, we'll have a strong presence in the league next year, and if things fall right, Champions League play for the Spurs' next season as well. 
We continue to expand our wholesale presence in the U.K. by accelerating our business with key partners like Sports Direct and JD Sports. 
Throughout the Europe, Middle East and African region, we are seeing solid growth through our expanded Direct-to-Consumer business, the addition of 250 shop-in-shops with partners throughout Europe and this past quarter, the introductions of our brand in Turkey and North and South Africa through distributors. 
Throughout other key markets around the globe, the UA brand continues to outperform and drive brand momentum. And of course, with the Olympics coming up this summer, we are seeing an increasing global brand awareness as our Rule Yourself campaign kicks of this past February with memorable spots featuring the United States women's gymnastics teams, Manchester United, Memphis Depay and in preparation for what will likely be his own Olympic goodbye, the most decorated Olympic athlete of all-time, the great Michael Phelps. 
So while our core apparel products like training are driving the growth globally, our category focus in the U.S. is already helping drive strong results across multiple businesses, including basketball, golf and running. 
As we move into the balance of the year, we'll start to see a greater impact from some of our apparel product innovations like CoolSwitch that combines 3 active ingredients in a print technology that keeps you cool and performing at your best. 
We're also bringing to market something called Microthread, a new elastomeric thread that dries 30% faster and is 70% more breathable than similar Lycra. 
We're focused on innovating at the yarn level and expect to drive even bigger innovations in the years to come in all of our product categories. 
In addition to the statistic I gave earlier about more than half of our E-Commerce traffic coming through mobile devices, our E-Commerce business provides us great visibility directly into our consumer and brings quantitative insight to how we measure our business. 
Specifically, our women's E-Commerce growth rate continues to outpace the growth on the men's side, a direct indicator of the strength of demand for our women's product when we deliver upon her expectations for performance and style. 
This year, our women's business will surpass $1 billion, USD 1 billion, that's $1 billion women's business, a milestone we are proud of that puts us among very select company in a space that continues to attract a lot of interest and competition. 
However, much like our footwear in international businesses, we are focused on our long-term prospects in women's. We believe the continued investments we are making to create beautiful women's performance product and deliver it to them where they shop are the key drivers of that long-term opportunity. 
In the Connected Fitness space, we saw strong activity on our website for the UA HealthBox launch as it came in as our second best-selling item on E-Commerce behind the Curry Two for the quarter. 
This great initial consumer reaction to a $400 Connected Fitness bundle and broader retail rollout through spring has us excited about the opportunities in Connected Fitness. 
Beyond our opportunities in products like HealthBox, we are seeing meaningful improvements in direct revenue to E-Commerce coming from our Connected Fitness community. Monetizing our Connected Fitness space in a synergistic way that enhances consumer engagement and drives value to our community and the Under Armour brand remains a key initiative for us and in this quarter alone, we nearly matched the revenue from people interacting on our platforms compared to what we did for all of 2015. 
With a community now of over 160 million registered users that continues to grow by well over 100,000 new users logging on every day and registering, we recognize the opportunity that we have through product as well as enriching consumers' lives by helping them make better decisions about their health. 
While we are still in an investment mode, we believe that the future of Connected Fitness is very bright for our brand. In 2016, we will continue to move our digital strategy forward as we focus on driving even better consumer engagement, while also building our map house to drive insights to make better decisions and ultimately, build better products for our consumer. 
Last week, we released Creative for UA HealthBox, starring our newest ambassador, Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. It's been a great start to the relationship as he is not only the voice for our HealthBox, but his initial launch of Project Rock backpack has already sold out. 
From The Rock to Misty Copeland, we bring together diverse athletes that truly speak to our willingness of adapting to new terrain. And for Under Armour, partnerships like the ones we have with Misty, The Rock, Cam Newton, Stephen Curry, Tom Brady, Jordan Spieth, Bryce Harper, so many more all combine to make a powerful statement about how we operate as a company. 
In the specific cases of Stephen and Jordan, we can internalize the challenge of repeating, the challenge of breaking a record of setting a standard then finding the will to do it again. This is what drives us every day and when those streaks are eclipsed, we will start a new one, whether it's in one of our regions, product categories or something not even yet created, we will deliver against a different set of metrics that inspire us to outperform our competition, because today's record becomes tomorrow's benchmark. 
And with that, I'll pass it over to Chip."

Before I begin, I want to quickly express my gratitude to the entire Under Armour team for this opportunity to be part of such a powerful growth story. Approaching 100 days in the role, I have been extremely impressed by the unwavering drive of this culture and the strength and depth of the team across the board. 
Now I'd like to turn our focus to the details of our first quarter 2016 financial results, followed by our updated outlook for the remainder of the year. 
Our revenues for the first quarter of 2016 increased 30% to $1.05 billion. On a currency-neutral basis, first quarter revenues increased 32%. 
While we are experiencing some changing dynamics among our domestic wholesale partner base, the increased diversity of our global channels and product lines continues to drive strong results. 
During the first quarter, our wholesale revenues grew 28% to $744 million. Our Direct-to-Consumer revenues grew 33% to $266 million, holding steady year-over-year at approximately 25% of revenues in what has been our lowest quarter from a mix perspective the past 2 years. 
In Direct-to-Consumer, our store count at the end of the quarter included 198 company-owned stores globally, comprised of 162 Factory House stores and 36 Brand House stores. We also increased our total number of in-country websites to 26 with the opening of our site in Mexico. 
During the quarter, licensing revenues grew 15% to $19 million and Connected Fitness revenues grew 119% to $19 million. 
On the product category front, apparel revenues increased 20% to $667 million compared to $555 million in the prior year's quarter, led by growth in training, golf and new innovation platforms such as Microthread and CoolSwitch. 
First quarter footwear revenues increased 64% to $264 million from $161 million in the prior year's quarter. The Curry Two signature basketball shoe continues to be a clear leader in the category. We are also excited about the reaction to some of our new pinnacle running styles, included our -- including our updated SpeedForm Gemini 2 as well as our first smart shoe, the SpeedForm Gemini 2 Record Equipped. 
Our accessories revenues during the first quarter increased 26% to $80 million from $63 million in the prior year's quarter, primarily driven by our new lines of headwear and bags. 
On a regional basis, North American revenues in the first quarter increased 26% to $881 million compared to $701 million during the same period last year. 
On a currency-neutral basis, North American revenues increased 27%. One of our key stories domestically continues to be the strategic initiatives we embarked upon early last year to improve service levels for our wholesale customers. Although these initiatives carried an associated investment in inventory beginning in the second quarter last year, we have seen significant improvement in our customer fulfillment rates supporting growth in North American sales. 
International revenues increased 56% to $149 million in the first quarter to reach 14% of total revenues, representing a 200 basis point increase from the year ago period and on pace to reach our Investor Day target of 18% of revenues by 2018. On a currency-neutral basis, international revenues increased 65%. 
Starting with Asia-Pacific, china emerged as our largest international country, nearly tripling the year ago revenue base. Our positioning as the premium performance brand in the market is resonating with consumers, and we are particularly encouraged by the relatively higher mix of footwear in women's. 
In the EMEA region, as Kevin mentioned, we are strengthening our partnerships with key sporting goods accounts and continuing to invest in controlled retail space to elevate our positioning and brand awareness. We are also extending our brand reach by building some of our newer distributor relationships in areas such as the Middle East, Turkey and North and South Africa. 
And in Latin America, we remain in the early stages of our growth story as we build our distribution and product mix in our primary markets of Mexico, Chile and Brazil. 
Moving on to margins. First quarter gross margins decreased 100 basis points to 45.9% compared to 46.9% in the prior year’s period.
 As we forecasted on our last quarterly call, higher liquidations to clear through excess inventory and foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted gross margin by approximately 100 basis points and 70 basis points, respectively. These negative impacts were partially offset by favorable product margins, led primarily by cost improvements, benefiting gross margin by approximately 60 basis points. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses grew 27% to $446 million compared to $350 million during the first quarter of last year. Growth was predominantly driven by investments in our Direct-to-Consumer businesses, both retail and E-Commerce and overall headcount to support our growth and strategic initiatives such as Connected Fitness and sport category management. Marketing expenses grew 14% for the quarter. 
Operating income for the first quarter increased 26% to $35 million compared with $28 million in the prior year period. Interest expense increased approximately $2 million compared to the prior year period, driven by higher debt levels from our Connected Fitness acquisitions in 2015 and other working capital needs. 
Within our other income and expense line, we recorded a gain of $3 million versus a $2 million loss in the prior year period. The gain was driven by an improvement in foreign currency exchange rates towards the end of the quarter, which favorably impacted our required period end balance sheet adjustments. 
In addition, the company tax rate in the first quarter was 42.0% compared to 50.3% in the prior year, primarily driven by international losses decreasing as a percentage of our overall pretax income. 
Our first quarter net income increased 63% to $19 million compared to $12 million in the prior year period, while our diluted earnings per share increased 62% to $0.04. 
As a reminder, diluted earnings per share calculations for both periods reflect the company's Class C stock dividend effective April 7, 2016, which has the same effect as the two-for-one stock split. 
On a pre-split basis, EPS would have been $0.09 for the first quarter this year compared to $0.05 in the prior year period. 
On the balance sheet, total cash and cash equivalents for the quarter decreased to $157 million compared with $225 million at March 31, 2015. Inventory for the quarter increased 44% to $834 million compared to $578 million at March 31, 2015. 
As previously mentioned, the strategy to improve wholesale customer service levels resulted in elevated inventory investments beginning in the second quarter of last year. We expect the growth in inventory will be more in line with sales as we begin to anniversary the strategy during the second quarter of this year. 
Accounts receivable grew 43% to $566 million compared to $396 million at the end of the first quarter of last year, while total debt increased to $935 million as compared to $669 million at March 31, 2015. 
Looking at our cash flows, our investment in capital expenditures was $91 million for the first quarter compared to $68 million in the prior year’s period. We continue to expect to spend between $450 million and $475 million for the full year, including investments in our global headquarters in Baltimore, our SAP platform and global Direct-to-Consumer. 
Now moving on to our guidance for the remainder of 2016. Based on our current visibility, we are slightly raising both our revenue expectations to approximately $5.0 billion, representing growth of 26% and our operating income expectations to a range of approximately $503 million to $507 million, representing growth of 23% to 24%. 
Gross margins for the full year are expected to be relatively flat when compared to last year, and based on our outlook of $5.0 billion in revenues, SG&A is expected to grow approximately 27%. 
The anticipated deleveraging expenses is a result of our continued focus on making the right investments to drive our long term global success. 
Below the operating line, we expect interest expense to increase to approximately $35 million in 2016 from the higher debt levels to support our business. 
In addition, we continue to expect the full year tax rate of approximately 38.5% and fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 446 million adjusted for the Class C stock dividend. 
For the second quarter, we expect revenues to grow at a rate in the high 20s, led by many of the same factors from our first quarter, including strength in footwear and International and continued strategies to better service our customers. 
In addition, we expect our gross margin percentage to be relatively flat and operating income of $40 million to $42 million, representing 25% to 32% growth. 
Before we turn it over to Q&A, I wanted to reiterate how excited I am to be working with Kevin and the entire Under Armour team. This is an incredible brand, and we look forward to promoting and protecting our growth ahead. 
One of the key members of this team, Dave Bergman, our SVP of Corporate Finance, will be joining us this morning to provide assistance with your questions. Dave brings nearly 12 years of finance and accounting leadership in Under Armour to the table, and he will continue to assist me as I seek to understand all aspects of our global business. 
Finally, I look forward to beginning a dialogue with many of you on this call in the upcoming months. Operator?"

So it's obviously a tough quarter for some of our partners in sporting goods as we saw Sports Authority and just recently, Sport Chalet, with some of the filings that have come out. And I guess if there is anything as we think about our busin",1367,"Yes, thanks. So it's obviously a tough quarter for some of our partners in sporting goods as we saw Sports Authority and just recently, Sport Chalet, with some of the filings that have come out. And I guess if there is anything as we think about our business, the good news is that we're not strictly a North American story anymore, is that this is a global company, and it's becoming more and more important to us as we'll be closing on 13% of our revenues and possibly north of that as we think about what the 2016 play will ultimately look like. But again, and I'm going to put this through the lens of Under Armour, which is incredibly proud of what we've done, I mean, posting 30% growth in a quarter, where 2 -- one of our largest customers -- one of our top 2 or 3 customers just a few years ago filed for bankruptcy, I think putting that kind of number up to something that just continues to demonstrate the strength of the brand and how strong our portfolio ultimately is. I want to reiterate as well is that, there is definitely the things that happen in these types of situations is that it separates sort of where the best are. And I want to be clear that we do not believe that retail is dead. We do believe that there is still an underlying very strong wholesale market out there, and we expect to continue to be iconic, to be a destination. But in order to compete in today's market with what's happening on the digital side, it needs to be experiential. And one of the things we pride ourselves on is being terrific storytellers, and we've got some amazing partners out there that you'll see us continue to invest and frankly reinvest in the places where we're already doing business today. That starts with our largest customer, which is DICK'S Sporting Goods, and I think one of the best in the market in the field. And as I say that, I also -- I look and say , ""I don't know if we've been as great as we can be there."" And while we posted fine results, we think that there is an enormous amount of opportunity for us to do a better job. And so, with Ed Stack and myself, I want you to know that we've both taken a personal interest in how we can drive and build a better business today, and that will come through in some of our collaborations on premium footwear as well as things as getting the details like elevated golf shops, but we certainly see more opportunity there. From the mall channel, partners like Champs expanding The ARMOURY concept. We've got 5 large-format Champs right now, and something we've seen success and we'll be expanding that to over 150 doors to take down this year. Foot Locker, we've effectively doubled our store base that we've had at Foot Locker because of its success, really driven, of course, by Steph Curry, but frankly what we're doing in footwear is extraordinary that's giving us. One thing Dick Johnson said to me a long time ago is that the word foot is what's on the door, and so while we can lead with our apparels, it's important that we have that balance. And so I think you're seeing us drive toward that really across the board that we have a better even balance between both apparel and footwear. And then as we look at distribution from the department stores, we got 275 women's departments this year across some of our department store channels like Macy's, Bon-Ton and Bloomingdale's. So we think that the key to all this is going to be merchandising efforts. As we think about distribution in the -- in North America, I just want to put in perspective sort of where we are as we think that we have been incredibly tight. I think it was one of the assets and strengths of the Under Armour brand is how narrow we have been with our distribution. And we're not looking to make any drastic changes, and I want to be clear, but to sort of set the table, Under Armour has roughly 11,000 points of retail distribution, shop-in-shops, our own stores, et cetera in North America. One of our competitors has over 24,000 points of distribution. So we just want to be really clear that there is a tremendous runway for us as we think about the opportunity in front of us. And so it gives us the luxury and the ability to really be able to pick and choose. And probably the thing that drives that force more than anything else is just merchandising. Line segmentation is that we haven't had the sophistication, and frankly needed it until the last several years. We were a company that built a great shirt for athletes to wear beneath of uniforms and then they -- all of a sudden they had bottoms, they had cold weather and they had women's, and we sort of added this as the consumers demanded and asked for more. And now we've really gotten to a point where understanding that merchandising needs to be a core competency for us. And so bringing back Kevin Eskridge is the gentlemen that helped us build out and get China rolling for us and really building a merchandising, a key merchandising team, we are incredibly bullish about what that is going to mean. And so we really -- we identified it in '14 and again, this sounds -- may sound a little pedestrian, but we identified it in '14, we begin building the team in '15. I think that we're building expertise in '16, and we think we're really going to begin to see the fruits of that coming in '17, which is going to leave us a lot of opportunities to look at finding were the best places where we can go to the right product at the right time and really meet our consumer where they want us to be. So we recognized there is opportunities out there. We recognized that there is frankly distribution channels or specific partners that we're currently not doing business with today, that we're basically walking a consumer and not giving them an Under Armour opportunity, which is frankly giving our competition, allowing them to go unchecked. And we believe that when we -- when or if we decide to do that, that we can be incredibly competitive and that ultimately we believe that we can win in that type of mentality. As I also say that, it's hard to understand as -- I think some of the data that we realize is, our DTC business is incredibly strong as well. With 30-plus percent of our business coming from DTC, you can't overlook E-Commerce, and it's one of the things we don't clearly report on, but we can tell you that our E-Commerce business is outpacing our overall growth. And again, in a year where we -- or a quarter we decided to honor Stephen Curry with posting that 30% number of growth, that's obviously a very, very big statement. So what we can tell you is that the good news for us is that the growth right now, we recognize what a big -- how -- what a privilege it is to make this statement, but our growth is effectively coming from everywhere. And North America is something that we feel incredibly strong about. We recognized some of the challenges, but I think as I mentioned in my written comments is that we are -- we have one thing we have developed over the last 10 years and especially the last 6 years of 20-plus percent top line revenue growth consistently is that I believe that we've assembled a team that is experts in terrain and the map will continue to change, and it will continue to undulate. But when and at it does, hopefully, we've demonstrated our expertise in being able to deliver results for our shareholders, our customers and ultimately, for our end consumers."

Again, just in the quarter alone, we saw ASPs up in the high single digits just in quarter -- in Q1. Next, it's one thing we know as well is that it's -- when we can be impactful as when we combine premium product and game-changing athletes with powerful point-of-sale in distribution that really matters. And so we're fortunate that terrific distribution partners that have been incredibly patient with us and really helping us accelerate, whether it's the guys that are exactly doing it or the guys like Foot Locker or Finish Line that lead it. But leading with signature product like that Curry Two -- I mean, what Stephen Curry is doing right now is an incredibly -- incredibly impressive and something that is -- I think, we can only imagine just how big it is going to continue to become. But when you think about premium, just a few examples, the Curry Two basketball shoe that we put off at $130, the Curry 2.5 that when he actually broke the record of 73 games and broke the Bulls' record, that shoes is heading to the market at $135. When you look at things like football cleats, the first category we entered in 2006, it's $140 cleat. It's the highest price point in a marketplace and frankly, we have designs on being the #1 football cleat by market share within the next, let's call it, 24 months. For us to make that statement, again, 10 years ago, we had people laughing and say, ""You can't compete, it will never happen."" So it's been a 10-year slog for us to do that. And so as we sit here in year 6 of running and year 5 of basketball, imagine what we're going to look like in year 10 in both those categories. And it doesn't just stop there, it's coming across the brand. With like the Jordan Spieth with the Tempo Tour at $220 and the Drive One at $200, driving premium from a consumer base that is really in love with the product. And again, we're doing this demonstrating with the best athletes in the world that are wearing our product. One area I just want to spend a minute on as I talk about footwear is running, and I want to get back to answering like how are we doing with the team and supply chain, so bear with me if you can. But I just want to be clear. In running alone, in 2015, we had 4 styles above $100 in running. In 2016, we're going to have 8 styles above $100 in running. In 2017, we expect to have 14 different styles above $100. Now you can ask the question and I just want to be able to set in perspective of what that means is that getting into these markets categories, there's a lot of things because supply chain has a lot to do with it. It doesn't mean we just make a pretty shoe and then we put a big price tag on it, you have to earn the right to do that and that begins with a price to value relationship that the product that you're putting on the shelf ultimately has. When we do that, it's a -- an incredibly long and difficult process because this come down to how do you actually get the shoes made, and beyond just the team. And we're incredibly excited about what we're building in Portland, a new 100,000 square-foot headquarters that we'll have there, based in Portland that will really give us access to talent without having to uproot families and move them across the country. And so again, we're going to go where the fish are there. But let me use the example of something like footwear ASPs in running. In 2011, we launched our real first running shoe, that is still in the market today, and this has become a heritage product for us and it's called the Under Armour Assert. When we launched it, it had a $70 price point. It started at a $90 price point. It settled at $70 price point for us. When we launched the Assert -- by 2013, the Assert was doing about 0.5 million units for us. In 2014, it did about 1.2 million units for us. In 2015, it did 1.7 million units. And this year, the Assert is going to be about, close to 2.5 million units of Asserts that we'll make this year. And you could say, why are we making a low price point shoe? The problem that you have with a factory base is that factories means that there is people. And keeping the consistencies in the product lines for us to manufacture goods on a consistent basis, it's a really valuable thing and it's part of the overall strategy to make ourselves important to some of the biggest and the best footwear manufacturers in the world like the YuYens [ph]. So while we say that, we want you to understand we're not just driving toward lower price points. By having the competency and the consistency with our manufacturing base, it allows us to attract better talent from our manufacturers that are putting their A teams on our product that allow us to make higher price point goods, like, for instance, the SpeedForm Gemini that we launched in 2015. And when we launched the Gemini, we did about a half -- close to 0.5 million units in 2015, and it will be over 780,000 units this year, closing on 800,000 units. Those kind of increases -- and we're going to do that at $130 price point. To find and build that competency is something that just takes time and the good news is that we have the equity of brand that has allowed us to endure to get through the difficult years of building out the infrastructure, the team, the manufacturing cycle and the supply chain for us to get it there. And we've had amazing partners that are incredibly patient with us, but we understand is that, that patience [ph] wears out at some point. And as I said, the good news is that we've got these over 14 styles above $100 coming in '17. But we're incredibly proud, I think, of the product we have in the market even right now in our new SpeedForm style like the Slingshot, which is a terrific all-knit upper running shoe at $140. The Gemini 2 RE at $150. I mean, I think when you look at our training product line, we have a new product called The Amp [ph] at $120 versus, which is going to be as a new precision fit technology for the midfoot. So we see ourselves taking these steps across really all aspects, but I want to be clear, building out a footwear company, it takes time. And we're incredibly proud of the growth we have, and again, that all anchors with we put 64% on the top line of growth in footwear, and it's obviously incredibly important to us as we think about the business going forward."

I think it just -- it describes what we've been trying to put together with Connected Fitness and it's this idea, is that data is the new oil like those who have the data, those who have the understanding of the consumer, we believe are the ones that are going to win. And for us, laying out now having a Connected Fitness community of over 160 million with adding well over 100,000 new registrants every single day that are volunteering information to us like how much they slept, how active they are, what they did when they exercised, how hard they exercise and they're doing things like using our Gear Tracker up to the tune of 1 million people that are asking us to tell them when they should buy a new shoe by evaluating the type of terrain they're running on and the distance they're running on. The information we're getting is extraordinary. But frankly, we're still -- we are in the first inning of what's happening in this world. But what we do have is we have the ability to use data and a key initiative for Under Armour Connected Fitness, and I want to be clear is that we want you to understand is that we believe in the growth opportunities. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks as well is that we did in the first quarter in revenues, what we did in all -- in just 90 days, what we did in all of 2015. So we see things like premium, we see things like subscription, we see opportunity for us there. But to understand like what exactly is the product is something is going to be a continuous work in process for us. And our job is to find synergistic ways that enhance consumer engagement and drives value to the community, really delivering great value to the community. And so we've laid that bogey out there, about $200 million in 2018, and we feel very good about that. But we also believe that speaking of map and terrain, there will be ebb and flow as to what happens with this product and as it evolves into building the best product for our consumer. So I want to let you know and just remind ourselves that we are certainly still in investment more this year, focused on engagement and what we call the single view of the consumer as it relates to SAP is that we have a major initiative with us -- with them that will give us a really one and only look as a company is that the fact that we are not burdened with so much legacy and have the ability to truly define what the company of the future should look like of not only just guessing or using things like a recommendation engine based on previous purchasing history, but truly knowing the activities that consumers are engaging in to deliver to meet the consumer where they are and deliver better products for them at the right time. But our investments are going to enable us to build out, again, what we're calling our map house with data, and ultimately, we believe are going to help us empower us to sell more shirts and shoes. So we're doing that not by ourselves, but we brought together some really great partners, in IBM in the Watson platform, where we're gaining more competency and Big Data analytics. And again, I think we are still in the first part of this as well as something like the Under Armour HealthBox that our first reads on it are very positive, but we think it's a product that will continue to evolve, and we'll continue to find and allow the consumer to take us with the data that they want. But at the end of the day, we feel incredibly -- we feel really good about what happened in the first quarter of getting that product launched, the launch at CES, but we think that there is -- definitely this map and terrain will continue to evolve for us."

So we're matching what happened in 2015, where we've been testing everything, bringing the right amount of map [ph] of driving consumers to E-Commerce, to drive ultimately selling more shirts and shoes. Again, we are really clear that the ultimate goal that we had here is that while Connected Fitness and -- again, if I said there was -- as we bought these apps, what they didn't have before is, while they had a great product for the consumer, they had no way to monetize that product. And so by combining Under Armour who is in the physical fitness space and sells shirts and shoes, it really allowed us that we had the vehicle of -- I'll use the analogy of the purpose of a brand is that we bring people to the amusement park and we put them on the rollercoaster and they go up in the air and they get excited. When they come off, they go to loop-d-loop. They want to engage somehow. They didn't have a way to do that other than to see their day-to-day track. With us, we have the ability to drive them through the gift shop, and with that they -- hopefully, we have and help them buy lots and lots of Under Armour shirts and shoes."

Is that something that's part of the conversation potentially over time and really requires some thought and segmentation? Or maybe help me understand how you think about segmenting the brand in those points of distribution. Are you happy with where you are with DTC and E-Commerce and existing distribution?

Plain and simple is that we think that there are -- we think there is opportunities. We think there is moments where consumers walk into retail and frankly, they don't have an option to purchase Under Armour. And so while no hard decisions have been made now, I want you to know is that our job and our goal has been to put ourselves in a position to make those decisions when the time is right and appropriate. And so merchandising, as I said, is that identifying in '14, building the team in '15, perfecting it in '16 and really being able to hit on all cylinders in '17 is the way that we're thinking about what we're going to do. I mean, driving the right product, right place, right time is the message we have there. And you've heard how much fan I am of Kevin Eskridge, who runs our merchandising group for us and how highly we think of him and frankly, because he has had the experience of having run and built China for us and now having him back here again -- but it's not one person, probably the best asset he has which is the #1 requirement at Under Armour, is he's done a great job building an expert team. And so we didn't have a merchandising team 2 years ago. I mean, we had merchandising throughout the building, but we didn't really have a specific merchandising team. So being prescriptive with product flow, key items being reinforced with new item styles, colors and making sure there's a differentiation. I mean, right now, we've got the channels of sporting goods, the mall, department store as well as our own distribution and then possibly broader distribution as we think about it. So again, at Under Armour, we really -- we say the only thing that will get you fired at Under Armour is when someone says that's the way we've always done it. And so we do believe we're a different company every 6 months, and we'll continue to make those -- make the best decisions that allows to meet consumers where they are, and we think that merchandising segmentation is going to be a critical tool for us in our toolbox as we move forward."

Kerry is the best person to tell the Under Armour story and keep her strong shareholder base informed on our business. Congratulations, again, Kerry, on this new role for you. 
Now good morning, everyone. Under Armour is a growth company. The dictionary defines opportunity as a chance for advancing our success and the business of sports provides us with abundant moments where our brand can stand a part among our consumers. But there are times, like now, when this power sport reaches monumental levels, and we find ourselves right now in the midst of a 60-day period where sport transcends its normal place in the conversation. 
Starting back in June with NBA finals, the Cope America and the Euro Champs in Global football, the U.S. and British Opening Golf, the MLB All-Star game and Wimbledon, in a few weeks while the global spectacle of the Summer Olympics. Each of those moments provide opportunities for our consumers to experience the emotion and thrill of sports and for the Apparel and Footwear we make, to shine on a global stage. Whether it's Stephen Curry receiving his second MVP and being named the first unanimous MVP in the NBA, Andy Murray taking the Wimbledon crown in front of the home crowd in London or Michael Phelps in the U.S. gymnastics team preparing for the Olympic spotlight in Rio next month. These athletes have helped Under Armour achieve a new level of awareness and demand. 
So as we grow within both our core Apparel and Footwear businesses, we have steadily and strategically expanded our distribution to reach more athletes who are demanding our brand. We remain focused on helping the world's elite athletes perform at their very best. 
But our mission is broader, to make all athletes better. So this morning, I want to talk about some of the strategic steps we are taking the reach more athletes in 3 key areas: Channels, categories and geographies. 
Our second quarter results are strong evidence that demand for Under Armour has never been higher. Total revenues grew 28% with our Apparel business, up over 19%; footwear, up 58%; and International, up 68%. Chip is going to take you through the key drivers of those growth numbers in a bit, but I want to map out some of the opportunities we are executing against to widen the playing field in terms of access to our brand. 
We have built our business over the past 20 years through great retail partnerships within the sporting goods channel with partners like DICK'S Sporting Goods and Academy. And in department stores and malls, partners like Macy's, Foot Locker, Champs and Finish Line. The authenticity we've gained with consumers grew those partnerships has helped us become who we are today and positioned us to bring Under Armour to an even broader set of consumers. 
What you'll be seeing over the next 12 to 18 months in terms of expanding that consumer access is part of a measured effort to widen the playing field with each element having been in the works for at least 18 months and in some cases, even much longer. 
The first adjacency is UAS, Under Armour Sportswear, the first product for the line will be available this September. UAS is not just the category play or distribution play, it's about bringing a new consumer into the Under Armour Brand. 
UAS will bring a young, fresh and modern voice of sportswear and reflects the insights we've gained as performance brand now apply to the everyday wardrobe. 
It is not about being on trend or capturing the athleisure market, consumers have the expectations that performance product is not just functional but it's fully executed through fit and style. 
We don't believe that Under Armour technology should be exclusively for on field. We don't see it as an either or thing. UAS is poised from the field and built for life. 
Last month, we announced the hiring of Tim Coppens as Executive Creative Director of UAS. Tim's reputation in the faster world is compelling with an existing line already carry a premium retail like Barneys. UAS will have the narrow range of distribution available in new premium retail as well limited range of boutique stores. 
For UAS as a business, it's built for the mobile made of consumer. So while we are partnering with select high-end wholesale partners to showcase the best-in-class expression of the collection, the launch of UAS is predominantly a DTC offering. 
This initiative represents an ambitious step to our brand and provides a great amount of daylight between it and our existing product range. 
The next step in our strategy to reach new consumers as the partnership we're announcing today that will bring the Under Armour Brand to Kohl's starting in 2017. 
One of the top retailers of in the U.S., Kohl's is a large loyal consumer base, the majority of which are women's shoppers. 
This position to reach new consumers through Kohl's is not a channel consideration, but a consumer consideration. We want to reach our consumer where they expect to find Under Armour product. We'll continue to partner with the retailers to provide us the opportunity to showcase the Under Armour Brand. 
Great brands like iconic and inspirational storytellers especially where product meets the consumer. For Under Armour, an important piece of that story is the retail experience we create and drive with our own brand houses. 
Now, I am incredibly excited to announce today the newest location, the former FAO Schwarz space on 5th Avenue at the base of the GM building in New York City. 
The approximately 53,000 square foot space is one of the most recognized and high-traffic areas in all of New York and our plan is to build the most breathtaking and exciting consumer experience ever conceived at retail. 
So in addition to using landmark retail space to help tell the Under Armour story, we are equally focused on creating the best mobile shopping experience as the consumer continues to move to the right space purchasing. 
Last month, we introduce the UA Shop app. It's a way to better navigate shopping for our products through our Connected Fitness platform. 
With consumer spending 85% of their time on mobile devices in an app, we want to better use the new oil that is data to refine and recommend products based on your activities. We believe this will help drive more frequent shopping, bigger baskets and bigger convention throughout the platform. 
Shifting to growth story now from distribution to categories. We have been capturing new basketful consumers almost by the hour with our signature Stephen Curry footwear. Sales of Curry footwear has been extremely strong with the Curry Three coming this fall, we're anticipating our business will continue to post incredible growth. 
Many of these new UA consumers are finding the brand in Foot Locker doors especially at Kids Foot Locker. Not surprising given Stephen's growing popularity with the younger generation. 
So while the numbers he is putting up for Under Armour are record setting, we continue to be blown away by what Stephen has accomplished and incredibly excited for what it is come for both of us as a result. 
The third area of powerful growth is in our geographies, ad specifically in Greater China. Our team continues to drive great revenue increases, especially in E-Commerce with year-to-date revenues up 157%. Our growth is driven by consistently being viewed as performance by the Chinese consumer, brought [indiscernible] first to us as the professional brand. 
We're accomplishing this through premium brand houses in a full-price business model, focused on basketball, running and training. 
Amid increasing support for sport by the government, the Chinese consumers getting more serious about training. 
Our Women's business in China continues to over deliver against our plan with Women's apparel currently 34% of total apparel revenues, up from 24% just last year and our Men's and Women's running businesses combined has more than doubled compared to last year. 
And not surprisingly, Stephen Curry's growing global awareness continues to help drive our business in Greater China. The social media impression for Stephen during the NBA playoffs reached over 2.7 million during that type. It helped drive extremely high sell-through rates in the Curry Two throughout the first 6 months, making our top selling item in China year-to-date. 
This is a great example of what the opportunity and what the future looks like for UA in Greater China, great product and great marketing that is laser focused on the consumer, combined with the hottest athlete in the NBA. 
We're planning our second tour of China with Stephen later this summer and remain incredibly bullish about the future for both Stephen and our brand. 
One of the key vehicles for our dialogue with consumers is our Connected Fitness platform, and we continue to make great strides in delivering insights that make athletes better. With a growing community that's now over 175 million registered users, we're continuing over 100,000 users signing up each and every day, we're learning more about our consumer every single day. 
Mike Lee, the founder of MyFitnessPal, who joined us in early 2015, is now leading our strategic vision to the Connected Fitness business and our team is becoming more knowledgeable everyday about our consumer. 
With areas like sales, merchandising and product innovation, now utilizing single view of the consumer, we are just getting started at implementing of these powerful insights to drive every aspect of our business. 
Some small but important wins for the brand has been our ability to: Number one, quickly tailor our communications in content for our consumer based on the activities giving us the opportunity to tweak our product mix and get more precise the consumer showing up at our stores; secondly, utilizing the data that create a heat map of run activity around our consumers location just a drop of what's the common in terms of personalization. 
I mentioned upfront that this 60-day window of global sports activity culminates next month of the Olympics in Rio. Our presence will be significantly higher than it was in London in 2012 with 4x as many outlets representing national governing bodies for more than 30 different countries competing in Under Armour apparel or footwear and in some cases, utilizing our great Connected Fitness platform to measure their performance. 
In addition, we sponsored some of the most visible icons in Rio like Michael Phelps; recent Wimbledon champ, Andy Murray; and the U.S. gymnastics team. 
We also have a great story in Olympic gold-medal winner, Natasha Hastings, who will be running the 400 this summer in Under Armour footwear. 
In Europe, we're making some great strides in global football as well with Tottenham Hotspur qualifying for champion league play this coming season. And our new sighing, Southhampton, who will be playing euro league football in their first season in UA Kit next month. 
We also announced that one of England's story clubs, Aston Villa, will be wearing Under Armour when the season kicks off in August. And we will have another high profile player, Granit Xhaka, in our boots when the EPL season starts. In one of the largest transfers in club history, he joined Arsenal Football Club and last month, won the national team in Switzerland to a round of 16 at Euro this year. 
The great news is that our marketing efforts are paying off in the U.K. where revenues more than doubled in Q2 year-over-year. 
I should add the U.K. as far away our large market in Europe, so we're driving awareness in the places that move the needle for our business. 
Driving brand awareness where we can benefit most is a key initiative for us and here in North America, we've been most challenged from a regional standpoint on the West Coast. That's critical for us because if California were a country, they would have the sixth largest GDP in the world with roughly 12% of the United States population. 
We recently signed 2 sports marketing deals with great iconic brand in key North American geographies, specifically Los Angeles and the Bay Area. Bringing both the UCLA and Cal Berkeley Athletics Programs into the Under Armour family raises the profile in California that we already have through great partners in sporting goods, mall as well exist existing and a venue department store partners like Kohl's, which has over 100 stores in California. 
This is a great example of how we are thinking all the way through all the assets that we could bring to bear to get after the opportunity in that very, very key market. 
When we add Cal Berkeley to the existing asset that we already have in the San Francisco area, like Stephen Curry, Buster Posey and one of our Connected Fitness offices with over 100 employees and growing, you can see how we're planning for the long run way of growth that exist for the Under Armour brand. 
In then UCLA, we are partnering with one of the most recognizable brands in college sports, not only the Armour model of the great, Jackie Robinson, but the school with more championships than any other in history of the NCAA. 
UCLA has won a total of 113 national team championships, including 11 in basketball, more than any other school. 
So as you've heard me say consistently for over 10 years now as a the public company, Under Armour is a growth company. Now more than ever, we appreciate the challenge of growth and believe we are well positioned to continue to expand our access to more consumers around the world, and that's what makes us extremely proud of our record of 25 consecutive quarters of 20%-plus revenue growth. 
Fortunately, our formula is well-defined. We will maintain our long-term vision of making all athletes better and continually approve on our execution of strategy around channels, categories and geographies. 
With that, I'll pass it over to Chip. Chip?"

I would now like to spend sometime reviewing our second quarter 2016 financial results, followed by our updated outlook for the remainder of the year. 
Our revenues for the second quarter of 2016 increased 28% to $1 billion as we continue to navigate to the changing dynamics of the retail landscape, the consistent growth across our diverse product lines and channels delivered another quarter of strong results. 
During the second quarter, our wholesale revenues grew 27% to $635 million. Our Direct-to-Consumer revenues grew 28% to $321 million, representing approximately 32% of total revenues for the quarter. 
During the quarter, licensing revenues grew 16% to $21 million and Connected Fitness revenues grew 73% to $23 million. 
On the product category front, apparel revenues increased 19% to $613 million compared to $515 million in the prior year's quarter, led by many of the same factors as the first quarter as we continue to see new innovation platforms like Microthread gain momentum in key categories like running as well as continued growth in men's training, women's training and golf. 
Second quarter footwear revenues increased 58% to $243 million from $154 million in the prior year's quarter. 
Our basketball category led by the Curry signature basketball line posted another quarter of strong growth. Beyond basketball, we continue to make strong gains in our running and cleated products within our golf and team sports categories as we remain focused on providing premium products for our customers in more styles and price points than ever before. 
Our accessories revenues during the second quarter increased 21% to $101 million from $83 million in the prior year's quarter, primarily driven by our new lines of bags and headwear. 
On a regional basis, North American revenues in the second quarter increased 22% to $827 million compared to $681 million during the same period last year. 
Within our direct-to-consumer channel, our North American store count at the end of the quarter included 160 company-owned stores comprised of 146 Factory House stores and 14 Brand House stores. 
International revenues increased 68% to $150 million in the second quarter to reach 15% of total revenues. 
On a currency-neutral basis, International revenues increased 72%. Within our International wholesale business, the store count at the end of the quarter included 239 partner stores. 
Within our Direct-to-Consumer business, our company-owned International store count at the end of the quarter included 52 stores comprised of 26 Factory House stores and 26 Brand House stores. 
Looking at our International regions, starting with the EMEA. We continue to grow our presence within key sporting goods accounts and expand our direct-to-consumer business with second quarter openings of new Factory House stores in the U.K., Germany and the Netherlands. 
In the Asia Pacific region, we now have more than 230 stores comprised of both owned and partnered stores as we look to continue to drive our premium positioning as the performance brand in the market. 
And in Latin America, we remain focused on building and expanding our distribution. 
Moving on to margins. Second quarter gross margin decreased 70 basis points to 47.7% compared to 48.4% in the prior year's period.  Sales mix negatively impacted the second quarter by approximately 130 basis points, primarily driven by the continued strength of our footwear in International growth. Partially offsetting this negative impact were continued favorable product margins, benefiting gross margin by approximately 50 basis points. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses grew 32% to $458 million, which includes the previously announced impairment related to The Sports Authority liquidation compared to $347 million during the second quarter of last year. 
In addition to the impairment, growth was predominantly driven by investments in our Direct-to-Consumer businesses, both retail and E-Commerce and overall headcount to support our growth and strategic initiatives such as product creation, innovation and sport category 
management.  Marketing expenses grew 20% for the quarter. 
Operating income for the second quarter decreased 39% to $19 million compared with $32 million in the prior year period. The decrease was primarily driven by the $23 million impairment related to the Sports Authority liquidation. 
Interest expense for the second quarter increased to approximately $6 million compared to $4 million in the prior year's period. 
Within other income and expense, we recorded a loss of $3 million versus a slight gain in the prior year period. This loss was primarily driven by foreign currency exchange rates. 
In addition, the company tax rate in the second quarter was 40.5% compared to 46.7% in the prior year, largely due to a onetime tax benefit related to our prior period acquisitions. 
Our second quarter net income decreased 58% to $6 million compared to $15 million in the prior year period. 
In the second quarter, we completed a $59 million, onetime stock dividend to our Class C shareholders related to our shareholder litigation, which resulted in a different earnings per share calculation for the quarter for our Class A and B stock as compared to our Class C stock. The dividend was allocated only to our Class C shareholders, resulting in a different numerator when calculating EPS for the Class C stock. Our earnings release included a non-GAAP presentation of EPS backing out the impact of the dividend. This is a onetime event and will only call the difference in earnings per share for the 3 classes of stock for this quarter and year-end. 
On the balance sheet, total cash and cash equivalents for the quarter was $121 million compared with $171 million at June 30, 2015. Inventory for the quarter increased 30% to $1.1 billion compared to $837 million at June 30, 2015. 
As we noted last quarter, we are beginning to anniversary strategic inventory investments that we implemented in the second quarter of last year and expect the growth in inventory to remain relatively in line with sales throughout the remainder of the year. 
Total debt increased to $1.2 billion as compared to $712 million at June 30, 2015. 
During the quarter, we completed our first public bond offering of a $600 million investment-grade notes, which was well received in the market. The net proceeds were used to pay down outstanding revolver borrowings. 
Looking at our cash flows. Our investment and capital expenditures was $149 million for the second quarter compared to 9

Below the operating line, we expect interest expense to increase to approximately $32 million in 2016. 
In addition, we now expect a full year tax rate of approximately 36.5% and fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately $448 million.

In addition, we expect our gross margin percentage to decline slightly compared to the prior year. 
For the third quarter, we expect operating income in the range of $180 million to $185 million, representing 5% to 8% growth versus the prior year.

I think people are asking in China to figure out how where as the brand beyond, pitch, the field to court. We just seen that over and over and over, again. And when we look at the market opportunity, our 2 competitor claimed that their sportswears businesses are somewhere between 20% to 30% so the aggregate number there is roughly $50 billion, so we assume there's about $15 billion market opportunity that today Under Armour is playing just a few percentage points for overall growth. So we think there's a massive opportunity, there's massive appetite for those in our space to really be effective in sportswear. We also recognize that I think there's a shift that's happening in the consumer workplace right now. I don't know how many people in the call have been people in their offers that are you wearing suits and ties. And so there's massive shift to cash and comfortable. And I think what we have than to establish our brand is that our shirts they just don't look great, but they actually do something. So whether it's working management, stretch, washability, all the things that I think more practical than the way we frankly have dressed ourselves these days. So I think our taking advantage of that opportunity in that shift is very, very important for us. And the way we want to do is a couple is because what UA sportswear is meant to be is more like a flag in the ground that plays out there. And we think there's frankly a little bit room for us to fill in overtime between where we're going with that flat and where we are today. And so it will be a bit of an evolution. You'll see that, number one, through things that are branded, UAS and sportswear. And you'll also see us being more aggressive with some lines that we have in some of our more proactive and aggressive retailers as well. So the lines you'll see at Foot Locker and things that are more street ready where as well as things will be doing in our traditional sporting goods distribution. So we see styling in the company being more important. Of course, we're not going to give up on what we've done to establish ourselves as authentic and on field, on court, et cetera, but we do see there's an opportunity for us not just to wear to us when they're playing sports, but then to wear us to school, out at night and other wearing occasions. So getting Tim Coppens on board is a big deal. He is a big deal and with it, we're creating -- we moved to the sports category focus. We actually have 9 or 10 divisions now, sportswear is going to be one of them and very important to us headed by a guy named, Ben Pruess, who is an industry veteran someone who knows how to do it. And this is also answering just the signature athlete lines that we've had. All of a sudden, we woke up one day, we recognize that we had athletes like Stephen and Jordan and Cam and Tom and all these household names and what we're really doing to leverage this. We think that is a big opportunity on the signature side. We think there's specific opportunity in sportswear that we can play in. We think, A, we can get market share as well as the ability for us to grow that where we think it somewhere about a $15 billion pie today as we think about it at least. So we think there's -- we're really excited about it and frankly, I'm sitting here wearing Under Armour Sportswear today, and I think I look great. [indiscernible] working on it."

A bit more ready wear and washability. But everything will have the Under Armour DNA. That's more important, whether it is stain resistance or waterproof or some of the other things that you'd expect from us, a little more stylish. You'll see the branding, I think. What I challenged the team to do is lean on the brand when you need to. And the first reaction is that we don't need the branding anywhere, but I think the consumer, again, this will be a journey. And as we get there, you'll see the brand. But the UAS will have its own unique distinctive brand and from time to time, particularly in things like the footwear, you'll see some more starting use of the logo. But the logo will be on every piece whether it's inside of the collar or outside the collar has been the question."

But I want to be clear as we talked about Kohl's, first and foremost, have an amazing distribution group of partners that have enabled us to get to this point and I think we've been incredibly prudent with the way that we rolled out our distribution. It has been thoughtful, it has been patient, it has been 20 years in the making. And I want to know that first of all, Kohl's there's nothing reactionary about Kohl's. This is a proactive move for us. That has been the work for the last several years. And you're right, the thing that allows us to be in this position is that we have built a merchandising expertise in the building that frankly, really just a couple of years ago, we didn't exactly have, not specifically. The goal in the role of merchandising when we bought Kevin Eskridge, who Heads of our merchandising now back from China and gave him that task for us more than a year ago, it has this really position that we think we're ready for it in 2017. And so we're very thoughtful about our existing distribution because the differentiation in the line is critical. Number one, we become more expert at differentiating within channels. So differentiating our existing retailers as well as between within their own partners as well as we look at between the mall, between department stores and between sporting goods. And so we think Kohl's is a great evolution for us. We think that the female consumer that she's there, she's shopping and she's buying, we think there's a big opportunity. But at the end of the day, we think, again, as I said, in my comments, this is a consumer decision, it's not really a channel decision. We believe that there is a massive opportunity with the consumer that's walking into those stores and looking for the Under Armour brand. And frankly, they just haven't been able to find it. And so we think while continue to have elevated product in there. The goal is that from a price point standpoint, we continue -- we'll force to be aggressive, but we think that there's a consumer that's looking for our brand, we think that there's a great market opportunity. And we don't anticipate a big impact to a balance of our other businesses because of the merchandising time and effort and energy that we put them. So we think we ready for this moment, and we're incredibly excited about it. But again, this is just another part -- one of the single chapters in our larger growth story."

When we give door accounts, 11,000 in North America, I think a lot of times, the saturation level a bit of misunderstood with what how we fair against the competition. So we do believe when we talk about North America, we're bullish on North America. We continue to see opportunity and expansion within existing doors, and that's the story that we see, of course, in apparel. But frankly, when we look at things like footwear, we're barely scratching the surface there. So we see really great, great opportunity for us. And as we think about distribution for us across all of our channels, all of our partners, all of our -- everywhere we do business, our job is to be important as an iconic brand. And when I say that, that really speaks, I think, talking about the things we're opening in the future. And again, this might be for a couple of years, but taking over the space, the overall sports phase of 5th Avenue. I think it's definitive that the brand we expect to be for consumers, creating environment that are unique and unlike anything else everyone has ever seen or experienced before. So I think as you think about what defines the brand, our job is to be iconic and the consumer is going to have places where they choose to interact with our brand, where they choose to purchase our brand. Our bit job is to meet them transaction and one thing we know certain we got over the last 12 months or even shorter than is that moment in time, that plays will always be shifting. And so we need to be ready for that, we need to be prepared for that. We certainly don't want to do limit opportunity that we have, and we feel pretty good about the way that we're set up with some of new announcements that we're making today, be it at Kohl's or via talking about something like 5th Avenue. And frankly, not to be forgotten, this is the continue double down that we continue to do in our existing distribution from sporting goods, to mall, to department stores."

I'm not going to say I'm comfortable with the promotion out there in the market today, but I don't but if that's different than what we've seen in the last several years either.

I'm not going to say I'm comfortable with the promotion out there in the market today, but I don't but if that's different than what we've seen in the last several years either. I mean, when you look at holiday these days, it's an incredibly -- it is promotional environment out there. And so what we all have found is the barbell effect continues to really accentuate itself with either going to 1 or 2 extremes. A, the consumer chasing price, and you'll see that with obviously some of the digital pure plays out there or you'll see it with people finding that at retail or they're chasing premium or chasing brand. And so we, of course, expect to be on the right side of that barbell. And I think we've continued to define that for the consumer as to where they find us. I don't think it's a top out, I think there's a shift happening. I think the way the people are addressing this changing, it's altering. So I don't know if it's as extreme as just women's buying black tights and whether people can make a career out of that. And obviously, there's been a lot of people jumping in the both on women's specifically in the athleisure trend. But the good news is that we're not grounded in trend, we're bounded in sport. That will keep us here. The trend will come and go, but we also watching our core base, continue to grow for us as well. We see women's as a burgeoning opportunity for us. And one thing I just want to be clear about our women's business, I think people look and say, are we taking up advantage, are we taking the opportunity? We've done some great things in the Women's space, beginning with the fact that this year, we'll hit a massive milestone. We have $1 billion Women's business. Just the Women's business alone, $1 billion this year. And to be clear, that is primarily women's apparel. So just a few things about our women's is as I mentioned going to the sport category, women's is going to be specifically Kohl's categories and of course, we're going to be involved across the other 9 categories directly. But we need a driver for that. We want a leader for that. So we have -- we had industry veteran, Tim, who have been here for about 6 months and really doing terrific job just coordinating the pieces and applying merchandise and marketing and product and sales and really getting everybody on 1 page. Because what we recognize that we are competing against people that are only in the women's space, there's a big opportunity for us there. And so we feel like we're incredibly well positioned right now. And I mentioned apparel, but I'd be remiss if I just didn't give you a sort of climb into the women's conversation here, just talking about women's footwear. So much of our business is that we are a young business. While we turn 20 this year, and we're incredibly proud of that milestone as a company, we are really just getting started when you look at the things that we're doing. I mean, women's footwear is a great example. And I say this, and I'm not proud of it, but just -- not even 2 years ago, the same person who handles women's for us also handled our outlet merchandising supply as well as our Youth. There's one person. She was incredible and she did amazing herculean job. But if you look at any of our competitors, there's probably 60, 80 to 100 people that would have those 3 collective jobs. So since that time we've actually split them off. Our Women's today, we got roughly half a dozen people in our Women's footwear team. And the fact is that we need about 20. And so we're an investment mode, but what you'll see is that first line from that Women's footwear team, we'll be delivering in spring of '17. So I don't know if people have seen the best stroke from Under Armour yet from a woman standpoint. What we can tell you is we're incredible proud of what the points we put in the board, and that's echoed by the sheer size and scale of that $1 billion Women's business. But what you will see a security continued concerted effort for us to be premium and for us to be #1 in Women's. And we're proud of what we've done, but there's meat on the bone, and we expect to go attack it."

So we feel like we found a really -- it's an interesting model. As you look at the way they do it in China, you're, A, going with a partner, you're  effectively you're running space like a landlord in  a larger department store. So China, for us, is something just recounting some of the history, we spent a long time trying to figure it out. We start manufacturing in 2000, we started selling there in 2010, where we did $1 million, $1.2 million or $1.3 million [ph] out of 1 store. By 2012, that was $3 million and then we really amplified it by I think bringing great senior leadership and really defining a point of view for ourselves in the market. And from $3 million in '12 to $7 million in '13, to $30 million in '14, to $80 million in '15 to this year, we're looking at north of $150 million business. And so, really, we're seeing that inflection point to the brand in China. We have great leadership in the brand over there, we have seasoned leadership on the ground. Our office, our headquarter's in Shanghai. And we think there's a really good momentum. We're going to be following up on some of that momentum. At the end of next month or beginning of September with another Stephen Curry  tour that we'll  be taking through Asia. And really, it's a bigger story than just Stephen. I mean, again, as I said, in my comments, Under Armour is known as the professional brand in China. So granting ourselves as authenticity is one of the formulas in any market we've gone through around the world. We found, really, what is required for us to win.  It's beginning with authentic approach, having the consumers see us, they start really tip of the spear and then really creating a bit of that trickle down. So I think we're getting some of that net effect and then you added some of the star power with some of our global superstars and whether it's -- this month being able to highlight Michael Phelps, whether it is what we're doing with Jordan or Stephen, but the brand is definitely known in China. We're not as famous as we will be, but we're  definitely proud I think of the inroads that we've made big opportunity in putting stores behind it, putting distribution. And the other thing is our E-Commerce over there. Our E-Commerce in China had basically exploded for us as well. And so this is not just bricks-and-mortar story. In fact, China may actually end up being the power that we're able to like the script of what is that balance. Because one of the question so having in the space right now is where some of our competitors specifically, they talk about the power of their growth in terms of number of retail stores. I think that's one indicator for us, but I don't other retail stores will open today are going to be open in the future. And so I know the best ones we'll survive, and we think E-Commerce can be a great supplement to that. And so we're pretty bullish on China, and I'm looking forward to that Stephen Curry tour in a few weeks."

But probably by the middle of '19 at the latest and doing that, they've got someone else is going to go and use the space temporary space for a period of time and then we'll be taking over. So again, I think that, that space for me, it solves a lot of things for the brand. Number one, I think it's a flag in the ground for -- first and foremost, our product teams, putting out there for our teams telling them the way and telling every designer and putting the world on notice and every designer every builder in every product manager that once the build greater products for the corner of Main and Main of -- beyond the United States, but really the world. And so being there at the Central Park, the opening of 5th Avenue, we think it's a great platform to the brand. We'll really going to be able to define ourselves of the company that we expect to be. So there's going to be a lot of imagineering that's going to happen as we look at this. Experiential is going to be at the pinnacle of what we're going to try to create here and really how we drive retail. And we think as we continue to add retail stores, we finished the year with some 400, again, opening over 150 this year, we think that we as we is, whether we like it or not, we are retailers at some level, and we never want that to be competitive with our existing wholesale distribution base, but we think the more excellent we become as retailers, the better wholesale will be as well and and of being manufactured for all of us. And again, driving the idea of iconic, what I said is mix of bold statements in my written remarks about how big I think this idea of the store can be. But effectively, the goal that we have is to build the greater the single greatest retail store in the world. And we know that's big statement with big company, but I think that, that's opportunity that we have and expect to put together an incredible team of people that will help us think through what that means and I think it will really position of the brand, again, in the iconic place where we believe that we belong."

And we're still projecting with 25 quarters note of 20% in a row over 6 years of doing that, we see that trend continuing for us, number one. We do continue to see it project 25% plus growth for the full year. So I just kind of level set that. And if I can just sort of think about how we're looking at the world these days, I think this quarter, it really is -- it's illustrative, I think, of the brand that we've built. The 28% top line growth and if you look at how it's coming for other brands in this market we're incredibly proud of the ability to put that number up. 58% footwear growth, 68% International growth, 19% apparel growth, launching Under Armour sportswear this quarter, extending meaningful distribution by having built out a merchandising bunches that put us in a position to do that, creating statements retail and signing something as ambitious as 5th Avenue that I think will elevate the entire industry in addition to our own brand, and you will see people look and get worried and concerned about what we're going to build their without question. All the way down to the athletes we signed without beating them over the heads of all the first names, from Jordan and Lindsey and Misty, to Andy Murray that won at Wimbledon recently and then anchored by the Cal and UCLA signing. So I think we're firing on all function as a company right now. I think that will look with the tape looks outside. We still expect to be -- if the rising tied with all the other boats and we expect to be one of the highest boats in the room. So from a record standpoint, this is a growth company. It's a reason why I typically start my script with that and end my scripts with that is that we think growth is incredibly important. We have an opportunity to put ourselves and really separate ourselves from any into very exclusive company that puts Under Armour, I think, in the stratosphere of where we belong. But look, it's not God-given. We got to go to work everyday. Hopefully, you see and feel that from our brand, we got an unbelievably committed team that's doing that each and everyday here in Baltimore, in our 26 offices all over the world. And the global expansion that we've been able to enjoy, something that really excited about. We expect to be a global brand. We're proud of what we've been in North America, we're proud of we've done in apparel but things like footwear, things like women's, things like global and International are all going to be hallmarks of what we're defining for Under Armour going forward. So we're just getting started."

One of the challenges that we had being primarily a sporting goods wholesale account, there wasn't a large sporting goods presence in the West Coast. This exception is Sports Authority, which had 63 doors that went away. And so one of the things frankly, even we see in Kohl's as they got over 100 doors in the State of California. So we look at California as an opportunity for us. Again, it is the world's sixth largest economy. And something that we don't feel that we had been aggressive enough on. And so that's why you saw us make 2 very bold bets in terms of a new partnership with Cal and new partnerships with UCLA. And so those are about as certain as things get when you talk about investing in really in the community. And so in Northern and Southern California and one [indiscernible] group, back up, of course, what Stephen Curry is doing there. And then one of our key Connected Fitness officers, Mike Lee, Head of Connected Fitness based out in San Francisco as well got a new 50,000 square-foot office being built there right now also. So we're in a State of California. We do think it's an opportunity for us, but we think it's also -- that is a top market globally and something we think also a bit of a leading board for us as we look to Asia and other markets abroad, too. So we like the opportunity, but again, many of these deals what we made recently were really is a deal about geography as much as anything. We try to accomplish that point. So now we have to prove it out and there's work to be done. So you watch our team run hard."

I'm excited that she has taken this leadership role and I'm pleased to introduce you to those of you in the investment community who you have not yet met. That will change quickly. 
Carrie is the best person to tell the Under Armour story and keep our strong shareholder base informed on our business. Congratulations, again, Carrie, on this new role for you. 
Now good morning, everyone. Under Armour is a growth company. The dictionary defines opportunity as a chance for advancing our success, and the business of sports provides us with abundant moments where our brand can stand apart among our consumers. But there are times, like now, when this power of sport reaches monumental levels, and we find ourselves, right now, in the midst of a 60-day period where sport transcends its normal place in the conversation. 
Starting back in June with the NBA finals, the Copa América and the Euro Champs in Global football, the U.S. and British Opening Golf, the MLB All-Star game and Wimbledon, in a few weeks we'll have the global spectacle of the Summer Olympics. Each of those moments provides opportunities for our consumers to experience the emotion and thrill of sports, and for the Apparel and Footwear we make, to shine on a global stage. Whether it's Stephen Curry receiving his second MVP and being named the first unanimous MVP in the NBA, Andy Murray taking the Wimbledon crown in front of the home crowd in London or Michael Phelps and the U.S. gymnastics team preparing for the Olympic spotlight in Rio next month. These athletes have helped Under Armour achieve a new level of awareness and demand. 
So as we grow within both our core Apparel and Footwear businesses, we've steadily and strategically expanded our distribution to reach more athletes who are demanding our brand. We remain focused on helping the world's elite athletes perform at their very best. 
But our mission is broader, to make all athletes better. So this morning, I want to talk about some of the strategic steps we are taking to reach more athletes in 3 key areas: channels, categories and geographies. 
Our second quarter results are strong evidence that demand for Under Armour has never been higher. Total revenues grew 28%, with our Apparel business, up over 19%; footwear, up 58%; and International, up 68%. Chip is going to take you through the key drivers of those growth numbers in a bit, but I want to map out some of the opportunities we are executing against to widen the playing field in terms of access to our brand. 
We have built our business over the past 20 years through great retail partnerships within the sporting goods channel with partners like DICK'S Sporting Goods and Academy; and in department stores and malls, with partners like Macy's, Foot Locker, Champs and Finish Line. The authenticity we've gained with consumers through those partnerships has helped us become who we are today and positioned us to bring Under Armour to an even broader set of consumers. 
What you'll be seeing over the next 12 to 18 months in terms of expanding that consumer access is part of a measured effort to widen the playing field with each element having been in the works for at least 18 months, and in some cases, even much longer. 
The first adjacency is UAS, Under Armour Sportswear, the first product from the line would be available this September. UAS is not just a category play or distribution play, it's about bringing a new consumer into the Under Armour Brand. 
UAS will bring a young, fresh and modern voice of sportswear, and reflects the insights we've gained as a performance brand now apply to the everyday wardrobe. 
This is not about being on trend or capturing the athleisure market, consumers have the expectation that performance product is not just functional but it's fully executed through fit and style. 
We don't believe that Under Armour technology should be exclusively for on field. We don't see it as an either or thing. UAS is poised from the field and built for life. 
Last month, we announced the hiring of Tim Coppens as Executive Creative Director of UAS. Tim's reputation in the fashion world is compelling with his existing line already carried in premium retail like Barneys. UAS will have a narrow range of distribution available in new premium retail as well as a limited range of boutique doors. 
For UAS as a business is built for the mobile, made up consumer. So while we are partnering with select high-end wholesale partners to showcase a best-in-class expression of the collection, the launch of UAS is predominantly a DTC offering. 
This initiative represents an ambitious step for our brand and provides a great amount of daylight between it and our existing product range. 
The next step in our strategy to reach new consumers is the partnership we're announcing today that'll bring the Under Armour Brand to Kohl's, starting in 2017. 
One of the top retailers of activewear in the U.S., Kohl's has a large and loyal consumer base, the majority of which are women shoppers. 
This decision to reach new consumer through Kohl's is not a channel consideration, but a consumer consideration. We want to reach our consumer where they expect to find Under Armour product. We'll continue to partner with the retailers that provide us the opportunity to showcase the Under Armour Brand. 
Great brands are iconic and inspirational storytellers especially where product meets the consumer. For Under Armour, an important piece of that story is the retail experience we create and drive with our own brand houses. 
Now, I am incredibly excited to announce today the newest location, the former FAO Schwarz space on 5th Avenue, at the base of the GM building in New York City. 
The approximately 53,000 square foot space is one of the most recognized and high-traffic areas in all of New York, and our plan is to build the most breathtaking and exciting consumer experience ever conceived at retail. 
So in addition to using landmark retail space to help tell the Under Armour story, we are equally focused on creating the best mobile shopping experience as the consumer continues to move to device space purchasing. 
Last month, we introduced the UA Shop app. It's a way to better navigate shopping for our products through our Connected Fitness platform. 
With consumer spending 85% of their time on mobile devices in an app, we want to better use the new oil that is data to refine and recommend products based on your activities. We believe this will help drive more frequent shopping, bigger baskets and better conversion throughout the platform. 
Shifting the growth story now from distribution to categories. We've been capturing new basketful consumers almost by the hour with our signature Stephen Curry footwear. Sales of Curry footwear have been extremely strong, and with the Curry Three coming this fall, we're anticipating our business will continue to post incredible growth. 
Many of these new UA consumers are finding the brand in Foot Locker doors, especially at Kids Foot Locker. Not surprising, given Stephen's growing popularity with the younger generation. 
So while the numbers he's putting up for Under Armour are record setting, we continue to be blown away by what Stephen has accomplished, and incredibly excited for what it is come for both of us as a result. 
The third area of powerful growth is in our geographies, and specifically in Greater China. Our team continues to drive great revenue increases, especially in E-Commerce, with year-to-date revenues up 157%. Our growth is driven by consistently being viewed as performance by the Chinese consumer, who actually refers to us as, the professional brand. 
We're accomplishing this through premium brand houses in a full-price business model focused on basketball, running and training. 
Amid increasing support for sport by the government, the Chinese consumer is getting more serious about training. 
Our Women's business in China continues to over deliver against our plan with Women's apparel currently 34% of total apparel revenues, up from 24% just last year, and our Men's and Women's running businesses combined has more than doubled compared to last year. 
And, not surprisingly, Stephen Curry's growing global awareness continues to help drive our business in Greater China. The social media impression for Stephen during the NBA playoffs reached over 2.7 million during that time. It helped drive extremely high sell-through rates in the Curry Two throughout the first 6 months, making it our top selling item in China year-to-date. 
This is a great example of what the opportunity and what the future looks like for UA in Greater China, great product and great marketing that is laser focused on the consumer, combined with the hottest athlete in the NBA. 
We're planning our second tour of China with Stephen later this summer and remain incredibly bullish about the future for both Stephen and our brand. 
One of the key vehicles for our dialogue with consumers is our Connected Fitness platform, and we continue to make great strides in delivering insights that make athletes better. With a growing community, that's now over 175 million registered users, with continuing over 100,000 users signing up each and every day, we're learning more about our consumer every single day. 
Mike Lee, the founder of MyFitnessPal, who joined us in early 2015, is now leading our strategic vision for the Connected Fitness business, and our team is becoming more knowledgeable everyday about our consumer. 
With areas like sales, merchandising and product innovation now utilizing single view of the consumer, we are just getting started at implementing these powerful insights to drive every aspect of our business. 
Some small but important wins for the brand have been our ability to: number one, quickly tailor our communications and content to our consumer based on their activities, giving us the opportunity to tweak our product mix and to get it more precise for the consumer showing up at our stores; secondly, utilizing the data to create a heat map of run activity around our consumers location, just a drop of what's to come in terms of personalization. 
I'd mentioned upfront that this 60-day window of global sports activity culminates next month with the Olympics in Rio. Our presence will be significantly higher than it was in London in 2012, with 4x as many athletes representing national governing bodies for more than 30 different countries competing in Under Armour apparel or footwear, and in some cases, utilizing our great Connected Fitness platform to measure their performance. 
In addition, we sponsored some of the visible icons in Rio like Michael Phelps; recent Wimbledon champ, Andy Murray; and the U.S. gymnastics team. 
We also have a great story in Olympic gold-medal winner, Natasha Hastings, who'll be running the 400 this summer in Under Armour footwear. 
In Europe, we're making some great strides in global football as well, with Tottenham Hotspur qualifying for Champions League play this coming season, and our new sighing, Southampton, who'll be playing Europa League football in their first season in UA Kit next month. 
We also announced that one of England's storied clubs, Aston Villa, will be wearing Under Armour when the season kicks off in August. And we will have another high profile player, Granit Xhaka, in our boots when the EPL season starts. In one of the largest transfers in club history, he joined Arsenal Football Club, and last month went on to lead his national team, Switzerland, to the round of 16 at Euro this year. 
The great news is that our marketing efforts are paying off in the U.K., where revenues more than doubled in Q2 year-over-year. I should add that the U.K. is far away our large market in Europe, so we're driving awareness in the places that move the needle for our business. 
Driving brand awareness where we can benefit most, is a key initiative for us, and here in North America, we've been most challenged, from a regional standpoint, on the West Coast. That's critical for us because if California were a country, they would have the sixth largest GDP in the world, with roughly 12% of the United States population. 
We recently signed 2 sports marketing deals with great iconic brands in key North American geographies, specifically Los Angeles and the Bay Area. Bringing both the UCLA and Cal Berkeley Athletic Programs into the Under Armour family raises the profile in California that we already have through great partners in sporting goods, mall as well exist existing and even new department store partners like Kohl's, which has over 100 stores in California. 
This is a great example of how we are thinking all the way through all the assets that we could bring to bear to get after the opportunity in that very, very key market. 
When we add Cal Berkeley to the existing assets that we already have in the San Francisco area, like Stephen Curry, Buster Posey and one of our Connected Fitness offices with over 100 employees and growing, you can see how we're planning for the long runway of growth that exists for the Under Armour brand. 
And in UCLA, we are partnering with one of the most recognizable brands in college sports, not only the alma mater of the great, Jackie Robinson, but the school with more championships than any other in history of the NCAA. 
UCLA has won a total of 113 national team championships, including 11 in basketball, more than any other school. 
So as you've heard me say consistently for over 10 years now as a public company, Under Armour is a growth company. Now, more than ever, we appreciate the challenge of growth and believe we are well positioned to continue to expand our access to more consumers around the world, and that's what makes us extremely proud of our record of 25 consecutive quarters of 20%-plus revenue growth. 
Fortunately, our formula is well-defined. We will maintain our long-term vision of making all athletes better and continually approve on our execution of strategy around channels, categories and geographies. 
With that, I'll pass it over to Chip. Chip?"

I would now like to spend some time on reviewing our second quarter 2016 financial results, followed by our updated outlook for the remainder of the year. 
Our revenues for the second quarter of 2016 increased 28% to $1 billion as we continue to navigate through the changing dynamics of the retail landscape, the consistent growth across our diverse product lines and channels delivered another quarter of strong results. 
During the second quarter, our wholesale revenues grew 27% to $635 million. Our Direct-to-Consumer revenues grew 28% to $321 million, representing approximately 32% of total revenues for the quarter. 
During the quarter, licensing revenues grew 16% to $21 million, and Connected Fitness revenues grew 73% to $23 million. 
On the product category front, apparel revenues increased 19% to $613 million compared to $515 million in the prior year's quarter, led by many of the same factors as the first quarter, as we continue to see new innovation platforms like Microthread gain momentum in key categories like running as well as continued growth in men's training, women's training and golf. 
Second quarter footwear revenues increased 58% to $243 million from $154 million in the prior year's quarter. 
Our basketball category, led by the Curry signature basketball line, posted another quarter of strong growth. Beyond basketball, we continue to make strong gains in our running and cleated products within our golf and team sports categories as we remained focused on providing premium pinnacle products for our customers in more styles and price points than ever before. 
Our accessories revenues during the second quarter increased 21% to $101 million from $83 million in the prior year's quarter, primarily driven by our new lines of bags and headwear. 
On a regional basis, North American revenues in the second quarter increased 22% to $827 million compared to $681 million during the same period last year. 
Within our direct-to-consumer channel, our North American store count at the end of the quarter included 160 company-owned stores comprised of 146 Factory House stores and 14 Brand House stores. 
International revenues increased 68% to $150 million in the second quarter to reach 15% of total revenues. 
On a currency-neutral basis, International revenues increased 72%. Within our International wholesale business, the store count at the end of the quarter included 239 partner stores. 
Within our Direct-to-Consumer business, our company-owned International store count at the end of the quarter included 52 stores, comprised of 26 Factory House stores and 26 Brand House stores. 
Looking at our International regions, starting with the EMEA. We continue to grow our presence within key sporting goods accounts and expand our direct-to-consumer business with second quarter openings of new Factory House stores in the U.K., Germany and the Netherlands. 
In the Asia Pacific region, we now have more than 230 stores, comprised of both owned and partnered stores, as we look to continue to drive our premium positioning as the performance brand in the market. 
And in Latin America, we remain focused on building and expanding our distribution. 
Moving on to margins. Second quarter gross margin decreased 70 basis points to 47.7% compared to 48.4% in the prior year's period. Sales mix negatively impacted the second quarter by approximately 130 basis points, primarily driven by the continued strength of our footwear and International growth. Partially offsetting this negative impact were continued favorable product margins, benefiting gross margin by approximately 50 basis points. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses grew 32% to $458 million, which includes the previously announced impairment related to The Sports Authority liquidation, compared to $347 million during the second quarter of last year. 
In addition to the impairment, growth was predominantly driven by investments in our Direct-to-Consumer businesses, both retail and E-Commerce, and overall headcount to support our growth and strategic initiatives such as product creation, innovation and sport category management. Marketing expenses grew 20% for the quarter. 
Operating income for the second quarter decreased 39% to $19 million compared with $32 million in the prior year period. The decrease was primarily driven by the $23 million impairment related to the Sports Authority liquidation. 
Interest expense for the second quarter increased to approximately $6 million compared to $4 million in the prior year's period. 
Within other income and expense, we recorded a loss of $3 million versus a slight gain in the prior year period. This loss was primarily driven by foreign currency exchange rates. 
In addition, the company tax rate in the second quarter was 40.5% compared to 46.7% in the prior year, largely due to a onetime tax benefit related to our prior period acquisitions. 
Our second quarter net income decreased 58% to $6 million compared to $15 million in the prior year period. 
In the second quarter, we completed a $59 million onetime stock dividend to our Class C shareholders related to our shareholder litigation, which resulted in a different earnings per share calculation for the quarter for our Class A and B stock as compared to our Class C stock. The dividend was allocated only to our Class C shareholders, resulting in a different numerator when calculating EPS for the Class C stock. Our earnings release included a non-GAAP presentation of EPS backing out the impact of the dividend. This is a onetime event and will only cause a difference in earnings per share for the 3 classes of stock for this quarter and year-end. 
On the balance sheet, total cash and cash equivalents for the quarter was $121 million compared with $171 million at June 30, 2015. Inventory for the quarter increased 30% to $1.1 billion compared to $837 million at June 30, 2015. 
As we noted last quarter, we are beginning to anniversary the strategic inventory investments that we implemented in the second quarter of last year and expect the growth in inventory to remain relatively in line with sales throughout the remainder of the year. 
Total debt increased to $1.2 billion as compared to $712 million at June 30, 2015. 
During the quarter, we completed our first public bond offering of a $600 million investment-grade notes, which was well received in the market. The net proceeds were used to pay down outstanding revolver borrowings. 
Looking at our cash flows. Our investment and capital expenditures was $149 million for the second quarter compared to 9

consumer. 
Now moving on to our guidance for the remainder of 2016. Based on our current visibility, we continue to expect 2016 net revenues of approximately $4.925 billion, representing growth of 24%, and operating income in the range of approximately $440 million to $445 million, representing growth of 8% to 9%. 
Gross margins for the full year are expected to be down slightly compared to last year and based on our outlook of $4.925 billion in revenues, SG&A is still expected to grow approximately 28% as we remain focused on making the right investments today to drive our long term global success. 
Below the operating line, we expect interest expense to increase to approximately $32 million in 2016. 
In addition, we now expect a full year tax rate of approximately 36.5% and fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately $448 million. 
For the third quarter, we expect revenues to grow approximately 20% as we begin to lap our strategies to better service our customers and as we navigate through the impact of the Sports Authority liquidation. 
In addition, we expect our gross margin percentage to decline slightly compared to the prior year. 
For the third quarter, we expect operating income in the range of $180 million to $185 million, representing 5% to 8% growth versus the prior year.

I think people are asking in China to figure out how to wear the brand beyond the pitch, the field, the court. We've just seen that over and over and over, again. And when we look at the market opportunity",658,"Sure. Well first off, we begin with the consumer. I think people are asking in China to figure out how to wear the brand beyond the pitch, the field, the court. We've just seen that over and over and over, again. And when we look at the market opportunity, our 2 competitors claim that their sportswears businesses are somewhere between 20% to 30%. So the aggregate number there is roughly $50 billion. So we assume there's roughly about $15 billion market opportunity that today Under Armour is playing just a few percentage points for overall growth. So we think there's a massive opportunity, there's massive appetite for those in our space to really be effective in sportswear. We also recognize that, I think, there's a shift that's happening in the consumer workplace right now. I don't know how many people in the call have people in their offices that are wearing suits and ties. And so there is this massive shift to casual and comfortable. And I think what we have done to establish our brand is that our shirts aren't just -- they just don't look great, but they actually do something. And so whether it's working, moisture management, stretch, washability, all the things that I think more practical than the way we frankly have dressed ourselves this day. So I think our taking advantage of that opportunity in that shift is very, very important for us. And the way we want to do it is a couple of ways, because what UA sportswear is meant to be is more like, a flag in the ground that plays out there. And we think there's, frankly, a little bit of room for us to fill in overtime between where we're going with that flag and where we are today. And so, it'll be a bit of an evolution. You'll see that, number one, through things that are branded, UAS or sportswear. And you'll also see us being more aggressive with some lines that we have in some of our more proactive and aggressive retailers as well. So the lines you'll see at Foot Locker and things that are more street ready, where as well as things we'll be doing in our traditional sporting goods distribution. So we see styling in the company being more important. Of course, we're not going to give up on what we've done to establish ourselves as authentic and on field, on court, et cetera, but we do see there's an opportunity for us, for kids not just to wear to us when they're playing sports, but then to wear us to school, out at night and other wearing occasions. So getting Tim Coppens on board is a big deal. He is a big deal, and with it we're creating -- we're moving to the sport category focus. We actually have 9 or 10 divisions now, sportswear is going to be one of them, and very important to us headed by a guy named, Ben Pruess, who is an industry veteran and someone who knows how to do it. And this is also answering just the signature athlete lines that we've had. All of a sudden, we woke up one day and we recognize that we had athletes like Stephen and Jordan and Cam and Tom and all these household names, and what are we really doing to leverage this? So we think that there's a bigger opportunity on the signature side. We think there's a specific opportunity in sportswear that we can play in. And we think, a, we can get market share as well as the ability for us to grow that, what we think it's somewhere about a $15 billion pie today as we think about it at least. So we think there is -- we're really excited about it, and frankly, I'm sitting here wearing Under Armour Sportswear today, and I think I look great. So we're working on it."

So we're not just going to start making stylish clothes, but they have to be stylish clothes that do something. You'll see some of these features, whether it's a button down that actually has a sleeve, that has spandex in it, or lap to get it, so you can pull your sleeves up without having to fold them. A bit more ready wear and washability. But everything will have the Under Armour DNA in it, that's most important, whether it is stain resistant or waterproof or some of the other things that you'd expect from us, a little more stylish. You'll see the branding. And I think, what I've challenged the team to do is, lean on the brand when you need to. And the first reaction is that, we don't need the branding anywhere, but I think the consumer -- again, this will be a journey. And as we get there, you'll see the brand. But the UAS will have its own unique distinctive brand and from time to time, particularly in things like the footwear, you'll see some more starting use of the logo. But the logo will be on every piece, just whether it's on the inside of the collar or the outside the collar is bit of a question."

But I want to be clear, as we talk about Kohl's, first and foremost, we have an amazing distribution group of partners that have enabled us to get to this point, and I think we've been incredibly prudent with the way that we've rolled out our distribution. It has been thoughtful, it has been patient, it has been 20 years in the making. And I want everyone to know that, first of all, Kohl's is there's nothing reactionary about Kohl's. This is a proactive move for us that has been in the work for the last several years. And you're right, the thing that allows us to be in this position is that we have built a merchandising expertise in the building that frankly, really just a couple of years ago, we didn't exactly have, not specifically. The goal in the role of merchandising, when we bought Kevin Eskridge, who Heads up our Merchandising, now back from China, and gave him that task for us more than a year ago, it has this -- really in this position that we think we're ready for it in 2017. And so we're very thoughtful about our existing distribution, because the differentiation in the lines is critical. Number one, as we become more expert at differentiating within channels. So differentiating our existing retailers as well as between within their own partners as well as we look at between the mall, between department stores and between sporting goods. And so we think Kohl's is a great evolution for us. We think that the female consumer that she's there, she's shopping and she's buying. We think there's a big opportunity. But at the end of the day, we think, again, as I said in my comments, this is a consumer decision, it's not really a channel decision. We believe that there's a massive opportunity with a consumer that's walking into those stores and looking for the Under Armour brand. And frankly, they just haven't been able to find it. And so we think we'll -- continue to have the elevated product in there. The goal is that, from a price point standpoint, we continue to -- we'll, of course, be aggressive, but we think that there's a consumer that's looking for our brand, and we think there's a great market opportunity. And we don't anticipate a big impact to a balance of our other businesses because of the merchandising time and effort and energy that we've put in. So we think we're ready for this moment, and we're incredibly excited about it. But again, this is just another part -- one of the single chapters in our larger growth story."

When we give door accounts, 11,000 in North America, I think a lot of times, the saturation level is a bit misunderstood with how we fair against their competition. So we do believe -- when we talk about North America, we're bullish on North America. We continue to see opportunity and expansion within existing doors, and that's the story that we see, of course, in apparel. But frankly, when we look at things like footwear, we're barely scratching the surface there. So we see really great, great opportunity for us. And as we think about distribution for us across all of our channels, all of our partners, all of our -- everywhere we do business, our job is to be important as an iconic brand. And when I say that, that really speaks, I think, talking about the things we're opening in the future. And again, this won't be for a couple of years, but taking over the space, the old FAO Schwarz space at 5th Avenue. I think it's definitive about the brand that we expect to be for consumers, creating environments that are unique and unlike anything else that everyone has ever seen or experienced before. So I think as we think about what defines the brand, our job is to be iconic and the consumer is going to have places where they choose to interact with our brand, where they choose to purchase our brand. Our job is to meet them at that transaction, and one thing we know is certain, particularly we've learned over the last 12 months or even shorter than that is that, that moment in time, that place will always be shifting. And so we need to be ready for that, we need to be prepared for that. We certainly don't want to limit opportunity that we have, and we feel pretty good about the way that we're set up with some of new announcements that we're making today and -- be it at Kohl's or if we're talking about something like 5th Avenue. And frankly, not to be forgotten, this is the continued double down that we continue to do in our existing distribution from sporting goods, to mall, to department stores."

I mean, when you look at holiday these days, it's an incredibly -- it is promotional environment out there. And so what we all have found is the barbell effect continues to really accentuate itself with either going to 1 or 2 extremes. Either, a, the consumer chasing price, and you'll see that with obviously some of the digital pure plays out there, or you'll see it with -- or people finding that at retail, or they're chasing premium, they're chasing brand. And so we, of course, expect to be on the right side of that barbell. And I think we've continued to define that for the consumer as to where they would find us. I don't think it's a top out, I think there's a shift happening. I think the way the people are addressing is changing, and it's altering. And so I don't know if it'll be as extreme as just women's buying black tights and whether people can make a career out of that. And obviously, there have been a lot of people jumping in the boat on women's, specifically in the athleisure trend. But the good news is that, we're not grounded in trend, we're grounded in sport. That'll keep us here. And the trends will come and go, but we're also watching our core base continue to grow for us as well. We see women's as a burgeoning opportunity for us. And one thing I just wanted to be clear about our women's business, I think people look and say, are we taking enough advantage, are we taking the opportunity? We've done some great things in the Women's space, beginning with the fact that, that this year, we're going to hit a massive milestone. We have $1 billion Women's business. Just on Women's business alone, $1 billion this year. And to be clear, that is primarily women's apparel. So just a few things about our women's is that, as I mentioned going to the sport category, women's is going to be specifically one of those sport categories, and of course, we'll be involved across the other 9 categories directly. But we need a driver for that. We want a leader for that. So we have had -- we hired industry veteran, Pam Catlett, who has been here for about 6 months, and really doing a terrific job, just coordinating the pieces and applying, merchandising and marketing and product and sales and really getting everybody on one page is, because what we recognize is that we are competing against people that are only in the women's space. There is a bigger opportunity for us there. And so, we feel like we're incredibly well positioned right now. And I mentioned apparel, but I'd be remiss if I just didn't give you a sort of climb into the women's conversation here. Just talking about women's footwear. So much of our business is that, we are a young business. While we turned 20 this year, and we're incredibly proud of that milestone as a company, we are really just getting started when you look at the things that we're doing. I mean, women's footwear is a great example. And I say this, and I'm not proud of it, but just -- not even 2 years ago, the same person who handles women's for us also handled our outlet merchandising supply as well as our Youth. It was 1 person, she was incredible and she did an amazing herculean job. But if you look at any of our competitors, there's probably 60, 80 to 100 people that would have those 3 collective jobs. So since that time, we've actually split them off. Our Women's today, we've got roughly half a dozen people in our Women's footwear team. And the fact is, we need about 20. And so we're in an investment mode, but what you'll see is, that first line from that Women's footwear team, we'll be delivering in spring of '17, and so I don't know if people have seen the best stroke from Under Armour yet from a woman standpoint. But what we can tell you is, we're incredibly proud of what the points we've put on the board, and that's echoed by the sheer size and scale of that $1 billion Women's business. But what you will see is, is you'll see a continued, concerted effort for us to be premium and for us to be #1 in Women's. And we're proud of what we've done, but there's meat on the bone, and we expect to go attack it."

So we feel like we found a really -- it's an",613,"Yes, of course. So China, as we think about the opportunities we have, we've got about -- opening over 150 owned partner stores in 2016 as we look at it. The majority of those are actually going to be in China. So we feel like we found a really -- it's an interesting model. And as you look at the way they do it in China, you're either, a, going with a partner, you're effectively -- you're running space like a landlord in a larger department store. So China, for us, is something -- just recounting some of the history, we spent a long time trying to figure it out. We started manufacturing there in 2000, we started selling there in 2010, where we did $1 million, $1.2 million or $1.3 million out of 1 store. By 2012, that was $3 million, and then we really amplified it by, I think, bringing great senior leadership and really defining a point of view for ourselves in the market. And from $3 million in '12 to $7 million in '13, to $30 million in '14, to $80 million in '15 to this year, we're looking at north of $150 million business. And so, really, we're seeing that inflection point for the brand in China. We have great leadership on the ground over there, we have seasoned leadership on the ground. Our office, our headquarter, is in Shanghai. And we think there's a really good momentum. We're going to be following up on some of that momentum. At the end of next month or in beginning of September with another Stephen Curry tour, that we'll be taking through Asia. And really, it's a bigger story than just Stephen. I mean, again, as I said in my comments, Under Armour is known as, the professional brand in China. So granting ourselves an authenticity is one of the formulas in any market we've gone to around the world. We found where it -- really is required for us to win. It's beginning with that authentic approach, having the consumers see us there, start really at the tip of the spear, and then, really creating a bit of that trickle down. So I think we're getting some of that net effect, and then you add in some of the star power with some of our global superstars, and whether it's -- this month being able to highlight Michael Phelps, whether it is what we're doing with Jordan or Stephen, but the brand is definitely known in China. We're not as famous as we will be, but we're definitely proud, I think, of the inroads that we've made in -- the big opportunity in putting stores behind it, putting distribution. And the other thing is our E-Commerce over there. Our E-Commerce in China has basically exploded for us as well. And so this is not just a bricks-and-mortar story. And frankly, China may actually end up being the pallet that we're able to write the script of what is that balance. Because I think, one of the questions that everybody is having in the space right now is, where -- some of our competitors specifically, they talk about the power of their growth in terms of number of retail stores. I think that's one indicator for us, but I'm not sure that all the retail stores that are open today are going to be open in the future. And so, I know the best ones will survive, and we think that E-Commerce can be a great supplement to that. And so, we're pretty bullish on China, and I'm looking forward to that second Stephen Curry tour in a few weeks."

But probably by the middle of '19 at the latest, in doing that they've got -- someone else is going to go and use the space as temporary space for a period of time and then we'll be taking over. So again, I think that, that space for me, it solves lots of things for the brand. Number one, I think it's a flag in the ground for -- first and foremost, our product teams. Putting out there for our teams, of telling them the way, and telling every designer and putting the world on notice, and every designer and every builder and every product manager that once we build the greatest product for the corner of Main and Main of -- beyond the United States, but really the world. And so being there at the mouth of Central Park, on the opening of 5th Avenue, we think it's a great platform to the brand. We're really going to be able to define ourselves of the company that we expect to be. So there's going to be a lot of imagineering that's going to happen as we look at this, experiential. It's going to be at the pinnacle of what we're going to try to create here, and really, how we drive retail. And we think, as we continue to add retail stores -- we finished the year with some 400, again, opening over 150 this year, we think that as we, it is, whether we like it or not, we are retailers at some level, and we never want that to be competitive with our existing wholesale distribution base, but we think the more excellent we become as retailers, the better wholesale will be as well, and it'll -- that'll end up being a net effect for all of us. And again, driving the idea of iconic. You know, what I've said is -- I made some bold statements in my written remarks about how big I think this idea of the store can be. But effectively, the goal that we have, to build the greater -- the single greatest retail store in the world. And we know that's a big statement with big company. But I think that, that's opportunity that we have and I expect to put together an incredible team of people that will help us think through what that means, and I think it'll really position the brand, again, in the iconic place where we believe that we belong."

But I think the first thing that -- when you just look at the strength of the brand is that, we're not -- the hardest thing is accepting a question that says, ""Tell us about decelerating revenues."" And we're still projecting -- you know we are 25 quarters north of 20% in a row. Over 6 years of doing that, we see that trend continuing for us, number one. We do continue to see it to project 25% plus growth for the full year. So I just kind of want to level set that. And if I can just sort of think about how we're looking at the world these days, I think this quarter, it really is -- it's illustrative, I think, of the brand that we've built. With 28% top line growth, and if you look at how it's coming for other brands in this market, we're incredibly proud of the ability to put that number up. 58% footwear growth, 68% International growth, 19% apparel growth, launching Under Armour sportswear this quarter, expanding meaningful distribution by having built out a merchandising punches that puts us in position to do that, creating statement retail and signing something as ambitious as 5th Avenue, that I think will elevate the entire industry in addition to our own brand, and you will see people look and get worried and concerned about what we're going to build there without question. All the way down to the athletes we've signed and without beating them over the heads of all the first names, from Jordan and Lindsey and Misty, to Andy Murray's win at Wimbledon recently and then, anchored by the Cal and UCLA signing. So I think that we're firing on all functions as a company right now. I think that, regardless of what the tape looks outside, we still expect to be -- is the rising tide that's with all the other boats, and we expect to be one of the highest boats in the room. So from a record standpoint, this is a growth company. It's a reason why I typically start my scripts with that and end my scripts with that, is that we think growth is incredibly important. We have an opportunity to put ourselves and really separate ourselves from many into a very exclusive company that puts Under Armour, I think, in the stratosphere of where we belong. But look, it's not God-given. We got to go to work every day. Hopefully, you see and feel that from our brand. We got an unbelievably committed team that's doing that each and every day here in Baltimore and in our 26 offices all over the world. And the global expansion that we've been able to enjoy, something we're really excited about. We expect to be a global brand. We're proud of what we've done in North America, we're proud of what we've done in apparel, but things like footwear, things like women's, things like global and International are all going to be the hallmarks of what are we defining for Under Armour going forward, So, we're just getting started."

Now one of the challenges that we had being primarily a sporting goods wholesale account, there wasn't a large sporting goods presence in the West Coast.

So we look at California as an opportunity for us. Again, it is the world's sixth largest economy, and something that we don't feel that we had been aggressive enough on. And so that's why you saw us make 2 very bold bets in terms of a new partnership with Cal and a new partnership with UCLA. And so those are about as certain as things get when you talk about investing in, really, in the community. And so, Northern and Southern California in one fell swoop, backed up, of course, with what's Stephen Curry is doing there. And then, one of our key Connected Fitness officers -- where Mike Lee, the Head of Connected Fitness is based out of in San Francisco as well. And we've got a new 50,000 square-foot office being built there right now also. So we're in the State of California. We do think it's an opportunity for us, but we think it's also -- that is a top market globally and something we think is also a bit of a leaping board for us as we look to Asia and other markets abroad, too. So we like the opportunity, but again, many of these deals that we made recently were, really, the deal about geography as much as anything else, and we feel like we accomplished that point. So now we have to prove it out and there's work to be done. So you'll watch our team run hard."

Carrie is the best person to both tell the Under Armour story and keep our strong shareholder base informed on our business. Congratulations, again, Carrie, on this new role for you. 
Now good morning, everyone. Under Armour is a growth company. The dictionary defines opportunity as a chance for advancement or success, and the business of sports provides us with abundant moments where our brand can stand apart among our consumers. But there are times, like now, when this power of sport reaches monumental levels, and we find ourselves, right now, in the midst of a 60-day period where sport transcends its normal place in the conversation. 
Starting back in June with the NBA finals, the Copa América and the Euro Champs in Global football, the U.S. and British Opening Golf, the MLB All-Star game and Wimbledon, in a few weeks we'll have the global spectacle of the Summer Olympics. Each of those moments provides opportunities for our consumers to experience the emotion and thrill of sports, and for the apparel and footwear we make, to shine on a global stage. Whether it's Stephen Curry receiving his second MVP and being named the first unanimous MVP in the NBA, Andy Murray taking the Wimbledon crown in front of the home crowd in London or Michael Phelps and the U.S. gymnastics team preparing for the Olympic spotlight in Rio next month. These athletes have helped Under Armour achieve a new level of awareness and demand. 
So as we grow within both our core Apparel and Footwear businesses, we have steadily and strategically expanded our distribution to reach more athletes who are demanding our brand. We remain focused on helping the world's elite athletes perform at their very best. 
But our mission is broader, to make all athletes better. So this morning, I want to talk about some of the strategic steps we are taking to reach more athletes in 3 key areas: channels, categories and geographies. 
Our second quarter results are strong evidence that demand for Under Armour has never been higher. Total revenues grew 28%, with our Apparel business, up over 19%; footwear, up 58%; and International, up 68%. Chip is going to take you through the key drivers of those growth numbers in a bit, but I want to map out some of the opportunities we are executing against to widen the playing field in terms of access to our brand. 
We have built our business over the past 20 years through great retail partnerships within the sporting goods channel with partners like DICK'S Sporting Goods and Academy; and in department stores and malls, with partners like Macy's, Foot Locker, Champs and Finish Line. The authenticity we've gained with consumers through those partnerships has helped us become who we are today and positioned us to bring Under Armour to an even broader set of consumers. 
What you'll be seeing over the next 12 to 18 months in terms of expanding that consumer access is part of a measured effort to widen the playing field with each element having been in the works for at least 18 months, and in some cases, even much longer. 
The first adjacency is UAS, Under Armour Sportswear, the first products from the line would be available this September. UAS is not just a category play or distribution play, it's about bringing a new consumer into the Under Armour Brand. 
UAS will bring a young, fresh and modern voice of sportswear, and reflects the insights we've gained as a performance brand now apply to the everyday wardrobe. 
This is not about being on trend or capturing the athleisure market, consumers have the expectation that performance product is not just functional but it's fully executed through fit and style. 
We don't believe that Under Armour technology should be exclusively for on field. We don't see it as an either or thing. UAS is poised from the field and built for life. 
Last month, we announced the hiring of Tim Coppens as Executive Creative Director of UAS. Tim's reputation in the fashion world is compelling with his existing line already carried in premium retail like Barneys. UAS will have a narrow range of distribution available in new premium retail as well as a limited range of boutique doors. 
But UAS as a business is built for the mobile-native consumer. So while we are partnering with select high-end wholesale partners to showcase a best-in-class expression of the collection, the launch of UAS is predominantly a DTC offering. 
This initiative represents an ambitious step for our brand and provides a great amount of daylight between it and our existing product range. 
The next step in our strategy to reach new consumers is the partnership we're announcing today that will bring the Under Armour Brand to Kohl's, starting in 2017. 
One of the top retailers of activewear in the U.S., Kohl's has a large and loyal consumer base, the majority of which are women shoppers. 
This decision to reach new consumer through Kohl's is not a channel consideration, but a consumer consideration. We want to reach our consumer where they expect to find Under Armour product. We'll continue to partner with the retailers that provide us the opportunity to showcase the Under Armour Brand. 
Great brands are iconic and inspirational storytellers especially where product meets the consumer. For Under Armour, an important piece of that story is the retail experience we create and drive with our own brand houses. 
Now, I am incredibly excited to announce today the newest location, the former FAO Schwarz space on 5th Avenue, at the base of the GM building in New York City. 
The approximately 53,000 square foot space is one of the most recognized and high-traffic areas in all of New York, and our plan is to build the most breathtaking and exciting consumer experience ever conceived at retail. 
So in addition to using landmark retail space to help tell the Under Armour story, we are equally focused on creating the best mobile shopping experience as the consumer continues to move to device-based purchasing. 
Last month, we introduced the UA Shop app. It's a way to better navigate shopping for our products through our Connected Fitness platform. 
With consumer spending 85% of their time on mobile devices in an app, we want to better use the new oil that is data to refine and recommend products based on your activities. We believe this will help drive more frequent shopping, bigger baskets and better conversion throughout the platform. 
Shifting the growth story now from distribution to categories. We've been capturing new basketful consumers almost by the hour with our signature Stephen Curry footwear. Sales of Curry footwear have been extremely strong, and with the Curry Three coming this fall, we're anticipating our business will continue to post incredible growth. 
Many of these new UA consumers are finding the brand in Foot Locker doors, especially at Kids Foot Locker. Not surprising, given Stephen's growing popularity with the younger generation. 
So while the numbers he is putting up for Under Armour are record setting, we continue to be blown away by what Stephen has accomplished, and incredibly excited for what it is come for both of us as a result. 
The third area of powerful growth is in our geographies, and specifically in Greater China. Our team continues to drive great revenue increases, especially in E-Commerce, with year-to-date revenues up 157%. Our growth is driven by consistently being viewed as performance by the Chinese consumer, who actually refers to us as, the professional brand. 
We're accomplishing this through premium brand houses and a full-price business model focused on basketball, running and training. 
Amid increasing support for sport by the government, the Chinese consumer is getting more serious about training. 
Our Women's business in China continues to over deliver against our plan with Women's apparel currently 34% of total apparel revenues, up from 24% just last year, and our Men's and Women's running businesses combined has more than doubled compared to last year. 
And, not surprisingly, Stephen Curry's growing global awareness continues to help drive our business in Greater China. The social media impressions for Stephen during the NBA playoffs reached over 2.7 million during that time. It helped drive extremely high sell-through rates in the Curry Two throughout the first 6 months, making it our top selling item in China year-to-date. 
This is a great example of what the opportunity and what the future looks like for UA in Greater China, great product and great marketing that is laser focused on the consumer, combined with the hottest athlete in the NBA. 
We're planning our second tour of China with Stephen later this summer and remain incredibly bullish about the future for both Stephen and our brand. 
One of the key vehicles for our dialogue with consumers is our Connected Fitness platform, and we continue to make great strides in delivering insights that make athletes better. With a growing community, that's now over 175 million registered users, with continuing over 100,000 users signing up each and every day, we're learning more about our consumer every single day. 
Mike Lee, the founder of MyFitnessPal, who joined us in early 2015, is now leading our strategic vision for the Connected Fitness business, and our team is becoming more knowledgeable every day about our consumer. 
With areas like sales, merchandising and product innovation now utilizing single view of the consumer, we are just getting started at implementing these powerful insights to drive every aspect of our business. 
Some small but important wins for the brand have been our ability to: number one, quickly tailor our communications and content to our consumer based on their activities, giving us the opportunity to tweak our product mix and to get it more precise for the consumer showing up at our stores; secondly, utilizing the data to create a heat map of run activity around a consumer's location, just a drop of what's to come in terms of personalization. 
I'd mentioned upfront that this 60-day window of global sports activity culminates next month with the Olympics in Rio. Our presence will be significantly higher than it was in London in 2012, with 4x as many athletes representing national governing bodies for more than 30 different countries competing in Under Armour apparel or footwear, and in some cases, utilizing our great Connected Fitness platform to measure their performance. 
In addition, we sponsor some of the visible icons in Rio like Michael Phelps; recent Wimbledon champ, Andy Murray; and the U.S. gymnastics team. 
We also have a great story in Olympic gold-medal winner, Natasha Hastings, who'll be running the 400 this summer in Under Armour footwear. 
In Europe, we're making some great strides in global football as well, with Tottenham Hotspur qualifying for Champions League play this coming season, and our new sighing, Southampton, who'll be playing Europa League football in their first season in UA Kit [ph] next month. 
We also announced that one of England's storied clubs, Aston Villa, will be wearing Under Armour when the season kicks off in August. And we will have another high profile player, Granit Xhaka, in our boots when the EPL season starts. In one of the largest transfers in club history, he joined Arsenal Football Club, and last month went on to lead his national team, Switzerland, to the round of 16 at Euro this year. 
The great news is that our marketing efforts are paying off in the U.K., where revenues more than doubled in Q2 year-over-year. I should add that the U.K. is far and  away our large market in Europe, so we're driving awareness in the places that move the needle for our business. 
Driving brand awareness where we can benefit most, is a key initiative for us, and here in North America we've been most challenged from a regional standpoint on the West Coast. That's critical for us because if California were a country, they would have the sixth largest GDP in the world, with roughly 12% of the United States population. 
We recently signed 2 sports marketing deals with great iconic brands in key North American geographies, specifically Los Angeles and the Bay Area. Bringing both the UCLA and Cal Berkeley Athletic Programs into the Under Armour family raises the profile in California that we already have through great partners in sporting goods, mall, as well exist existing and even new department store partners like Kohl's, which has over 100 stores in California. 
This is a great example of how we are thinking all the way through all the assets that we could bring to bear to get after the opportunity in that very, very key market. 
When we add Cal Berkeley to the existing assets that we already have in the San Francisco area, like Stephen Curry, Buster Posey and one of our Connected Fitness offices with over 100 employees and growing, you can see how we're planning for the long runway of growth that exists for the Under Armour brand. 
And in UCLA, we are partnering with one of the most recognizable brands in college sports, not only the alma mater of the great, Jackie Robinson, but the school with more championships than any other in history of the NCAA. 
UCLA has won a total of 113 national team championships, including 11 in basketball, more than any other school. 
So as you've heard me say consistently for over 10 years now as a public company, Under Armour is a growth company. Now, more than ever, we appreciate the challenge of growth and believe we are well positioned to continue to expand our access to more consumers around the world, and that's what makes us extremely proud of our record of 25 consecutive quarters of 20%-plus revenue growth. 
Fortunately, our formula is well-defined. We will maintain our long-term vision of making all athletes better and continually approve on our execution of strategy around channels, categories and geographies. 
With that, I'll pass it over to Chip. Chip?"

I would now like to spend some time on reviewing our second quarter 2016 financial results, followed by our updated outlook for the remainder of the year. 
Our revenues for the second quarter of 2016 increased 28% to $1 billion as we continue to navigate through the changing dynamics of the retail landscape, the consistent growth across our diverse product lines and channels delivered another quarter of strong results. 
During the second quarter, our wholesale revenues grew 27% to $635 million. Our Direct-to-Consumer revenues grew 28% to $321 million, representing approximately 32% of total revenues for the quarter. 
During the quarter, licensing revenues grew 16% to $21 million, and Connected Fitness revenues grew 73% to $23 million. 
On the product category front, apparel revenues increased 19% to $613 million compared to $515 million in the prior year's quarter, led by many of the same factors as the first quarter, as we continue to see new innovation platforms like Microthread gain momentum in key categories like running as well as continued growth in men's training, women's training and golf. 
Second quarter footwear revenues increased 58% to $243 million from $154 million in the prior year's quarter. 
Our basketball category, led by the Curry signature basketball line, posted another quarter of strong growth. Beyond basketball, we continue to make strong gains in our running and cleated products within our golf and team sports categories as we remained focused on providing premium pinnacle products for our customers in more styles and price points than ever before. 
Our accessories revenues during the second quarter increased 21% to $101 million from $83 million in the prior year's quarter, primarily driven by our new lines of bags and headwear. 
On a regional basis, North American revenues in the second quarter increased 22% to $827 million compared to $681 million during the same period last year. 
Within our direct-to-consumer channel, our North American store count at the end of the quarter included 160 company-owned stores comprised of 146 Factory House stores and 14 Brand House stores. 
International revenues increased 68% to $150 million in the second quarter to reach 15% of total revenues. 
On a currency-neutral basis, International revenues increased 72%. Within our International wholesale business, the store count at the end of the quarter included 239 partner stores. 
Within our Direct-to-Consumer business, our company-owned International store count at the end of the quarter included 52 stores, comprised of 26 Factory House stores and 26 Brand House stores. 
Looking at our International regions, starting with the EMEA. We continue to grow our presence within key sporting goods accounts and expand our direct-to-consumer business with second quarter openings of new Factory House stores in the U.K., Germany and the Netherlands. 
In the Asia Pacific region, we now have more than 230 stores, comprised of both owned and partner stores, as we look to continue to drive our premium positioning as the performance brand in the market. 
And in Latin America, we remain focused on building and expanding our distribution. 
Moving on to margins. Second quarter gross margin decreased 70 basis points to 47.7% compared to 48.4% in the prior year's period. Sales mix negatively impacted the second quarter by approximately 130 basis points, primarily driven by the continued strength of our footwear and International growth. Partially offsetting this negative impact were continued favorable product margins, benefiting gross margin by approximately 50 basis points. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses grew 32% to $458 million, which includes the previously announced impairment related to The Sports Authority liquidation, compared to $347 million during the second quarter of last year. 
In addition to the impairment, growth was predominantly driven by investments in our Direct-to-Consumer businesses, both retail and E-Commerce, and overall headcount to support our growth and strategic initiatives such as product creation, innovation and sport category management. Marketing expenses grew 20% for the quarter. 
Operating income for the second quarter decreased 39% to $19 million compared with $32 million in the prior year period. The decrease was primarily driven by the $23 million impairment related to the Sports Authority liquidation. 
Interest expense for the second quarter increased to approximately $6 million compared to $4 million in the prior year's period. 
Within other income and expense, we recorded a loss of $3 million versus a slight gain in the prior year period. This loss was primarily driven by foreign currency exchange rates. 
In addition, the company tax rate in the second quarter was 40.5% compared to 46.7% in the prior year, largely due to a onetime tax benefit related to our prior period acquisitions. 
Our second quarter net income decreased 58% to $6 million compared to $15 million in the prior year period. 
In the second quarter, we completed a $59 million onetime stock dividend to our Class C shareholders related to our shareholder litigation, which resulted in a different earnings per share calculation for the quarter for our Class A and B stock as compared to our Class C stock. The dividend was allocated only to our Class C shareholders, resulting in a different numerator when calculating EPS for the Class C stock. Our earnings release included a non-GAAP presentation of EPS backing out the impact of the dividend. This is a onetime event and will only cause a difference in earnings per share for the 3 classes of stock for this quarter and year-end. 
On the balance sheet, total cash and cash equivalents for the quarter was $121 million compared with $171 million at June 30, 2015. Inventory for the quarter increased 30% to $1.1 billion compared to $837 million at June 30, 2015. 
As we noted last quarter, we are beginning to anniversary the strategic inventory investments that we implemented in the second quarter of last year and expect the growth in inventory to remain relatively in line with sales throughout the remainder of the year. 
Total debt increased to $1.2 billion as compared to $712 million at June 30, 2015. 
During the quarter, we completed our first public bond offering of a $600 million investment-grade notes, which was well received in the market. The net proceeds were used to pay down outstanding revolver borrowings. 
Looking at our cash flows. Our investment and capital expenditures was $149 million for the second quarter compared to $93 million in the prior year's period. We continue to expect to spend between $450 million and $475 million for the full year, including investments in our global offices around the world, including our headquarters in Baltimore, our distribution centers, our SAP platform and global direct-to-consumer. 
Now moving on to our guidance for the remainder of 2016. Based on our current visibility, we continue to expect 2016 net revenues of approximately $4.925 billion, representing growth of 24%, and operating income in the range of approximately $440 million to $445 million, representing growth of 8% to 9%. 
Gross margins for the full year are expected to be down slightly compared to last year and based on our outlook of $4.925 billion in revenues, SG&A is still expected to grow approximately 28% as we remain focused on making the right investments today to drive our long term global success. 
Below the operating line, we expect interest expense to increase to approximately $32 million in 2016. 
In addition, we now expect a full year tax rate of approximately 36.5% and fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately $448 million. 
For the third quarter, we expect revenues to grow approximately 20% as we begin to lap our strategies to better service our customers and as we navigate through the impact of the Sports Authority liquidation. 
In addition, we expect our gross margin percentage to decline slightly compared to the prior year. 
For the third quarter, we expect operating income in the range of $180 million to $185 million, representing 5% to 8% growth versus the prior year.

I think people were asking and trying to figure out how to wear the brand beyond the pitch, the field, the court. We've just seen that over and over and over, again. And when we look at the market opportunity, our 2 competitors claim that their sportswear businesses are somewhere between 20% to 30%. So the aggregate number there is roughly $50 billion. So we assume there's roughly about $15 billion market opportunity that today Under Armour is playing just a few percentage points for overall growth. So we think there's a massive opportunity, there's massive appetite for those in our space to really be effective in sportswear. We also recognize that, I think, there's a shift that's happening in the consumer workplace right now. I don't know how many people in the call have people in their offices that are wearing suits and ties. And so there is this massive shift to casual and comfortable. And I think what we have done to establish our brand is that our shirts aren't just -- they just don't look great, but they actually do something. And so whether it's wicking, moisture management, stretch, washability, all the things that I think more practical than the way we frankly have dressed ourselves to this day. So I think our taking advantage of that opportunity in that shift is very, very important for us. And the way we want to do it is a couple of ways, because what UA sportswear is meant to be is more like, a flag in the ground that's placed out there. And we think there's, frankly, a little bit of room for us to fill in overtime between where we're going with that flag and where we are today. And so, it'll be a bit of an evolution. You'll see that, number one, through things that are branded, UAS or sportswear. And you'll also see us being more aggressive with some lines that we have in some of our more proactive and aggressive retailers as well. So the lines you'll see us at Foot Locker and things that are more street ready, where as well as things we'll be doing in our traditional sporting goods distribution. So we see styling in the company being more important. Of course, we're not going to give up on what we've done to establish ourselves as authentic and on field, on court, et cetera, but we do see there's an opportunity for us, for kids not just to wear to us when they're playing sports, but then to wear us to school, out at night and other wearing occasions. So getting Tim Coppens on board is a big deal. He is a big deal, and with it we're creating -- as we've moved into the sport category focus -- we actually have 9 or 10 divisions now, sportswear is going to be one of them, and very important to us headed by a guy named, Ben Pruess, who is an industry veteran and someone who knows how to do it. And this is also answering just the signature athlete lines that we've had. All of a sudden, we woke up one day and we recognized that we had athletes like Stephen and Jordan and Cam and Tom and all these household names, and what are we really doing to leverage this? So we think that there's a bigger opportunity on the signature side. We think there's a specific opportunity in sportswear that we can play in. And we think, a, we can get market share as well as the ability for us to grow that, what we think it's somewhere about a $15 billion pie today as we think about it at least. So we think there is -- we're really excited about it, and frankly, I'm sitting here wearing Under Armour Sportswear today, and I think I look great -- or working on it."

A bit more ready wear and washability. But everything will have the Under Armour DNA in it, that's most important, whether it is stain resistance or waterproof or some of the other things that you'd expect from us, a little more stylish. You'll see the branding. And I think, what I've challenged the team to do is, lean on the brand when you need to. And the first reaction is that, we don't need the branding anywhere, but I think the consumer -- again, this will be a journey. And as we get there, you'll see the brand. But the UAS will have its own unique distinctive brand and from time to time, particularly in things like the footwear, you'll see some more stunning use of the logo.

But I want to be clear, as we talk about Kohl's, first and foremost, we have an amazing distribution group of partners that have enabled us to get to this point, and I think we've been incredibly prudent with the way that we've rolled out our distribution. It has been thoughtful, it has been patient, it has been 20 years in the making. And I want everyone to know that, first of all, Kohl's is there's nothing reactionary about Kohl's. This was a proactive move for us that has been in the work for the last several years. And you're right, the thing that allows us to be in this position is that we have built a merchandising expertise in the building that frankly, really just a couple of years ago, we didn't exactly have, not specifically. The goal in the role of merchandising, when we bought Kevin Eskridge, who Heads up our Merchandising now, back from China and gave him that task for us more than a year ago, it has us really in this position that we think we're ready for it in 2017. And so we're very thoughtful about our existing distribution, because the differentiation in the lines is critical. Number one, as we become more expert at differentiating within channels. So differentiating our existing retailers as well as between -- within their own partners as well as we look at between the mall, between department stores and between sporting goods. And so we think Kohl's is a great evolution for us. We think that the female consumer that she's there, she's shopping and she's buying. We think there's a big opportunity. But at the end of the day, we think, again, as I said in my comments, this is a consumer decision, it's not really a channel decision. We believe that there's a massive opportunity with a consumer that's walking into those stores and looking for the Under Armour brand. And frankly, they just haven't been able to find it. And so we think -- we'll continue to have the elevated product in there. The goal is that, from a price point standpoint, we continue to -- we'll, of course, be aggressive, but we think that there's a consumer that's looking for our brand, and we think there's a great market opportunity. And we don't anticipate a big impact to the balance of our other businesses because of the merchandising time and effort and energy that we've put in. So we think we're ready for this moment, and we're incredibly excited about it. But again, this is just another part -- one of the single chapters in our larger growth story."

So we do believe -- when we talk about North America, we're bullish on North America. We continue to see opportunity and expansion within existing doors, and that's the story that we see, of course, in apparel. But frankly, when we look at things like footwear, we're barely scratching the surface there. So we see really great, great opportunity for us.

And again, this won't be for a couple of years, but taking over the space, the old FAO Schwarz space at 5th Avenue. I think it's definitive about the brand that we expect to be for consumers, creating environments that are unique and unlike anything else that everyone has ever seen or experienced before. So I think as we think about what defines the brand, our job is to be iconic and the consumer is going to have places where they choose to interact with our brand, where they choose to purchase our brand. Our job is to meet them at that transaction, and one thing we know is certain, particularly we've learned over the last 12 months or even shorter than that is that, that moment in time, that place will always be shifting. And so we need to be ready for that, we need to be prepared for that. We certainly don't want to limit opportunity that we have, and we feel pretty good about the way that we're set up with some of new announcements that we're making today and -- be it at Kohl's or be it talking about something like 5th Avenue. And frankly, not to be forgotten, this is the continued double down that we continue to do in our existing distribution from sporting goods, to mall, to department stores."

I'm not going to say I'm comfortable with the promotion out there in the market today, but I don't know if it's that different than what we've seen in the last several years either. I mean, when you look at holiday these days, it's an incredibly -- it is promotional environment out there. And so what we all have found is the barbell effect continues to really accentuate itself with either going to 1 or 2 extremes. Either, a, the consumer chasing price, and you'll see that with obviously some of the digital pure plays out there, or you'll see it with -- or people finding that at retail, or they're chasing premium, they're chasing brand. And so we, of course, expect to be on the right side of that barbell. And I think we've continued to define that for the consumer as to where they find us. I don't think it's a top out, I think there's a shift happening. I think the way the people are dressing is changing, and it's altering. And so I don't know if it'll be as extreme as just women's buying black tights and whether people can make a career out of that. And obviously, there have been a lot of people jumping in the boat on women's, specifically in the athleisure trend. But the good news is that we're not grounded in trend, we're grounded in sport. That'll keep us here. And the trends will come and go, but we're also watching our core base continue to grow for us as well. We see women's as a burgeoning opportunity for us. And one thing I just wanted to be clear about our women's business, I think people look and say, are we taking enough advantage, are we taking the opportunity? We've done some great things in the Women's space, beginning with the fact that, that this year, we're going to hit a massive milestone. We have $1 billion Women's business. Just our Women's business alone, $1 billion this year. And to be clear, that is primarily women's apparel. So just a few things about our women's is as I mentioned going to the sport category, women's is going to be specifically one of those sport categories, and of course, we'll be involved across the other 9 categories directly. But we need a driver for that. We want a leader for that. So we have had -- we hired industry veteran, Pam Catlett, who has been here for about 6 months, and really doing a terrific job, just coordinating the pieces and applying, merchandising and marketing and product and sales and really getting everybody on one page is, because what we recognize is that we are competing against people that are only in the women's space. There is a bigger opportunity for us there. And so, we feel like we're incredibly well positioned right now. And I mentioned apparel, but I'd be remiss if I just didn't give you a sort of climb into the women's conversation here. Just talking about women's footwear. So much of our business is that, we are a young business. While we turned 20 this year, and we're incredibly proud of that milestone as a company, we are really just getting started when you look at the things that we're doing. I mean, women's footwear is a great example. And I say this, and I'm not proud of it, but just -- not even 2 years ago, the same person who handles women's for us also handled our outlet merchandising supply as well as our Youth. It was 1 person, she was incredible and she did an amazing Herculean job. But if you look at any of our competitors, there's probably 60, 80 to 100 people that would have those 3 collective jobs. So since that time, we've actually split them off. Our Women's today, we've got roughly half a dozen people in our Women's footwear team. And the fact is, we need about 20. And so we're in investment mode, but what you'll see is, that first line from that Women's footwear team, we'll be delivering in spring of '17, and so I don't know if people have seen the best stroke from Under Armour yet from a women's standpoint. But what we can tell you is, we're incredibly proud of what the points we've put on the board, and that's echoed by the sheer size and scale of that $1 billion Women's business. But what you will see is, is you'll see a continued, concerted effort for us to be premium and for us to be #1 in Women's. And we're proud of what we've done, but there's meat on the bone, and we expect to go attack it."

So we feel like we found a really -- it's an interesting model. And as you look at the way they do it in China, you're either, a, going with a partner, or you're effectively -- you're running space like a landlord in a larger department store. So China, for us, is something -- just recounting some of the history, we spent a long time trying to figure it out. We started manufacturing there in 2000, we started selling there in 2010, where we did $1 million, $1.2 million or $1.3 million out of 1 store. By 2012, that was $3 million, and then we really amplified it by, I think, bringing great senior leadership and really defining a point of view for ourselves in the market. And from $3 million in '12 to $7 million in '13, to $30 million in '14, to $80 million in '15 to this year, we're looking at north of $150 million business. And so, really, we're seeing that inflection point for the brand in China. We have great leadership on the ground over there, we have seasoned leadership on the ground. Our office, our headquarters in Shanghai. And we think there's a really good momentum. We're going to be following up on some of that momentum. At the end of next month or in beginning of September with another Stephen Curry tour, that we'll be taking through Asia. And really, it's a bigger story than just Stephen. I mean, again, as I said in my comments, Under Armour is known as, the professional brand in China. So grounding ourselves an authenticity is one of the formulas in any market we've gone to around the world. We found where it really is required for us to win. It's beginning with that authentic approach, having the consumers see us there, start really at the tip of the spear, and then, really creating a bit of that trickle down. So I think we're getting some of that net effect, and then you add in some of the star power with some of our global superstars, and whether it's -- this month being able to highlight Michael Phelps, whether it is what we're doing with Jordan or Stephen, but the brand is definitely known in China. We're not as famous as we will be, but we're definitely proud, I think, of the inroads that we've made in -- the big opportunity in putting stores behind it, putting distribution. And the other thing is our E-Commerce over there. Our E-Commerce in China has basically exploded for us as well. And so this is not just a bricks-and-mortar story. And frankly, China may actually end up being the palette that we're able to write the script of what is that balance. Because I think, one of the questions that everybody is having in the space right now is, where -- some of our competitors specifically, they talk about the power of their growth in terms of number of retail stores. I think that's one indicator for it, but I'm not sure that all the retail stores that are open today are going to be open in the future. And so, I know the best ones will survive, and we think that E-Commerce can be a great supplement to that. And so, we're pretty bullish on China, and I'm looking forward to that second Stephen Curry tour in a few weeks."

But probably by the middle of '19 at the latest, in doing that they've got -- someone else is going to go and use the space as temporary space for a period of time and then we'll be taking over. So again, I think that, that space for me, it solves lots of things for the brand. Number one, I think it's a flag in the ground for -- first and foremost, our product teams. Putting out there for our teams, of telling them the way, and telling every designer and putting the world on notice, and every designer and every builder and every product manager that wants to build the greatest product for the corner of Main and Main of -- beyond the United States, but really the world. And so being there at the mouth of Central Park, on the opening of 5th Avenue, we think it's a great platform to the brand. We're really going to be able to define ourselves of the company that we expect to be. So there's going to be a lot of imagineering that's going to happen as we look at this. Experiential, it's going to be at the pinnacle of what we're going to try to create here, and really, how we drive retail. And we think, as we continue to add retail stores -- we finished the year with some 400, again, opening over 150 this year, we think that as we, it is, whether we like it or not, we are retailers at some level, and we never want that to be competitive with our existing wholesale distribution base, but we think the more excellent we become as retailers, the better wholesale will be as well. It'll end up being a net effect for all of us. And again, driving the idea of iconic. You know, what I've said is -- I made some bold statements in my written remarks about how big I think this idea of the store can be. But effectively, the goal that we have is to build the greater -- the single greatest retail store in the world. And we know that's a big statement with big company. But I think that, that's opportunity that we have and I expect to put together an incredible team of people that will help us think through what that means, and I think it'll really position the brand, again, in the iconic place where we believe that we belong."

Any other color you can help us to try to think about the shape of -- because I know the next time we hear from you, on the third quarter call, you guys traditionally like to give us the 2017 numbers. So just trying to think about our model for a little bit longer term here."

I think we'll have a much better picture in 90 days, to be clear, to give you guys -- and we want to be as close as possible to that. But I think the first thing that -- when you just look at the strength of the brand is that, we're not -- th",551,"Yes, I know. I think we'll have a much better picture in 90 days, to be clear, to give you guys -- and we want to be as close as possible to that. But I think the first thing that -- when you just look at the strength of the brand is that, we're not -- the hardest thing is accepting a question that says, ""Tell us about decelerating revenues."" And we're still projecting -- you know with 25 quarters north of 20% in a row. Over 6 years of doing that, we see that trend continuing for us, number one. We do continue to see it to project 25% plus growth for the full year. So I just kind of want to level set that. 
And if I can just sort of think about how we're looking at the world these days, I think this quarter, it really is -- it's illustrative, I think, of the brand that we've built. With 28% top line growth, and if you look at how it's coming for other brands in this market, we're incredibly proud of the ability to put that number up. 58% footwear growth, 68% International growth, 19% apparel growth, launching Under Armour sportswear this quarter, expanding meaningful distribution by having built out a merchandising function [ph] that puts us in position to do that, creating statement retail and signing something as ambitious as 5th Avenue, that I think will elevate the entire industry in addition to our own brand, and you will see people look and get worried and concerned about what we're going to build there without question. All the way down to the athletes we've signed and without beating them over the heads of all the first names, from Jordan and Lindsey and Misty, to Andy Murray's win at Wimbledon recently and then, anchored by the Cal and UCLA signing. So I think that we're firing on all functions as a company right now. I think that, regardless of what the tape looks outside, we still expect to be the rising tide that's with all the other boats, and we expect to be one of the highest boats in the room. So from a record standpoint, this is a growth company. It's a reason why I typically start my scripts with that and end my scripts with that, is that we think growth is incredibly important. We have an opportunity to put ourselves and really separate ourselves from many into a very exclusive company that puts Under Armour, I think, in the stratosphere of where we belong. But look, it's not God-given. We got to go to work every day. Hopefully, you see and feel that from our brand. We got an unbelievably committed team that's doing that each and every day here in Baltimore and in our 26 offices all over the world. And the global expansion that we've been able to enjoy is something we're really excited about. We expect to be a global brand. We're proud of what we've done in North America, we're proud of what we've done in apparel, but things like footwear, things like women's, things like global and International are all going to be the hallmarks of what are we defining for Under Armour going forward, So, we're just getting started."

I think sportswear is a much important category on the West Coast. Have you guys -- is there -- I mean, can you help us think about how big of an opportunity that is, if I'm still right that that's an opportunity from the mapping analysis and stuff from a few years ago.

You know one of the challenges that we had being primarily a sporting goods wholesale account, there wasn't a large sporting goods presence in the West Coast. The exception is Sports Authority, which had 63 doors that went away. And so, one of the things, frankly that, even we see in Kohl's is they've got over 100 doors in the State of California. So we look at California as an opportunity for us. Again, it is the world's sixth largest economy, and something that we don't feel that we had been aggressive enough on. And so that's why you saw us make 2 very bold bets in terms of a new partnership with Cal and a new partnership with UCLA. And so those are about as certain as things get when you talk about investing in, really, in the community. And so, Northern and Southern California in one fell swoop, backed up, of course, with what's Stephen Curry is doing there. And then, one of our key Connected Fitness offices, where Mike Lee, the Head of Connected Fitness is based out of, in San Francisco as well. And we've got a new 50,000 square-foot office being built there right now also. So we're in the State of California. We do think it's an opportunity for us, but we think it's also -- that is a top market globally and something we think is also a bit of a leaping board for us as we look to Asia and other markets abroad, too. So we like the opportunity, but again, many of these deals that we made recently were, really, the deal about geography as much as anything else, and we feel like we accomplished that point. So now we have to prove it out and there's work to be done. So you'll watch our team run hard."

I'm excited that she has taken this leadership role and am pleased to introduce you to those of you in the investment community who you have not yet met. That will change quickly. 
Carrie is the best person to both tell the Under Armour story and keep our strong shareholder base informed on our business. Congratulations, again, Carrie, on this new role for you. 
Now good morning, everyone. Under Armour is a growth company. The dictionary defines opportunity as a chance for advancement or success, and the business of sports provides us with abundant moments where our brand can stand apart among our consumers. But there are times, like now, when this power of sport reaches monumental levels, and we find ourselves, right now, in the midst of a 60-day period where sport transcends its normal place in the conversation. 
Starting back in June with the NBA finals, the Copa América and the Euro Champs in Global football, the U.S. and British Opening Golf, the MLB All-Star game and Wimbledon, in a few weeks we'll have the global spectacle of the Summer Olympics. Each of those moments provides opportunities for our consumers to experience the emotion and thrill of sports, and for the apparel and footwear we make, to shine on a global stage. Whether it's Stephen Curry receiving his second MVP and being named the first unanimous MVP in the NBA, Andy Murray taking the Wimbledon crown in front of the home crowd in London or Michael Phelps and the U.S. gymnastics team preparing for the Olympic spotlight in Rio next month. These athletes have helped Under Armour achieve a new level of awareness and demand. 
So as we grow within both our core Apparel and Footwear businesses, we have steadily and strategically expanded our distribution to reach more athletes who are demanding our brand. We remain focused on helping the world's elite athletes perform at their very best. 
But our mission is broader, to make all athletes better. So this morning, I want to talk about some of the strategic steps we are taking to reach more athletes in 3 key areas: channels, categories and geographies. 
Our second quarter results are strong evidence that demand for Under Armour has never been higher. Total revenues grew 28%, with our Apparel business, up over 19%; footwear, up 58%; and International, up 68%. Chip is going to take you through the key drivers of those growth numbers in a bit, but I want to map out some of the opportunities we are executing against to widen the playing field in terms of access to our brand. 
We have built our business over the past 20 years through great retail partnerships within the sporting goods channel with partners like DICK'S Sporting Goods and Academy; and in department stores and malls, with partners like Macy's, Foot Locker, Champs and Finish Line. The authenticity we've gained with consumers through those partnerships has helped us become who we are today and positioned us to bring Under Armour to an even broader set of consumers. 
What you'll be seeing over the next 12 to 18 months in terms of expanding that consumer access is part of a measured effort to widen the playing field with each element having been in the works for at least 18 months, and in some cases, even much longer. 
The first adjacency is UAS, Under Armour Sportswear, the first products from the line would be available this September. UAS is not just a category play or distribution play, it's about bringing a new consumer into the Under Armour Brand. 
UAS will bring a young, fresh and modern voice of sportswear, and reflects the insights we've gained as a performance brand now apply to the everyday wardrobe. 
This is not about being on trend or capturing the athleisure market, consumers have the expectation that performance product is not just functional but it's fully executed through fit and style. 
We don't believe that Under Armour technology should be exclusively for on field. We don't see it as an either or thing. UAS is poised from the field and built for life. 
Last month, we announced the hiring of Tim Coppens as Executive Creative Director of UAS. Tim's reputation in the fashion world is compelling with his existing line already carried in premium retail like Barneys. UAS will have a narrow range of distribution available in new premium retail as well as a limited range of boutique doors. 
But UAS as a business is built for the mobile-native consumer. So while we are partnering with select high-end wholesale partners to showcase a best-in-class expression of the collection, the launch of UAS is predominantly a DTC offering. 
This initiative represents an ambitious step for our brand and provides a great amount of daylight between it and our existing product range. 
The next step in our strategy to reach new consumers is the partnership we're announcing today that will bring the Under Armour Brand to Kohl's, starting in 2017. 
One of the top retailers of activewear in the U.S., Kohl's has a large and loyal consumer base, the majority of which are women shoppers. 
This decision to reach new consumer through Kohl's is not a channel consideration, but a consumer consideration. We want to reach our consumer where they expect to find Under Armour product. We'll continue to partner with the retailers that provide us the opportunity to showcase the Under Armour Brand. 
Great brands are iconic and inspirational storytellers especially where product meets the consumer. For Under Armour, an important piece of that story is the retail experience we create and drive with our own brand houses. 
Now I am incredibly excited to announce today the newest location, the former FAO Schwarz space on 5th Avenue, at the base of the GM building in New York City. 
The approximately 53,000 square foot space is one of the most recognized and high-traffic areas in all of New York, and our plan is to build the most breathtaking and exciting consumer experience ever conceived at retail. 
So in addition to using landmark retail space to help tell the Under Armour story, we are equally focused on creating the best mobile shopping experience as the consumer continues to move to device-based purchasing. 
Last month, we introduced the UA Shop app. It's a way to better navigate shopping for our products through our Connected Fitness platform. 
With consumer spending 85% of their time on mobile devices in an app, we want to better use the new oil that is data to refine and recommend products based on your activities. We believe this will help drive more frequent shopping, bigger baskets and better conversion throughout the platform. 
Shifting the growth story now from distribution to categories. We've been capturing new basketful consumers almost by the hour with our signature Stephen Curry footwear. Sales of Curry footwear have been extremely strong, and with the Curry Three coming this fall, we're anticipating our business will continue to post incredible growth. 
Many of these new UA consumers are finding the brand in Foot Locker doors, especially at Kids Foot Locker. Not surprising, given Stephen's growing popularity with the younger generation. 
So while the numbers he is putting up for Under Armour are record setting, we continue to be blown away by what Stephen has accomplished, and incredibly excited for what it is come for both of us as a result. 
The third area of powerful growth is in our geographies, and specifically in Greater China. Our team continues to drive great revenue increases, especially in E-Commerce, with year-to-date revenues up 157%. Our growth is driven by consistently being viewed as performance by the Chinese consumer, who actually refers to us as, the professional brand. 
We're accomplishing this through premium brand houses and a full-price business model focused on basketball, running and training. 
Amid increasing support for sport by the government, the Chinese consumer is getting more serious about training. 
Our Women's business in China continues to over deliver against our plan with Women's apparel currently 34% of total apparel revenues, up from 24% just last year, and our Men's and Women's running businesses combined has more than doubled compared to last year. 
And not surprisingly, Stephen Curry's growing global awareness continues to help drive our business in Greater China. The social media impressions for Stephen during the NBA playoffs reached over 2.7 million during that time. It helped drive extremely high sell-through rates in the Curry Two throughout the first 6 months, making it our top selling item in China year-to-date. 
This is a great example of what the opportunity and what the future looks like for UA in Greater China, great product and great marketing that is laser focused on the consumer, combined with the hottest athlete in the NBA. 
We're planning our second tour of China with Stephen later this summer and remain incredibly bullish about the future for both Stephen and our brand. 
One of the key vehicles for our dialogue with consumers is our Connected Fitness platform, and we continue to make great strides in delivering insights that make athletes better. With a growing community, that's now over 175 million registered users, with continuing over 100,000 users signing up each and every day, we're learning more about our consumer every single day. 
Mike Lee, the founder of MyFitnessPal, who joined us in early 2015, is now leading our strategic vision for the Connected Fitness business, and our team is becoming more knowledgeable every day about our consumer. 
With areas like sales, merchandising and product innovation now utilizing single view of the consumer, we are just getting started at implementing these powerful insights to drive every aspect of our business. 
Some small but important wins for the brand have been our ability to: number one, quickly tailor our communications and content to our consumer based on their activities, giving us the opportunity to tweak our product mix and to get it more precise for the consumer showing up at our stores; secondly, utilizing the data to create a heat map of run activity around a consumer's location, just a drop of what's to come in terms of personalization. 
I'd mentioned upfront that this 60-day window of global sports activity culminates next month with the Olympics in Rio. Our presence will be significantly higher than it was in London in 2012, with 4x as many athletes representing national governing bodies for more than 30 different countries competing in Under Armour apparel or footwear, and in some cases, utilizing our great Connected Fitness platform to measure their performance. 
In addition, we sponsor some of the visible icons in Rio like Michael Phelps; recent Wimbledon champ, Andy Murray; and the U.S. gymnastics team. 
We also have a great story in Olympic gold-medal winner, Natasha Hastings, who'll be running the 400 this summer in Under Armour footwear. 
In Europe, we're making some great strides in global football as well, with Tottenham Hotspur qualifying for Champions League play this coming season, and our new sighing, Southampton, who'll be playing Europa League football in their first season in UA Kit [ph] next month. 
We also announced that one of England's storied clubs, Aston Villa, will be wearing Under Armour when the season kicks off in August. And we will have another high profile player, Granit Xhaka, in our boots when the EPL season starts. In one of the largest transfers in club history, he joined Arsenal Football Club, and last month went on to lead his national team, Switzerland, to the round of 16 at Euro this year. 
The great news is that our marketing efforts are paying off in the U.K., where revenues more than doubled in Q2 year-over-year. I should add that the U.K. is far and away our large market in Europe, so we're driving awareness in the places that move the needle for our business. 
Driving brand awareness where we can benefit most, is a key initiative for us, and here in North America we've been most challenged from a regional standpoint on the West Coast. That's critical for us because if California were a country, they would have the sixth largest GDP in the world, with roughly 12% of the United States population. 
We recently signed 2 sports marketing deals with great iconic brands in key North American geographies, specifically Los Angeles and the Bay Area. Bringing both the UCLA and Cal Berkeley Athletic Programs into the Under Armour family raises the profile in California that we already have through great partners in sporting goods, mall, as well exist existing and even new department store partners like Kohl's, which has over 100 stores in California. 
This is a great example of how we are thinking all the way through all the assets that we could bring to bear to get after the opportunity in that very, very key market. 
When we add Cal Berkeley to the existing assets that we already have in the San Francisco area, like Stephen Curry, Buster Posey and one of our Connected Fitness offices with over 100 employees and growing, you can see how we're planning for the long runway of growth that exists for the Under Armour brand. 
And in UCLA, we are partnering with one of the most recognizable brands in college sports, not only the alma mater of the great, Jackie Robinson, but the school with more championships than any other in history of the NCAA. 
UCLA has won a total of 113 national team championships, including 11 in basketball, more than any other school. 
So as you've heard me say consistently for over 10 years now as a public company, Under Armour is a growth company. Now more than ever, we appreciate the challenge of growth and believe we are well positioned to continue to expand our access to more consumers around the world, and that's what makes us extremely proud of our record of 25 consecutive quarters of 20%-plus revenue growth. 
Fortunately, our formula is well-defined. We will maintain our long-term vision of making all athletes better and continually approve on our execution of strategy around channels, categories and geographies. 
With that, I'll pass it over to Chip. Chip?"

I would now like to spend some time on reviewing our second quarter 2016 financial results, followed by our updated outlook for the remainder of the year. 
Our revenues for the second quarter of 2016 increased 28% to $1 billion as we continue to navigate through the changing dynamics of the retail landscape, the consistent growth across our diverse product lines and channels delivered another quarter of strong results. 
During the second quarter, our wholesale revenues grew 27% to $635 million. Our Direct-to-Consumer revenues grew 28% to $321 million, representing approximately 32% of total revenues for the quarter. 
During the quarter, licensing revenues grew 16% to $21 million, and Connected Fitness revenues grew 73% to $23 million. 
On the product category front, apparel revenues increased 19% to $613 million compared to $515 million in the prior year's quarter, led by many of the same factors as the first quarter, as we continue to see new innovation platforms like Microthread gain momentum in key categories like running as well as continued growth in men's training, women's training and golf. 
Second quarter footwear revenues increased 58% to $243 million from $154 million in the prior year's quarter. 
Our basketball category, led by the Curry signature basketball line, posted another quarter of strong growth. Beyond basketball, we continue to make strong gains in our running and cleated products within our golf and team sports categories as we remained focused on providing premium pinnacle products for our customers in more styles and price points than ever before. 
Our accessories revenues during the second quarter increased 21% to $101 million from $83 million in the prior year's quarter, primarily driven by our new lines of bags and headwear. 
On a regional basis, North American revenues in the second quarter increased 22% to $827 million compared to $681 million during the same period last year. 
Within our direct-to-consumer channel, our North American store count at the end of the quarter included 160 company-owned stores comprised of 146 Factory House stores and 14 Brand House stores. 
International revenues increased 68% to $150 million in the second quarter to reach 15% of total revenues. 
On a currency-neutral basis, International revenues increased 72%. Within our International wholesale business, the store count at the end of the quarter included 239 partner stores. 
Within our Direct-to-Consumer business, our company-owned International store count at the end of the quarter included 52 stores, comprised of 26 Factory House stores and 26 Brand House stores. 
Looking at our International regions, starting with the EMEA. We continue to grow our presence within key sporting goods accounts and expand our direct-to-consumer business with second quarter openings of new Factory House stores in the U.K., Germany and the Netherlands. 
In the Asia Pacific region, we now have more than 230 stores, comprised of both owned and partner stores, as we look to continue to drive our premium positioning as the performance brand in the market. 
And in Latin America, we remain focused on building and expanding our distribution. 
Moving on to margins. Second quarter gross margin decreased 70 basis points to 47.7% compared to 48.4% in the prior year's period. Sales mix negatively impacted the second quarter by approximately 130 basis points, primarily driven by the continued strength of our footwear and International growth. Partially offsetting this negative impact were continued favorable product margins, benefiting gross margin by approximately 50 basis points. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses grew 32% to $458 million, which includes the previously announced impairment related to The Sports Authority liquidation, compared to $347 million during the second quarter of last year. 
In addition to the impairment, growth was predominantly driven by investments in our Direct-to-Consumer businesses, both retail and E-Commerce, and overall headcount to support our growth and strategic initiatives such as product creation, innovation and sport category management. Marketing expenses grew 20% for the quarter. 
Operating income for the second quarter decreased 39% to $19 million compared with $32 million in the prior year period. The decrease was primarily driven by the $23 million impairment related to the Sports Authority liquidation. 
Interest expense for the second quarter increased to approximately $6 million compared to $4 million in the prior year's period. 
Within other income and expense, we recorded a loss of $3 million versus a slight gain in the prior year period. This loss was primarily driven by foreign currency exchange rates. 
In addition, the company tax rate in the second quarter was 40.5% compared to 46.7% in the prior year, largely due to a onetime tax benefit related to our prior period acquisitions. 
Our second quarter net income decreased 58% to $6 million compared to $15 million in the prior year period. 
In the second quarter, we completed a $59 million onetime stock dividend to our Class C shareholders related to our shareholder litigation, which resulted in a different earnings per share calculation for the quarter for our Class A and B stock as compared to our Class C stock. The dividend was allocated only to our Class C shareholders, resulting in a different numerator when calculating EPS for the Class C stock. Our earnings release included a non-GAAP presentation of EPS backing out the impact of the dividend. This is a onetime event and will only cause a difference in earnings per share for the 3 classes of stock for this quarter and year-end. 
On the balance sheet, total cash and cash equivalents for the quarter was $121 million compared with $171 million at June 30, 2015. Inventory for the quarter increased 30% to $1.1 billion compared to $837 million at June 30, 2015. 
As we noted last quarter, we are beginning to anniversary the strategic inventory investments that we implemented in the second quarter of last year and expect the growth in inventory to remain relatively in line with sales throughout the remainder of the year. 
Total debt increased to $1.2 billion as compared to $712 million at June 30, 2015. 
During the quarter, we completed our first public bond offering of a $600 million investment-grade notes, which was well received in the market. The net proceeds were used to pay down outstanding revolver borrowings. 
Looking at our cash flows. Our investment and capital expenditures was $149 million for the second quarter compared to $93 million in the prior year's period. We continue to expect to spend between $450 million and $475 million for the full year, including investments in our global offices around the world, including our headquarters in Baltimore, our distribution centers, our SAP platform and global direct-to-consumer. 
Now moving on to our guidance for the remainder of 2016. Based on our current visibility, we continue to expect 2016 net revenues of approximately $4.925 billion, representing growth of 24%, and operating income in the range of approximately $440 million to $445 million, representing growth of 8% to 9%. 
Gross margins for the full year are expected to be down slightly compared to last year and based on our outlook of $4.925 billion in revenues, SG&A is still expected to grow approximately 28% as we remain focused on making the right investments today to drive our long term global success. 
Below the operating line, we expect interest expense to increase to approximately $32 million in 2016. 
In addition, we now expect a full year tax rate of approximately 36.5% and fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately $448 million. 
For the third quarter, we expect revenues to grow approximately 20% as we begin to lap our strategies to better service our customers and as we navigate through the impact of the Sports Authority liquidation. 
In addition, we expect our gross margin percentage to decline slightly compared to the prior year. 
For the third quarter, we expect operating income in the range of $180 million to $185 million, representing 5% to 8% growth versus the prior year. 
We'd now like to open the call for your questions. Similar to our last earnings call, Dave Bergman, our SVP of Corporate Finance, will be joining us this morning to provide additional assistance with your questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator?"

I think people were asking and trying to figure out how to wear the brand beyond the pitch, the field, the court. We've just seen that over and over and over, again. And when we look at the market opportunity, our 2 competitors claim that their sportswear businesses are somewhere between 20% to 30%. So the aggregate number there is roughly $50 billion. So we assume there's roughly about $15 billion market opportunity that today Under Armour is playing just a few percentage points for overall growth. So we think there's a massive opportunity, there's massive appetite for those in our space to really be effective in sportswear. We also recognize that, I think, there's a shift that's happening in the consumer workplace right now. I don't know how many people in the call have people in their offices that are wearing suits and ties. And so there is this massive shift to casual and comfortable. And I think what we have done to establish our brand is that our shirts aren't just -- they just don't look great, but they actually do something. And so whether it's wicking, moisture management, stretch, washability, all the things that I think more practical than the way we frankly have dressed ourselves to this day. So I think our taking advantage of that opportunity in that shift is very, very important for us. And the way we want to do it is a couple of ways, because what UA sportswear is meant to be is more like, a flag in the ground that's placed out there. And we think there's, frankly, a little bit of room for us to fill in overtime between where we're going with that flag and where we are today. And so it'll be a bit of an evolution. You'll see that, number one, through things that are branded, UAS or sportswear. And you'll also see us being more aggressive with some lines that we have in some of our more proactive and aggressive retailers as well. So the lines you'll see us at Foot Locker and things that are more street ready, where as well as things we'll be doing in our traditional sporting goods distribution. So we see styling in the company being more important. Of course, we're not going to give up on what we've done to establish ourselves as authentic and on field, on court, et cetera, but we do see there's an opportunity for us, for kids not just to wear to us when they're playing sports, but then to wear us to school, out at night and other wearing occasions. So getting Tim Coppens on board is a big deal. He is a big deal, and with it we're creating -- as we've moved into the sport category focus -- we actually have 9 or 10 divisions now, sportswear is going to be one of them, and very important to us headed by a guy named, Ben Pruess, who is an industry veteran and someone who knows how to do it. And this is also answering just the signature athlete lines that we've had. All of a sudden, we woke up one day and we recognized that we had athletes like Stephen and Jordan and Cam and Tom and all these household names, and what are we really doing to leverage this? So we think that there's a bigger opportunity on the signature side. We think there's a specific opportunity in sportswear that we can play in. And we think, a, we can get market share as well as the ability for us to grow that, what we think it's somewhere about a $15 billion pie today as we think about it at least. So we think there is -- we're really excited about it, and frankly, I'm sitting here wearing Under Armour Sportswear today, and I think I look great -- or working on it."

You'll see some of these features, whether it's a button down that actually has a sleeve, that has spandex in it, or elastic in it, so you can pull your sleeves up without having to fold them. A bit more ready wear and washability. But everything will have the Under Armour DNA in it, that's most important, whether it is stain resistance or waterproof or some of the other things that you'd expect from us, a little more stylish. You'll see the branding. And I think, what I've challenged the team to do is, lean on the brand when you need to. And the first reaction is that, we don't need the branding anywhere, but I think the consumer -- again, this will be a journey. And as we get there, you'll see the brand. But the UAS will have its own unique distinctive brand and from time to time, particularly in things like the footwear, you'll see some more stunning use of the logo. But the logo will be on every piece, just whether it's on the inside of the collar or the outside the collar is bit of a question."

But I want to be clear, as we talk about Kohl's, first and foremost, we have an amazing distribution group of partners that have enabled us to get to this point, and I think we've been incredibly prudent with the way that we've rolled out our distribution. It has been thoughtful, it has been patient, it has been 20 years in the making. And I want everyone to know that, first of all, Kohl's is there's nothing reactionary about Kohl's. This was a proactive move for us that has been in the work for the last several years. And you're right, the thing that allows us to be in this position is that we have built a merchandising expertise in the building that frankly, really just a couple of years ago, we didn't exactly have, not specifically. The goal in the role of merchandising, when we bought Kevin Eskridge, who Heads up our Merchandising now, back from China and gave him that task for us more than a year ago, it has us really in this position that we think we're ready for it in 2017. And so we're very thoughtful about our existing distribution, because the differentiation in the lines is critical. Number one, as we become more expert at differentiating within channels. So differentiating our existing retailers as well as between -- within their own partners as well as we look at between the mall, between department stores and between sporting goods. And so we think Kohl's is a great evolution for us. We think that the female consumer that she's there, she's shopping and she's buying. We think there's a big opportunity. But at the end of the day, we think, again, as I said in my comments, this is a consumer decision, it's not really a channel decision. We believe that there's a massive opportunity with a consumer that's walking into those stores and looking for the Under Armour brand. And frankly, they just haven't been able to find it. And so we think -- we'll continue to have the elevated product in there. The goal is that, from a price point standpoint, we continue to -- we'll, of course, be aggressive, but we think that there's a consumer that's looking for our brand, and we think there's a great market opportunity. And we don't anticipate a big impact to the balance of our other businesses because of the merchandising time and effort and energy that we've put in. So we think we're ready for this moment, and we're incredibly excited about it. But again, this is just another part -- one of the single chapters in our larger growth story."

When we give door counts, 11,000 in North America, I think a lot of times the saturation level is a bit misunderstood with how we fair against, say, our competition. So we do believe -- when we talk about North America, we're bullish on North America. We continue to see opportunity and expansion within existing doors, and that's the story that we see, of course, in apparel. But frankly, when we look at things like footwear, we're barely scratching the surface there. So we see really great, great opportunity for us. And as we think about distribution for us across all of our channels, all of our partners, all of our -- everywhere we do business, our job is to be important as an iconic brand. And when I say that, that really speaks, I think, talking about the things we're opening in the future. And again, this won't be for a couple of years, but taking over the space, the old FAO Schwarz space at 5th Avenue. I think it's definitive about the brand that we expect to be for consumers, creating environments that are unique and unlike anything else that everyone has ever seen or experienced before. So I think as we think about what defines the brand, our job is to be iconic and the consumer is going to have places where they choose to interact with our brand, where they choose to purchase our brand. Our job is to meet them at that transaction, and one thing we know is certain, particularly we've learned over the last 12 months or even shorter than that is that, that moment in time, that place will always be shifting. And so we need to be ready for that, we need to be prepared for that. We certainly don't want to limit opportunity that we have, and we feel pretty good about the way that we're set up with some of new announcements that we're making today and -- be it at Kohl's or be it talking about something like 5th Avenue. And frankly, not to be forgotten, this is the continued double down that we continue to do in our existing distribution from sporting goods, to mall, to department stores."

I mean, when you look at holiday these days, it's an incredibly -- it is promotional environment out there. And so what we all have found is the barbell effect continues to really accentuate itself with either going to 1 or 2 extremes. Either, a, the consumer chasing price, and you'll see that with obviously some of the digital pure plays out there, or you'll see it with -- or people finding that at retail, or they're chasing premium, they're chasing brand. And so we, of course, expect to be on the right side of that barbell. And I think we've continued to define that for the consumer as to where they find us. I don't think it's a top out, I think there's a shift happening. I think the way the people are dressing is changing, and it's altering. And so I don't know if it'll be as extreme as just women's buying black tights and whether people can make a career out of that. And obviously, there have been a lot of people jumping in the boat on women's, specifically in the athleisure trend. But the good news is that we're not grounded in trend, we're grounded in sport. That'll keep us here. And the trends will come and go, but we're also watching our core base continue to grow for us as well. We see women's as a burgeoning opportunity for us. And one thing I just wanted to be clear about our women's business, I think people look and say, are we taking enough advantage, are we taking the opportunity? We've done some great things in the Women's space, beginning with the fact that, that this year, we're going to hit a massive milestone. We have $1 billion Women's business. Just our Women's business alone, $1 billion this year. And to be clear, that is primarily women's apparel. So just a few things about our women's is as I mentioned going to the sport category, women's is going to be specifically one of those sport categories, and of course, we'll be involved across the other 9 categories directly. But we need a driver for that. We want a leader for that. So we have had -- we hired industry veteran, Pam Catlett, who has been here for about 6 months, and really doing a terrific job, just coordinating the pieces and applying, merchandising and marketing and product and sales and really getting everybody on one page is, because what we recognize is that we are competing against people that are only in the women's space. There is a bigger opportunity for us there. And so we feel like we're incredibly well positioned right now. And I mentioned apparel, but I'd be remiss if I just didn't give you a sort of climb into the women's conversation here. Just talking about women's footwear. So much of our business is that, we are a young business. While we turned 20 this year, and we're incredibly proud of that milestone as a company, we are really just getting started when you look at the things that we're doing. I mean, women's footwear is a great example. And I say this, and I'm not proud of it, but just -- not even 2 years ago, the same person who handles women's for us also handled our outlet merchandising supply as well as our Youth. It was 1 person, she was incredible and she did an amazing Herculean job. But if you look at any of our competitors, there's probably 60, 80 to 100 people that would have those 3 collective jobs. So since that time, we've actually split them off. Our Women's today, we've got roughly half a dozen people in our Women's footwear team. And the fact is, we need about 20. And so we're in investment mode, but what you'll see is, that first line from that Women's footwear team, we'll be delivering in spring of '17, and so I don't know if people have seen the best stroke from Under Armour yet from a women's standpoint. But what we can tell you is, we're incredibly proud of what the points we've put on the board, and that's echoed by the sheer size and scale of that $1 billion Women's business. But what you will see is, is you'll see a continued, concerted effort for us to be premium and for us to be #1 in Women's. And we're proud of what we've done, but there's meat on the bone, and we expect to go attack it."

It is about 300 to 400 basis points of our growth in the back half of the year without shipping to TSA. We have made up some of that, but not all of it. And then, as it relates to North America, when you're looking at the segment, there have been some costs that have moved from Connected Fitness, there are headcount costs and the marketing side of the house for Connected Fitness that are more for the overall North America segment or all in-segment, and those costs have shifted -- approximately $5 million have shifted from Connected Fitness to North America. So that's why that segment looks that way."

So China, as we think about the opportunities we have, we've got about -- opening over 150 owned partner stores in 2016 as we look at it. The majority of those are actually going to be in China. So we feel like we found a really -- it's an interesting model. And as you look at the way they do it in China, you're either, a, going with a partner, or you're effectively -- you're running space like a landlord in a larger department store. So China, for us, is something -- just recounting some of the history, we spent a long time trying to figure it out. We started manufacturing there in 2000, we started selling there in 2010, where we did $1 million, $1.2 million or $1.3 million out of 1 store. By 2012, that was $3 million, and then we really amplified it by, I think, bringing great senior leadership and really defining a point of view for ourselves in the market. And from $3 million in '12 to $7 million in '13, to $30 million in '14, to $80 million in '15 to this year, we're looking at north of $150 million business. And so really, we're seeing that inflection point for the brand in China. We have great leadership on the ground over there, we have seasoned leadership on the ground. Our office, our headquarters in Shanghai. And we think there's a really good momentum. We're going to be following up on some of that momentum. At the end of next month or in beginning of September with another Stephen Curry tour, that we'll be taking through Asia. And really, it's a bigger story than just Stephen. I mean, again, as I said in my comments, Under Armour is known as, the professional brand in China. So grounding ourselves an authenticity is one of the formulas in any market we've gone to around the world. We found where it really is required for us to win. It's beginning with that authentic approach, having the consumers see us there, start really at the tip of the spear, and then, really creating a bit of that trickle down. So I think we're getting some of that net effect, and then you add in some of the star power with some of our global superstars, and whether it's -- this month being able to highlight Michael Phelps, whether it is what we're doing with Jordan or Stephen, but the brand is definitely known in China. We're not as famous as we will be, but we're definitely proud, I think, of the inroads that we've made in -- the big opportunity in putting stores behind it, putting distribution. And the other thing is our E-Commerce over there. Our E-Commerce in China has basically exploded for us as well. And so this is not just a bricks-and-mortar story. And frankly, China may actually end up being the palette that we're able to write the script of what is that balance. Because I think, one of the questions that everybody is having in the space right now is, where -- some of our competitors specifically, they talk about the power of their growth in terms of number of retail stores. I think that's one indicator for it, but I'm not sure that all the retail stores that are open today are going to be open in the future. And so I know the best ones will survive, and we think that E-Commerce can be a great supplement to that. And so we're pretty bullish on China, and I'm looking forward to that second Stephen Curry tour in a few weeks."

But probably by the middle of '19 at the latest, in doing that they've got -- someone else is going to go and use the space as temporary space for a period of time and then we'll be taking over. So again, I think that, that space for me, it solves lots of things for the brand. Number one, I think it's a flag in the ground for -- first and foremost, our product teams. Putting out there for our teams, of telling them the way, and telling every designer and putting the world on notice, and every designer and every builder and every product manager that wants to build the greatest product for the corner of Main and Main of -- beyond the United States, but really the world. And so being there at the mouth of Central Park, on the opening of 5th Avenue, we think it's a great platform to the brand. We're really going to be able to define ourselves of the company that we expect to be. So there's going to be a lot of imagineering that's going to happen as we look at this. Experiential, it's going to be at the pinnacle of what we're going to try to create here, and really, how we drive retail. And we think, as we continue to add retail stores -- we finished the year with some 400, again, opening over 150 this year, we think that as we, it is, whether we like it or not, we are retailers at some level, and we never want that to be competitive with our existing wholesale distribution base, but we think the more excellent we become as retailers, the better wholesale will be as well. It'll end up being a net effect for all of us. And again, driving the idea of iconic. What I've said is -- I made some bold statements in my written remarks about how big I think this idea of the store can be. But effectively, the goal that we have is to build the greater -- the single greatest retail store in the world. And we know that's a big statement with big company. But I think that, that's opportunity that we have and I expect to put together an incredible team of people that will help us think through what that means, and I think it'll really position the brand, again, in the iconic place where we believe that we belong."

As we just kind of think about the cadence or how our models now start to transition in 2017, should we look at that slowdown to 20% handing off to a growth rate closer to that 25% long-term growth rate that you guys have outlined, as we get into the first half of next year? Any other color you can help us to try to think about the shape of -- because I know the next time we hear from you, on the third quarter call, you guys traditionally like to give us the 2017 numbers.

But I think the first thing that -- when you just look at the strength of the brand is that, we're not -- the hardest thing is accepting a question that says, ""Tell us about decelerating revenues."" And we're still projecting -- you know with 25 quarters north of 20% in a row. Over 6 years of doing that, we see that trend continuing for us, number one. We do continue to see it to project 25% plus growth for the full year. So I just kind of want to level set that. And if I can just sort of think about how we're looking at the world these days, I think this quarter, it really is -- it's illustrative, I think, of the brand that we've built. With 28% top line growth, and if you look at how it's coming for other brands in this market, we're incredibly proud of the ability to put that number up. 58% footwear growth, 68% International growth, 19% apparel growth, launching Under Armour sportswear this quarter, expanding meaningful distribution by having built out a merchandising function [ph] that puts us in position to do that, creating statement retail and signing something as ambitious as 5th Avenue, that I think will elevate the entire industry in addition to our own brand, and you will see people look and get worried and concerned about what we're going to build there without question. All the way down to the athletes we've signed and without beating them over the heads of all the first names, from Jordan and Lindsey and Misty, to Andy Murray's win at Wimbledon recently and then, anchored by the Cal and UCLA signing. So I think that we're firing on all functions as a company right now. I think that, regardless of what the tape looks outside, we still expect to be the rising tide that's with all the other boats, and we expect to be one of the highest boats in the room. So from a record standpoint, this is a growth company. It's a reason why I typically start my scripts with that and end my scripts with that, is that we think growth is incredibly important. We have an opportunity to put ourselves and really separate ourselves from many into a very exclusive company that puts Under Armour, I think, in the stratosphere of where we belong. But look, it's not God-given. We got to go to work every day. Hopefully, you see and feel that from our brand. We got an unbelievably committed team that's doing that each and every day here in Baltimore and in our 26 offices all over the world. And the global expansion that we've been able to enjoy is something we're really excited about. We expect to be a global brand. We're proud of what we've done in North America, we're proud of what we've done in apparel, but things like footwear, things like women's, things like global and International are all going to be the hallmarks of what are we defining for Under Armour going forward, so we're just getting started."

You know one of the challenges that we had being primarily a sporting goods wholesale account, there wasn't a large sporting goods presence in the West Coast. The exception is Sports Authority, which had 63 doors that went away. And so one of the things, frankly that, even we see in Kohl's is they've got over 100 doors in the State of California. So we look at California as an opportunity for us. Again, it is the world's sixth largest economy, and something that we don't feel that we had been aggressive enough on. And so that's why you saw us make 2 very bold bets in terms of a new partnership with Cal and a new partnership with UCLA. And so those are about as certain as things get when you talk about investing in, really, in the community. And so Northern and Southern California in one fell swoop, backed up, of course, with what's Stephen Curry is doing there. And then, one of our key Connected Fitness offices, where Mike Lee, the Head of Connected Fitness is based out of, in San Francisco as well. And we've got a new 50,000 square-foot office being built there right now also. So we're in the State of California. We do think it's an opportunity for us, but we think it's also -- that is a top market globally and something we think is also a bit of a leaping board for us as we look to Asia and other markets abroad, too. So we like the opportunity, but again, many of these deals that we made recently were, really, the deal about geography as much as anything else, and we feel like we accomplished that point. So now we have to prove it out and there's work to be done. So you'll watch our team run hard."

Our financi",3195,"Thank you, Carrie, and good morning, everyone. We are a growth company, and with our 26th consecutive quarter of 20-plus percent revenue growth, we continue to demonstrate our ability to drive a bigger and better company quarter after quarter. Our financial results are an incredible accomplishment for any brand and something that we believe separates us from others in our business. 
Today, I'd like to start by giving some perspective on our industry and articulate what that means for Under Armour in this moment in time. 
I believe we operate in a truly resilient industry. The athletic apparel and footwear business and in broader context, sports, has been one of the most dynamic and strongest growing industries in our lifetime. As we continue to emerge ourselves in strategic and long-term growth, we ensure that we will continue to drive in an industry with various entry today that are much higher than 1996 when I drove my old Ford Explorer door-to-door to teams, selling T-shirts out of the back. 
Our industry's collective ability to continue to evolve and make better product that improves an athlete's performance, bring the passion of the sports experience to consumers to our brand storytelling and to do so with increasing profitability on a global basis is a reflection of what has been an ever-growing demand for consumers that our industry has met with outstanding financial results. 
Those measures of success are not as commonplace in other industries that are sometimes viewed as more stable or secure investments. Today, brands that 5 years ago were viewed as leaders in our field are in danger of being commoditized, disruptive or worse, becoming extinct as technology and the way we live changes the way consumers need and value them. 
Our industry of sport [ph] is different. Our industry's growth opportunities are global, with consumers around the world embracing athletic Apparel and Footwear at its historic levels. It's not about what people are conveniently referring to as athleisure. It's the simple truth that consumers all over the world are raising expectations about what to expect from their Apparel and Footwear and is a shift that is not going to be reversed. 
The macro trends is [indiscernible], not just us, but all the premium brands on our business, which is part of the reason I believe our industry will continue to gain new and loyal consumers across the globe. 
In the sports industry, we represent something truly attainable, measurable and sought after by most consumers to live a better, healthier life. Under Armour's mission is to make all athletes better. And we are fortunate enough to be in an industry that will withstand and maintain its relevancy over time because our value proposition enriches consumers' lives and help them reach their personal health and fitness goals. 
But our track record of growth and the power of the UA brand provides us with the confidence that we can do more. That track record is one of which we are extremely proud. Over the past 3 years, Under Armour is the only consumer brand in the top 10 fastest-growing companies in the S&P 500 with total revenue increasing 116% through 2015. We have the capacity to lead our industry over the next 10 years by continuing to take our consumer someplace new with our constant flow of product and innovation while at the same time improving their lives through our Connected Fitness platform, which will pass our 2016 goal of reaching over 190 million registered users by the end of this week. 
For UA, we have punched above our weight for a long time, and that has been essential theme of our success. That's not going to change. We compete in an industry that is measured by a few very high standards. We're measured by the innovative product we bring to consumers, by the strength and relevancy of our brand, by the talent of our team and, of course, by a financial results we deliver. 
While our business is in constant evolution, we know the standards won't change. We also know that we can't look for old models of success that have helped establish some of our competitors in their existing position. 
So I want to spend some time this morning talking about how we will operate as the world evolves around us and ensure we are investing to continue to drive forward-industry leadership on every front. 
As I've stated numerous times on these calls, footwear and International will be key drivers of our revenue growth. Our footwear business went from $239 million in 2012 to approaching $1 billion in revenue this year. And our International revenues grew from $108 million in 2012 to more than $700 million this year. That's clear evidence that our investments in footwear and International have driven strong revenue growth to date and fuels our confidence that we are just getting started in each of these areas. 
I'll talk about our focus there in just a minute, but first, I want to talk about the core of our business, North America. 
We built our brand and our business with the best wholesale partners in the industry, and we are incredibly proud of both our growth and our partnerships across the market. There's no doubt that the landscape globally and certainly, in our North American backyard is shifting. As we navigate this dynamic environment, our intention is to continue to evolve and grow in the places that have built our brand while we simultaneously reach a broader set of consumers through new avenues of distribution. We believe consumers expect excellence at every touch point with our brand, and you will see us invest to ensure that we drive growth with our long-term partners at the same time that we invest in new distribution through our own Direct-to-Consumer experiences. 
As we think about the many dimensions of growth for our company, we are incredibly confident in the opportunity we see for our North America business. Consider this, our 2 largest competitors generate approximately $18 billion in revenue in North America over just the past 12 months. So while we recognize that our trailing 12-month North American revenues of $3.95 billion is 85% of our business, it is just a fraction of the opportunity that we believe exist for our brand. Whether through share gains, market growth, new distribution or sheer brand heat, we know we have tremendous runway in our home market. We'll drive growth by the measures you'd expect, innovative product, brand strength and relevance and the best team in the industry to drive market-leading results. 
A large part of that growth in North America will come from footwear as we firmly believe that we are at the tipping point in terms of opportunities to gain market share. 
In the back-to-school window of July through September, our overall footwear market share nearly doubled according to industry data. 
So while we've always understood that the size of the price in footwear was massive, we knew coming into this year that there were a lot of consumers in U.S. who didn't know us as a footwear brand. So this summer, we launched our It Came from Below Footwear Campaign, which focused on the importance of footwork as athletes train. We started with Bryce Harper in baseball. And for running, we hosted a UA Run Camp, where we took experienced men and women from urban run-throughs and put them and their Under Armour footwear to the ultimate test in the world's toughest conditions. 
With the start of NFL season in early September, we incorporated NFL MVP, Cam Newton, with the Prince of a Thousand Enemies' spot and the launch of the game on SnapChat with Cam that drove incredible engagement. 
The final piece of our footwear campaign debuts today with the launch of the Curry 3. The TV spot debuts tonight on TNT during opening night of the NBA season, combined with our second tour of Asia where we took Steph into 4 cities in early September, we are continuing to build our relationship with the basketball consumer and driving awareness of UA as a footwear brand by partnering with the 2-time NBA MVP. 
So while Stephen has been a big part of building our footwear story, we're also having success in other areas that are contributing to the growth. The highlight is the #1 football cleat in the market 4 years running now and continues to showcase our ability to elevate and drive premium footwear in every category we chose to be in. We made our first football cleat in 2006, and since then, have changed the look of the entire category while elevating the price. 
This type of market evolution and positioning [indiscernible] indicated underscores our opportunity in other footwear category as we gain awareness, credibility, capabilities and scale. 
We are focused on the exploding running market in China, and we saw a great success there with the Bandit 2 running shoe, an example of how we are building key footwear platform that will continue to scale and expand.
We are improving our ability to leverage our global assets and help drive business in local markets. And we continue to focus on being a premium brand in footwear, with the goal of having more than 50% of our volume in running footwear over $100 by just spring of next year. 
We saw incredible demand for our Slingride product offering during the third quarter. Slingride is our second running shoe utilizing a full knit upper to deliver comfort and fit where you need it. Priced at $100, it did extremely well in the market. And we believe there's great opportunity in what knit can mean for Under Armour running. 
So we will continue to invest meaningfully in our footwear business with a focus on talent as well as infrastructure that will help improve the profitability in our business as we scale. We believe we are at a moment in time where we can gain share in footwear. And we are prepared to make investments that will drive long-term, profitable growth. 
That same focus on the long-term opportunity holds true for our investments as we build out our International business. We continue to post strong growth across all our geographies. While our business in EMEA continues to be strong, it's our Greater China market that remains the biggest growth story for our International business. 
Posting revenue in the third quarter equal to the entire first half of the year and firmly on a path to more than double their business from $80 million just a year ago, we are making incredible inroads in China that we believe will drive our position in this critical market. With sports and fitness being promoted strongly by the government, we continue to be viewed by the Chinese consumer as the performance brand or referred to often as the professional brand. Some of the things we're doing in China include: focusing on building premium brand houses with a controlled retail environment and a sustainable full-price business model, where we've already opened over 100 doors this year; driving a strong E-Commerce channel presence and utilizing an Asia for China and local-for-local model to reduce cost and improve fill rates and on-time delivery. 
But we are just getting started in China, much like we are in new markets around the world. We've rolled out E-Commerce platforms in 4 new markets this year, including Mexico, Australia, New Zealand and Chile. And that's after doing the same in 14 new markets in 2015, bringing our total global E-Commerce sites to 30. 
We're building a global organization for the long haul. As I said earlier, funding these growing International markets may require additional investment in the short term. However, we believe they are central to our long-term goal of market leadership. 
In addition to Footwear and International, we're making investments in other key growth areas that will contribute and drive our ability to become a bigger and better company, including: retail, where we're ensuring that we deliver a great presentation of the brand wherever our consumer decides to transact. With SAP, we're creating efficiencies in our systems as we continue to grow and scale; in category management, where we are organizing around 9 sports categories and executive leadership to create focus and alignment across our business; and finally, merchandising, which enables us to differentiate our product to create unique experiences for our consumers across our points of distribution and now gives us the ability to reach more athletes than ever before. 
The third key, where we will continue to overinvest in the near term, is connected in fitness. We're doing so because we believe strongly that it'll prove an important differentiator in our relationship with the consumer. With nearly 190 million registered users in our community, we continue to gather critical information to help us change the way athletes live. We firmly believe that going forward, brands without substantive communities will be at a deficit when it comes to building a relationship with their consumer. 
We are investing in our single view of consumer through our partnership with SAP as we look to continuously drive a better business as we scale, knowing that much of the benefit will not be seen immediately. 
That said, we expect to see return on these investments starting in the near term with tools like self-service consumer comparison reporting, where we can quickly compare the demographic profile, workout habits and purchase behavior of any group of consumers. We are growing our analytics capabilities and moving from backward looking reporting to predictive and prescriptive analytics, which allow us to establish and drive growth in a more meaningful way. 
We will be able to personalize our E-Commerce homepage, driving off your demographic profile, which sports categories are important to you, your exercise, how frequently you exercise, sleep, weight, diet and the makeup of your household. 
Going forward, we will continue to dive into the data and leverage the insights to deepen and expand our relationship with athletes as their needs change. 
Our brand continues to evolve and shift with the changing demand and needs of the consumer. And as I said earlier, we're in an incredible industry where sports and health and fitness are driving forces in our success. 
Our investments, the ones we have made in the past and will continue to make in the years to come, are critical for us to realize the true potential of the UA brand. We are confident we are making the right investments and our track record of investing for growth is exceptional. Our investments are all about expansion of the brand, about opening the aperture of what we're capable of and never being satisfied with our past successes. 
So recently I pulled together the top leaders in the company and discussed the strategic growth and direction of Under Armour. We came away with 3 key areas of focus that I want to share with you today. 
First, getting big fast; second, making retail of core competency; and third, getting more shoes on feet. 
To be clear, get big fast does not mean at all cost. It means prioritizing our growth and making the right decisions for the brand, it means growing the right way. As I said earlier, we have succeeded over the past 20 years by consistently punching above our weight, and that will not change. But our growth now gives us opportunities to move up in a weight class. And we find ourselves well positioned at this moment in time to compete for long-term relationships with athletes, teams and league affiliation that we previously could not justify. 
Now with the flexibility to lock in 10- to 15-year deals, we can make investments on a global scale that will help drive authenticity, awareness and revenues for our brand. it is not going to be easy. The mix of our business is evolving, and so must we, which is why making retail a core competency is critical to our future success. We'll do that by answering the call of the consumer, who's asking us to give them more in the places that they expect to find our product. We are no longer just a North American apparel company. We are a retail company across multiple consumer touch points, and we'll look to be best-in-class. And when we know how to be a great retailer, we can leverage that expertise to help us be a better wholesale partner and therefore, continue to elevate and meet our consumer where and how they want to engage with us. 
So to summarize where this nets out, both International and footwear are growing faster in the near term than we had originally planned. And as a result, we remain confident in reaching our 2018 revenue target of $7.5 billion. 
While this mixed shift will create margin pressure, we have a significant opportunity to offset the sales mix impact by continuing to improve our footwear product margins over time, and we will. But the market share opportunity cannot wait. We will remain focused on getting more shoes on feet because we see footwear being as big, if not bigger, than apparel one day. And as we drive footwear revenue, the dynamics of the business do change, but that's a good thing because we are truly just getting started in footwear. 
So before I pass it to Chip, I just want to reiterate my confidence in the future of our industry and more specifically, how Under Armour, with the right investment and incredible brand momentum, will continue to lead and outpace the competition. 
As I said during my opening, I believe we operate in a resilient industry with strong competitors who will build global businesses over the course of many years. And while their sheer size poses consistent challenges for us and challenges we have consistently met and beaten, we believe that the monumental shift that is taking place in both the manufacturing of shoes and apparel and the way consumers buy our products is leveling the playing field and will enable us to build a bigger and better global brand. 
We've delivered great results on the path that has led us to this moment in time, 26 consecutive quarters of 20-plus percent revenue growth. During that stretch, we've established a culture of growth that equips us for this next chapter in our story. And today, we are reiterating our target of $7.5 billion of revenue for 2018. Our challenge is that we need to continue investing on multiple fronts and categories, geographies and the talent and infrastructure required to capture those growth opportunities, and that's why the dollars we are committing reflect a broader investment strategy. In the short term, these investments will impact our operating income growth, which Chip will walk you through in a moment. 
We understand that the path to industry leadership grows more complex as we expand in categories, channels and geographies. And I am confident we will remain the market leader in growth by delivering innovation at every touch point, a consumer has with our brand. 
Thank you. And I will pass it over to Chip."
8740684,403729229,1059920,"Under Armour, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2016",2016-10-25,"Earnings Calls","Under Armour, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Kevin. I would now like to spend some time when reviewing our third quarter 2016 financial results, followed by our updated outlook for the remainder of the year as well as our long-term outlook and initial guidance for next year. Our revenues f",1944,"Thanks, Kevin. I would now like to spend some time when reviewing our third quarter 2016 financial results, followed by our updated outlook for the remainder of the year as well as our long-term outlook and initial guidance for next year. 
Our revenues for the third quarter of 2016 increased 22% to $1.47 billion. On a currency-neutral basis, net revenues increased 23% compared with the prior year's period. Our ability to deliver another quarter of consistent growth is a direct result of continued investments we have made in the business to meet consumer expectations through categories, channels and geographies. 
As we continue to navigate through the changing dynamics of the North American retail landscape, we remain focused on solving problems for athletes all over the world and meeting the consumer with premium compelling product wherever they are interacting with our brand. 
During the third quarter, our wholesale sales revenues grew 19% to $1.01 billion. Our Direct-to-Consumer revenues grew 29% to $408 million, representing approximately 28% of total revenues for the quarter. 
During the quarter, licensing revenues grew 21% to $29 million and Connected Fitness revenues grew 40% to $20 million. 
On the product category front, apparel revenues increased 18% to $1.02 billion compared to $866 million in the prior year's quarter, led by consistent growth in our sport categories, including Men's training, Women's training, golf and team sports. 
Third quarter footwear revenues increased 42% to $279 million from $196 million in the prior year's quarter. 
Within running, we saw a strong global demand for the brand led by 2 of our new $100 price point product offerings, the Bandit 2 and Slingride, showcasing our continued focus in investment in these key category of long-term growth. 
In basketball, the Curry signature line continues to drive strong growth for the Under Armour Brand. 
Our accessories revenues during the third quarter increased 18% to $122 million from $104 million in the prior year's quarter, primarily driven by bags and headwear. 
On a regional basis, North American revenues in the third quarter increased 16% to $1.23 billion compared to $1.06 billion during the same period last year. 
Within our Direct-to-Consumer channel, our North American store count at the end of the quarter included 162 company-owned stores, comprised of 145 factory stores and 17 Brand House stores. With the opening of 3 new Brand Houses in the quarter, including Philadelphia, New York City World Trade Center and Madison, Wisconsin, we continue to invest in building and creating the best premium retail expression of our brand. 
International revenues increased 74% to $226 million in the third quarter to reach 15% of total revenues. On a currency-neutral basis, International revenues increased 80%. Within our International wholesale channel, the store count at the end of the quarter included 282 partner stores. 
Within our Direct-to-Consumer channel, our company-owned International store count at the end of the quarter included 63 stores, comprised of 32 Factory Houses and 31 Brand House stores. 
Looking at our International regions, starting with EMEA. We continue to post strong growth in the region as we expand our presence with key wholesale partners and distributors while building out our Direct-to-Consumer business. 
In the Asia Pacific region, our premium performance brand strategy continues to resonate with the consumer, driving strong growth in the quarter. As Kevin mentioned, we continue to see strong growth in basketball, led by the Stephen Curry signature line and believe we are well positioned to capitalize and scale the business in our fastest-growing region. 
And in Latin America, we drove incredible brand awareness in the region and around the globe through the strong performance of -- performances of our Olympic athletes. We remain focused on the long-term growth opportunity of this region as we continue to build and expand our distribution. 
Moving on to margins. Third quarter gross margins decreased 130 basis points to 47.5% compared to 48.8% in the prior year's period. The following items contributed the majority of the margin contraction this quarter: first, liquidations negatively impacted the quarter by approximately 80 basis points versus the prior year; second, product margins negatively impacted gross margin by approximately 30 basis points versus the prior year, driven by product mix, higher discounts and promotions, partially offset by continued improvement and product input cost; and finally, foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted gross margin by approximately 30 basis points. 
In the quarter, gross margin declined more than planned, driven predominantly by higher-than-expected promotions, both the volume and rate of liquidations and foreign exchange rates. 
Despite liquidations having been a headwind on margin rates for most of this year, we now believe that our inventory position is healthier and liquidation should not have the same negative impact moving forward. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses grew 20% to $499 million compared to $416 million during the third quarter of last year. Growth was predominantly driven by investments in our Direct-to-Consumer businesses, both retail and E-Commerce, along with the infrastructure and people necessary to support our growth and strategic initiatives such as product creation, innovation and sport category management. Selling, general and administrative expenses were less than planned in the quarter due to lower incentive compensation and the timing of marketing activations. A portion of the expected marketing spend shifted from the third quarter to the fourth quarter to better align with key initiatives, including the launch of Curry 3 that Kevin mentioned earlier. 
Operating income for the third quarter increased 16% to $199 million compared with $171 million in the prior year period. Interest expense for the third quarter increased to approximately $8 million compared to $4 million in the prior year's period. 
Within other income and expense, we recorded a loss of $1 million in the current year versus a loss of $3 million in the prior year. 
In addition, the tax rate in the third quarter was 32.6% compared to 38.8% in the prior year, largely due to improved international profitability in the current year period and the tax benefit related to our prior year acquisitions. 
Our third quarter net income increased 28% to $128 million compared to $100 million in the prior year period. 
On the balance sheet, total cash and cash equivalents for the quarter was $180 million compared with $159 million at September 30, 2015. 
Inventory for the quarter increased 12% to $971 million compared to $867 million while total debt increased to $1.07 billion as compared to $902 million. 
Looking at our cash flows. Our investment in capital expenditures was $73 million for the third quarter compared to $71 million in the prior year's period. We now expect to spend approximately $450 million for the full year, including investments on our global offices around the world, including our headquarters in Baltimore, our distribution centers, our SAP platform and global Direct-to-Consumer. 
Now moving on to our guidance for the remainder of the year. Based on our current visibility, we continue to expect full year 2016 net revenues of approximately $4.925 billion, representing growth of 24%, and operating income in the range of approximately $440 million to $445 million, representing growth of 8% to 9%. Gross margins for the full year is expected to decline approximately 80 basis points compared to last year, driven by the same factors that we have experienced through the year. 
Based on our outlook of $4.925 billion in revenues, SG&A is now expected to grow approximately 26% as we remain focused on making the right investments today to drive our long-term global success. 
Below the operating line, we expect interest expense to increase to approximately $30 million in 2016. 
In addition, we now expect the full year tax rate of approximately 35.5% and fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 446 million. 
I would also like to bring additional color on the fourth quarter. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenues to grow approximately 20%. We believe the strength of our brand and increased breadth of head-to-toe product offerings position us for another quarter of strong growth and what has been a challenging North American retail environment. 
With strong momentum in footwear and International, we remain focused on delivering key products and assortments for the holiday season. 
Gross margin is expected to be relatively flat versus prior year with SG&A as I mentioned earlier, the timing of certain marketing activations along with continued investment in long-term growth opportunities like Connected Fitness, International and Direct-to-Consumer will drive the growth in the quarter. 
For the fourth quarter, we expect operating income in the range of $186 million to $191 million, representing growth of 5% to 8% over the prior year. 
Before we turn it over to Q&A, we'd like to briefly discuss our long-term outlook and associated guidance for next year. At our 2015 Investor Day, we announced our goals of achieving $7.5 billion of revenues and $800 million of operating income by 2018. We are on track to achieve our 2018 revenue goal of $7.5 billion and expect to grow full year revenues consistently in the low-20s in both 2017 and 2018. 
At the same time, we expect annual operating income growth in the mid-teens each of the next 2 years as we focus on investing to get big fast. 
As Kevin highlighted earlier, the landscaper for our business in our industry continues stable and in a fast-paced world, we must be willing to adapt, make game time decisions and drive our brand forward. North America apparel growth is slowing across the industry. While we expect to continue to significantly outpace the apparel industry, the growth rate going forward will be less than expected from our Investor Day in 2015. 
This is a moment in time. We could choose to optimize for more near-term profits, but we believe it is more prudent to invest to maintain superior growth rates while gaining both share and scale. Growth, share and scale are the priorities for our brand. That said, we will invest more heavily in areas that we can grow faster such as footwear, Direct-to-Consumer and International as well as more aggressively enter of sports fashion like UAS and the much broader sports lifestyle category. 
In footwear, that means doubling down on creating great products through innovation and design, scaling and extending our pinnacle footwear franchises and investing in the complete market strategy for merchandising to in-store marketing. 
In Direct-to-Consumer, we are driving investment in mobile. The optimization of the Factory House store footprint and building out premium Brand House expressions to help us drive market share. 
International growth includes being more aggressive in key markets where we are gaining significant awareness such as Asia. 
In the sports lifestyle category, we accelerating investment in the people necessary to design relevant and brand right product. 
And finally, we will continue to make key investments in assets that promote the brand. 
Beyond 2018, we believe we have opportunities across categories, channels and geographies to consistently deliver superior revenue growth relative to our industry. 
We also believe that as we approach $10 billion in revenues, the scale it provides, along with the investments we have made in people, infrastructure and systems, will begin to pay off in the form of increasing operating margin rates. 
As Kevin stated earlier, we've delivered great results from the path that has led us from this moment in time. The dollars we are committing reflect a broader investment strategy that will enable us to build a company as big as our brand. 
We would now like to open the call for your questions. Similar to our last earnings call, Dave Bergman, our SVP of Corporate Finance, will be joining us this morning to provide additional assistance with your questions. [Operator Instructions]"

Thank you, Michael, and this is obviously an area that I want to spend a little time on and go deep so give me a few minutes to cap this for you. So as Chip said in his commentary, we talked about building a business as big as brand. We had on our ey",1803,"Yes. Thank you, Michael, and this is obviously an area that I want to spend a little time on and go deep so give me a few minutes to cap this for you. So as Chip said in his commentary, we talked about building a business as big as brand. We had on our eye on $10 billion, that's the way that we see our company. I think the way that people view and judge as with $7.5 billion being our next milestone to be hit by 2018 and again, we want to reiterate that we're on track to hitting that goal. But there are a few factors that led to decision to modify the operating income for us since Investor Day, September 2015. So what's happened and what's different? First of all, in North America, it's a place of providing of incredible air cover for our brand for very long time. And I think like we're seeing a lot of places that, that that has modified and changing. In the investments that we've made over the past 11 years as a public company, we've seen that our business thankfully has evolved from being strictly North American wholesale apparel brand into a global sports brand that often goes to claim International and footwear as probably 2 of our large as in gratis opportunities for growth. And all the while, I want to be clear, with apparel remain incredibly profitable and still growing to the tune of 18% in just the third quarter for us. So this is not -- there's the end to the North America apparel story, that continues to march on for us as well. We just have other opportunities that are outpacing some of that growth. So some of those opportunities like footwear in International, they are exceeding what we're putting up in 24-plus percent top line growth as a company, and that change in mix is modifying our growth margin story in the short term. That means while we're doing better in footwear in International than we thought we were capable of doing, that we are fortunate to have these levers to pull and frankly, attack as we maintain our industry-leading growth on the top line as well as continue to drive what we can to making the right investments and the right parts of our business. So what's also change that's our distribution. The fact that we've had 3 bankruptcies that have occurred in just the last 12 months in sporting goods that account for more than $4 billion in loss revenue for the sporting goods industry in North America and compare that relatively speaking that going all the way back to 2008, plus 2009, there's just $170 million of bankruptcies of loss in in our industry. So we saw something pretty big happened that we thought about, but it definitely has been eye-opening for us especially recently. And we want to be clear like our demand is still there, like this doesn't mean that the demand for the Under Armour Brand has disappeared, but it certainly hasn't reappeared dollar for dollar in our immediate distribution. We believe that the opportunity is also still there. We just have to be more thoughtful about how to capture the consumers and their dollars, including replacing with our own Direct-to-Consumer controlled retail as well as expanded distribution by doing things like Cole's, which will carry the Under Armour product beginning in 2017.  We also plan to make additional investments in the places where we know that we can win. So right now, that moment in time is a very important message, I think, for obviously our shareholders but thankfully to our team and our consumer. Footwear and International are going to continue to be staples of our investment strategy because we think the opportunities for us now is to strike and strike hard. And we think the momentum of things like Curry what is launching tonight and I think you'll be pretty excited about where you see and most importantly, that consumers are going to be excited. We also have opportunities like lifestyle that as we talked about before on these calls represents roughly 1/3 of the revenues of our 2 largest competitors. And today, less than 5% of the business for Under Armour. Thirdly, Connected Fitness is continuing to be going to be an area that we'll invest in, where we believe that defining the expectations, the consumer has of the sports brand with our data will give us perspective on our consumer that will be truly unmatched in our industry. Another factor that we've seen recently has been the escalation in the price in fact of the duration of sports marketing assets. The length of these deals have gone from standard 5-year deals arrangements to now 10- to 15-year deals. [indiscernible], one that we wrapped up recently this past spring was the largest deal in history put to 15-year partnership and at the same time, we also lapped up Cal Berkley and giving us a true position in California which frankly, prior to that we really didn't have. If we deem them strategic, the ability that was happening in sports marketing as these assets are being wrapped up is either act now or lose them for frankly, the mid- to long-term. This, of course, does not mean every deal and I want to be clear is that the shift in operating income for us is not about putting a bigger marketing budgets so we can go buy more stuff, it is about truly investing in our brand, our systems, our infrastructure and especially, our team. I'll give you another example of that in just a minute. So all those things are some of the tactical but not the [indiscernible] strategic issues, new issues that we're  facing since September of 2015. And when you grow a business 20-plus percent a quarter for 6.5 years, it builds a unique profile that we find ourselves today, which means adding $1 billion in growing by year-end revenue and require significant resources and investments. But I want to be clear is that the growth remains intact, interest cost more short-term investment dollars to achieve and the belief that greater efficiency can come later and that the growth that we have over the short-term EPS is a priority for our long-term goal of becoming the #1 sports brand in the world. And I want to reiterate that like we are in this for the long haul and the opportunity that we see is to be the best in the world. And that does require investment, and we know the people are going to like the way it sounds, but this is what -- I don't know if there's even been another model like ours at 6.5 years with the growth that we've seen, particularly in consumer. And so the book isn't written anywhere. And if it were, we had to read it. But this is what we're telling you that from our purview of 11 years public and what I've seen in our business that now is the time for us to strike because I think the upside is so much greater on the other side. So on relative basis, we believe the short term dollars a better spent building our infrastructure ensuring that we capture that '18 goal of $7.5 billion especially once we achieve the scale of a $10 billion growth company, which will be when we can truly begin to leverage to expand gross margins, our SG&A investments and ultimately, shareholder value. So one of the issues that I know people know this, but I think it's worthy for us to say that you face as a superior growth company with Under Armour demonstrated its ability to be is that operating growth of 15% for virtually any S&P or Fortune 500 business will be outstanding. But because of our business is growing in the 20s, the profile that only a very few rare companies near the S&P our Fortune 500 and frankly, not from our industry tax share and where we still expect to deliver more than $0.5 billion of operating income profit in 2017 alone, so we're not saying we're losing money, we are moving and marching forward. On growth term, that more than $0.5 billion is more than nearly 2x the total revenue we delivered in our IPO year of 2005, proving at our investment in things like footwear, Women's and International have all paid off. But at the end of the day, look, we believe that by making these investments, the ability for us is to mature into a business as big as our brand. So we want to drive best-in-class profitability as our business scale, our growth rates to become more measured, and we've got the people, distribution, systems and infrastructure to optimize. Today, we have pieces of it, but frankly, it's just incomplete, and that's why we must continue to invest. I want to give some perspective here for a second just on where we are. And I mean Under Armour, we drop into the sporting brand pond about 20 years ago, and we jumped in and there were a lot of players, 20, 30 players on brands as many as you want. Today, we're the third largest brand in the world, we're the second largest brand in North America. And our 2 largest competitors have more than 20,000 points of distribution each in North America alone compared to just our 11,000 which speaks to just some the runway that we still have in front of us right here in our own backyard. They're also 6 and 4x and our size, respectively. So let me give you a realtime example of what that means. It means in an area like Women's footwear, where we currently have just 6 teammates on our Women's sportswear team based in Portland who are doing an amazing job for us and is building best-in-class product, our competitors who we get compared to on a 1 to 1 basis have dozens or even hundreds of people covering the same category. It's our responsibility through our long-term growth objective of being #1 in Youth, in Men's and of course, Women's across all categories to continue to invest to meet that long-term goal. So I want to be clear is that we have saying around here, it's called the [indiscernible] talk and it's the last thing we will ever do. And I want our share shareholders know how hard this company fight for every single dollar at the bottom line, but we're looking honestly at this moment in time and saying it's time for us to invest. We have the best team and we got the best brand, and we expect to continue to grow."

So first of all, we're seeing a tough story that as we look or think about North America, you've heard a couple people talk about it. And again, it's nothing going away, but it's definitely reflected in just some of the bankruptcies and the other things that we've seen recently. The people we're doing business with I believe are doing very well and they're getting very smart about the way they're managing and running their business. But it's definitely you're not finding our accounts that are taking big inventory positions and betting on the cold weather. So those are the things that are leading for us, which are requiring us to run into drive a better business. Today, I will define Under Armour as a great brand and as a great brand with a probably a good company. The opportunity we have as things like what we see what some of the speed to manufacturing, things like recently when we announced our partnership at Citi Garage here in Baltimore where we talked about local for local strategy which means bringing manufacturing back to the United States and again, that's not they made in U.S.A. initiative as much as initiative for us about making great product anywhere is that people of America one product made in America. The people of Europe want the same. The people in Sao Paulo want product in Brazil, so we're going to continue to answer that and look to drive a net answer. But there's a lot of investment in the front-end. The good news is that the staffing of our industry is that a certain issue exact same way they were 100 years ago, and we see massive opportunity for that in for. Some of the things I talk about him a script, in my comments was how we have the ability I think to accelerate the speed at which innovation can happen there. Right now to make a single shoe, for instance, it takes upwards of 300 pairs a hand to make a single shoe. So we think there's a lot of room for innovation, we're finding about ourselves and I think that's continuing to move for us as well."

But over time as we start to gain more and more scale, we'll see that gross margin improvement. And on top of that as we get more into lifestyle, we'll see more gross margin as well. So once we started to get towards $10 billion, we'll see gross margin. The same time, that's what we should really start to be able to leverage our expense structure. We're investing across the world, we're investing in offices, we're investing in IT systems, we're investing in distribution capacity, all of those things that are happening today, and will continue to happen over the next couple of years. But we will start to see that leverage so it becomes sort of a perfect storm once we get to $10 billion, and we'll start to see operating income margin expansion. And I think we'll head towards more the premium level versus the other person or the other competitor that you're speaking with."

At the same time, we're already seeing improvements in our footwear margins, and we'll continue to see those improvements. And so net-net, we think we can overcome that mixed shift through the improvements we're seeing on the costing side from the next couple of years. But net-net, it will be flat.

And so there's no secret sauce of someone else has that we don't. It's been time, it's been energy and experience and and frankly, I just gotten back with Chip in Asia about 4, 5 weeks ago and seeing the investments that our manufacturing partners are making us throughout China, but also through Vietnam and the Philippines, where you seeing a lot of this new facilities going up. There is a great belief in a company and a brand like Under Armour that just a couple of years ago I think -- it's important to lay out. Last year, we made 30 million pairs of shoes, 2016, we'll make 40 million pairs of shoes. Obviously, you heard how bullish we are in footwear, that number is increasing. And again, that's impressive, but it still compares to the hundreds of millions of pairs of shoes that are made by our competitors as we build scale, this will naturally come onboard as well as we'll help with people like Cowen Brown who is our new President of sourcing and some of the things that we'll do driving these initiatives. So we see this great opportunity and gross margin and there's nothing that we're laying back and there's no excuse for what we're doing with operating income as it relates to or the way that will something gross margin across the board."

Pam is leading that-- she's an industry veteran has been a complete pro in bringing the pieces together but there's a lot of pieces to bring together. Probably the best thing I could say is when you talk about our Women's business -- we have $1 billion Women's brand. It's taking us one heck of a long time to get here, but we're incredibly proud of what that means. But I think probably looking at women's through the lens of -- I gave an example about footwear one of my earlier answers, and we have 6 people in our Women's footwear team. We just built our first Women's last year for the first time. And those are the things from an operating income standpoint I want to say is that when people say you don't have enough -- people dress toe to head, and they start with the shoe. But if the shoe isn't right, if the fit isn't right, if the color isn't right, wouldn't have the right team, the reason we didn't build the women's lap before is because we were focused on the ability that we couldn't afford it. And so we're making a lot of the small decisions right now that we truly believe that making -- looking at 2017, 2018, making the investment as unfortunately because our growth rate is so great, it creates that drag. But making this right investments in footwear is important. So let me go back with Women's one thing we think is incredibly important is the football cleated opportunity and what we're doing that the #1 Cleat there is a doing much for the Women's category, but the confidence that we're demonstrating in running from our knit products, this is a again this would be the first year in a products that we have Women's lap on people's feet on Women's feet and we also think that as we continue to drive better products for, driving both performance, style, strength and beauty, the focuses we'll have. So I think we've got a terrific team in place. We are investing in our Women's team as well. We think footwear will be one of the catalyst forward, but achieving $1 billion business in Women's is a pretty big feet and is something that we're not stopping as we're  satisfied with."

We are a growth company, and with our 26th consecutive quarter of 20-plus percent revenue growth, we continue to demonstrate our ability to drive a bigger and better company quarter after quarter. Our financi",3194,"Thank you, Carrie, and good morning, everyone. We are a growth company, and with our 26th consecutive quarter of 20-plus percent revenue growth, we continue to demonstrate our ability to drive a bigger and better company quarter after quarter. Our financial results are an incredible accomplishment for any brand and something that we believe separates us from others in our business. 
Today, I'd like to start by giving some perspective on our industry and articulate what that means for Under Armour in this moment in time. 
I believe we operate in a truly resilient industry. The athletic apparel and footwear business and in broader context, sports, has been one of the most dynamic and strongest growing industries in our lifetime. As we continue to emerge ourselves in strategic and long-term growth, we ensure that we will continue to drive in an industry with various entry today that are much higher than 1996 when I drove my old Ford Explorer door-to-door to teams, selling T-shirts out of the back. 
Our industry's collective ability to continue to evolve and make better product that improves an athlete's performance, bring the passion of the sports experience to consumers to our brand storytelling and to do so with increasing profitability on a global basis is a reflection of what has been an ever-growing demand for consumers that our industry has met with outstanding financial results. 
Those measures of success are not as commonplace in other industries that are sometimes viewed as more stable or secure investments. Today, brands that 5 years ago were viewed as leaders in our field are in danger of being commoditized, disruptive or worse, becoming extinct as technology and the way we live changes the way consumers need and value them. 
Our industry of sport is different. Our industry's growth opportunities are global, with consumers around the world embracing athletic Apparel and Footwear at its historic levels. It's not about what people are conveniently referring to as athleisure. It's the simple truth that consumers all over the world are raising expectations about what to expect from their Apparel and Footwear and is a shift that is not going to be reversed. 
The macro trend has favored not just us, but all the premium brands on our business, which is part of the reason, I believe, our industry will continue to gain new and loyal consumers across the globe. 
In the sports industry, we represent something truly attainable, measurable and sought after by most consumers to live a better, healthier life. Under Armour's mission is to make all athletes better. And we are fortunate enough to be in an industry that will withstand and maintain its relevancy over time because our value proposition enriches consumers' lives and help them reach their personal health and fitness goals. 
But our track record of growth and the power of the UA brand provides us with the confidence that we can do more. That track record is one of which we are extremely proud. Over the past 3 years, Under Armour is the only consumer brand in the top 10 fastest-growing companies in the S&P 500 with total revenue increasing 116% through 2015. We have the capacity to lead our industry over the next 10 years by continuing to take our consumer someplace new with our constant flow of product and innovation while at the same time improving their lives through our Connected Fitness platform, which will pass our 2016 goal of reaching over 190 million registered users by the end of this week. 
For UA, we have punched above our weight for a long time, and that has been essential theme of our success. That's not going to change. We compete in an industry that is measured by a few very high standards. We're measured by the innovative product we bring to consumers, by the strength and relevancy of our brand, by the talent of our team and, of course, by a financial results we deliver. 
While our business is in constant evolution, we know the standards won't change. We also know that we can't look for old models of success that have helped establish some of our competitors in their existing position. 
So I want to spend some time this morning talking about how we will operate as the world evolves around us and ensure we are investing to continue to drive forward-industry leadership on every front. 
As I've stated numerous times on these calls, footwear and International will be key drivers of our revenue growth. Our footwear business went from $239 million in 2012 to approaching $1 billion in revenue this year. And our International revenues grew from $108 million in 2012 to more than $700 million this year. That's clear evidence that our investments in footwear and International have driven strong revenue growth to date and fuels our confidence that we are just getting started in each of these areas. 
I'll talk about our focus there in just a minute, but first, I want to talk about the core of our business, North America. 
We built our brand and our business with the best wholesale partners in the industry, and we are incredibly proud of both our growth and our partnerships across the market. There's no doubt that the landscape globally and certainly, in our North American backyard is shifting. As we navigate this dynamic environment, our intention is to continue to evolve and grow in the places that have built our brand while we simultaneously reach a broader set of consumers through new avenues of distribution. We believe consumers expect excellence at every touch point with our brand, and you will see us invest to ensure that we drive growth with our long-term partners at the same time that we invest in new distribution through our own Direct-to-Consumer experiences. 
As we think about the many dimensions of growth for our company, we are incredibly confident in the opportunity we see for our North America business. Consider this, our 2 largest competitors generate approximately $18 billion in revenue in North America over just the past 12 months. So while we recognize that our trailing 12-month North American revenues of $3.95 billion is 85% of our business, it is just a fraction of the opportunity that we believe exist for our brand. Whether through share gains, market growth, new distribution or sheer brand heat, we know we have tremendous runway in our home market. We'll drive growth by the measures you'd expect, innovative product, brand strength and relevance and the best team in the industry to drive market-leading results. 
A large part of that growth in North America will come from footwear as we firmly believe that we are at the tipping point in terms of opportunities to gain market share. 
In the back-to-school window of July through September, our overall footwear market share nearly doubled according to industry data. 
So while we've always understood that the size of the price in footwear was massive, we knew coming into this year that there were a lot of consumers in U.S. who didn't know us as a footwear brand. So this summer, we launched our It Came from Below Footwear Campaign, which focused on the importance of footwork as athletes train. We started with Bryce Harper in baseball. And for running, we hosted a UA Run Camp, where we took experienced men and women from urban run-throughs and put them and their Under Armour footwear to the ultimate test in the world's toughest conditions. 
With the start of NFL season in early September, we incorporated NFL MVP, Cam Newton, with the Prince of a Thousand Enemies' spot and the launch of the game on SnapChat with Cam that drove incredible engagement. 
The final piece of our footwear campaign debuts today with the launch of the Curry 3. The TV spot debuts tonight on TNT during opening night of the NBA season, combined with our second tour of Asia where we took Steph into 4 cities in early September, we are continuing to build our relationship with the basketball consumer and driving awareness of UA as a footwear brand by partnering with the 2-time NBA MVP. 
So while Stephen has been a big part of building our footwear story, we're also having success in other areas that are contributing to the growth. The highlight is the #1 football cleat in the market 4 years running now and continues to showcase our ability to elevate and drive premium footwear in every category we chose to be in. We made our first football cleat in 2006, and since then, have changed the look of the entire category while elevating the price. 
This type of market evolution and positioning in cleated underscores our opportunity in other footwear category as we gain awareness, credibility, capabilities and scale. 
We are focused on the exploding running market in China, and we saw a great success there with the Bandit 2 running shoe, an example of how we are building key footwear platform that will continue to scale and expand.
We are improving our ability to leverage our global assets and help drive business in local markets. And we continue to focus on being a premium brand in footwear, with the goal of having more than 50% of our volume in running footwear over $100 by just spring of next year. 
We saw incredible demand for our Slingride product offering during the third quarter. Slingride is our second running shoe utilizing a full knit upper to deliver comfort and fit where you need it. Priced at $100, it did extremely well in the market. And we believe there's great opportunity in what knit can mean for Under Armour running. 
So we will continue to invest meaningfully in our footwear business with a focus on talent as well as infrastructure that will help improve the profitability in our business as we scale. We believe we are at a moment in time where we can gain share in footwear. And we are prepared to make investments that will drive long-term, profitable growth. 
That same focus on the long-term opportunity holds true for our investments as we build out our International business. We continue to post strong growth across all our geographies. While our business in EMEA continues to be strong, it's our Greater China market that remains the biggest growth story for our International business. 
Posting revenue in the third quarter equal to the entire first half of the year and firmly on a path to more than double their business from $80 million just a year ago, we are making incredible inroads in China that we believe will drive our position in this critical market. With sports and fitness being promoted strongly by the government, we continue to be viewed by the Chinese consumer as the performance brand or referred to often as the professional brand. Some of the things we're doing in China include: focusing on building premium brand houses with a controlled retail environment and a sustainable full-price business model, where we've already opened over 100 doors this year; driving a strong E-Commerce channel presence and utilizing an Asia for China and local-for-local model to reduce cost and improve fill rates and on-time delivery. 
But we are just getting started in China, much like we are in new markets around the world. We've rolled out E-Commerce platforms in 4 new markets this year, including Mexico, Australia, New Zealand and Chile. And that's after doing the same in 14 new markets in 2015, bringing our total global E-Commerce sites to 30. 
We're building a global organization for the long haul. As I said earlier, funding these growing International markets may require additional investment in the short term. However, we believe they are central to our long-term goal of market leadership. 
In addition to Footwear and International, we're making investments in other key growth areas that will contribute and drive our ability to become a bigger and better company, including: retail, where we're ensuring that we deliver a great presentation of the brand wherever our consumer decides to transact. With SAP, we're creating efficiencies in our systems as we continue to grow and scale; in category management, where we are organizing around 9 sports categories and executive leadership to create focus and alignment across our business; and finally, merchandising, which enables us to differentiate our product to create unique experiences for our consumers across our points of distribution and now gives us the ability to reach more athletes than ever before. 
The third key, where we will continue to overinvest in the near term, is connected in fitness. We're doing so because we believe strongly that it'll prove an important differentiator in our relationship with the consumer. With nearly 190 million registered users in our community, we continue to gather critical information to help us change the way athletes live. We firmly believe that going forward, brands without substantive communities will be at a deficit when it comes to building a relationship with their consumer. 
We are investing in our single view of consumer through our partnership with SAP as we look to continuously drive a better business as we scale, knowing that much of the benefit will not be seen immediately. 
That said, we expect to see return on these investments starting in the near term with tools like self-service consumer comparison reporting, where we can quickly compare the demographic profile, workout habits and purchase behavior of any group of consumers. We are growing our analytics capabilities and moving from backward looking reporting to predictive and prescriptive analytics, which allow us to establish and drive growth in a more meaningful way. 
We will be able to personalize our E-Commerce homepage, driving off your demographic profile, which sports categories are important to you, your exercise, how frequently you exercise, sleep, weight, diet and the makeup of your household. 
Going forward, we will continue to dive into the data and leverage the insights to deepen and expand our relationship with athletes as their needs change. 
Our brand continues to evolve and shift with the changing demand and needs of the consumer. And as I said earlier, we're in an incredible industry where sports and health and fitness are driving forces in our success. 
Our investments, the ones we have made in the past and will continue to make in the years to come, are critical for us to realize the true potential of the UA brand. We are confident we are making the right investments and our track record of investing for growth is exceptional. Our investments are all about expansion of the brand, about opening the aperture of what we're capable of and never being satisfied with our past successes. 
So recently I pulled together the top leaders in the company and discussed the strategic growth and direction of Under Armour. We came away with 3 key areas of focus that I want to share with you today. 
First, getting big fast; second, making retail of core competency; and third, getting more shoes on feet. 
To be clear, get big fast does not mean at all cost. It means prioritizing our growth and making the right decisions for the brand, it means growing the right way. As I said earlier, we have succeeded over the past 20 years by consistently punching above our weight, and that will not change. But our growth now gives us opportunities to move up in a weight class. And we find ourselves well positioned at this moment in time to compete for long-term relationships with athletes, teams and league affiliation that we previously could not justify. 
Now with the flexibility to lock in 10- to 15-year deals, we can make investments on a global scale that will help drive authenticity, awareness and revenues for our brand. it is not going to be easy. The mix of our business is evolving, and so must we, which is why making retail a core competency is critical to our future success. We'll do that by answering the call of the consumer, who's asking us to give them more in the places that they expect to find our product. We are no longer just a North American apparel company. We are a retail company across multiple consumer touch points, and we'll look to be best-in-class. And when we know how to be a great retailer, we can leverage that expertise to help us be a better wholesale partner and therefore, continue to elevate and meet our consumer where and how they want to engage with us. 
So to summarize where this nets out, both International and footwear are growing faster in the near term than we had originally planned. And as a result, we remain confident in reaching our 2018 revenue target of $7.5 billion. 
While this mixed shift will create margin pressure, we have a significant opportunity to offset the sales mix impact by continuing to improve our footwear product margins over time, and we will. But the market share opportunity cannot wait. We will remain focused on getting more shoes on feet because we see footwear being as big, if not bigger, than apparel one day. And as we drive footwear revenue, the dynamics of the business do change, but that's a good thing because we are truly just getting started in footwear. 
So before I pass it to Chip, I just want to reiterate my confidence in the future of our industry and more specifically, how Under Armour, with the right investment and incredible brand momentum, will continue to lead and outpace the competition. 
As I said during my opening, I believe we operate in a resilient industry with strong competitors who will build global businesses over the course of many years. And while their sheer size poses consistent challenges for us and challenges we have consistently met and beaten, we believe that the monumental shift that is taking place in both the manufacturing of shoes and apparel and the way consumers buy our products is leveling the playing field and will enable us to build a bigger and better global brand. 
We've delivered great results on the path that has led us to this moment in time, 26 consecutive quarters of 20-plus percent revenue growth. During that stretch, we've established a culture of growth that equips us for this next chapter in our story. And today, we are reiterating our target of $7.5 billion of revenue for 2018. Our challenge is that we need to continue investing on multiple fronts and categories, geographies and the talent and infrastructure required to capture those growth opportunities, and that's why the dollars we are committing reflect a broader investment strategy. In the short term, these investments will impact our operating income growth, which Chip will walk you through in a moment. 
We understand that the path to industry leadership grows more complex as we expand in categories, channels and geographies. And I am confident we will remain the market leader in growth by delivering innovation at every touch point, a consumer has with our brand. 
Thank you. And I will pass it over to Chip."
8740684,403729229,1060112,"Under Armour, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2016",2016-10-25,"Earnings Calls","Under Armour, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Kevin. I would now like to spend some time when reviewing our third quarter 2016 financial results, followed by our updated outlook for the remainder of the year as well as our long-term outlook and initial guidance for next year. Our revenues f",1950,"Thanks, Kevin. I would now like to spend some time when reviewing our third quarter 2016 financial results, followed by our updated outlook for the remainder of the year as well as our long-term outlook and initial guidance for next year. 
Our revenues for the third quarter of 2016 increased 22% to $1.47 billion. On a currency-neutral basis, net revenues increased 23% compared with the prior year's period. Our ability to deliver another quarter of consistent growth is a direct result of continued investments we have made in the business to meet consumer expectations through categories, channels and geographies. 
As we continue to navigate through the changing dynamics of the North American retail landscape, we remain focused on solving problems for athletes all over the world and meeting the consumer with premium compelling product wherever they are interacting with our brand. 
During the third quarter, our wholesale sales revenues grew 19% to $1.01 billion. Our Direct-to-Consumer revenues grew 29% to $408 million, representing approximately 28% of total revenues for the quarter. 
During the quarter, licensing revenues grew 21% to $29 million and Connected Fitness revenues grew 40% to $20 million. 
On the product category front, apparel revenues increased 18% to $1.02 billion compared to $866 million in the prior year's quarter, led by consistent growth in our sport categories, including men's training, women's training, golf and team sports. 
Third quarter footwear revenues increased 42% to $279 million from $196 million in the prior year's quarter. 
Within running, we saw a strong global demand for the brand led by 2 of our new $100 price point product offerings, the Bandit 2 and Slingride, showcasing our continued focus in investment in these key category of long-term growth. 
In basketball, the Curry signature line continues to drive strong growth for the Under Armour Brand. 
Our accessories revenues during the third quarter increased 18% to $122 million from $104 million in the prior year's quarter, primarily driven by bags and headwear. 
On a regional basis, North American revenues in the third quarter increased 16% to $1.23 billion compared to $1.06 billion during the same period last year. 
Within our Direct-to-Consumer channel, our North American store count at the end of the quarter included 162 company-owned stores, comprised of 145 factory stores and 17 Brand House stores. With the opening of 3 new Brand Houses in the quarter, including Philadelphia, New York City World Trade Center and Madison, Wisconsin, we continue to invest in building and creating the best premium retail expression of our brand. 
International revenues increased 74% to $226 million in the third quarter to reach 15% of total revenues. On a currency-neutral basis, International revenues increased 80%. Within our International wholesale channel, the store count at the end of the quarter included 282 partner stores. 
Within our Direct-to-Consumer channel, our company-owned International store count at the end of the quarter included 63 stores, comprised of 32 Factory Houses and 31 Brand House stores. 
Looking at our International regions, starting with EMEA. We continue to post strong growth in the region as we expand our presence with key wholesale partners and distributors while building out our Direct-to-Consumer business. 
In the Asia Pacific region, our premium performance brand strategy continues to resonate with the consumer, driving strong growth in the quarter. As Kevin mentioned, we continue to see strong growth in basketball, led by the Stephen Curry signature line and believe we are well positioned to capitalize and scale the business in our fastest-growing region. 
And in Latin America, we drove incredible brand awareness in the region and around the globe through the strong performance of -- performances of our Olympic athletes. We remain focused on the long-term growth opportunity of this region as we continue to build and expand our distribution. 
Moving on to margins. Third quarter gross margins decreased 130 basis points to 47.5% compared to 48.8% in the prior year's period. The following items contributed the majority of the margin contraction this quarter: first, liquidations negatively impacted the quarter by approximately 80 basis points versus the prior year; second, product margins negatively impacted gross margin by approximately 30 basis points versus the prior year, driven by product mix, higher discounts and promotions, partially offset by continued improvement and product input cost; and finally, foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted gross margin by approximately 30 basis points. 
In the quarter, gross margin declined more than planned, driven predominantly by higher-than-expected promotions, both the volume and rate of liquidations and foreign exchange rates. 
Despite liquidations having been a headwind on margin rates for most of this year, we now believe that our inventory position is healthier and liquidation should not have the same negative impact moving forward. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses grew 20% to $499 million compared to $416 million during the third quarter of last year. Growth was predominantly driven by investments in our Direct-to-Consumer businesses, both retail and E-Commerce, along with the infrastructure and people necessary to support our growth and strategic initiatives such as product creation, innovation and sport category management. Selling, general and administrative expenses were less than planned in the quarter due to lower incentive compensation and the timing of marketing activations. A portion of the expected marketing spend shifted from the third quarter to the fourth quarter to better align with key initiatives, including the launch of Curry 3 that Kevin mentioned earlier. 
Operating income for the third quarter increased 16% to $199 million compared with $171 million in the prior year period. Interest expense for the third quarter increased to approximately $8 million compared to $4 million in the prior year's period. 
Within other income and expense, we recorded a loss of $1 million in the current year versus a loss of $3 million in the prior year. 
In addition, the tax rate in the third quarter was 32.6% compared to 38.8% in the prior year, largely due to improved international profitability in the current year period and the tax benefit related to our prior year acquisitions. 
Our third quarter net income increased 28% to $128 million compared to $100 million in the prior year period. 
On the balance sheet, total cash and cash equivalents for the quarter was $180 million compared with $159 million at September 30, 2015. 
Inventory for the quarter increased 12% to $971 million compared to $867 million while total debt increased to $1.07 billion as compared to $902 million. 
Looking at our cash flows. Our investment in capital expenditures was $73 million for the third quarter compared to $71 million in the prior year's period. We now expect to spend approximately $450 million for the full year, including investments on our global offices around the world, including our headquarters in Baltimore, our distribution centers, our SAP platform and global Direct-to-Consumer. 
Now moving on to our guidance for the remainder of the year. Based on our current visibility, we continue to expect full year 2016 net revenues of approximately $4.925 billion, representing growth of 24%, and operating income in the range of approximately $440 million to $445 million, representing growth of 8% to 9%. Gross margins for the full year is expected to decline approximately 80 basis points compared to last year, driven by the same factors that we have experienced through the year. 
Based on our outlook of $4.925 billion in revenues, SG&A is now expected to grow approximately 26% as we remain focused on making the right investments today to drive our long-term global success. 
Below the operating line, we expect interest expense to increase to approximately $30 million in 2016. In addition, we now expect the full year tax rate of approximately 35.5% and fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 446 million. 
I would also like to provide additional color on the fourth quarter. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenues to grow approximately 20%. We believe the strength of our brand and increased breadth of head-to-toe product offerings position us for another quarter of strong growth in what has been a challenging North American retail environment. With strong momentum in footwear and International, we remain focused on delivering key products and assortments for the holiday season. 
Gross margin is expected to be relatively flat versus prior year with an SG&A, as I mentioned earlier, the timing of certain marketing activations along with continued investment in long-term growth opportunities like Connected Fitness, International and Direct-to-Consumer will drive the growth in the quarter. For the fourth quarter, we expect operating income in the range of $186 million to $191 million, representing growth of 5% to 8% over the prior year. 
Before we turn it over to Q&A, we'd like to briefly discuss our long-term outlook and associated guidance for next year. At our 2015 Investor Day, we announced our goals of achieving $7.5 billion of revenues and $800 million of operating income by 2018. We are on track to achieve our 2018 revenue goal of $7.5 billion and expect to grow full year revenues consistently in the low-20s in both 2017 and 2018. 
At the same time, we expect annual operating income growth in the mid-teens each of the next 2 years as we focus on investing to get big fast. 
As Kevin highlighted earlier, the landscape for our business in our industry continues to evolve and in a fast-paced world, we must be willing to adapt, make game time decisions and drive our brand forward. North America apparel growth is slowing across the industry. While we expect to continue to significantly outpace the apparel industry, the growth rate going forward will be less than expected from our Investor Day in 2015. 
This is a moment in time. We could choose to optimize for more near-term profits, but we believe it is more prudent to invest to maintain superior growth rates while gaining both share and scale. Growth, share and scale are the priorities for our brand. That said, we will invest more heavily in areas that we can grow faster such as footwear, Direct-to-Consumer and International as well as more aggressively enter sport fashion like UAS and the much broader sports lifestyle category. 
In footwear, that means doubling down on creating great product through innovation and design, scaling and extending our pinnacle footwear franchising -- franchises and investing in the complete market strategy for merchandising to in-store marketing. 
In Direct-to-Consumer, we are driving investment in mobile, the optimization of the Factory House store footprint and building out premium Brand House expressions to help us drive market share. 
International growth includes being more aggressive in key markets where we are gaining significant awareness such as Asia. 
In the sports lifestyle category, we are accelerating investment in the people necessary to design relevant and brand right product. 
And finally, we will continue to make key investments in assets that promote the brand. 
Beyond 2018, we believe we have opportunities across categories, channels and geographies to consistently deliver superior revenue growth relative to our industry. We also that -- believe that as we approach $10 billion in revenues, the scale it provides, along with the investments we have made in people, infrastructure and systems, will begin to pay off in the form of increasing operating margin rates. 
As Kevin stated earlier, we've delivered great results from the path that has led us to this moment in time. The dollars we are committing reflect a broader investment strategy that will enable us to build a company as big as our brand. 
We would now like to open the call for your questions. Similar to our last earnings call, Dave Bergman, our SVP of Corporate Finance, will be joining us this morning to provide additional assistance with your questions. [Operator Instructions]"

And this is obviously an area that I want to spend a little time on and go deep, so give me a few minutes to really I think craft this for you. So as Chip just said in his commentary, we talked about building a business as big as",1838,"Yes. Thank you, Michael. And this is obviously an area that I want to spend a little time on and go deep, so give me a few minutes to really I think craft this for you. So as Chip just said in his commentary, we talked about building a business as big as our brand. We've had on our eye on $10 billion, that's the way that we see our company. I think it's the way that people view and judge as with $7.5 billion being our next milestone to be hit by 2018. And again, we want to reiterate that we're on track to hitting that goal. But there are a few factors that led to decision to modify the operating income for us since Investor Day September 2015. So what's happened and what's different? First of all, in North America, it's a place that's provided incredible air cover for our brand for a very long time. And I think like we're seeing a lot of places that, that it's modifying and it's changing. In the investments that we've made over the past 11 years as a public company, we've seen that our business thankfully has evolved from being strictly North American wholesale apparel brand into a global sports brand that also has the ability to claim International and footwear as probably 2 of our largest and greatest opportunities for growth. And all the while, I want to be clear, with apparel remaining incredibly profitable and still growing to the tune of 18% in just the third quarter for us. So this is not -- there's not an end to the North American apparel story. That continues to march on for us as well. We just have other opportunities that are outpacing some of that growth. So some of those opportunities like footwear and International, they are exceeding what we're putting up in 24-plus percent top line growth as a company. And that change in mix is modifying our gross margin story in the short term. So that means we're -- while we're doing better in footwear and International than we thought we weren't capable of doing, that we're fortunate to have these levers to pull and frankly attack as we maintain our industry-leading growth on the top line as well as continue to drive what we can in making the right investments and the right parts of our business. So what also has changed is our distribution. The fact that we've had 3 bankruptcies that have occurred in just the last 12 months in sporting goods that account for more than $4 billion in lost revenue for the sporting goods industry in North America and compare that relatively speaking that going all the way back to 2008/2009, there is just $170 million of bankruptcies, of loss revenue in our industry. So we saw something pretty big happened that we thought about, but it definitely has been eye-opening for us especially recently. And we want to be clear like our demand is still there, like this doesn't mean that the demand for the Under Armour Brand has disappeared, but it certainly hasn't reappeared dollar-for-dollar in our immediate distribution. We believe that the opportunity is also still there. We just have to be more thoughtful about how to capture the consumers and their dollars, including replacing with our own Direct-to-Consumer controlled retail as well as expanded distribution by doing things like Coles, which will carry the Under Armour product beginning in 2017.  We also plan to make additional investments in the places where we know that we can win. So right now, that moment in time is a very important message, I think, for obviously our shareholders, but frankly for our team and our consumer. Footwear and International are going to continue to be staples of our investment strategy because we think the opportunity for us now is to strike and strike hard. And we take the momentum of things like Curry, which is launching tonight. And I think you'll be pretty excited by what you see. And most importantly, the consumers are getting pretty excited about what this would be. We also have opportunities like lifestyle that, as we've talked about before on these calls, represents roughly 1/3 of the revenues of our 2 largest competitors and today, less than 5% of the business for Under Armour. Thirdly, Connected Fitness is continuing to be going to be an area that we'll invest in where we believe that redefining the expectation the consumer has of the sports brand with our data will give us perspective on our consumer that will be truly unmatched in our industry. Another factor that we've seen recently has been the escalation in the price and, frankly, the duration of sports marketing assets. The length of these deals has gone from standard 5-year deals arrangements to now 10- to 15-year deals. UCLA, one that we just wrapped up recently this past spring was the largest collegiate deal in history, but it's a 15-year partnership. And at the same time, we also locked up Cal Berkley and giving us a true position in California which, frankly, prior to that, we really didn't have. If we deem them strategic, the ability that was happening in the sports marketing as these assets are being wrapped up is either act now or lose them for, frankly, the mid to long term. This, of course, does not mean every deal, and I want to be clear, is that the shift in operating income for us is not about creating a bigger marketing budget, so we can go buy more stuff. It is about truly investing in our brand, our systems, our infrastructure and, especially, our team. I'll give you another example of that in just a minute. So all those things are just some of the tactical, but not to be ignored long-term strategic issues -- new issues that we're facing since September of 2015. And when you grow a business 20-plus percent a quarter for 6.5 years, it builds a unique profile that we find ourselves today, which means adding $1 billion and growing by year-end revenue and require significant resources and investment. But I want to be clear is that the growth remains intact. it just costs more short-term investment dollars to achieve and the belief is that greater efficiency can come later and that the growth that we have over the short-term EPS is a priority for our long-term goal of becoming the #1 sports brand in the world. And I want to reiterate that like we are in this for the long haul and the opportunity that we see is to be the best in the world. And that does require investment, and we know that people are going to like the way it sounds, but this is what -- I don't know if there's even been another model like ours at 6.5 years with the growth that we've seen, particularly in consumer. And so the book isn't written anywhere. And if it were, we'd have read it. But this is what we're telling you is that from our purview of 11 years public and what I've seen in our business that now is the time for us to strike because I think the upside is so much greater on the other side. So on relative basis, we believe the short-term dollar is better spent building our infrastructure, ensuring that we capture that '18 goal of $7.5 billion, especially once we achieve the scale of a $10 billion growth company, which will be when we can truly begin to leverage our model to optimize expanding gross margins, our SG&A investment and, ultimately, shareholder value. So one of the issues that I just -- I know people know this, but I think it's worthy of us to say that you face as a superior growth company, which Under Armour has always demonstrated its ability to be, is that operating growth of 15% for virtually any S&P or Fortune 500 business would be outstanding, but because our business is growing in the 20s, the profile that only a very few rare companies and either S&P our Fortune 500 and, frankly, not from our industry, from either [indiscernible] or tax share and where we still expect to deliver more than $0.5 billion of operating income profit in 2017 alone, so we're not saying we're losing money. We are moving and marching forward. Or in growth terms, that more than $0.5 billion is more than nearly 2x the total revenue we delivered in our IPO year of 2005, proving at our investments in things like footwear, women's and International have all paid off. But at the end of the day, look, we believe that by making these investments, the ability for us is to mature into a business as big as our brand. So we want to drive best-in-class profitability. As our business indiscernible] scale, our growth rates become more measured. And we've got the people, distribution, systems and infrastructure to optimize. Today, we have pieces of it. But frankly, it's just incomplete and that's why we must continue to invest. I want to give some perspective here for a second just on where we are. And I mean Under Armour's -- we dropped into the sporting brand pond about 20 years ago, and we jumped in and there were a lot of players, 20, 30 players or brands as many as you want. Today, we're the third largest brand in the world. We're the second largest brand in North America. And our 2 largest competitors have more than 20,000 points of distribution each in North America alone compared to just our 11,000, which speaks to just some the runway that we still have in front of us right here on our own backyard. They're also 6 and 4x our size, respectively. So let me give you a realtime example of what that means. It means in an area like women's footwear, where we currently have just 6 teammates on our women's footwear team based in Portland who are doing an amazing job for us and is building best-in-class product, our competitors who we get compared to on a 1:1 basis have dozens or even hundreds of people covering the same category. It's our responsibility through our long-term growth objective of being #1 in Youth, in Men's and, of course, women's across all categories to continue to invest to meet that long-term goal. So I want to be clear is that we have a saying around here, it's called the ""No loser talk"" and it's the last thing we would  ever do. And I want our share shareholders to know how hard this company fights for every single dollar at the bottom line, but how we're looking honestly at this moment in time and saying it's time for us to invest. We have the best team and we've got the best brand. And we expect to continue to grow."

So first of all, we're seeing a tough story that, as we look or think about North America, you've heard a couple people talk about it. And again, it's -- nothing is going away, but it's definitely been reflective in just some of the bankruptcies and the other things that we've seen recently. The people we're doing business with, I believe, are doing very well. And they're getting very smarter about the way they're managing and running their business. But it's definitely -- it's -- you're not finding our accounts that are taking big inventory positions and betting on the cold weather. So those are the things that are leading for us, which are requiring us to run into drive a better business. Today, I will define Under Armour as a great brand and as a great brand with a -- but a -- probably a good company. The opportunity we have as things like what we see with some of the speed to manufacturing, things like -- recently, when we announced our partnership at City Garage here in Baltimore where we talked about a local-for-local strategy, which means bringing manufacturing back to the United States. And again, that's not a made in U.S.A. initiative as much as initiative for us about making great product anywhere is the people of America want product made in America. The people of Europe want the same. The people in Sao Paulo want product from Brazil. So we're going to continue to answer that and look to drive on that answer. But there's a lot of investment on the front-end. The good news is that the sad thing about our industry is that a certain shoe or sole made the exact same way they were 100 years ago, and we see a massive opportunity for that to improve. So some of the things I talked about in my script and my comments was how that we had the ability, I think, to accelerate the speed at which innovation can happen there. Right now, to make a single shoe, for instance, it takes upwards of 300 pairs a hand to make a single shoe. So we think there's a lot of room for innovation. We're finding a lot about -- that about ourselves and I think that's continuing to move for us as well."

But over time, as we start to gain more and more scale, we'll see that gross margin improvement. And on top of that, as we get more into lifestyle, we'll see more gross margin as well. So once we start to get towards $10 billion, we'll see gross margin. At the same time, that's when we should really start to be able to leverage our expense structure. We're investing across the world. We're investing in offices. We're investing in IT systems. We're investing in distribution capacity. All of those things that are happening today and will continue to happen over the next couple of years. But we will start to see that leverage, so it becomes sort of a perfect storm once we get to $10 billion. And we'll start to see operating income margin expansion. And I think we'll head towards more the premium level versus the other person or the other competitor that you're speaking with."

At the same time, we're already seeing improvements in our footwear margins, and we'll continue to see those improvements. And so net-net, we think we can overcome that mix shift through the improvements we're seeing on the costing side for the next couple of years. But net-net, it will be flat. Then as we start to approach $10 billion, as I mentioned earlier, that's when we believe that we will have the scale.

So Under Armour today, we're in the low to mid-30s when it comes to our footwear gross margin that nets out compared to our competitors, which are 10% or roughly 1000 bps in front of us. And so we've made great strides in the last couple of years, actually taking hundreds of points of gross margin and flowing that back. And we see great opportunity as well. And so there's no secret sauce that someone else has that we don't. It's been time. It's been energy and experience. And frankly, I've just gotten back from a trip from Asia about 4, 5 weeks ago and seeing the investment that our manufacturing partners are making us throughout China, but also through Vietnam and the Philippines, where you're seeing a lot of these new facilities going up. There is a great belief in a company and a brand like Under Armour that, just a couple of years ago, I think, for us is important to lay out. Last year, we made 30 million pairs of shoes. 2016, we'll make 40 million pairs of shoes. Obviously, you hear how bullish we are on footwear, so that number is increasing. And again, that's impressive, but it still compares to the hundreds of millions of pairs of shoes that are made by our competitors. So as we build scale, this will naturally come onboard as well as will help with people like Colin Browne and -- who's our new President of Sourcing and some of the things that we'll do driving some these initiatives. So we see there's great opportunity in gross margin and this is nothing that we're laying back and there's no excuse for what we're doing with operating income as it relates to -- or the way that we're attacking gross margin across the board."

This was specifically called out to make sure that it gets the emphasis it needs. Pam Catlett is leading that. She's an industry vet and has been a complete pro in bringing the pieces together. But there's a lot of pieces to bring together. Probably the best thing I could say is when you talk about our women's business, we have $1 billion women's brand. It's taken us one heck of a long time to get here, but we're incredibly proud of what that means. And -- but I think probably looking at women's through the lens of -- I gave the example about footwear in one of my earlier answers, and we have 6 people in our women's footwear team. We just built our first women's [indiscernible] year for the first time. And those are the things from an operating income standpoint I want to say is that when people say you don't have enough -- people dress toe to head, where they start with their shoe. But if the shoe isn't right, if the fit isn't right, if the color isn't right, we don't have the right team. The reason we didn't build the women's last before is because we were focused on the ability that we couldn't afford it. And so we're making a lot of those small decisions right now that we truly believe that making into -- looking at 2017, 2018, making the investment as unfortunately and fortunately because our growth rate is so great, it creates that drag. But making this right investment in footwear is important. So let me go back with women is that one thing we think is incredibly important is that the football cleated opportunity and what we're doing being the #1 cleat there isn't doing much for the women's category. But the confidence that we're demonstrating in running from our knit products, this is the -- again, this will be the first year in a market that will have that women's [indiscernible] on people's feet -- on women's feet. And we also think that as we continue to drive more better products for, driving both performance, style, strength and beauty, the focuses we'll have. And so I think we've got a terrific team in place. We are investing in our women's team as well. We think footwear will be one of the catalyst for it. But achieving $1 billion business in women's is a pretty big feet and it's something we're certainly not stopping or  satisfied with."

We are a growth company, and with our 26th consecutive quarter of 20-plus percent revenue growth, we continue to demonstrate our ability to drive a bigger and better company quarter after quarter. Our financi",3194,"Thank you, Carrie, and good morning, everyone. We are a growth company, and with our 26th consecutive quarter of 20-plus percent revenue growth, we continue to demonstrate our ability to drive a bigger and better company quarter after quarter. Our financial results are an incredible accomplishment for any brand and something that we believe separates us from others in our business. 
Today, I'd like to start by giving some perspective on our industry and articulate what that means for Under Armour in this moment in time. 
I believe we operate in a truly resilient industry. The athletic apparel and footwear business and in broader context, sports, has been one of the most dynamic and strongest growing industries in our lifetime. As we continue to immerse ourselves in strategic and long-term growth, we ensure that we will continue to drive in an industry with various entry today that are much higher than 1996 when I drove my old Ford Explorer door-to-door to teams, selling T-shirts out of the back. 
Our industry's collective ability to continue to evolve and make better product that improves an athlete's performance, bring the passion of the sports experience to consumers through our brand storytelling and to do so with increasing profitability on a global basis is a reflection of what has been an ever-growing demand for consumers that our industry has met with outstanding financial results. 
Those measures of success are not as commonplace in other industries that are sometimes viewed as more stable or secure investments. Today, brands that 5 years ago were viewed as leaders in our field are in danger of being commoditized, disruptive or worse, becoming extinct as technology and the way we live changes the way consumers need and value them. 
Our industry of sport is different. Our industry's growth opportunities are global, with consumers around the world embracing athletic Apparel and Footwear at its historic levels. It's not about what people are conveniently referring to as athleisure. It's the simple truth that consumers all over the world are raising expectations about what to expect from their Apparel and Footwear and is a shift that is not going to be reversed. 
The macro trend has favored not just us, but all the premium brands on our business, which is part of the reason, I believe, our industry will continue to gain new and loyal consumers across the globe. 
In the sports industry, we represent something truly attainable, measurable and sought after by most consumers to live a better, healthier life. Under Armour's mission is to make all athletes better. And we are fortunate enough to be in an industry that will withstand and maintain its relevancy over time because our value proposition enriches consumers' lives and help them reach their personal health and fitness goals. 
But our track record of growth and the power of the UA brand provides us with the confidence that we can do more. That track record is one of which we are extremely proud. Over the past 3 years, Under Armour is the only consumer brand in the top 10 fastest-growing companies in the S&P 500 with total revenue increasing 116% through 2015. We have the capacity to lead our industry over the next 10 years by continuing to take our consumer someplace new with our constant flow of product and innovation while at the same time improving their lives through our Connected Fitness platform, which will pass our 2016 goal of reaching over 190 million registered users by the end of this week. 
For UA, we have punched above our weight for a long time, and that has been essential theme of our success. That's not going to change. We compete in an industry that is measured by a few very high standards. We're measured by the innovative product we bring to consumers, by the strength and relevancy of our brand, by the talent of our team and, of course, by a financial results we deliver. 
While our business is in constant evolution, we know the standards won't change. We also know that we can't look for old models of success that have helped establish some of our competitors in their existing position. 
So I want to spend some time this morning talking about how we will operate as the world evolves around us and ensure we are investing to continue to drive forward-industry leadership on every front. 
As I've stated numerous times on these calls, footwear and International will be key drivers of our revenue growth. Our footwear business went from $239 million in 2012 to approaching $1 billion in revenue this year. And our International revenues grew from $108 million in 2012 to more than $700 million this year. That's clear evidence that our investments in footwear and International have driven strong revenue growth to date and fuels our confidence that we are just getting started in each of these areas. 
I'll talk about our focus there in just a minute, but first, I want to talk about the core of our business, North America. 
We built our brand and our business with the best wholesale partners in the industry, and we are incredibly proud of both our growth and our partnerships across the market. There's no doubt that the landscape globally and certainly, in our North American backyard is shifting. As we navigate this dynamic environment, our intention is to continue to evolve and grow in the places that have built our brand while we simultaneously reach a broader set of consumers through new avenues of distribution. We believe consumers expect excellence at every touch point with our brand, and you will see us invest to ensure that we drive growth with our long-term partners at the same time that we invest in new distribution through our own Direct-to-Consumer experiences. 
As we think about the many dimensions of growth for our company, we are incredibly confident in the opportunity we see for our North America business. Consider this, our 2 largest competitors generate approximately $18 billion in revenue in North America over just the past 12 months. So while we recognize that our trailing 12-month North American revenues of $3.95 billion is 85% of our business, it is just a fraction of the opportunity that we believe exist for our brand. Whether through share gains, market growth, new distribution or sheer brand heat, we know we have tremendous runway in our home market. We'll drive growth by the measures you'd expect, innovative product, brand strength and relevance and the best team in the industry to drive market-leading results. 
A large part of that growth in North America will come from footwear as we firmly believe that we are at the tipping point in terms of opportunities to gain market share. 
In the back-to-school window of July through September, our overall footwear market share nearly doubled according to industry data. 
So while we've always understood that the size of the prize in footwear was massive, we knew coming into this year that there were a lot of consumers in U.S. who didn't know us as a footwear brand. So this summer, we launched our It Came from Below Footwear Campaign, which focused on the importance of footwork as athletes train. We started with Bryce Harper in baseball. And for running, we hosted a UA Run Camp, where we took experienced men and women from urban run-throughs and put them and their Under Armour footwear to the ultimate test in the world's toughest conditions. 
With the start of NFL season in early September, we incorporated NFL MVP, Cam Newton, with the Prince of a Thousand Enemies' spot and the launch of the game on SnapChat with Cam that drove incredible engagement. 
The final piece of our footwear campaign debuts today with the launch of the Curry 3. The TV spot debuts tonight on TNT during opening night of the NBA season, combined with our second tour of Asia where we took Steph into 4 cities in early September, we are continuing to build our relationship with the basketball consumer and driving awareness of UA as a footwear brand by partnering with the 2-time NBA MVP. 
So while Stephen has been a big part of building our footwear story, we're also having success in other areas that are contributing to the growth. The highlight is the #1 football cleat in the market 4 years running now and continues to showcase our ability to elevate and drive premium footwear in every category we chose to be in. We made our first football cleat in 2006, and since then, have changed the look of the entire category while elevating the price. 
This type of market evolution and positioning in cleated underscores our opportunity in other footwear category as we gain awareness, credibility, capabilities and scale. 
We are focused on the exploding running market in China, and we saw a great success there with the Bandit 2 running shoe, an example of how we are building key footwear platform that will continue to scale and expand.
We are improving our ability to leverage our global assets and help drive business in local markets. And we continue to focus on being a premium brand in footwear, with the goal of having more than 50% of our volume in running footwear over $100 by just spring of next year. 
We saw incredible demand for our Slingride product offering during the third quarter. Slingride is our second running shoe utilizing a full knit upper to deliver comfort and fit where you need it. Priced at $100, it did extremely well in the market. And we believe there's great opportunity in what knit can mean for Under Armour running. 
So we will continue to invest meaningfully in our footwear business with a focus on talent as well as infrastructure that will help improve the profitability in our business as we scale. We believe we are at a moment in time where we can gain share in footwear. And we are prepared to make investments that will drive long-term, profitable growth. 
That same focus on the long-term opportunity holds true for our investments as we build out our International business. We continue to post strong growth across all our geographies. While our business in EMEA continues to be strong, it's our Greater China market that remains the biggest growth story for our International business. 
Posting revenue in the third quarter equal to the entire first half of the year and firmly on a path to more than double their business from $80 million just a year ago, we are making incredible inroads in China that we believe will drive our position in this critical market. With sports and fitness being promoted strongly by the government, we continue to be viewed by the Chinese consumer as the performance brand or referred to often as the professional brand. Some of the things we're doing in China include: focusing on building premium brand houses with a controlled retail environment and a sustainable full-price business model, where we've already opened over 100 doors this year; driving a strong E-Commerce channel presence and utilizing an Asia for China and local-for-local model to reduce cost and improve fill rates and on-time delivery. 
But we are just getting started in China, much like we are in new markets around the world. We've rolled out E-Commerce platforms in 4 new markets this year, including Mexico, Australia, New Zealand and Chile. And that's after doing the same in 14 new markets in 2015, bringing our total global E-Commerce sites to 30. 
We're building a global organization for the long haul. As I said earlier, funding these growing International markets may require additional investment in the short term. However, we believe they are central to our long-term goal of market leadership. 
In addition to Footwear and International, we're making investments in other key growth areas that will contribute and drive our ability to become a bigger and better company, including: retail, where we're ensuring that we deliver a great presentation of the brand wherever our consumer decides to transact. With SAP, we're creating efficiencies in our systems as we continue to grow and scale; in category management, where we are organizing around 9 sports categories and executive leadership to create focus and alignment across our business; and finally, merchandising, which enables us to differentiate our product to create unique experiences for our consumers across our points of distribution and now gives us the ability to reach more athletes than ever before. 
The third key, where we will continue to overinvest in the near term, is connected in fitness. We're doing so because we believe strongly that it'll prove an important differentiator in our relationship with the consumer. With nearly 190 million registered users in our community, we continue to gather critical information to help us change the way athletes live. We firmly believe that going forward, brands without substantive communities will be at a deficit when it comes to building a relationship with our consumer. 
We are investing in our single view of consumer through our partnership with SAP as we look to continuously drive a better business as we scale, knowing that much of the benefit will not be seen immediately. 
That said, we expect to see return on these investments starting in the near term with tools like self-service consumer comparison reporting, where we can quickly compare the demographic profile, workout habits and purchase behavior of any group of consumers. We are growing our analytics capabilities and moving from backward looking reporting to predictive and prescriptive analytics, which allow us to establish and drive growth in a more meaningful way. 
We will be able to personalize our E-Commerce homepage, driving off your demographic profile, which sports categories are important to you, your exercise, how frequently you exercise, sleep, weight, diet and the makeup of your household. 
Going forward, we will continue to dive into the data and leverage the insights to deepen and expand our relationship with athletes as their needs change. 
Our brand continues to evolve and shift with the changing demand and needs of the consumer. And as I said earlier, we're in an incredible industry where sports and health and fitness are driving forces in our success. 
Our investments, the ones we have made in the past and will continue to make in the years to come, are critical for us to realize the true potential of the UA brand. We are confident we are making the right investments and our track record of investing for growth is exceptional. Our investments are all about expansion of the brand, about opening the aperture of what we're capable of and never being satisfied with our past successes. 
So recently I pulled together the top leaders in the company and discussed the strategic growth and direction of Under Armour. We came away with 3 key areas of focus that I want to share with you today. 
First, getting big fast; second, making retail a core competency; and third, getting more shoes on feet. 
To be clear, get big fast does not mean at all cost. It means prioritizing our growth and making the right decisions for the brand, it means growing the right way. As I said earlier, we have succeeded over the past 20 years by consistently punching above our weight, and that will not change. But our growth now gives us opportunities to move up in a weight class. And we find ourselves well positioned at this moment in time to compete for long-term relationships with athletes, teams and league affiliation that we previously could not justify. 
Now with the flexibility to lock in 10- to 15-year deals, we can make investments on a global scale that will help drive authenticity, awareness and revenues for our brand. it is not going to be easy. The mix of our business is evolving, and so must we, which is why making retail a core competency is critical to our future success. We'll do that by answering the call of the consumer, who's asking us to give them more in the places that they expect to find our product. We are no longer just a North American apparel company. We are a retail company across multiple consumer touch points, and we'll look to be best-in-class. And when we know how to be a great retailer, we can leverage that expertise to help us be a better wholesale partner and therefore, continue to elevate and meet our consumer where and how they want to engage with us. 
So to summarize where this nets out, both International and footwear are growing faster in the near term than we had originally planned. And as a result, we remain confident in reaching our 2018 revenue target of $7.5 billion. 
While this mixed shift will create margin pressure, we have a significant opportunity to offset the sales mix impact by continuing to improve our footwear product margins over time, and we will. But the market share opportunity cannot wait. We will remain focused on getting more shoes on feet because we see footwear being as big, if not bigger, than apparel one day. And as we drive footwear revenue, the dynamics of the business do change, but that's a good thing because we are truly just getting started in footwear. 
So before I pass it to Chip, I just want to reiterate my confidence in the future of our industry and more specifically, how Under Armour, with the right investment and incredible brand momentum, will continue to lead and outpace the competition. 
As I said during my opening, I believe we operate in a resilient industry with strong competitors who will build global businesses over the course of many years. And while their sheer size poses consistent challenges for us and challenges we have consistently met and beaten, we believe that the monumental shift that is taking place in both the manufacturing of shoes and apparel and the way consumers buy our products is leveling the playing field and will enable us to build a bigger and better global brand. 
We've delivered great results on the path that has led us to this moment in time, 26 consecutive quarters of 20-plus percent revenue growth. During that stretch, we've established a culture of growth that equips us for this next chapter in our story. And today, we are reiterating our target of $7.5 billion of revenue for 2018. Our challenge is that we need to continue investing on multiple fronts in categories, geographies and the talent and infrastructure required to capture those growth opportunities, and that's why the dollars we are committing reflect a broader investment strategy. In the short term, these investments will impact our operating income growth, which Chip will walk you through in a moment. 
We understand that the path to industry leadership grows more complex as we expand in categories, channels and geographies. And I am confident we will remain the market leader in growth by delivering innovation at every touch point, a consumer has with our brand. 
Thank you. And I will pass it over to Chip."
8740684,403729229,1060311,"Under Armour, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2016",2016-10-25,"Earnings Calls","Under Armour, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Kevin. I would now like to spend some time when reviewing our third quarter 2016 financial results, followed by our updated outlook for the remainder of the year as well as our long-term outlook and initial guidance for next year. Our revenues f",1949,"Thanks, Kevin. I would now like to spend some time when reviewing our third quarter 2016 financial results, followed by our updated outlook for the remainder of the year as well as our long-term outlook and initial guidance for next year. 
Our revenues for the third quarter of 2016 increased 22% to $1.47 billion. On a currency-neutral basis, net revenues increased 23% compared with the prior year's period. Our ability to deliver another quarter of consistent growth is a direct result of continued investments we have made in the business to meet consumer expectations through categories, channels and geographies. 
As we continue to navigate through the changing dynamics of the North American retail landscape, we remain focused on solving problems for athletes all over the world and meeting the consumer with premium compelling product wherever they are interacting with our brand. 
During the third quarter, our wholesale revenues grew 19% to $1.01 billion. Our Direct-to-Consumer revenues grew 29% to $408 million, representing approximately 28% of total revenues for the quarter. 
During the quarter, licensing revenues grew 21% to $29 million and Connected Fitness revenues grew 40% to $20 million. 
On the product category front, apparel revenues increased 18% to $1.02 billion compared to $866 million in the prior year's quarter, led by consistent growth in our sport categories, including men's training, women's training, golf and team sports. 
Third quarter footwear revenues increased 42% to $279 million from $196 million in the prior year's quarter. 
Within running, we saw a strong global demand for the brand led by 2 of our new $100 price point product offerings, the Bandit 2 and Slingride, showcasing our continued focus in investment in these key category of long-term growth. 
In basketball, the Curry signature line continues to drive strong growth for the Under Armour Brand. 
Our accessories revenues during the third quarter increased 18% to $122 million from $104 million in the prior year's quarter, primarily driven by bags and headwear. 
On a regional basis, North American revenues in the third quarter increased 16% to $1.23 billion compared to $1.06 billion during the same period last year. 
Within our Direct-to-Consumer channel, our North American store count at the end of the quarter included 162 company-owned stores, comprised of 145 factory stores and 17 Brand House stores. With the opening of 3 new Brand Houses in the quarter, including Philadelphia, New York City World Trade Center and Madison, Wisconsin, we continue to invest in building and creating the best premium retail expression of our brand. 
International revenues increased 74% to $226 million in the third quarter to reach 15% of total revenues. On a currency-neutral basis, International revenues increased 80%. Within our International wholesale channel, the store count at the end of the quarter included 282 partner stores. 
Within our Direct-to-Consumer channel, our company-owned International store count at the end of the quarter included 63 stores, comprised of 32 Factory Houses and 31 Brand House stores. 
Looking at our International regions, starting with EMEA. We continue to post strong growth in the region as we expand our presence with key wholesale partners and distributors while building out our Direct-to-Consumer business. 
In the Asia Pacific region, our premium performance brand strategy continues to resonate with the consumer, driving strong growth in the quarter. As Kevin mentioned, we continue to see strong growth in basketball, led by the Stephen Curry signature line and believe we are well positioned to capitalize and scale the business in our fastest-growing region. 
And in Latin America, we drove incredible brand awareness in the region and around the globe through the strong performance of -- performances of our Olympic athletes. We remain focused on the long-term growth opportunity of this region as we continue to build and expand our distribution. 
Moving on to margins. Third quarter gross margins decreased 130 basis points to 47.5% compared to 48.8% in the prior year's period. The following items contributed the majority of the margin contraction this quarter: first, liquidations negatively impacted the quarter by approximately 80 basis points versus the prior year; second, product margins negatively impacted gross margin by approximately 30 basis points versus the prior year, driven by product mix, higher discounts and promotions, partially offset by continued improvement in product input cost; and finally, foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted gross margin by approximately 30 basis points. 
In the quarter, gross margin declined more than planned, driven predominantly by higher-than-expected promotions, both the volume and rate of liquidations and foreign exchange rates. 
Despite liquidations having been a headwind on margin rates for most of this year, we now believe that our inventory position is healthier and liquidation should not have the same negative impact moving forward. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses grew 20% to $499 million compared to $416 million during the third quarter of last year. Growth was predominantly driven by investments in our Direct-to-Consumer businesses, both retail and E-Commerce, along with the infrastructure and people necessary to support our growth and strategic initiatives such as product creation, innovation and sport category management. Selling, general and administrative expenses were less than planned in the quarter due to lower incentive compensation and the timing of marketing activations. A portion of the expected marketing spend shifted from the third quarter to the fourth quarter to better align with key initiatives, including the launch of Curry 3 that Kevin mentioned earlier. 
Operating income for the third quarter increased 16% to $199 million compared with $171 million in the prior year period. Interest expense for the third quarter increased to approximately $8 million compared to $4 million in the prior year's period. 
Within other income and expense, we recorded a loss of $1 million in the current year versus a loss of $3 million in the prior year. 
In addition, the tax rate in the third quarter was 32.6% compared to 38.8% in the prior year, largely due to improved international profitability in the current year period and the tax benefit related to our prior year acquisitions. 
Our third quarter net income increased 28% to $128 million compared to $100 million in the prior year period. 
On the balance sheet, total cash and cash equivalents for the quarter was $180 million compared with $159 million at September 30, 2015. 
Inventory for the quarter increased 12% to $971 million compared to $867 million while total debt increased to $1.07 billion as compared to $902 million. 
Looking at our cash flows. Our investment in capital expenditures was $73 million for the third quarter compared to $71 million in the prior year's period. We now expect to spend approximately $450 million for the full year, including investments on our global offices around the world, including our headquarters in Baltimore, our distribution centers, our SAP platform and global Direct-to-Consumer. 
Now moving on to our guidance for the remainder of the year. Based on our current visibility, we continue to expect full year 2016 net revenues of approximately $4.925 billion, representing growth of 24%, and operating income in the range of approximately $440 million to $445 million, representing growth of 8% to 9%. Gross margins for the full year is expected to decline approximately 80 basis points compared to last year, driven by the same factors that we have experienced through the year. 
Based on our outlook of $4.925 billion in revenues, SG&A is now expected to grow approximately 26% as we remain focused on making the right investments today to drive our long-term global success. 
Below the operating line, we expect interest expense to increase to approximately $30 million in 2016. In addition, we now expect the full year tax rate of approximately 35.5% and fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 446 million. 
I would also like to provide additional color on the fourth quarter. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenues to grow approximately 20%. We believe the strength of our brand and increased breadth of head-to-toe product offerings position us for another quarter of strong growth in what has been a challenging North American retail environment. With strong momentum in footwear and International, we remain focused on delivering key products and assortments for the holiday season. 
Gross margin is expected to be relatively flat versus prior year with an SG&A, as I mentioned earlier, the timing of certain marketing activations along with continued investment in long-term growth opportunities like Connected Fitness, International and Direct-to-Consumer will drive the growth in the quarter. For the fourth quarter, we expect operating income in the range of $186 million to $191 million, representing growth of 5% to 8% over the prior year. 
Before we turn it over to Q&A, we'd like to briefly discuss our long-term outlook and associated guidance for next year. At our 2015 Investor Day, we announced our goals of achieving $7.5 billion of revenues and $800 million of operating income by 2018. We are on track to achieve our 2018 revenue goal of $7.5 billion and expect to grow full year revenues consistently in the low-20s in both 2017 and 2018. 
At the same time, we expect annual operating income growth in the mid-teens each of the next 2 years as we focus on investing to get big fast. 
As Kevin highlighted earlier, the landscape for our business in our industry continues to evolve and in a fast-paced world, we must be willing to adapt, make game time decisions and drive our brand forward. North America apparel growth is slowing across the industry. While we expect to continue to significantly outpace the apparel industry, the growth rate going forward will be less than expected from our Investor Day in 2015. 
This is a moment in time. We could choose to optimize for more near-term profits, but we believe it is more prudent to invest to maintain superior growth rates while gaining both share and scale. Growth, share and scale are the priorities for our brand. That said, we will invest more heavily in areas that we can grow faster such as footwear, Direct-to-Consumer and International as well as more aggressively enter sport fashion like UAS and the much broader sports lifestyle category. 
In footwear, that means doubling down on creating great product through innovation and design, scaling and extending our pinnacle footwear franchising -- franchises and investing in the complete market strategy for merchandising to in-store marketing. 
In Direct-to-Consumer, we are driving investment in mobile, the optimization of the Factory House store footprint and building out premium Brand House expressions to help us drive market share. 
International growth includes being more aggressive in key markets where we are gaining significant awareness such as Asia. 
In the sports lifestyle category, we are accelerating investment in the people necessary to design relevant and brand right product. 
And finally, we will continue to make key investments in assets that promote the brand. 
Beyond 2018, we believe we have opportunities across categories, channels and geographies to consistently deliver superior revenue growth relative to our industry. We also that -- believe that as we approach $10 billion in revenues, the scale it provides, along with the investments we have made in people, infrastructure and systems, will begin to pay off in the form of increasing operating margin rates. 
As Kevin stated earlier, we've delivered great results from the path that has led us to this moment in time. The dollars we are committing reflect a broader investment strategy that will enable us to build a company as big as our brand. 
We would now like to open the call for your questions. Similar to our last earnings call, Dave Bergman, our SVP of Corporate Finance, will be joining us this morning to provide additional assistance with your questions. [Operator Instructions]"

And this is obviously an area that I want to spend a little time on and go deep, so give me a few minutes to really I think craft this for you. So as Chip just said in his commentary, we talked about building a business as big as",1837,"Yes. Thank you, Michael. And this is obviously an area that I want to spend a little time on and go deep, so give me a few minutes to really I think craft this for you. So as Chip just said in his commentary, we talked about building a business as big as our brand. We've had on our eye on $10 billion, that's the way that we see our company. I think it's the way that people view and judge as with $7.5 billion being our next milestone to be hit by 2018. And again, we want to reiterate that we're on track to hitting that goal. But there are a few factors that led to decision to modify the operating income for us since Investor Day September 2015. So what's happened and what's different? First of all, in North America, it's a place that's provided incredible air cover for our brand for a very long time. And I think like we're seeing a lot of places that, that it's modifying and it's changing. In the investments that we've made over the past 11 years as a public company, we've seen that our business thankfully has evolved from being strictly North American wholesale apparel brand into a global sports brand that also has the ability to claim International and footwear as probably 2 of our largest and greatest opportunities for growth. And all the while, I want to be clear, with apparel remaining incredibly profitable and still growing to the tune of 18% in just the third quarter for us. So this is not -- there's not an end to the North American apparel story. That continues to march on for us as well. We just have other opportunities that are outpacing some of that growth. So some of those opportunities like footwear and International, they are exceeding what we're putting up in 24-plus percent top line growth as a company. And that change in mix is modifying our gross margin story in the short term. So that means we're -- while we're doing better in footwear and International than we thought we were capable of doing, that we're fortunate to have these levers to pull and frankly attack as we maintain our industry-leading growth on the top line as well as continue to drive what we can in making the right investments in the right parts of our business. So what also has changed is our distribution. The fact that we've had 3 bankruptcies that have occurred in just the last 12 months in sporting goods that account for more than $4 billion in lost revenue for the sporting goods industry in North America and compare that relatively speaking that going all the way back to 2008/2009, there is just $170 million of bankruptcies, of loss revenue in our industry. So we saw something pretty big happened that we thought about, but it definitely has been eye-opening for us especially recently. And we want to be clear like our demand is still there, like this doesn't mean that the demand for the Under Armour Brand has disappeared, but it certainly hasn't reappeared dollar-for-dollar in our immediate distribution. We believe that the opportunity is also still there. We just have to be more thoughtful about how to capture the consumers and their dollars, including replacing with our own Direct-to-Consumer controlled retail as well as expanded distribution by doing things like Coles, which will carry the Under Armour product beginning in 2017. We also plan to make additional investments in the places where we know that we can win. So right now, that moment in time is a very important message, I think, for obviously our shareholders, but frankly for our team and our consumer. Footwear and International are going to continue to be staples of our investment strategy because we think the opportunity for us now is to strike and strike hard. And we take the momentum of things like Curry, which is launching tonight. And I think you'll be pretty excited by what you see. And most importantly, the consumers are getting pretty excited about what they see. We also have opportunities like lifestyle that, as we've talked about before on these calls, represents roughly 1/3 of the revenues of our 2 largest competitors and today, less than 5% of the business for Under Armour. Thirdly, Connected Fitness is continuing to be going to be an area that we'll invest in where we believe that redefining the expectation the consumer has of the sports brand with our data will give us perspective on our consumer that will be truly unmatched in our industry. Another factor that we've seen recently has been the escalation in the price and, frankly, the duration of sports marketing assets. The length of these deals has gone from standard 5-year deals arrangements to now 10- to 15-year deals. UCLA, one that we just wrapped up recently this past spring was the largest collegiate deal in history, but it's a 15-year partnership. And at the same time, we also locked up Cal Berkley and giving us a true position in California which, frankly, prior to that, we really didn't have. If we deem them strategic, the ability that was happening in the sports marketing as these assets are being wrapped up is either act now or lose them for, frankly, the mid to long term. This, of course, does not mean every deal, and I want to be clear, is that the shift in operating income for us is not about creating a bigger marketing budget, so we can go buy more stuff. It is about truly investing in our brand, our systems, our infrastructure and, especially, our team. I'll give you another example of that in just a minute. So all those things are just some of the tactical, but not to be ignored long-term strategic issues -- new issues that we're facing since September of 2015. And when you grow a business 20-plus percent a quarter for 6.5 years, it builds a unique profile that we find ourselves today, which means adding $1 billion and growing a year-end revenue and require significant resources and investment. But I want to be clear is that the growth remains intact. it just costs more short-term investment dollars to achieve and the belief is that greater efficiency can come later and that the growth that we have over the short-term EPS is a priority for our long-term goal of becoming the #1 sports brand in the world. And I want to reiterate that like we are in this for the long haul and the opportunity that we see is to be the best in the world. And that does require investment, and we know that people aren't going to like the way it sounds, but this is what -- I don't know if there's even been another model like ours at 6.5 years with the growth that we've seen, particularly in consumer. And so the book isn't written anywhere. And if it were, we'd have read it. But this is what we're telling you is that from our purview of 11 years public and what I've seen in our business that now is the time for us to strike because I think the upside is so much greater on the other side. So on relative basis, we believe the short-term dollar is better spent building our infrastructure, ensuring that we capture that '18 goal of $7.5 billion, especially once we achieve the scale of a $10 billion growth company, which will be when we can truly begin to leverage our model to optimize expanding gross margins, our SG&A investment and, ultimately, shareholder value. So one of the issues that I just -- I know people know this, but I think it's worthy of us to say that you face as a superior growth company, which Under Armour has always demonstrated its ability to be, is that operating growth of 15% for virtually any S&P or Fortune 500 business would be outstanding, but because our business is growing in the 20s, the profile that only a very few rare companies in either S&P or Fortune 500 and, frankly, not from our industry, from either former or tech share and where we still expect to deliver more than $0.5 billion of operating income profit in 2017 alone, so we're not saying we're losing money. We are moving and marching forward. Or in growth terms, that more than $0.5 billion is more than nearly 2x the total revenue we delivered in our IPO year of 2005, proving at our investments in things like footwear, women's and International have all paid off. But at the end of the day, look, we believe that by making these investments, the ability for us is to mature into a business as big as our brand. So we want to drive best-in-class profitability as our business hits scale, our growth rates become more measured. And we've got the people, distribution, systems and infrastructure to optimize. Today, we have pieces of it. But frankly, it's just incomplete and that's why we must continue to invest. I want to give some perspective here for a second just on where we are. And I mean Under Armour's -- we dropped into the sporting brand pond about 20 years ago, and we jumped in and there were a lot of players, 20, 30 players or brands as many as you want. Today, we're the third largest brand in the world. We're the second largest brand in North America. And our 2 largest competitors have more than 20,000 points of distribution each in North America alone compared to just our 11,000, which speaks to just some the runway that we still have in front of us right here on our own backyard. They're also 6 and 4x our size, respectively. So let me give you a realtime example of what that means. It means in an area like women's footwear, where we currently have just 6 teammates on our women's footwear team based in Portland who are doing an amazing job for us and is building best-in-class product, our competitors who we get compared to on a 1:1 basis have dozens or even hundreds of people covering the same category. It's our responsibility to our long-term growth objective of being #1 in Youth, in Men's and, of course, women's across all categories to continue to invest to meet that long-term goal. So I want to be clear is that we have a saying around here, it's called the ""No loser talk"" and it's the last thing we would ever do. And I want our share shareholders to know how hard this company fights for every single dollar at the bottom line, but how we're looking honestly at this moment in time and saying it's time for us to invest. We have the best team and we've got the best brand. And we expect to continue to grow."

So first of all, we're seeing a tough story that, as we look or think about North America, you've heard a couple people talk about it. And again, it's -- nothing is going away, but it's definitely been reflective in just some of the bankruptcies and the other things that we've seen recently. The people we're doing business with, I believe, are doing very well. And they're getting very smarter about the way they're managing and running their business. But it's definitely -- it's -- you're not finding our accounts that are taking big inventory positions and betting on the cold weather. So those are the things that are leading for us, which are requiring us to run and to drive a better business. Today, I will define Under Armour as a great brand and as a great brand with a -- but a -- probably a good company. The opportunity we have as things like what we see with some of the speed to manufacturing, things like -- recently, when we announced our partnership at City Garage here in Baltimore where we talked about a local-for-local strategy, which means bringing manufacturing back to the United States. And again, that's not a made in U.S.A. initiative as much as initiative for us about making great product anywhere is the people of America want product made in America. The people of Europe want the same. The people in Sao Paulo want product from Brazil. So we're going to continue to answer that and look to drive on that answer. But there's a lot of investment on the front-end. The good news is that the sad thing about our industry is that a shirt and a shoe are still made the exact same way they were 100 years ago, and we see a massive opportunity for that to improve. So some of the things I talked about in my script and my comments was how that we had the ability, I think, to accelerate the speed at which innovation can happen there. Right now, to make a single shoe, for instance, it takes upwards of 300 pairs a hand to make a single shoe. So we think there's a lot of room for innovation. We're finding a lot about -- that about ourselves and I think that's continuing to move for us as well."

But over time, as we start to gain more and more scale, we'll see that gross margin improvement. And on top of that, as we get more into lifestyle, we'll see more gross margin as well. So once we start to get towards $10 billion, we'll see gross margin. At the same time, that's when we should really start to be able to leverage our expense structure. We're investing across the world. We're investing in offices. We're investing in IT systems. We're investing in distribution capacity. All of those things that are happening today and will continue to happen over the next couple of years. But we will start to see that leverage, so it becomes sort of a perfect storm once we get to $10 billion. And we'll start to see operating income margin expansion. And I think we'll head towards more the premium level versus the other person or the other competitor that you're speaking with."

At the same time, we're already seeing improvements in our footwear margins, and we'll continue to see those improvements. And so net-net, we think we can overcome that mix shift through the improvements we're seeing on the costing side for the next couple of years. But net-net, it will be flat. Then as we start to approach $10 billion, as I mentioned earlier, that's when we believe that we will have the scale. And we will have a much more significant mix at that time of footwear that you'll start to see in expanding gross margin come $10 billion."

So Under Armour today, we're in the low to mid-30s when it comes to our footwear gross margin that nets out compared to our competitors, which are 10% or roughly 1000 bps in front of us. And so we've made great strides in the last couple of years, actually taking hundreds of points of gross margin and clawing that back. And we see great opportunity as well. And so there's no secret sauce that someone else has that we don't. It's been time. It's been energy and experience. And frankly, I've just gotten back from a trip from Asia about 4, 5 weeks ago and seeing the investment that our manufacturing partners are making in us throughout China, but also through Vietnam and the Philippines, where you're seeing a lot of these new facilities going up. There is a great belief in a company and a brand like Under Armour that, just a couple of years ago, I think, for us is important to lay out. Last year, we made 30 million pairs of shoes. 2016, we'll make 40 million pairs of shoes. Obviously, you hear how bullish we are on footwear, so that number is increasing. And again, that's impressive, but it still compares to the hundreds of millions of pairs of shoes that are made by our competitors. So as we build scale, this will naturally come onboard as well as will help with people like Colin Browne and -- who's our new President of Sourcing and some of the things that we'll do driving some these initiatives. So we see there's great opportunity in gross margin and this is nothing that we're laying back and there's no excuse for what we're doing with operating income as it relates to -- or the way that we're attacking gross margin across the board."

Women's was still growing in the quarter, up 17%, I think, 18%. And again, at the heart of this is category management. I spoke about it in my prepared remarks, and we've done that with women's. This was specifically called out to make sure that it gets the emphasis it needs. Pam Catlett is leading that. She's an industry vet and has been a complete pro in bringing the pieces together. But there's a lot of pieces to bring together. Probably the best thing I could say is when you talk about our women's business, we have $1 billion women's brand. It's taken us one heck of a long time to get here, but we're incredibly proud of what that means. And -- but I think probably looking at women's through the lens of -- I gave the example about footwear in one of my earlier answers, and we have 6 people in our women's footwear team. We just built our first women's last year for the first time. And those are the things from an operating income standpoint I want to say is that when people say you don't have enough -- people dress toe to head, where they start with their shoe. But if the shoe isn't right, if the fit isn't right, if the color isn't right, if we don't have the right team. The reason we didn't build the women's last before is because we were focused on the ability that we couldn't afford it. And so we're making a lot of those small decisions right now that we truly believe that making into -- looking at 2017, 2018, making the investment as unfortunately and fortunately because our growth rate is so great, it creates that drag. But making this right investment in footwear is important. So let me go back with women is that one thing we think is incredibly important is that the football cleated opportunity and what we're doing being the #1 cleat there isn't doing much for the women's category. But the confidence that we're demonstrating in running from our knit products, this is the -- again, this will be the first year in a market that will have that women's last on people's feet -- on women's feet. And we also think that as we continue to drive more better products for her, driving both performance, style, strength and beauty, the focuses we'll have. And so I think we've got a terrific team in place. We are investing in our women's team as well. We think footwear will be one of the catalyst for it. But achieving $1 billion business in women's is a pretty big feat and it's something we're certainly not stopping or satisfied with."

We are a growth company, and with our 26th consecutive quarter of 20-plus percent revenue growth, we continue to demonstrate our ability to drive a bigger and better company quarter after quarter. Our financi",3194,"Thank you, Carrie, and good morning, everyone. We are a growth company, and with our 26th consecutive quarter of 20-plus percent revenue growth, we continue to demonstrate our ability to drive a bigger and better company quarter after quarter. Our financial results are an incredible accomplishment for any brand and something that we believe separates us from others in our business. 
Today, I'd like to start by giving some perspective on our industry and articulate what that means for Under Armour in this moment in time. 
I believe we operate in a truly resilient industry. The athletic apparel and footwear business and in broader context, sports, has been one of the most dynamic and strongest growing industries in our lifetime. As we continue to immerse ourselves in strategic and long-term growth, we ensure that we will continue to drive in an industry with various entry today that are much higher than 1996 when I drove my old Ford Explorer door-to-door to teams, selling T-shirts out of the back. 
Our industry's collective ability to continue to evolve and make better product that improves an athlete's performance, bring the passion of the sports experience to consumers through our brand storytelling and to do so with increasing profitability on a global basis is a reflection of what has been an ever-growing demand for consumers that our industry has met with outstanding financial results. 
Those measures of success are not as commonplace in other industries that are sometimes viewed as more stable or secure investments. Today, brands that 5 years ago were viewed as leaders in our field are in danger of being commoditized, disruptive or worse, becoming extinct as technology and the way we live changes the way consumers need and value them. 
Our industry of sport is different. Our industry's growth opportunities are global, with consumers around the world embracing athletic Apparel and Footwear at its historic levels. It's not about what people are conveniently referring to as athleisure. It's the simple truth that consumers all over the world are raising expectations about what to expect from their Apparel and Footwear and is a shift that is not going to be reversed. 
The macro trend has favored not just us, but all the premium brands on our business, which is part of the reason, I believe, our industry will continue to gain new and loyal consumers across the globe. 
In the sports industry, we represent something truly attainable, measurable and sought after by most consumers to live a better, healthier life. Under Armour's mission is to make all athletes better. And we are fortunate enough to be in an industry that will withstand and maintain its relevancy over time because our value proposition enriches consumers' lives and help them reach their personal health and fitness goals. 
But our track record of growth and the power of the UA brand provides us with the confidence that we can do more. That track record is one of which we are extremely proud. Over the past 3 years, Under Armour is the only consumer brand in the top 10 fastest-growing companies in the S&P 500 with total revenue increasing 116% through 2015. We have the capacity to lead our industry over the next 10 years by continuing to take our consumer someplace new with our constant flow of product and innovation while at the same time improving their lives through our Connected Fitness platform, which will pass our 2016 goal of reaching over 190 million registered users by the end of this week. 
For UA, we have punched above our weight for a long time, and that has been essential theme of our success. That's not going to change. We compete in an industry that is measured by a few very high standards. We're measured by the innovative product we bring to consumers, by the strength and relevancy of our brand, by the talent of our team and, of course, by a financial results we deliver. 
While our business is in constant evolution, we know the standards won't change. We also know that we can't look for old models of success that have helped establish some of our competitors in their existing position. 
So I want to spend some time this morning talking about how we will operate as the world evolves around us and ensure we are investing to continue to drive forward-industry leadership on every front. 
As I've stated numerous times on these calls, footwear and International will be key drivers of our revenue growth. Our footwear business went from $239 million in 2012 to approaching $1 billion in revenue this year. And our International revenues grew from $108 million in 2012 to more than $700 million this year. That's clear evidence that our investments in footwear and International have driven strong revenue growth to date and fuels our confidence that we are just getting started in each of these areas. 
I'll talk about our focus there in just a minute, but first, I want to talk about the core of our business, North America. 
We built our brand and our business with the best wholesale partners in the industry, and we are incredibly proud of both our growth and our partnerships across the market. There's no doubt that the landscape globally and certainly, in our North American backyard is shifting. As we navigate this dynamic environment, our intention is to continue to evolve and grow in the places that have built our brand while we simultaneously reach a broader set of consumers through new avenues of distribution. We believe consumers expect excellence at every touch point with our brand, and you will see us invest to ensure that we drive growth with our long-term partners at the same time that we invest in new distribution through our own Direct-to-Consumer experiences. 
As we think about the many dimensions of growth for our company, we are incredibly confident in the opportunity we see for our North America business. Consider this, our 2 largest competitors generate approximately $18 billion in revenue in North America over just the past 12 months. So while we recognize that our trailing 12-month North American revenues of $3.95 billion is 85% of our business, it is just a fraction of the opportunity that we believe exist for our brand. Whether through share gains, market growth, new distribution or sheer brand heat, we know we have tremendous runway in our home market. We'll drive growth by the measures you'd expect, innovative product, brand strength and relevance and the best team in the industry to drive market-leading results. 
A large part of that growth in North America will come from footwear as we firmly believe that we are at the tipping point in terms of opportunities to gain market share. 
In the back-to-school window of July through September, our overall footwear market share nearly doubled according to industry data. 
So while we've always understood that the size of the prize in footwear was massive, we knew coming into this year that there were a lot of consumers in U.S. who didn't know us as a footwear brand. So this summer, we launched our It Came from Below Footwear Campaign, which focused on the importance of footwork as athletes train. We started with Bryce Harper in baseball. And for running, we hosted a UA Run Camp, where we took experienced men and women from urban run-throughs and put them and their Under Armour footwear to the ultimate test in the world's toughest conditions. 
With the start of NFL season in early September, we incorporated NFL MVP, Cam Newton, with the Prince of a Thousand Enemies' spot and the launch of the game on SnapChat with Cam that drove incredible engagement. 
The final piece of our footwear campaign debuts today with the launch of the Curry 3. The TV spot debuts tonight on TNT during opening night of the NBA season, combined with our second tour of Asia where we took Steph into 4 cities in early September, we are continuing to build our relationship with the basketball consumer and driving awareness of UA as a footwear brand by partnering with the 2-time NBA MVP. 
So while Stephen has been a big part of building our footwear story, we're also having success in other areas that are contributing to the growth. The highlight is the #1 football cleat in the market 4 years running now and continues to showcase our ability to elevate and drive premium footwear in every category we chose to be in. We made our first football cleat in 2006, and since then, have changed the look of the entire category while elevating the price. 
This type of market evolution and positioning in cleated underscores our opportunity in other footwear category as we gain awareness, credibility, capabilities and scale. 
We are focused on the exploding running market in China, and we saw a great success there with the Bandit 2 running shoe, an example of how we are building key footwear platform that will continue to scale and expand.
We are improving our ability to leverage our global assets and help drive business in local markets. And we continue to focus on being a premium brand in footwear, with the goal of having more than 50% of our volume in running footwear over $100 by just spring of next year. 
We saw incredible demand for our Slingride product offering during the third quarter. Slingride is our second running shoe utilizing a full knit upper to deliver comfort and fit where you need it. Priced at $100, it did extremely well in the market. And we believe there's great opportunity in what knit can mean for Under Armour running. 
So we will continue to invest meaningfully in our footwear business with a focus on talent as well as infrastructure that will help improve the profitability in our business as we scale. We believe we are at a moment in time where we can gain share in footwear. And we are prepared to make investments that will drive long-term, profitable growth. 
That same focus on the long-term opportunity holds true for our investments as we build out our International business. We continue to post strong growth across all our geographies. While our business in EMEA continues to be strong, it's our Greater China market that remains the biggest growth story for our International business. 
Posting revenue in the third quarter equal to the entire first half of the year and firmly on a path to more than double their business from $80 million just a year ago, we are making incredible inroads in China that we believe will drive our position in this critical market. With sports and fitness being promoted strongly by the government, we continue to be viewed by the Chinese consumer as the performance brand or referred to often as the professional brand. Some of the things we're doing in China include: focusing on building premium brand houses with a controlled retail environment and a sustainable full-price business model, where we've already opened over 100 doors this year; driving a strong E-Commerce channel presence and utilizing an Asia for China and local-for-local model to reduce cost and improve fill rates and on-time delivery. 
But we are just getting started in China, much like we are in new markets around the world. We've rolled out E-Commerce platforms in 4 new markets this year, including Mexico, Australia, New Zealand and Chile. And that's after doing the same in 14 new markets in 2015, bringing our total global E-Commerce sites to 30. 
We're building a global organization for the long haul. As I said earlier, funding these growing International markets may require additional investment in the short term. However, we believe they are central to our long-term goal of market leadership. 
In addition to Footwear and International, we're making investments in other key growth areas that will contribute and drive our ability to become a bigger and better company, including: retail, where we're ensuring that we deliver a great presentation of the brand wherever our consumer decides to transact. With SAP, we're creating efficiencies in our systems as we continue to grow and scale; in category management, where we are organizing around 9 sports categories and executive leadership to create focus and alignment across our business; and finally, merchandising, which enables us to differentiate our product to create unique experiences for our consumers across our points of distribution and now gives us the ability to reach more athletes than ever before. 
The third key, where we will continue to overinvest in the near term, is connected in fitness. We're doing so because we believe strongly that it'll prove an important differentiator in our relationship with the consumer. With nearly 190 million registered users in our community, we continue to gather critical information to help us change the way athletes live. We firmly believe that going forward, brands without substantive communities will be at a deficit when it comes to building a relationship with our consumer. 
We are investing in our single view of consumer through our partnership with SAP as we look to continuously drive a better business as we scale, knowing that much of the benefit will not be seen immediately. 
That said, we expect to see return on these investments starting in the near term with tools like self-service consumer comparison reporting, where we can quickly compare the demographic profile, workout habits and purchase behavior of any group of consumers. We are growing our analytics capabilities and moving from backward looking reporting to predictive and prescriptive analytics, which allow us to establish and drive growth in a more meaningful way. 
We will be able to personalize our E-Commerce homepage, driving off your demographic profile, which sports categories are important to you, your exercise, how frequently you exercise, sleep, weight, diet and the makeup of your household. 
Going forward, we will continue to dive into the data and leverage the insights to deepen and expand our relationship with athletes as their needs change. 
Our brand continues to evolve and shift with the changing demand and needs of the consumer. And as I said earlier, we're in an incredible industry where sports and health and fitness are driving forces in our success. 
Our investments, the ones we have made in the past and will continue to make in the years to come, are critical for us to realize the true potential of the UA brand. We are confident we are making the right investments and our track record of investing for growth is exceptional. Our investments are all about expansion of the brand, about opening the aperture of what we're capable of and never being satisfied with our past successes. 
So recently I pulled together the top leaders in the company and discussed the strategic growth and direction of Under Armour. We came away with 3 key areas of focus that I want to share with you today. 
First, getting big fast; second, making retail a core competency; and third, getting more shoes on feet. 
To be clear, get big fast does not mean at all cost. It means prioritizing our growth and making the right decisions for the brand, it means growing the right way. As I said earlier, we have succeeded over the past 20 years by consistently punching above our weight, and that will not change. But our growth now gives us opportunities to move up in a weight class. And we find ourselves well positioned at this moment in time to compete for long-term relationships with athletes, teams and league affiliation that we previously could not justify. 
Now with the flexibility to lock in 10- to 15-year deals, we can make investments on a global scale that will help drive authenticity, awareness and revenues for our brand. It is not going to be easy. The mix of our business is evolving, and so must we, which is why making retail a core competency is critical to our future success. We'll do that by answering the call of the consumer, who's asking us to give them more in the places that they expect to find our product. We are no longer just a North American apparel company. We are a retail company across multiple consumer touch points, and we'll look to be best-in-class. And when we know how to be a great retailer, we can leverage that expertise to help us be a better wholesale partner and therefore, continue to elevate and meet our consumer where and how they want to engage with us. 
So to summarize where this nets out, both International and footwear are growing faster in the near term than we had originally planned. And as a result, we remain confident in reaching our 2018 revenue target of $7.5 billion. 
While this mixed shift will create margin pressure, we have a significant opportunity to offset the sales mix impact by continuing to improve our footwear product margins over time, and we will. But the market share opportunity cannot wait. We will remain focused on getting more shoes on feet because we see footwear being as big, if not bigger, than apparel one day. And as we drive footwear revenue, the dynamics of the business do change, but that's a good thing because we are truly just getting started in footwear. 
So before I pass it to Chip, I just want to reiterate my confidence in the future of our industry and more specifically, how Under Armour, with the right investment and incredible brand momentum, will continue to lead and outpace the competition. 
As I said during my opening, I believe we operate in a resilient industry with strong competitors who will build global businesses over the course of many years. And while their sheer size poses consistent challenges for us and challenges we have consistently met and beaten, we believe that the monumental shift that is taking place in both the manufacturing of shoes and apparel and the way consumers buy our products is leveling the playing field and will enable us to build a bigger and better global brand. 
We've delivered great results on the path that has led us to this moment in time, 26 consecutive quarters of 20-plus percent revenue growth. During that stretch, we've established a culture of growth that equips us for this next chapter in our story. And today, we are reiterating our target of $7.5 billion of revenue for 2018. Our challenge is that we need to continue investing on multiple fronts in categories, geographies and the talent and infrastructure required to capture those growth opportunities, and that's why the dollars we are committing reflect a broader investment strategy. In the short term, these investments will impact our operating income growth, which Chip will walk you through in a moment. 
We understand that the path to industry leadership grows more complex as we expand in categories, channels and geographies. And I am confident we will remain the market leader in growth by delivering innovation at every touch point, a consumer has with our brand. 
Thank you. And I will pass it over to Chip."
8740684,403729229,1060922,"Under Armour, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2016",2016-10-25,"Earnings Calls","Under Armour, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Kevin. I would now like to spend some time when reviewing our third quarter 2016 financial results, followed by our updated outlook for the remainder of the year as well as our long-term outlook and initial guidance for next year. Our revenues f",1949,"Thanks, Kevin. I would now like to spend some time when reviewing our third quarter 2016 financial results, followed by our updated outlook for the remainder of the year as well as our long-term outlook and initial guidance for next year. 
Our revenues for the third quarter of 2016 increased 22% to $1.47 billion. On a currency-neutral basis, net revenues increased 23% compared with the prior year's period. Our ability to deliver another quarter of consistent growth is a direct result of continued investments we have made in the business to meet consumer expectations through categories, channels and geographies. 
As we continue to navigate through the changing dynamics of the North American retail landscape, we remain focused on solving problems for athletes all over the world and meeting the consumer with premium compelling product wherever they are interacting with our brand. 
During the third quarter, our wholesale revenues grew 19% to $1.01 billion. Our Direct-to-Consumer revenues grew 29% to $408 million, representing approximately 28% of total revenues for the quarter. 
During the quarter, licensing revenues grew 21% to $29 million and Connected Fitness revenues grew 40% to $20 million. 
On the product category front, apparel revenues increased 18% to $1.02 billion compared to $866 million in the prior year's quarter, led by consistent growth in our sport categories, including men's training, women's training, golf and team sports. 
Third quarter footwear revenues increased 42% to $279 million from $196 million in the prior year's quarter. 
Within running, we saw a strong global demand for the brand led by 2 of our new $100 price point product offerings, the Bandit 2 and Slingride, showcasing our continued focus in investment in these key category of long-term growth. 
In basketball, the Curry signature line continues to drive strong growth for the Under Armour Brand. 
Our accessories revenues during the third quarter increased 18% to $122 million from $104 million in the prior year's quarter, primarily driven by bags and headwear. 
On a regional basis, North American revenues in the third quarter increased 16% to $1.23 billion compared to $1.06 billion during the same period last year. 
Within our Direct-to-Consumer channel, our North American store count at the end of the quarter included 162 company-owned stores, comprised of 145 factory stores and 17 Brand House stores. With the opening of 3 new Brand Houses in the quarter, including Philadelphia, New York City World Trade Center and Madison, Wisconsin, we continue to invest in building and creating the best premium retail expression of our brand. 
International revenues increased 74% to $226 million in the third quarter to reach 15% of total revenues. On a currency-neutral basis, International revenues increased 80%. Within our International wholesale channel, the store count at the end of the quarter included 282 partner stores. 
Within our Direct-to-Consumer channel, our company-owned International store count at the end of the quarter included 63 stores, comprised of 32 Factory Houses and 31 Brand House stores. 
Looking at our International regions, starting with EMEA. We continue to post strong growth in the region as we expand our presence with key wholesale partners and distributors while building out our Direct-to-Consumer business. 
In the Asia Pacific region, our premium performance brand strategy continues to resonate with the consumer, driving strong growth in the quarter. As Kevin mentioned, we continue to see strong growth in basketball, led by the Stephen Curry signature line and believe we are well positioned to capitalize and scale the business in our fastest-growing region. 
And in Latin America, we drove incredible brand awareness in the region and around the globe through the strong performance of -- performances of our Olympic athletes. We remain focused on the long-term growth opportunity of this region as we continue to build and expand our distribution. 
Moving on to margins. Third quarter gross margins decreased 130 basis points to 47.5% compared to 48.8% in the prior year's period. The following items contributed the majority of the margin contraction this quarter: first, liquidations negatively impacted the quarter by approximately 80 basis points versus the prior year; second, product margins negatively impacted gross margin by approximately 30 basis points versus the prior year, driven by product mix, higher discounts and promotions, partially offset by continued improvement in product input cost; and finally, foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted gross margin by approximately 30 basis points. 
In the quarter, gross margin declined more than planned, driven predominantly by higher-than-expected promotions, both the volume and rate of liquidations and foreign exchange rates. 
Despite liquidations having been a headwind on margin rates for most of this year, we now believe that our inventory position is healthier and liquidation should not have the same negative impact moving forward. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses grew 20% to $499 million compared to $416 million during the third quarter of last year. Growth was predominantly driven by investments in our Direct-to-Consumer businesses, both retail and E-Commerce, along with the infrastructure and people necessary to support our growth and strategic initiatives such as product creation, innovation and sport category management. Selling, general and administrative expenses were less than planned in the quarter due to lower incentive compensation and the timing of marketing activations. A portion of the expected marketing spend shifted from the third quarter to the fourth quarter to better align with key initiatives, including the launch of Curry 3 that Kevin mentioned earlier. 
Operating income for the third quarter increased 16% to $199 million compared with $171 million in the prior year period. Interest expense for the third quarter increased to approximately $8 million compared to $4 million in the prior year's period. 
Within other income and expense, we recorded a loss of $1 million in the current year versus a loss of $3 million in the prior year. 
In addition, the tax rate in the third quarter was 32.6% compared to 38.8% in the prior year, largely due to improved international profitability in the current year period and the tax benefit related to our prior year acquisitions. 
Our third quarter net income increased 28% to $128 million compared to $100 million in the prior year period. 
On the balance sheet, total cash and cash equivalents for the quarter was $180 million compared with $159 million at September 30, 2015. 
Inventory for the quarter increased 12% to $971 million compared to $867 million while total debt increased to $1.07 billion as compared to $902 million. 
Looking at our cash flows. Our investment in capital expenditures was $73 million for the third quarter compared to $71 million in the prior year's period. We now expect to spend approximately $450 million for the full year, including investments on our global offices around the world, including our headquarters in Baltimore, our distribution centers, our SAP platform and global Direct-to-Consumer. 
Now moving on to our guidance for the remainder of the year. Based on our current visibility, we continue to expect full year 2016 net revenues of approximately $4.925 billion, representing growth of 24%, and operating income in the range of approximately $440 million to $445 million, representing growth of 8% to 9%. Gross margins for the full year is expected to decline approximately 80 basis points compared to last year, driven by the same factors that we have experienced through the year. 
Based on our outlook of $4.925 billion in revenues, SG&A is now expected to grow approximately 26% as we remain focused on making the right investments today to drive our long-term global success. 
Below the operating line, we expect interest expense to increase to approximately $30 million in 2016. In addition, we now expect the full year tax rate of approximately 35.5% and fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 446 million. 
I would also like to provide additional color on the fourth quarter. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenues to grow approximately 20%. We believe the strength of our brand and increased breadth of head-to-toe product offerings position us for another quarter of strong growth in what has been a challenging North American retail environment. With strong momentum in footwear and International, we remain focused on delivering key products and assortments for the holiday season. 
Gross margin is expected to be relatively flat versus prior year with an SG&A, as I mentioned earlier, the timing of certain marketing activations along with continued investment in long-term growth opportunities like Connected Fitness, International and Direct-to-Consumer will drive the growth in the quarter. For the fourth quarter, we expect operating income in the range of $186 million to $191 million, representing growth of 5% to 8% over the prior year. 
Before we turn it over to Q&A, we'd like to briefly discuss our long-term outlook and associated guidance for next year. At our 2015 Investor Day, we announced our goals of achieving $7.5 billion of revenues and $800 million of operating income by 2018. We are on track to achieve our 2018 revenue goal of $7.5 billion and expect to grow full year revenues consistently in the low-20s in both 2017 and 2018. 
At the same time, we expect annual operating income growth in the mid-teens each of the next 2 years as we focus on investing to get big fast. 
As Kevin highlighted earlier, the landscape for our business in our industry continues to evolve and in a fast-paced world, we must be willing to adapt, make game time decisions and drive our brand forward. North America apparel growth is slowing across the industry. While we expect to continue to significantly outpace the apparel industry, the growth rate going forward will be less than expected from our Investor Day in 2015. 
This is a moment in time. We could choose to optimize for more near-term profits, but we believe it is more prudent to invest to maintain superior growth rates while gaining both share and scale. Growth, share and scale are the priorities for our brand. That said, we will invest more heavily in areas that we can grow faster such as footwear, Direct-to-Consumer and International as well as more aggressively enter sport fashion like UAS and the much broader sports lifestyle category. 
In footwear, that means doubling down on creating great product through innovation and design, scaling and extending our pinnacle footwear franchising -- franchises and investing in the complete market strategy for merchandising to in-store marketing. 
In Direct-to-Consumer, we are driving investment in mobile, the optimization of the Factory House store footprint and building out premium Brand House expressions to help us drive market share. 
International growth includes being more aggressive in key markets where we are gaining significant awareness such as Asia. 
In the sports lifestyle category, we are accelerating investment in the people necessary to design relevant and brand right product. 
And finally, we will continue to make key investments in assets that promote the brand. 
Beyond 2018, we believe we have opportunities across categories, channels and geographies to consistently deliver superior revenue growth relative to our industry. We also that -- believe that as we approach $10 billion in revenues, the scale it provides, along with the investments we have made in people, infrastructure and systems, will begin to pay off in the form of increasing operating margin rates. 
As Kevin stated earlier, we've delivered great results from the path that has led us to this moment in time. The dollars we are committing reflect a broader investment strategy that will enable us to build a company as big as our brand. 
We would now like to open the call for your questions. Similar to our last earnings call, Dave Bergman, our SVP of Corporate Finance, will be joining us this morning to provide additional assistance with your questions. [Operator Instructions]"

And this is obviously an area that I want to spend a little time on and go deep, so give me a few minutes to really I think craft this for you. So as Chip just said in his commentary, we talked about building a business as big as",1837,"Yes. Thank you, Michael. And this is obviously an area that I want to spend a little time on and go deep, so give me a few minutes to really I think craft this for you. So as Chip just said in his commentary, we talked about building a business as big as our brand. We've had on our eye on $10 billion, that's the way that we see our company. I think it's the way that people view and judge as with $7.5 billion being our next milestone to be hit by 2018. And again, we want to reiterate that we're on track to hitting that goal. But there are a few factors that led to decision to modify the operating income for us since Investor Day September 2015. So what's happened and what's different? First of all, in North America, it's a place that's provided incredible air cover for our brand for a very long time. And I think like we're seeing a lot of places that, that it's modifying and it's changing. In the investments that we've made over the past 11 years as a public company, we've seen that our business thankfully has evolved from being strictly North American wholesale apparel brand into a global sports brand that also has the ability to claim International and footwear as probably 2 of our largest and greatest opportunities for growth. And all the while, I want to be clear, with apparel remaining incredibly profitable and still growing to the tune of 18% in just the third quarter for us. So this is not -- there's not an end to the North American apparel story. That continues to march on for us as well. We just have other opportunities that are outpacing some of that growth. So some of those opportunities like footwear and International, they are exceeding what we're putting up in 24-plus percent top line growth as a company. And that change in mix is modifying our gross margin story in the short term. So that means we're -- while we're doing better in footwear and International than we thought we were capable of doing, that we're fortunate to have these levers to pull and frankly attack as we maintain our industry-leading growth on the top line as well as continue to drive what we can in making the right investments in the right parts of our business. So what also has changed is our distribution. The fact that we've had 3 bankruptcies that have occurred in just the last 12 months in sporting goods that account for more than $4 billion in lost revenue for the sporting goods industry in North America and compare that relatively speaking that going all the way back to 2008/2009, there is just $170 million of bankruptcies, of loss revenue in our industry. So we saw something pretty big happened that we thought about, but it definitely has been eye-opening for us especially recently. And we want to be clear like our demand is still there, like this doesn't mean that the demand for the Under Armour Brand has disappeared, but it certainly hasn't reappeared dollar-for-dollar in our immediate distribution. We believe that the opportunity is also still there. We just have to be more thoughtful about how to capture the consumers and their dollars, including replacing with our own Direct-to-Consumer controlled retail as well as expanded distribution by doing things like Coles, which will carry the Under Armour product beginning in 2017. We also plan to make additional investments in the places where we know that we can win. So right now, that moment in time is a very important message, I think, for obviously our shareholders, but frankly for our team and our consumer. Footwear and International are going to continue to be staples of our investment strategy because we think the opportunity for us now is to strike and strike hard. And we take the momentum of things like Curry, which is launching tonight. And I think you'll be pretty excited by what you see. And most importantly, the consumers are getting pretty excited about what they see. We also have opportunities like lifestyle that, as we've talked about before on these calls, represents roughly 1/3 of the revenues of our 2 largest competitors and today, less than 5% of the business for Under Armour. Thirdly, Connected Fitness is continuing to be going to be an area that we'll invest in where we believe that redefining the expectation the consumer has of the sports brand with our data will give us perspective on our consumer that will be truly unmatched in our industry. Another factor that we've seen recently has been the escalation in the price and, frankly, the duration of sports marketing assets. The length of these deals has gone from standard 5-year deals arrangements to now 10- to 15-year deals. UCLA, one that we just wrapped up recently this past spring was the largest collegiate deal in history, but it's a 15-year partnership. And at the same time, we also locked up Cal Berkley and giving us a true position in California which, frankly, prior to that, we really didn't have. If we deem them strategic, the ability that was happening in the sports marketing as these assets are being wrapped up is either act now or lose them for, frankly, the mid to long term. This, of course, does not mean every deal, and I want to be clear, is that the shift in operating income for us is not about creating a bigger marketing budget, so we can go buy more stuff. It is about truly investing in our brand, our systems, our infrastructure and, especially, our team. I'll give you another example of that in just a minute. So all those things are just some of the tactical, but not to be ignored long-term strategic issues -- new issues that we're facing since September of 2015. And when you grow a business 20-plus percent a quarter for 6.5 years, it builds a unique profile that we find ourselves today, which means adding $1 billion and growing a year-end revenue and require significant resources and investment. But I want to be clear is that the growth remains intact. it just costs more short-term investment dollars to achieve and the belief is that greater efficiency can come later and that the growth that we have over the short-term EPS is a priority for our long-term goal of becoming the #1 sports brand in the world. And I want to reiterate that like we are in this for the long haul and the opportunity that we see is to be the best in the world. And that does require investment, and we know that people aren't going to like the way it sounds, but this is what -- I don't know if there's even been another model like ours at 6.5 years with the growth that we've seen, particularly in consumer. And so the book isn't written anywhere. And if it were, we'd have read it. But this is what we're telling you is that from our purview of 11 years public and what I've seen in our business that now is the time for us to strike because I think the upside is so much greater on the other side. So on relative basis, we believe the short-term dollar is better spent building our infrastructure, ensuring that we capture that '18 goal of $7.5 billion, especially once we achieve the scale of a $10 billion growth company, which will be when we can truly begin to leverage our model to optimize expanding gross margins, our SG&A investment and, ultimately, shareholder value. So one of the issues that I just -- I know people know this, but I think it's worthy of us to say that you face as a superior growth company, which Under Armour has always demonstrated its ability to be, is that operating growth of 15% for virtually any S&P or Fortune 500 business would be outstanding, but because our business is growing in the 20s, the profile that only a very few rare companies in either S&P or Fortune 500 and, frankly, not from our industry, from either former or tech share and where we still expect to deliver more than $0.5 billion of operating income profit in 2017 alone, so we're not saying we're losing money. We are moving and marching forward. Or in growth terms, that more than $0.5 billion is more than nearly 2x the total revenue we delivered in our IPO year of 2005, proving at our investments in things like footwear, women's and International have all paid off. But at the end of the day, look, we believe that by making these investments, the ability for us is to mature into a business as big as our brand. So we want to drive best-in-class profitability as our business hits scale, our growth rates become more measured. And we've got the people, distribution, systems and infrastructure to optimize. Today, we have pieces of it. But frankly, it's just incomplete and that's why we must continue to invest. I want to give some perspective here for a second just on where we are. And I mean Under Armour's -- we dropped into the sporting brand pond about 20 years ago, and we jumped in and there were a lot of players, 20, 30 players or brands as many as you want. Today, we're the third largest brand in the world. We're the second largest brand in North America. And our 2 largest competitors have more than 20,000 points of distribution each in North America alone compared to just our 11,000, which speaks to just some the runway that we still have in front of us right here on our own backyard. They're also 6 and 4x our size, respectively. So let me give you a realtime example of what that means. It means in an area like women's footwear, where we currently have just 6 teammates on our women's footwear team based in Portland who are doing an amazing job for us and is building best-in-class product, our competitors who we get compared to on a 1:1 basis have dozens or even hundreds of people covering the same category. It's our responsibility to our long-term growth objective of being #1 in Youth, in Men's and, of course, women's across all categories to continue to invest to meet that long-term goal. So I want to be clear is that we have a saying around here, it's called the ""No loser talk"" and it's the last thing we would ever do. And I want our share shareholders to know how hard this company fights for every single dollar at the bottom line, but how we're looking honestly at this moment in time and saying it's time for us to invest. We have the best team and we've got the best brand. And we expect to continue to grow."

So first of all, we're seeing a tough story that, as we look or think about North America, you've heard a couple people talk about it. And again, it's -- nothing is going away, but it's definitely been reflective in just some of the bankruptcies and the other things that we've seen recently. The people we're doing business with, I believe, are doing very well. And they're getting very smarter about the way they're managing and running their business. But it's definitely -- it's -- you're not finding our accounts that are taking big inventory positions and betting on the cold weather. So those are the things that are leading for us, which are requiring us to run and to drive a better business. Today, I will define Under Armour as a great brand and as a great brand with a -- but a -- probably a good company. The opportunity we have as things like what we see with some of the speed to manufacturing, things like -- recently, when we announced our partnership at City Garage here in Baltimore where we talked about a local-for-local strategy, which means bringing manufacturing back to the United States. And again, that's not a made in U.S.A. initiative as much as initiative for us about making great product anywhere is the people of America want product made in America. The people of Europe want the same. The people in Sao Paulo want product from Brazil. So we're going to continue to answer that and look to drive on that answer. But there's a lot of investment on the front-end. The good news is that the sad thing about our industry is that a shirt and a shoe are still made the exact same way they were 100 years ago, and we see a massive opportunity for that to improve. So some of the things I talked about in my script and my comments was how that we had the ability, I think, to accelerate the speed at which innovation can happen there. Right now, to make a single shoe, for instance, it takes upwards of 300 pairs a hand to make a single shoe. So we think there's a lot of room for innovation. We're finding a lot about -- that about ourselves and I think that's continuing to move for us as well."

I think longer term, what people see is that they see one of your big competitors out in Portland with the mid-teens operating margin. They see one of your other competitors in Germany with a mid-single-digit operating margin. Where does Under Armour fit in long term? What's the true driver of margin expansion long term? Is it really just following more through by better SG&A leverage or gross margins and product margins can move higher? What pushes the operating margin longer term when we think just beyond 2018?"

So as we you start to get to $10 billion, there's a couple of things that'll happen. One, the gross margins, we should start to get expansion on the gross margins and we'll start to get that because we won't be faced with much of a mix shift that we're faced with today, and the improvements we're seeing on the cost side of the house, we are seeing those today and they'll continue. But over time, as we start to gain more and more scale, we'll see that gross margin improvement. And on top of that, as we get more into lifestyle, we'll see more gross margin as well. So once we start to get towards $10 billion, we'll see gross margin. At the same time, that's when we should really start to be able to leverage our expense structure. We're investing across the world. We're investing in offices. We're investing in IT systems. We're investing in distribution capacity. All of those things that are happening today and will continue to happen over the next couple of years. But we will start to see that leverage, so it becomes sort of a perfect storm once we get to $10 billion. And we'll start to see operating income margin expansion. And I think we'll head towards more the premium level versus the other person or the other competitor that you're speaking with."

We're going to have mix as a headwind as we continue to grow our footwear at 2 to 2.5x our apparel and accessories business. And the disparity between those gross margins creates a mix shift for us. At the same time, we're already seeing improvements in our footwear margins, and we'll continue to see those improvements. And so net-net, we think we can overcome that mix shift through the improvements we're seeing on the costing side for the next couple of years. But net-net, it will be flat. Then as we start to approach $10 billion, as I mentioned earlier, that's when we believe that we will have the scale. And we will have a much more significant mix at that time of footwear that you'll start to see in expanding gross margin come $10 billion."

So Under Armour today, we're in the low to mid-30s when it comes to our footwear gross margin that nets out compared to our competitors, which are 10% or roughly 1000 bps in front of us. And so we've made great strides in the last couple of years, actually taking hundreds of points of gross margin and clawing that back. And we see great opportunity as well. And so there's no secret sauce that someone else has that we don't. It's been time. It's been energy and experience. And frankly, I've just gotten back from a trip from Asia about 4, 5 weeks ago and seeing the investment that our manufacturing partners are making in us throughout China, but also through Vietnam and the Philippines, where you're seeing a lot of these new facilities going up. There is a great belief in a company and a brand like Under Armour that, just a couple of years ago, I think, for us is important to lay out. Last year, we made 30 million pairs of shoes. 2016, we'll make 40 million pairs of shoes. Obviously, you hear how bullish we are on footwear, so that number is increasing. And again, that's impressive, but it still compares to the hundreds of millions of pairs of shoes that are made by our competitors. So as we build scale, this will naturally come onboard as well as will help with people like Colin Browne and -- who's our new President of Sourcing and some of the things that we'll do driving some these initiatives. So we see there's great opportunity in gross margin and this is nothing that we're laying back and there's no excuse for what we're doing with operating income as it relates to -- or the way that we're attacking gross margin across the board."

Women's was still growing in the quarter, up 17%, I think, 18%. And again, at the heart of this is category management. I spoke about it in my prepared remarks, and we've done that with women's. This was specifically called out to make sure that it gets the emphasis it needs. Pam Catlett is leading that. She's an industry vet and has been a complete pro in bringing the pieces together. But there's a lot of pieces to bring together. Probably the best thing I could say is when you talk about our women's business, we have $1 billion women's brand. It's taken us one heck of a long time to get here, but we're incredibly proud of what that means. And -- but I think probably looking at women's through the lens of -- I gave the example about footwear in one of my earlier answers, and we have 6 people in our women's footwear team. We just built our first women's last year for the first time. And those are the things from an operating income standpoint I want to say is that when people say you don't have enough -- people dress toe to head, where they start with their shoe. But if the shoe isn't right, if the fit isn't right, if the color isn't right, if we don't have the right team. The reason we didn't build the women's last before is because we were focused on the ability that we couldn't afford it. And so we're making a lot of those small decisions right now that we truly believe that making into -- looking at 2017, 2018, making the investment as unfortunately and fortunately because our growth rate is so great, it creates that drag. But making this right investment in footwear is important. So let me go back with women is that one thing we think is incredibly important is that the football cleated opportunity and what we're doing being the #1 cleat there isn't doing much for the women's category. But the confidence that we're demonstrating in running from our knit products, this is the -- again, this will be the first year in a market that will have that women's last on people's feet -- on women's feet. And we also think that as we continue to drive more better products for her, driving both performance, style, strength and beauty, the focuses we'll have. And so I think we've got a terrific team in place. We are investing in our women's team as well. We think footwear will be one of the catalyst for it. But achieving $1 billion business in women's is a pretty big feat and it's something we're certainly not stopping or satisfied with."
