Last quarter, I spent a great deal of time talking about the decline in the shale prices of each of our publicly traded subsidiaries. Starting my remarks by referring to these declines as the proverbial elephan",1363,"Thank you, Mary, and good morning, everyone. Last quarter, I spent a great deal of time talking about the decline in the shale prices of each of our publicly traded subsidiaries. Starting my remarks by referring to these declines as the proverbial elephant in the room. Well, unfortunately, that elephant has not gone away, and chaos continues to reign over the energy markets.
Case in point. On November 2, the day of our last earnings call, oil was trading just below $47 a barrel. Although we didn't like that number then, it looks pretty good compared to today since oil prices have continued to plummet. On January 20, oil dropped below $27 a barrel, far below the replacement costs. If these pricing levels persist over the next 2 years, we will be in a drastically undersupplied oil market. The natural gas market is under the same dark cloud as the entire energy industry is being affected by this precipitous downturn, which has led to a steep decline in capital spending by exploration and production company. 
Oil price declines have largely been driven by the exceptional strength of supply, not by the weakness of demand. In fact, demand for oil is still growing and remains quite healthy. If there is any bright spots from which to focus, it's that the lack of drilling activity today will only help speed up the recovery in the auto market tomorrow. As they say in the oil business, the best cure for low prices is low prices.
While we wait for market rebalancing in oil prices, the reality for offshore drilling companies is stark. The drop in oil prices is causing oil companies to slash exploration and development budgets, and reduce or cancel drilling contracts, decimating day rates and idling rates. The market for rigs of all types, including new ultra-deepwater drillships, is currently and will for the immediate future be drastically oversupplied. And although Diamond Offshore's conservative financial management has allowed us to enter its downturn on solid footing, it's not immune from these challenging industry dynamics. 
Diamond has had to make some tough decisions regarding its own fleet, writing down 9 rigs in the fourth quarter. David Edelson will provide more details later on it in the call. 
I did want to point out that the Ocean confidence represents about 65% of the write-down. The radio is currently stacked, but we believe it will be a viable rig once the offshore drilling market comes back. And I believe that, that market will come back. It's just a question of when. 
By some estimates, offshore oil production supplies up to 30% of the world's oil, a significant percentage that cannot be replaced by conventional onshore drilling or shale production.
Despite this severe, Diamond continues to work tirelessly to navigate these troubled waters, having made a difficult decision to cut its dividends. This action will bolster Diamond's already strong balance sheet, and allow the company to capitalize on possible opportunities to acquire rig assets in the future at a substantial discount to shipyard prices. 
Turning to the natural gas markets in Boardwalk. Over the last few years, despite low prices, natural gas production has grown significantly. This growth was supported by 2 key dynamics.  The first was of the increase in oil production from shale plays. The majority of oil wells in these plays also yield significant amount of natural gas as a byproduct of oil production. This associated gas accounted for nearly half of all the growth in gas production in the country. 
The second dynamic was the discovery and rapid development of the the Marcellus shale. Well economics in the Marcellus were heavily subsidized by the production of natural gas liquids, which are sold at prices linked to oil. As a result, about a year ago, companies could breakeven when drilling a Marcellus well even with natural gas price below $2 per MCF. As a result, the market was flooded with lots of cheap gas. 
Today, these 2 dynamics have changed dramatically. As oil prices have collapsed, oil production from shale plays has started to decline, with associated gas production following suit. Natural gas production growth is stalling everywhere as producers cut drilling activity in response to the steep drop in NGL and natural gas prices. 
Midstream companies have been particularly affected by the poll having over that E&P industry. The shale price of some of these companies has dropped by over 75% in the past 8 months as the effects of reduced drilling and weakened financials have rippled through the industry. 
Two years ago, Boardwalk made the painful but decision to reduce its distribution, a decision that many of its competitors are making now. In retrospect, this was a wise choice as Boardwalk has been using it internally generated cash flow to fund organic growth projects and position the company for the future. 
We believe that the new projects that Boardwalk has lined up are good investments, and we're hopeful that they will provide Boardwalk with an unlevered double-digit rate of return on assets as they're completed over the next 1 to 3 years.
Although Boardwalk continues to face market headwinds, the company remains financially sound and continues to focus on future growth and capital generation for its shareholders.
CNA is a bright spot in Loews'  portfolio businesses right now, even though the numbers this quarter may obscure that light. There were less of moving parts in CNA's fourth quarter results, most significantly, our reserve charge in its long-term care business. The silver lining of the LTC charge is that it should mitigate future losses in CNA's long-term care book of business. Despite the noise in results, I want to stress that CNA's underlying businesses are solid and it continues to maintain its strong capital position. 
CNA's commercial lines business made steady progress, with a full year combined ratio improvement of almost 8 points due to a digital combination of a favorable loss development and underlying loss ratio improvement. CNA's specialty lines continued to perform well, although market conditions in certain areas are more challenged.
CNA's balance sheet remains stellar, ending the year with statutory capital of over $10.7 billion and GAAP shareholder's equity of almost $11.8 billion. 
As our results in this robust capital position and stable P&C earnings, CNA announced today a $2 per share special dividend, which is in addition to its regular $0.25 quarterly dividend. As a point of reference, last year, CNA also paid a $2 per share special dividend. 
And as a final note, in November of 2015, CNA announced that [indiscernible] will become its next CEO. Dina will join CNA towards the end of 2016 when Tom [indiscernible] retire. The CNA that [indiscernible] will inherit his poise for continued improvement and further value creation. At a later date, I'll spend more time talking about Tom's many accomplishments with the company. But for now, we are looking for another great year at CNA with him at the helm. 
Now let's take a look at Loews' cash position.
We ended the year with $4.3 billion in cash and investments, having spent $1.3 billion during the year buying back Loews' stock. In fact, we repurchased more of our own shares in 2015 than any single year since 1993. CNA's special dividend payment to Loews when received in March will increase our cash and investments by about $500 million. Assuming a regular dividend is paid each quarter, CNA will pay Loews dividends totaling about $730 million in 2016.
Most of our almost effective lever for value creation in 2015 was repurchasing our own shares. Our other 2 levers are making opportune advancements at the holding company level and investing in our subsidiaries. Over the years, each of these levers has contributed greatly to contributing long-term value to our shareholders.
The foundation for all of Loews' long-term valuation, value creation is, however, our commitment to maintaining our financial strength and stability. Our prudent capital management will ensure that the financial health we have built out of brick can continue to withstand whatever economic huffing and puffing may come our way. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, David Edelson."
285930,321970679,928465,"Loews Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 08, 2016",2016-02-08,"Earnings Calls","Loews Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning. Loews reported a fourth quarter net loss of $201 million or $0.58 per share. Both CNA Financial and Diamond Offshore posted quarterly losses driven by unusual items. Excluding unusual items, which I will describe more ful",1398,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning. Loews reported a fourth quarter net loss of $201 million or $0.58 per share. Both CNA Financial and Diamond Offshore posted quarterly losses driven by unusual items. Excluding unusual items, which I will describe more fully, Loews' income from continuing operations declined from $264 million in Q4 2014 to $183 million in Q4 2013. 
For the full year, Loews had income from continuing operations of $260 million or $0.72 per share, compared to $962 million or $2.52 per share for the prior year. Unusual items and lower operating results at CNA and Diamond were the main drivers of the year-over-year decline. Excluding unusual items, our income from continuing operations declined from $1.1 billion in 2014 to $858 million in 2015.
I will start by reviewing our fourth quarter results, and then return to the full year. CNA's earnings in Q4 2015 were reduced by a reserve charge, as Jim mentioned, related to its long-term care business, as well as by a change in accounting estimate adopted to better reflect the yields on fixed maturity securities that have call provisions. The long-term care reserve charge end of the accounting change reduced Loews' income from continuing operations by $177 million and $22 million, respectively. 
Absent these 2 unusual items in 2015 and a nonrecurring pension settlement charge in 2014, CNA's fourth quarter net operating income decreased by 35% versus Q4 2014, several factors contributed to the fourth quarter year-over-year decline in net operating income at CNA, excluding these unusual items.
Lower LP income, higher catastrophe losses, less favorable prior year development and lower non-cat accident year underwriting income, driven by higher loss ratios in specialty and international, and an expense ratio that was about 2 points above the company's run rate. Partially offsetting these negative factors was a continued market improvement in commercial loss ratio.
Let me take a moment to discuss the long-term care reserve charge. CNA concluded its annual LTC reserve review during the fourth quarter. When CNA applied its current best estimate actuarial assumptions to its long-term care reserve, the result was a $396 million increase in reserve estimate. Given that CNA had $100 million of margin before the review, this increase resulted in what's known as an unlocking and a $296 million pretax reserve charge at the CNA level. I would note that this is a GAAP reserve charge. The unlocking does not impact CNA's statutory surplus. 
CNA's LTC active life reserves are now based on its current best estimate assumptions. Future periodic income for long-term care will reflect any variance between actual experience and the reset assumptions contemplated in CNA's best estimate reserves. The reset assumptions should theoretically produce a breakeven underwriting results for long-term care, although there will undoubtedly be variability in CNA future per unit results. 
Diamond Offshore's fourth quarter reflects about challenging market conditions that Jim referred to earlier. Diamond's results in Q4 2015 were dominated by a $499 million pretax asset impairment charge, which reduced Loews' income from continuing operations by $182 million. Diamond wrote down 9 rigs in the fourth quarter, 5 jack-ups, 2 mid-water floaters and 2 Deepwater floaters. 
Setting aside the rig impairment charges, Diamond contributed $60 million to our Q4 income from continuing operations, up 28% from the fourth quarter of 2014. While contract drilling revenues were down meaningfully, aftertax earnings benefited from expense reductions and a favorable tax rate.
Diamond management is working hard to control expenses in the face of such difficult market conditions. Boardwalk posted a strong quarter as its contribution to our income from continuing operations, increased from $11 million in Q4 2014 to $19 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. Boardwalk's net operating revenues were up 10% in the quarter, and its expenses were essentially flat, resulting in a significant increase in its net income.
Several factors drove Boardwalk's revenue increase, including the Gulf South Rate case, the Evangeline pipeline being back in service and growth projects coming online. 
Loews Hotels contributed a slight loss to our income from continuing operations in the fourth quarter. The company's net income was hampared by an impairment charge on a joint venture equity interest in a hotel property as well as by hotel opening expenses, higher depreciation, losses posted at certain recently acquired properties and some unusual tax items. 
Remember that for required properties, there is typically a transitioned period if the property becomes a Loews branded hotel. Loews Hotels adjusted EBITDA, which is disclosed in our earnings snapshot, increased from $35 million in Q4 of 2014 to $38 million in Q4 2015.
Let me now turn to a brief discussion of the full year. CNA and Diamond accounted for the bulk of the year-over-year earnings decline, with reduced parent company investment income also contributed to the decline. CNA contributed $433 million to our income from continuing operations in 2015, down from $802 million in 2014. Included in these results are aftertax realized investment losses of $34 million in 2015 versus realized investment gains of $32 million in 2014.
Unusual items figure prominently in the year-over-year decline. The fourth quarter long-term care reserve charge and accounting change and the second quarter retroactive reinsurance charge combined to reduce CNA's earnings contribution by $237 million in 2015. In 2014, unusual items reduced CNA's earnings contribution by $30 million, resulting in a $207 million year-on-year negative swing.
Absent unusual items. CNA's net operating income was down 12% in 2015. Key drivers of this analyte decline were significantly lower LP income, slightly lower non-cat accident year underwriting income and higher operating losses in the Life & Group segment, caused largely by adverse mobility in the long-term care business. Partially offsetting the decline was higher favorable net prior year development.
Diamond contributed $156 million loss of our income from continuing operations in 2015, whereas in 2014, it contributed an income of $183 million. During 2015, Diamond booked $870 million of pretax asset impairment and restructuring charges, which reduced Loews' income from continuing operations by $344 million. Additionally, earlier in 2015, Loews wrote up $20 million of goodwill associated with Diamond. 
In 2014, Diamond's asset impairments reduced Loews' aftertax income by $55 million. Absent the impairment and restructuring charges and goodwill writeups, Diamond's contribution to our income from continuing operations declined by $30 million to $208 million, reflecting the substantial decline in revenues from pure rigs operating.
Boardwalk pipeline's contribution income from continuing operations rose to $74 million in 2015 from the prior year's $18 million, while strong operating results helped. The biggest driver of the year-over-year increase was the write-off in 2014 of capitalized costs associated with the terminated project, which reduced Loews' 2014 income from continuing operations by $55 million.
Loews Hotels contribute $12 million to our 2015 income, up from $11 million in 2014. Profitability was hampered by the results at a pure recently acquired hotels and hotels of operational challenges. 
On the other hand, numerous properties, including the properties at the Universal Orlando Resort, were up nicely versus 2014.
Adjusted EBITDA from Loews Hotels is up 29% year-over-year to $158 million. For the full year, parent company after-tax investment income was down from $63 million in 2014 to $16 million in 2015, reflecting lower performance of equities and alternatives.
As a Jim mentioned at year end, cash and investments totaled $4.3 billion as compared to $4.8 billion at end of September and $5.1 billion at the end of 2014.
Jim already mentioned our substantial share repurchases during Q4 and the full year, but let me reiterate. During the fourth quarter, we spent $632 million, repurchasing 17 million shares. For the full year, we bought back 33.3 million shares for a total of $1.26  billion shares. This represents just under 9% of our shares outstanding at the beginning of 2015.
Thus far, during 2016, we have repurchased 919,000 additional shares. 
During the fourth quarter, we received $83 million in dividends from our subsidiaries, $61 million from CNA, $9 million from Diamond and $13 million from Boardwalk. 
During all of 2015, we received $816 million in dividends from our subsidiaries, up from $782 million in 2014.
As Jim mentioned today, CNA declared a $2 special dividend, which is in addition to its regular $0.25 per share quarterly dividend.
Combining the two, Loews expects to receive $545 million in dividends from CNA this quarter. 
Let me now hand the call back to Jim."

Before we proceed to our Q&A, let me review why I am confident about the long-term prospects of each of our businesses. 
CNA has improved its underwriting performance and paid significant dividends to shareholders, while maintaining its strong capital position. Diamond is in a tough market, and although we can't predict when this market will turn around, Diamond is ready to weather the storm. It's been conserving its financial resources and maintaining its position as the strongest offshore drilling company in terms of finance, innovation and leadership. Hopefully, during these challenging times for the offshore drilling industry, Diamond will be able to add productive rate assets at attractive valuations. 
Boardwalk has made smart capital decisions that should allow us to fund its announced growth projects without having to issue equity in 2016.
And Loews Hotels continues to grow its chain steadily with an eye towards profitability.
Whether confronting headwinds or aided by tailwinds, Loews' strategic impairment remains at the same, creating value for shareholders over the long term.

Last quarter, I spent a great deal of time talking about the decline in the shale prices of each of our publicly traded subsidiaries.

Last quarter, I spent a great deal of time talking about the decline in the shale prices of each of our publicly traded subsidiaries. Starting my remarks by referring to these declines as the proverbial elephant in the room, well, unfortunately, that elephant has not gone away, and chaos continues to reign over the energy markets.
Case in point. On November 2, the day of our last earnings call, oil was trading just below $47 a barrel. Although we didn't like that number then, it looks pretty good compared to today since oil prices have continued to plummet. On January 20, oil dropped below $27 a barrel, far below its replacement cost. If these pricing levels persist over the next 2 years, we'll be in a drastically undersupplied oil market. The natural gas market is under the same dark cloud as the entire energy industry is being affected by this precipitous downturn, which has led to a steep decline in capital spending by exploration and production companies. 
Oil price declines have largely been driven by the exceptional strength of supply, not by the weakness of demand. In fact, demand for oil is still growing and remains quite healthy. If there is any bright spot from which to focus, it's that the lack of drilling activity today will only help speed up the recovery in the auto market tomorrow. As they say in the oil business, the best cure for low prices is low prices.
While we wait for a market rebalancing in oil prices, the reality for offshore drilling companies is stark. The drop in oil prices is causing oil companies to slash exploration and development budgets and reduce or cancel drilling contracts, decimating day rates and idling rigs. The market for rigs of all types, including new ultra-deepwater drillships, is currently and will for the immediate future be drastically oversupplied. And although Diamond Offshore's conservative financial management has allowed us to enter this downturn on solid footing, it's not immune from these challenging industry dynamics.  Diamond has had to make some tough decisions regarding its own fleet, writing down 9 rigs in the fourth quarter. David Edelson will provide more details later on in the call. 
I did want to point out that the Ocean Confidence represents about 65% of the write-down. The rig is currently stacked, but we believe it will be a viable rig once the offshore drilling market comes back. And I believe that, that market will come back. It's just a question of when. 
By some estimates, offshore oil production supplies up to 30% of the world's oil, a significant percentage that cannot be replaced by conventional onshore drilling or shale production.
Despite this severe downturn, Diamond continues to work tirelessly to navigate these troubled waters, having made a difficult decision to cut its dividend. This action will bolster Diamond's already strong balance sheet and allow the company to capitalize on possible opportunities to acquire rig assets in the future at a substantial discount to shipyard prices. 
Turning to the natural gas markets and Boardwalk. Over the last few years, despite low prices, natural gas production has grown significantly. This growth was supported by 2 key dynamics. The first was of the increase in oil production from shale plays. A majority of oil wells in these plays also yield significant amounts of natural gas as a byproduct of oil production. This associated gas accounted for nearly half of all the growth in gas production in the country. 
The second dynamic was the discovery and rapid development of the Marcellus Shale. Well economics in the Marcellus are -- were heavily subsidized by the production of natural gas liquids, which are sold at prices linked to oil. As a result, about a year ago, companies could breakeven when drilling a Marcellus well even with natural gas price below $2 per Mcf. As a result, the market was flooded with lots of cheap gas. 
Today, these 2 dynamics have changed dramatically. As oil prices have collapsed, oil production from shale plays has started to decline, with associated gas production following suit. Natural gas production growth is stalling everywhere as producers cut drilling activity in response to the steep drop in NGL and natural gas prices. 
Midstream companies have been particularly affected by the pole hanging over that E&P industry. The shale price of some of these companies has dropped by over 75% in the past 8 months as the effects of reduced drilling and weakened financials have rippled through the industry. 
2 years ago, Boardwalk made the painful but important decision to reduce its distribution, a decision that many of its competitors are making now. In retrospect, this was a wise choice as Boardwalk has been using its internally generated cash flow to fund organic growth projects and position the company for the future. 
We believe that the new projects that Boardwalk has lined up are good investments, and we're hopeful that they will provide Boardwalk with an unlevered double-digit rate of return on assets as they're completed over the next 1 to 3 years.
Although Boardwalk continues to face market headwinds, the company remains financially sound and continues to focus on future growth and capital generation for its shareholders.
CNA is a bright spot in Loews' portfolio of businesses right now, even though the numbers this quarter may obscure that light. There were less of moving parts in CNA's fourth quarter results, most significantly, a reserve charge in its long-term care business. The silver lining of the LTC charge is that it should mitigate future losses in CNA's long-term care book of business. Despite the noise in the results, I want to stress that CNA's underlying businesses are solid and it continues to maintain its strong capital position. 
CNA's commercial lines business made steady progress with a full year combined ratio improvement of almost 8 points due to a combination of a favorable loss development and underlying loss ratio improvement. CNA's specialty lines continued to perform well, although market conditions in certain areas are more challenged.
CNA's balance sheet remained stellar, ending the year with statutory capital of over $10.7 billion and GAAP shareholders' equity of almost $11.8 billion. 
As a result of its robust capital position and stable P&C earnings, CNA announced today a $2 per share special dividend, which is in addition to its regular $0.25 quarterly dividend. As a point of reference, last year, CNA also paid a $2 per share special dividend. 
And as a final note, in November of 2015, CNA announced that Dino Robusto will become its next CEO. Dino will join CNA towards the end of 2016 when Tom Motamed retires. The CNA that Dino will inherit is poised for continued improvement and further value creation. At a later date, I'll spend more time talking about Tom's many accomplishments of the company. But for now, we are looking forward to another great year at CNA with him at the helm. 
Now let's take a look at Loews' cash position. We ended the year with $4.3 billion in cash and investments, having spent $1.3 billion during the year buying back Loews' stock. In fact, we repurchased more of our own shares in 2015 than any single year since 1993. CNA's special dividend payment to Loews, when received in March, will increase our cash and investments by about $500 million. Assuming a regular dividend is paid each quarter, CNA will pay Loews dividends totaling about $730 million in 2016.
Most of our -- our most effective lever for value creation in 2015 was repurchasing our own shares. Our other 2 levers are making opportune advancements at the holding company level and investing in our subsidiaries. Over the years, each of these levers has contributed greatly to creating long-term value for our shareholders.
The foundation for all of Loews' long-term valuation -- value creation is, however, our commitment to maintaining our financial strength and stability. Our prudent capital management will ensure that the financial health we have built out of bricks can continue to withstand whatever economic huffing and puffing may come our way. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, David Edelson."
285930,321970679,928510,"Loews Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 08, 2016",2016-02-08,"Earnings Calls","Loews Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning. Loews reported a fourth quarter net loss of $201 million or $0.58 per share. Both CNA Financial and Diamond Offshore posted quarterly losses driven by unusual items. Excluding unusual items, which I will describe more ful",1398,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning. Loews reported a fourth quarter net loss of $201 million or $0.58 per share. Both CNA Financial and Diamond Offshore posted quarterly losses driven by unusual items. Excluding unusual items, which I will describe more fully, Loews' income from continuing operations declined from $264 million in Q4 2014 to $183 million in Q4 2015.
For the full year, Loews had income from continuing operations of $260 million or $0.72 per share compared to $962 million or $2.52 per share for the prior year. Unusual items and lower operating results at CNA and Diamond were the main drivers of the year-over-year decline. Excluding unusual items, our income from continuing operations declined from $1.1 billion in 2014 to $858 million in 2015.
I'll start by reviewing our fourth quarter results and then return to the full year. CNA's earnings in Q4 2015 were reduced by a reserve charge, as Jim mentioned, related to its long-term care business as well as by a change in accounting estimate adopted to better reflect the yields on fixed maturity securities that have call provisions. The long-term care reserve charge and the accounting change reduced Loews' income from continuing operations by $177 million and $22 million, respectively. Absent these 2 unusual items in 2015 and a nonrecurring pension settlement charge in 2014, CNA's fourth quarter net operating income decreased by 35% versus Q4 2014.
Several factors contributed to the fourth quarter year-over-year decline in net operating income at CNA, excluding these unusual items.  Lower LP income, higher catastrophe losses, less favorable prior year development and lower non-cat accident year underwriting income, driven by higher loss ratios in specialty and international, and an expense ratio that was about 2 points above the company's run rate. Partially offsetting these negative factors was a continued marked improvement in commercial's loss ratio.
Let me take a moment to discuss the long-term care reserve charge. CNA concluded its annual LTC reserve review during the fourth quarter. When CNA applied its current best estimate actuarial assumptions to its long-term care reserves, the result was a $396 million increase in reserve estimate. Given that CNA had $100 million of margin before the review, this increase resulted in what's known as an unlocking and a $296 million pretax reserve charge at the CNA level. I would note that this is a GAAP reserve charge. The unlocking does not impact CNA's statutory surplus. 
CNA's LTC active life reserves are now based on its current best estimate assumptions. Future periodic income for long-term care will reflect any variance between actual experience and the reset assumptions contemplated in CNA's best estimate reserves. The reset assumptions should theoretically produce a breakeven underwriting result for long-term care, although there will undoubtedly be variability in CNA's future periodic results. 
Diamond Offshore's fourth quarter reflects the challenging market conditions that Jim referred to earlier. Diamond's results in Q4 2015 were dominated by a $499 million pretax asset impairment charge, which reduced Loews' income from continuing operations by $182 million. Diamond wrote down 9 rigs in the fourth quarter, 5 jack-ups, 2 mid-water floaters and 2 deepwater floaters.
Setting aside the rig impairment charges, Diamond contributed $60 million to our Q4 income from continuing operations, up 28% from the fourth quarter of 2014. While contract drilling revenues were down meaningfully, after-tax earnings benefited from expense reductions and a favorable tax rate. Diamond management is working hard to control expenses in the face of such difficult market conditions.
Boardwalk posted a strong quarter as its contribution to our income from continuing operations increased from $11 million in Q4 2014 to $19 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. Boardwalk's net operating revenues were up 10% in the quarter, and its expenses were essentially flat, resulting in a significant increase in its net income.
Several factors drove Boardwalk's revenue increase, including the Gulf South rate case, the Evangeline pipeline being back in service and growth projects coming online. 
Loews Hotels contributed a slight loss to our income from continuing operations in the fourth quarter. The company's net income was hampered by an impairment charge on a joint venture equity interest in a hotel property as well as by hotel opening expenses, higher depreciation, losses posted at certain recently acquired properties and some unusual tax items. 
Remember that for acquired properties, there is typically a transition period as the property becomes a Loews branded hotel. Loews Hotels' adjusted EBITDA, which is disclosed in our earnings snapshot, increased from $35 million in Q4 of 2014 to $38 million in Q4 2015.
Let me now turn to a brief discussion of the full year. CNA and Diamond accounted for the bulk of the year-over-year earnings decline, where reduced parent company investment income also contributed to the decline. CNA contributed $433 million to our income from continuing operations in 2015, down from $802 million in 2014. Included in these results are aftertax-realized investment losses of $34 million in 2015 versus realized investment gains of $32 million in 2014.
Unusual items figured prominently in the year-over-year decline. The fourth quarter long-term care reserve charge and accounting change and the second quarter retroactive reinsurance charge combined to reduce CNA's earnings contribution by $237 million in 2015. In 2014, unusual items reduced CNA's earnings contribution by $30 million, resulting in a $207 million year-on-year negative swing.
Absent unusual items, CNA's net operating income was down 12% in 2015. Key drivers of this NOI decline were significantly lower LP income, slightly lower non-cat accident year underwriting income and higher operating losses in the Life & Group segment, caused largely by adverse morbidity in the long-term care business. Partially offsetting the decline was higher favorable net prior year development.
Diamond contributed a $156 million loss to our income from continuing operations in 2015, whereas in 2014 it contributed an income of $183 million. During 2015, Diamond booked $870 million of pretax asset impairment and restructuring charges, which reduced Loews' income from continuing operations by $344 million. Additionally, earlier in 2015, Loews wrote off $20 million of goodwill associated with Diamond. 
In 2014, Diamond's asset impairments reduced Loews' after-tax income by $55 million. Absent the impairment and restructuring charges and goodwill write-off, Diamond's contribution to our income from continuing operations declined by $30 million to $208 million, reflecting the substantial decline in revenues from pure rigs operating --
Boardwalk's pipe -- Boardwalk pipeline's contribution income from continuing operations rose to $74 million in 2015 from the prior year's $18 million. While strong operating results helped, the biggest driver of the year-over-year increase was the write-off in 2014 of capitalized costs associated with the terminated project, which reduced Loews' 2014 income from continuing operations by $55 million.
Loews Hotels contributed $12 million to our 2015 income, up from $11 million in 2014. Profitability was hampered by the results at a few recently acquired hotels and hotels with operational challenges.  On the other hand, numerous properties, including the properties at the Universal Orlando Resort, were up nicely versus 2014.
Adjusted EBITDA for Loews Hotels was up 29% year-over-year to $158 million. For the full year, parent company after-tax investment income was down from $63 million in 2014 to $16 million in 2015, reflecting lower performance of equities and alternatives.
As Jim mentioned at year-end, cash and investments totaled $4.3 billion as compared to $4.8 billion at end of September and $5.1 billion at the end of 2014.
Jim already mentioned our substantial share repurchases during Q4 and the full year, but let me reiterate. During the fourth quarter, we spent $632 million repurchasing 17 million shares. For the full year, we bought back 33.3 million shares for a total of $1.26 billion. This represents just under 9% of our shares outstanding at the beginning of 2015. Thus far, during 2016, we have repurchased 919,000 additional shares. 
During the fourth quarter, we received $83 million in dividends from our subsidiaries: $61 million from CNA, $9 million from Diamond and $13 million from Boardwalk. During all of 2015, we received $816 million in dividends from our subsidiaries, up from $782 million in 2014.
As Jim mentioned today, CNA declared a $2 per share special dividend, which is in addition to its regular $0.25 per share quarterly dividend. Combining the 2, Loews expects to receive $545 million in dividends from CNA this quarter. 
Let me now hand the call back to Jim."

Before we proceed to our Q&A, let me review why I'm confident about the long-term prospects of each of our businesses.
CNA has improved its underwriting performance and paid significant dividends to shareholders, while maintaining its strong capital position. Diamond is in a tough market, and although we can't predict when its market will turn around, Diamond is ready to weather the storm. It's been conserving its financial resources and maintaining its position as the strongest offshore drilling company in terms of finance, innovation and leadership. Hopefully, during these challenging times for the offshore drilling industry, Diamond will be able to add productive rig assets at attractive valuations. 
Boardwalk has made smart capital decisions that should allow it to fund its announced growth projects without having to issue equity in 2016.
And Loews Hotels continues to grow its chain steadily with an eye towards profitability.
Whether confronting headwinds or aided by tailwinds, Loews' strategic imperative remains at the same: creating value for shareholders over the long term.
And now I'd like to turn the call back to Mary Skafidas."

It would be very nice for Boardwalk to be able to increase its distribution. And by the way, Loews would be the biggest beneficiary of such an increase. But Boardwalk will not do that until such time as it has the distributable cash flow available to it and total access to markets in order that the dividend could be increased responsibly.

Last quarter, I spent a great deal of time talking about the decline in the shale prices of each of our publicly traded subsidiaries. Starting my remarks by referring to these declines as the proverbial elephant in the room, well, unfortunately, that elephant has not gone away, and chaos continues to reign over the energy markets.
Case in point. On November 2, the day of our last earnings call, oil was trading just below $47 a barrel. Although we didn't like that number then, it looks pretty good compared to today since oil prices have continued to plummet. On January 20, oil dropped below $27 a barrel, far below its replacement cost. If these pricing levels persist over the next 2 years, we'll be in a drastically undersupplied oil market. The natural gas market is under the same dark cloud as the entire energy industry is being affected by this precipitous downturn, which has led to a steep decline in capital spending by exploration and production companies. 
Oil price declines have largely been driven by the exceptional strength of supply, not by the weakness of demand. In fact, demand for oil is still growing and remains quite healthy. If there is any bright spot from which to focus, it's that the lack of drilling activity today will only help speed up the recovery in the auto market tomorrow. As they say in the oil business, the best cure for low prices is low prices.
While we wait for a market rebalancing in oil prices, the reality for offshore drilling companies is stark. The drop in oil prices is causing oil companies to slash exploration and development budgets and reduce or cancel drilling contracts, decimating day rates and idling rigs. The market for rigs of all types, including new ultra-deepwater drillships, is currently and will for the immediate future be drastically oversupplied. And although Diamond Offshore's conservative financial management has allowed it to enter this downturn on solid footing, it's not immune from these challenging industry dynamics.  Diamond has had to make some tough decisions regarding its own fleet, writing down 9 rigs in the fourth quarter. David Edelson will provide more details later on in the call. 
I did want to point out that the Ocean Confidence represents about 65% of the write-down. The rig is currently stacked, but we believe it will be a viable rig once the offshore drilling market comes back. And I believe that, that market will come back. It's just a question of when. 
By some estimates, offshore oil production supplies up to 30% of the world's oil, a significant percentage that cannot be replaced by conventional onshore drilling or shale production.
Despite this severe downturn, Diamond continues to work tirelessly to navigate these troubled waters, having made the difficult decision to cut its dividend. This action will bolster Diamond's already strong balance sheet and allow the company to capitalize on possible opportunities to acquire rig assets in the future at a substantial discount to shipyard prices. 
Turning to the natural gas markets and Boardwalk. Over the last few years, despite low prices, natural gas production has grown significantly. This growth was supported by 2 key dynamics. The first was the increase in oil production from shale plays. A majority of oil wells in these plays also yield significant amounts of natural gas as a byproduct of oil production. This associated gas accounted for nearly half of all the growth in gas production in the country. 
The second dynamic was the discovery and rapid development of the Marcellus Shale. Well economics in the Marcellus are -- were heavily subsidized by the production of natural gas liquids, which are sold at prices linked to oil. As a result, about a year ago, companies could break even when drilling a Marcellus well even with natural gas price below $2 per Mcf. As a result, the market was flooded with lots of cheap gas. 
Today, these 2 dynamics have changed dramatically. As oil prices have collapsed, oil production from shale plays has started to decline, with associated gas production following suit. Natural gas production growth is stalling everywhere as producers cut drilling activity in response to the steep drop in NGL and natural gas prices. 
Midstream companies have been particularly affected by the pall hanging over that E&P industry. The shale price of some of these companies has dropped by over 75% in the past 8 months as the effects of reduced drilling and weakened financials have rippled through the industry. 
Two years ago, Boardwalk made the painful but important decision to reduce its distribution, a decision that many of its competitors are making now. In retrospect, this was a wise choice as Boardwalk has been using its internally generated cash flow to fund organic growth projects and position the company for the future. 
We believe that the new projects that Boardwalk has lined up are good investments, and we're hopeful that they will provide Boardwalk with an unlevered double-digit rate of return on assets as they're completed over the next 1 to 3 years.
Although Boardwalk continues to face market headwinds, the company remains financially sound and continues to focus on future growth and capital generation for its shareholders.
CNA is a bright spot in Loews' portfolio of businesses right now, even though the numbers this quarter may obscure that light. There were lots of moving parts in CNA's fourth quarter results, most significantly, a reserve charge in its long-term care business. The silver lining of the LTC charge is that it should mitigate future losses in CNA's long-term care book of business. Despite the noise in the results, I want to stress that CNA's underlying businesses are solid and it continues to maintain its strong capital position. 
CNA's commercial lines business made steady progress with a full year combined ratio improvement of almost 8 points due to a combination of favorable loss development and underlying loss ratio improvement. CNA's specialty lines continued to perform well, although market conditions in certain areas are more challenged.
CNA's balance sheet remained stellar, ending the year with statutory capital of over $10.7 billion and GAAP shareholders' equity of almost $11.8 billion. 
As a result of its robust capital position and stable P&C earnings, CNA announced today a $2 per share special dividend, which is in addition to its regular $0.25 quarterly dividend. As a point of reference, last year, CNA also paid a $2 per share special dividend. 
And as a final note, in November of 2015, CNA announced that Dino Robusto will become its next CEO. Dino will join CNA towards the end of 2016 when Tom Motamed retires. The CNA that Dino will inherit is poised for continued improvement and further value creation. At a later date, I'll spend more time talking about Tom's many accomplishments at the company. But for now, we are looking forward to another great year at CNA with him at the helm. 
Now let's take a look at Loews' cash position. We ended the year with $4.3 billion in cash and investments, having spent $1.3 billion during the year buying back Loews' stock. In fact, we repurchased more of our own shares in 2015 than any single year since 1993. CNA's special dividend payment to Loews, when received in March, will increase our cash and investments by about $500 million. Assuming a regular dividend is paid each quarter, CNA will pay Loews dividends totaling about $730 million in 2016.
Most of our -- our most effective lever for value creation in 2015 was repurchasing our own shares. Our other 2 levers are making opportune advancements at the holding company level and investing in our subsidiaries. Over the years, each of these levers has contributed greatly to creating long-term value for our shareholders.
The foundation for all of Loews' long-term valuation -- value creation is, however, our commitment to maintaining our financial strength and stability. Our prudent capital management will ensure that the financial house we have built out of bricks can continue to withstand whatever economic huffing and puffing may come our way. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, David Edelson."

Both CNA Financial and Diamond Offshore posted quarterly losses driven by unusual items. Excluding unusual items, which I will describe more fully, Loews' income from continuing operations declined from $264 million in Q4 2014 to $183 million in Q4 2015.
For the full year, Loews had income from continuing operations of $260 million or $0.72 per share compared to $962 million or $2.52 per share for the prior year. Unusual items and lower operating results at CNA and Diamond were the main drivers of the year-over-year decline. Excluding unusual items, our income from continuing operations declined from $1.1 billion in 2014 to $858 million in 2015.
I'll start by reviewing our fourth quarter results and then return to the full year. CNA's earnings in Q4 2015 were reduced by a reserve charge, as Jim mentioned, related to its long-term care business as well as by a change in accounting estimate adopted to better reflect the yields on fixed maturity securities that have call provisions. The long-term care reserve charge and the accounting change reduced Loews' income from continuing operations by $177 million and $22 million, respectively. Absent these 2 unusual items in 2015 and a nonrecurring pension settlement charge in 2014, CNA's fourth quarter net operating income decreased by 35% versus Q4 2014.
Several factors contributed to the fourth quarter year-over-year decline in net operating income at CNA, excluding these unusual items.  Lower LP income, higher catastrophe losses, less favorable prior year development and lower non-cat accident year underwriting income, driven by higher loss ratios in specialty and international, and an expense ratio that was about 2 points above the company's run rate. Partially offsetting these negative factors was a continued market improvement in commercial's loss ratio.
Let me take a moment to discuss the long-term care reserve charge. CNA concluded its annual LTC reserve review during the fourth quarter. When CNA applied its current best estimate actuarial assumptions to its long-term care reserves, the result was a $396 million increase in reserve estimate. Given that CNA had $100 million of margin before the review, this increase resulted in what's known as an unlocking and a $296 million pretax reserve charge at the CNA level. I would note that this is a GAAP reserve charge. The unlocking does not impact CNA's statutory surplus. 
CNA's LTC active life reserves are now based on its current best estimate assumptions. Future periodic income for long-term care will reflect any variance between actual experience and the reset assumptions contemplated in CNA's best estimate reserves. The reset assumptions should theoretically produce a breakeven underwriting result for long-term care, although there will undoubtedly be variability in CNA's future periodic results. 
Diamond Offshore's fourth quarter reflects the challenging market conditions that Jim referred to earlier. Diamond's results in Q4 2015 were dominated by a $499 million pretax asset impairment charge, which reduced Loews' income from continuing operations by $182 million. Diamond wrote down 9 rigs in the fourth quarter, 5 jack-ups, 2 mid-water floaters and 2 deepwater floaters.
Setting aside the rig impairment charges, Diamond contributed $60 million to our Q4 income from continuing operations, up 28% from the fourth quarter of 2014. While contract drilling revenues were down meaningfully, after-tax earnings benefited from expense reductions and a favorable tax rate. Diamond management is working hard to control expenses in the face of such difficult market conditions.
Boardwalk posted a strong quarter as its contribution to our income from continuing operations increased from $11 million in Q4 2014 to $19 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. Boardwalk's net operating revenues were up 10% in the quarter, and its expenses were essentially flat, resulting in a significant increase in its net income.
Several factors drove Boardwalk's revenue increase, including the Gulf South rate case, the Evangeline pipeline being back in service and growth projects coming online. 
Loews Hotels contributed a slight loss to our income from continuing operations in the fourth quarter. The company's net income was hampered by an impairment charge on a joint venture equity interest in a hotel property as well as by hotel opening expenses, higher depreciation, losses posted at certain recently acquired properties and some unusual tax items. 
Remember that for acquired properties, there is typically a transition period as the property becomes a Loews branded hotel. Loews Hotels' adjusted EBITDA, which is disclosed in our earnings snapshot, increased from $35 million in Q4 of 2014 to $38 million in Q4 2015.
Let me now turn to a brief discussion of the full year. CNA and Diamond accounted for the bulk of the year-over-year earnings decline; reduced parent company investment income also contributed to the decline. CNA contributed $433 million to our income from continuing operations in 2015, down from $802 million in 2014. Included in these results are aftertax-realized investment losses of $34 million in 2015 versus realized investment gains of $32 million in 2014.
Unusual items figured prominently in the year-over-year decline. The fourth quarter long-term care reserve charge and accounting change and the second quarter retroactive reinsurance charge combined to reduce CNA's earnings contribution by $237 million in 2015. In 2014, unusual items reduced CNA's earnings contribution by $30 million, resulting in a $207 million year-on-year negative swing.
Absent unusual items, CNA's net operating income was down 12% in 2015. Key drivers of this NOI decline were significantly lower LP income, slightly lower non-cat accident year underwriting income and higher operating losses in the Life & Group segment, caused largely by adverse morbidity in the long-term care business. Partially offsetting the decline was higher favorable net prior year development.
Diamond contributed a $156 million loss to our income from continuing operations in 2015, whereas in 2014 it contributed income of $183 million. During 2015, Diamond booked $870 million of pretax asset impairment and restructuring charges, which reduced Loews' income from continuing operations by $344 million. Additionally, earlier in 2015, Loews wrote off $20 million of goodwill associated with Diamond. 
In 2014, Diamond's asset impairments reduced Loews' after-tax income by $55 million. Absent the impairment and restructuring charges and goodwill write-off, Diamond's contribution to our income from continuing operations declined by $30 million to $208 million, reflecting the substantial decline in revenues from pure rigs operating.
Boardwalk's pipe -- Boardwalk pipeline's contribution income from continuing operations rose to $74 million in 2015 from the prior year's $18 million. While strong operating results helped, the biggest driver of the year-over-year increase was the write-off in 2014 of capitalized costs associated with the terminated project, which reduced Loews' 2014 income from continuing operations by $55 million.
Loews Hotels contributed $12 million to our 2015 income, up from $11 million in 2014. Profitability was hampered by the results at a few recently acquired hotels and hotels with operational challenges.  On the other hand, numerous properties, including the properties at the Universal Orlando Resort, were up nicely versus 2014.
Adjusted EBITDA for Loews Hotels was up 29% year-over-year to $158 million. For the full year, parent company after-tax investment income was down from $63 million in 2014 to $16 million in 2015, reflecting lower performance of equities and alternatives.
As Jim mentioned at year-end, cash and investments totaled $4.3 billion as compared to $4.8 billion at end of September and $5.1 billion at the end of 2014.
Jim already mentioned our substantial share repurchases during Q4 and the full year, but let me reiterate. During the fourth quarter, we spent $632 million repurchasing 17 million shares. For the full year, we bought back 33.3 million shares for a total of $1.26 billion. This represents just under 9% of our shares outstanding at the beginning of 2015. Thus far, during 2016, we have repurchased 919,000 additional shares. 
During the fourth quarter, we received $83 million in dividends from our subsidiaries: $61 million from CNA, $9 million from Diamond and $13 million from Boardwalk. During all of 2015, we received $816 million in dividends from our subsidiaries, up from $782 million in 2014.
As Jim mentioned today, CNA declared a $2 per share special dividend, which is in addition to its regular $0.25 per share quarterly dividend. Combining the 2, Loews expects to receive $545 million in dividends from CNA this quarter. 
Let me now hand the call back to Jim."

Before we proceed to our Q&A, let me review why I'm confident about the long-term prospects of each of our businesses.
CNA has improved its underwriting performance and paid significant dividends to shareholders, while maintaining its strong capital position. Diamond is in a tough market, and although we can't predict when its market will turn around, Diamond is ready to weather the storm. It's been conserving its financial resources and maintaining its position as the strongest offshore drilling company in terms of finance, innovation and leadership. Hopefully, during these challenging times for the offshore drilling industry, Diamond will be able to add productive rig assets at attractive valuations. 
Boardwalk has made smart capital decisions that should allow it to fund its announced growth projects without having to issue equity in 2016.
And Loews Hotels continues to grow its chain steadily with an eye towards profitability.
Whether confronting headwinds or aided by tailwinds, Loews' strategic imperative remains the same: creating value for shareholders over the long term.

Last quarter, I spent a great deal of time talking about the decline in the shale prices of each of our publicly traded subsidiaries.

Last quarter, I spent a great deal of time talking about the decline in the shale prices of each of our publicly traded subsidiaries. Starting my remarks by referring to these declines as the proverbial elephant in the room, well, unfortunately, that elephant has not gone away, and chaos continues to reign over the energy markets.
Case in point. On November 2, the day of our last earnings call, oil was trading just below $47 a barrel. Although we didn't like that number then, it looks pretty good compared to today since oil prices have continued to plummet. On January 20, oil dropped below $27 a barrel, far below its replacement cost. If these pricing levels persist over the next 2 years, we'll be in a drastically undersupplied oil market. The natural gas market is under the same dark cloud as the entire energy industry is being affected by this precipitous downturn, which has led to a steep decline in capital spending by exploration and production companies. 
Oil price declines have largely been driven by the exceptional strength of supply, not by the weakness of demand. In fact, demand for oil is still growing and remains quite healthy. If there is any bright spot from which to focus, it's that the lack of drilling activity today will only help speed up the recovery in the auto market tomorrow. As they say in the oil business, the best cure for low prices is low prices.
While we wait for a market rebalancing in oil prices, the reality for offshore drilling companies is stark. The drop in oil prices is causing oil companies to slash exploration and development budgets and reduce or cancel drilling contracts, decimating day rates and idling rigs. The market for rigs of all types, including new ultra-deepwater drillships, is currently and will for the immediate future be drastically oversupplied. And although Diamond Offshore's conservative financial management has allowed it to enter this downturn on solid footing, it's not immune from these challenging industry dynamics. Diamond has had to make some tough decisions regarding its own fleet, writing down 9 rigs in the fourth quarter. David Edelson will provide more details later on in the call. 
I did want to point out that the Ocean Confidence represents about 65% of the write-down. The rig is currently stacked, but we believe it will be a viable rig once the offshore drilling market comes back. And I believe that, that market will come back. It's just a question of when. 
By some estimates, offshore oil production supplies up to 30% of the world's oil, a significant percentage that cannot be replaced by conventional onshore drilling or shale production.
Despite this severe downturn, Diamond continues to work tirelessly to navigate these troubled waters, having made the difficult decision to cut its dividend. This action will bolster Diamond's already strong balance sheet and allow the company to capitalize on possible opportunities to acquire rig assets in the future at a substantial discount to shipyard prices. 
Turning to the natural gas markets and Boardwalk. Over the last few years, despite low prices, natural gas production has grown significantly. This growth was supported by 2 key dynamics. The first was the increase in oil production from shale plays. A majority of oil wells in these plays also yield significant amounts of natural gas as a byproduct of oil production. This associated gas accounted for nearly half of all the growth in gas production in the country. 
The second dynamic was the discovery and rapid development of the Marcellus Shale. Well economics in the Marcellus are -- were heavily subsidized by the production of natural gas liquids, which are sold at prices linked to oil. As a result, about a year ago, companies could break even when drilling a Marcellus well even with natural gas price below $2 per Mcf. As a result, the market was flooded with lots of cheap gas. 
Today, these 2 dynamics have changed dramatically. As oil prices have collapsed, oil production from shale plays has started to decline, with associated gas production following suit. Natural gas production growth is stalling everywhere as producers cut drilling activity in response to the steep drop in NGL and natural gas prices. 
Midstream companies have been particularly affected by the pall hanging over that E&P industry. The shale price of some of these companies has dropped by over 75% in the past 8 months as the effects of reduced drilling and weakened financials have rippled through the industry. 
Two years ago, Boardwalk made the painful but important decision to reduce its distribution, a decision that many of its competitors are making now. In retrospect, this was a wise choice as Boardwalk has been using its internally generated cash flow to fund organic growth projects and position the company for the future. 
We believe that the new projects that Boardwalk has lined up are good investments, and we're hopeful that they will provide Boardwalk with an unlevered double-digit rate of return on assets as they're completed over the next 1 to 3 years.
Although Boardwalk continues to face market headwinds, the company remains financially sound and continues to focus on future growth and capital generation for its shareholders.
CNA is a bright spot in Loews' portfolio of businesses right now, even though the numbers this quarter may obscure that light. There were lots of moving parts in CNA's fourth quarter results, most significantly, a reserve charge in its long-term care business. The silver lining of the LTC charge is that it should mitigate future losses in CNA's long-term care book of business. Despite the noise in the results, I want to stress that CNA's underlying businesses are solid and it continues to maintain its strong capital position. 
CNA's commercial lines business made steady progress with a full year combined ratio improvement of almost 8 points due to a combination of favorable loss development and underlying loss ratio improvement. CNA's specialty lines continued to perform well, although market conditions in certain areas are more challenged.
CNA's balance sheet remained stellar, ending the year with statutory capital of over $10.7 billion and GAAP shareholders' equity of almost $11.8 billion. 
As a result of its robust capital position and stable P&C earnings, CNA announced today a $2 per share special dividend, which is in addition to its regular $0.25 quarterly dividend. As a point of reference, last year, CNA also paid a $2 per share special dividend. 
And as a final note, in November of 2015, CNA announced that Dino Robusto will become its next CEO. Dino will join CNA towards the end of 2016 when Tom Motamed retires. The CNA that Dino will inherit is poised for continued improvement and further value creation. At a later date, I'll spend more time talking about Tom's many accomplishments at the company. But for now, we are looking forward to another great year at CNA with him at the helm. 
Now let's take a look at Loews' cash position. We ended the year with $4.3 billion in cash and investments, having spent $1.3 billion during the year buying back Loews' stock. In fact, we repurchased more of our own shares in 2015 than any single year since 1993. CNA's special dividend payment to Loews, when received in March, will increase our cash and investments by about $500 million. Assuming a regular dividend is paid each quarter, CNA will pay Loews dividends totaling about $730 million in 2016.
Most of our -- our most effective lever for value creation in 2015 was repurchasing our own shares. Our other 2 levers are making opportune advancements at the holding company level and investing in our subsidiaries. Over the years, each of these levers has contributed greatly to creating long-term value for our shareholders.
The foundation for all of Loews' long-term valuation -- value creation is, however, our commitment to maintaining our financial strength and stability. Our prudent capital management will ensure that the financial house we have built out of bricks can continue to withstand whatever economic huffing and puffing may come our way. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, David Edelson."
285930,321970679,928737,"Loews Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 08, 2016",2016-02-08,"Earnings Calls","Loews Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning. Loews reported a fourth quarter net loss of $201 million or $0.58 per share. Both CNA Financial and Diamond Offshore posted quarterly losses driven by unusual items.

Both CNA Financial and Diamond Offshore posted quarterly losses driven by unusual items. Excluding unusual items, which I will describe more fully, Loews' income from continuing operations declined from $264 million in Q4 2014 to $183 million in Q4 2015.
For the full year, Loews had income from continuing operations of $260 million or $0.72 per share compared to $962 million or $2.52 per share for the prior year. Unusual items and lower operating results at CNA and Diamond were the main drivers of the year-over-year decline. Excluding unusual items, our income from continuing operations declined from $1.1 billion in 2014 to $858 million in 2015.
I'll start by reviewing our fourth quarter results and then return to the full year. CNA's earnings in Q4 2015 were reduced by a reserve charge, as Jim mentioned, related to its long-term care business as well as by a change in accounting estimate adopted to better reflect the yields on fixed maturity securities that have call provisions. The long-term care reserve charge and the accounting change reduced Loews' income from continuing operations by $177 million and $22 million, respectively. Absent these 2 unusual items in 2015 and a nonrecurring pension settlement charge in 2014, CNA's fourth quarter net operating income decreased by 35% versus Q4 2014.
Several factors contributed to the fourth quarter year-over-year decline in net operating income at CNA, excluding these unusual items. Lower LP income, higher catastrophe losses, less favorable prior year development and lower non-cat accident year underwriting income, driven by higher loss ratios in specialty and international, and an expense ratio that was about 2 points above the company's run rate. Partially offsetting these negative factors was a continued marked improvement in commercial's loss ratio.
Let me take a moment to discuss the long-term care reserve charge. CNA concluded its annual LTC reserve review during the fourth quarter. When CNA applied its current best estimate actuarial assumptions to its long-term care reserves, the result was a $396 million increase in reserve estimate. Given that CNA had $100 million of margin before the review, this increase resulted in what's known as an unlocking and a $296 million pretax reserve charge at the CNA level. I would note that this is a GAAP reserve charge. The unlocking does not impact CNA's statutory surplus. 
CNA's LTC active life reserves are now based on its current best estimate assumptions. Future periodic income for long-term care will reflect any variance between actual experience and the reset assumptions contemplated in CNA's best estimate reserves. The reset assumptions should theoretically produce a breakeven underwriting result for long-term care, although there will undoubtedly be variability in CNA's future periodic results. 
Diamond Offshore's fourth quarter reflects the challenging market conditions that Jim referred to earlier. Diamond's results in Q4 2015 were dominated by a $499 million pretax asset impairment charge, which reduced Loews' income from continuing operations by $182 million. Diamond wrote down 9 rigs in the fourth quarter, 5 jack-ups, 2 mid-water floaters and 2 deepwater floaters.
Setting aside the rig impairment charges, Diamond contributed $60 million to our Q4 income from continuing operations, up 28% from the fourth quarter of 2014. While contract drilling revenues were down meaningfully, after-tax earnings benefited from expense reductions and a favorable tax rate. Diamond management is working hard to control expenses in the face of such difficult market conditions.
Boardwalk posted a strong quarter as its contribution to our income from continuing operations increased from $11 million in Q4 2014 to $19 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. Boardwalk's net operating revenues were up 10% in the quarter, and its expenses were essentially flat, resulting in a significant increase in its net income.
Several factors drove Boardwalk's revenue increase, including the Gulf South rate case, the Evangeline pipeline being back in service and growth projects coming online. 
Loews Hotels contributed a slight loss to our income from continuing operations in the fourth quarter. The company's net income was hampered by an impairment charge on a joint venture equity interest in a hotel property as well as by hotel opening expenses, higher depreciation, losses posted at certain recently acquired properties and some unusual tax items. 
Remember that for acquired properties, there is typically a transition period as the property becomes a Loews branded hotel. Loews Hotels' adjusted EBITDA, which is disclosed in our earnings snapshot, increased from $35 million in Q4 of 2014 to $38 million in Q4 2015.
Let me now turn to a brief discussion of the full year. CNA and Diamond accounted for the bulk of the year-over-year earnings decline; reduced parent company investment income also contributed to the decline. CNA contributed $433 million to our income from continuing operations in 2015, down from $802 million in 2014. Included in these results are aftertax-realized investment losses of $34 million in 2015 versus realized investment gains of $32 million in 2014.
Unusual items figured prominently in the year-over-year decline. The fourth quarter long-term care reserve charge and accounting change and the second quarter retroactive reinsurance charge combined to reduce CNA's earnings contribution by $237 million in 2015. In 2014, unusual items reduced CNA's earnings contribution by $30 million, resulting in a $207 million year-on-year negative swing.
Absent unusual items, CNA's net operating income was down 12% in 2015. Key drivers of this NOI decline were significantly lower LP income, slightly lower non-cat accident year underwriting income and higher operating losses in the Life & Group segment, caused largely by adverse morbidity in the long-term care business. Partially offsetting the decline was higher favorable net prior year development.
Diamond contributed a $156 million loss to our income from continuing operations in 2015, whereas in 2014 it contributed income of $183 million. During 2015, Diamond booked $870 million of pretax asset impairment and restructuring charges, which reduced Loews' income from continuing operations by $344 million. Additionally, earlier in 2015, Loews wrote off $20 million of goodwill associated with Diamond. 
In 2014, Diamond's asset impairments reduced Loews' after-tax income by $55 million. Absent the impairment and restructuring charges and goodwill write-off, Diamond's contribution to our income from continuing operations declined by $30 million to $208 million, reflecting the substantial decline in revenues from pure rigs operating.
Boardwalk's pipe -- Boardwalk pipeline's contribution income from continuing operations rose to $74 million in 2015 from the prior year's $18 million. While strong operating results helped, the biggest driver of the year-over-year increase was the write-off in 2014 of capitalized costs associated with the terminated project, which reduced Loews' 2014 income from continuing operations by $55 million.
Loews Hotels contributed $12 million to our 2015 income, up from $11 million in 2014. Profitability was hampered by the results at a few recently acquired hotels and hotels with operational challenges. On the other hand, numerous properties, including the properties at the Universal Orlando Resort, were up nicely versus 2014.
Adjusted EBITDA for Loews Hotels was up 29% year-over-year to $158 million. For the full year, parent company after-tax investment income was down from $63 million in 2014 to $16 million in 2015, reflecting lower performance of equities and alternatives.
As Jim mentioned at year-end, cash and investments totaled $4.3 billion as compared to $4.8 billion at end of September and $5.1 billion at the end of 2014.
Jim already mentioned our substantial share repurchases during Q4 and the full year, but let me reiterate. During the fourth quarter, we spent $632 million repurchasing 17 million shares. For the full year, we bought back 33.3 million shares for a total of $1.26 billion. This represents just under 9% of our shares outstanding at the beginning of 2015. Thus far, during 2016, we have repurchased 919,000 additional shares. 
During the fourth quarter, we received $83 million in dividends from our subsidiaries: $61 million from CNA, $9 million from Diamond and $13 million from Boardwalk. During all of 2015, we received $816 million in dividends from our subsidiaries, up from $782 million in 2014.
As Jim mentioned today, CNA declared a $2 per share special dividend, which is in addition to its regular $0.25 per share quarterly dividend. Combining the 2, Loews expects to receive $545 million in dividends from CNA this quarter. 
Let me now hand the call back to Jim."

Before we proceed to our Q&A, let me review why I'm confident about the long-term prospects of each of our businesses.
CNA has improved its underwriting performance and paid significant dividends to shareholders, while maintaining its strong capital position. Diamond is in a tough market, and although we can't predict when its market will turn around, Diamond is ready to weather the storm. It's been conserving its financial resources and maintaining its position as the strongest offshore drilling company in terms of finance, innovation and leadership. Hopefully, during these challenging times for the offshore drilling industry, Diamond will be able to add productive rig assets at attractive valuations. 
Boardwalk has made smart capital decisions that should allow it to fund its announced growth projects without having to issue equity in 2016.
And Loews Hotels continues to grow its chain steadily with an eye towards profitability.
Whether confronting headwinds or aided by tailwinds, Loews' strategic imperative remains the same: creating value for shareholders over the long term.

It would be very nice for Boardwalk to be able to increase its distribution. And by the way, Loews would be the biggest beneficiary of such an increase. But Boardwalk will not do that until such time as it has the distributable cash flow available to it and total access to markets in order that the dividend could be increased responsibly. I cannot give you a date for when that's going to happen. But even without the dividend, we believe that the management of Boardwalk is building tremendous value with these new projects that it's embarked upon."

The first quarter was my favorite type of quarter. It was relatively quiet with solid performances from each of our subsidiaries.

It was relatively quiet with solid performances from each of our subsidiaries. Just to review, CNA had significant reserve releases as well as strong operational results. However, this positive performance was distorted by a non-cash retroactive reinsurance charge relating to the company's asbestos policies. Investment losses from CNA's LP portfolio also muted while was essentially a good quarter at CNA.
Diamond Offshore continued to manage well through the cyclical downturn and benefited from revenue earned by smooth drillships that are on long-term charters. 
Boardwalk Pipeline also had a smooth first quarter. Its favorable performance is attributable, in part, to higher rates taking effect as a result of the Gulf Coast rate case and booked growth projects that have been placed in service over the last year.
Finally, Loews Hotels and Resorts also performed well. Its properties in Florida remain strong earners as did some of the new hotels added to the chain in the past few years. David Edelson, our CFO, will walk you through the results of each of our subsidiaries in more detail later in our call. 
Since it was the quarter was relatively uneventful, I thought I'd use this time to address some questions about the insurance in the oil markets that have come up in our discussions with shareholders.
Let's start with insurance. Over the last several years, there's been a significant increase in third-party capital coming into the insurance and reinsurance markets, and this capital is increasing competition for the more generic insurance and reinsurance providers. It's having less of effect on CNA's book of business, however, because of the company's extensive and well-established nationwide agency network. This network is a tremendous asset, and CNA is one of only a handful of industry players with this type of distribution channel. This web of distributed offices with local underwriters working with local agents is remarkably expensive to duplicate creating high barriers to entry for new players. The strength of CNA's network did not happen by accident. It's been built up over decades. In recent years, CNA has focused substantial time and resources on bolstering and upgrading its field operations for its commercial lines of business, and it's also increasing the origination of its specialty business through these offices. The result is that these actions have made CNA's business lines less vulnerable to competition by new players in the industry.
CNA has been concentrating on growing in core customer segments where has deep underwriting expertise while calling less profitable business lines. This combination has dramatically changed CNA's property and casualty portfolio and underwriting returns. The result is that core customer segments have grown from 71% of the portfolio in 2011 to 80% in the last 2 years. In the past several years, CNA has had relatively flat top line growth. But below the surface, the company has shed unprofitable business.
CNA has 2 major lines of PNC business: Specialty uncommercial. The company's specialty business has always had a market-leading position and has been the envy of its competitors. CNA's commercial lines of business, however, has historically lagged behind specialty. Today, the company's focus on enhancing its underwriting expertise and commercial lines has resulted in more than 10 points of improvement in the underlying loss ratio from 2010 to 2015. This portfolio today is more stable as demonstrated by the retention rate in the mid-80s.
Over the last few years, CNA's operational gains have been offset somewhat by an increasing expense ratio, which at 35% in the first quarter is too high. CNA has consciously increased investments in information technology, analytics and talent with the goal of becoming a top quartile underwriter. While these investments put pressure on margins today, we believe they will have a favorable impact on CNA's long-term profitability. Additionally, CNA has taken a number of actions to strengthen its operations, including exiting from nonperforming businesses, selling its life insurance company and actively managing its long-term care runoff business. Over the last decade, CNA has become a company with a fortress balance sheet. CNA has never been stronger with regard to its capital, its brand and its competitive position.
Now from the good to the bad and the ugly. Let's take a look at the auto market. Since I often get asked about my outlook for oil, I thought I'd beat you to the punch today. One of my favorite sayings is, ""He who lives by the crystal ball must learn to eat ground grass."" And while I'm not a fan of ground grass, I'll share with you what I am seeing and forecasting with respect to oil. 
The past few months have brought clarity to a couple of points. First, it is now abundantly clear that in the absence of OPEC intervention, U.S. shale oil is the world's swing producer. Shale production can come on quickly and relatively cheaply and is largely developed by nimble independent producers who have the incentive to quickly respond to changing prices. 
The second point that's become clear is it that U.S. shale producers are unlikely to experience any time soon the growth I enjoyed several years ago. In order to simply maintain production using internally generated cash, our guess is that the U.S. shale industry needs oil prices to be about $50 to $60 per barrel. With current prices at around $45 per barrel, U.S. production will continue to decline. 
So what does this mean for Diamond Offshore and the offshore drilling industry? Today, the world is dramatically under investing in oil exploration and production, and the effects of this underinvestment will start to be evident over the next 2 to 5 years. Oil price declines have largely been driven by the strength of supply, not the weakness of demand. In fact, demand for oil is still growing and remains quite healthy. If there's a silver lining in this, in this oil price downturn it's that the lack of drilling activity today will only help speed the recovery of the oil market tomorrow. U.S. shale drilling activity may be the first to turn on when the market rebounds, but these onshore resources only produce about 5 million barrels a day. In contrast, offshore productions plays [ph] 25 million to 35 million barrels a day or about 30% of global oil production. And when oil prices reach levels where domestic shale production increases, many offshore oil drilling projects will be economic as well. 
The million-dollar question is when will we arrive at the tipping point when the supply demand fundamentals drive oil prices higher? There's no shortage of opinion expressed on that subject, and I'm not going to throw my hat into that race. As I've said before, I'd rather predict where oil prices will be 2 years from now than 2 months from now. 
And now that I brought it up, may fearless forecast is that oil will be $65 [ph] per barrel or higher by the end of 2018. That's the price that I believe will be required for E&P companies to invest in productive capacity necessary to satisfy demand. it certainly won't happen in $45 per barrel. When you compare today's oil prices with the recent low of $27 per barrel reached in January of 2016, it looks like we could be half way to my fearless forecast.
While there are many unknowns in the relation to the oil and energy markets today, we have no doubt that the Diamond Offshore will withstand this tough cyclical downturn and hopefully use it as an opportunity for growth. Diamond has taken a number of steps to maintain a solid balance sheet, starting with reducing costs in 2015 by $100 million and scrapping and selling 6 rigs it believe will not work or again. Additionally, Diamond chose to eliminate its special and regular dividends, an action taken from a position of strength so that it can use its financial resources to invest in this depressed market when and if the opportunity arises.
Diamond is benefiting from earnings from its new drilling rigs, which are all contracted through 2019. The Diamond's strong capitalization and liquidity position, we are confident that Diamond will not only be able to weather the downturn but will emerge well positioned for the inevitable rebound.
And now to get back to the business at hand, let me turn the call over to David Edelson. David?"
285930,330928165,969397,"Loews Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 02, 2016",2016-05-02,"Earnings Calls","Loews Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning. For the first quarter, Loews reported net income of $102 million or $0.30 per share as compared to $109 million or $0.29 per share in last year's first quarter. As described in our earnings release, Boardwalk's and Diamon",1335,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning. For the first quarter, Loews reported net income of $102 million or $0.30 per share as compared to $109 million or $0.29 per share in last year's first quarter. As described in our earnings release, Boardwalk's and Diamond's contributions to our net income were up year-over-year while contributions from CNA and Loews Hotels were down. Parent company investment results were also below prior year.
Let me unpack this quarter's results to highlight for key drivers: One, strong underlying operating results at CNA and Boardwalk; two, challenge investment results at CNA and the parent company; three, a retroactive reinsurance charge at CNA relating to the company's agreement to see asbestos and environmental liabilities to national indemnity; and four, the absence of a rig impairment charge at Diamond this quarter versus a substantial charge last year.
Turning to CNA. In the first quarter, CNA contributed $60 million to our net income, which includes $17 million of realized investment losses. This compares to a net income contribution of $210 million in the first quarter of 2015. The decrease is primarily driven by 3 items: Lower net investment income; realized investment losses; and the retroactive reinsurance charge, all offset somewhat by improved operating results. CNA's limited partnership investments generated a small loss this quarter versus an almost 4% pretax return in last year's first quarter. This swing reduced CNA's year-over-year contribution to our first quarter net income by $74 million. Additionally, CNA posted realized investment losses this quarter versus realized gains last year, which reduced CNA's contribution to our first quarter net income by an additional $25 million. 
Finally, the retroactive reinsurance charge reduced CNA's contribution to our first quarter net income by $74 million. As a reminder, there was a retroactive reinsurance charge in last year's second quarter that reduced our net income by $49 million.
Let me recap the reason for this non-cash retroactive reinsurance charge. In 2010, CNA and National Indemnity, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway, completed a transaction whereby CNA ceded to National Indemnity substantially all of its legacy asbestos and environmental pollution liabilities subject to an aggregate limit of 4 billion. This reinsurance agreement is commonly referred to as a loss portfolio of transfer. Under retroactive reinsurance accounting, CNA is not permitted to recognize the benefit of the National Indemnity cover until actual cash recoveries are made by CNA. This means that when CNA increases its asbestos and environmental pollution reserves, it must book a deferred attractive reinsurance gain, which results in a GAAP income statement charge. This gain will ultimately be recognized back into CNA's earnings in the future as losses are paid by National Indemnity. Think of it as a timing difference. 
For more information, please review Page 14 of CNA's first quarter earnings presentation. Setting aside investment results and the reinsurance charge, CNA performed well in the first quarter. The company posted a property casualty combined ratio of 96.1, down from 98.9 last year. The combined ratio was helped by a solid 62.0 accident year loss ratio and 3.6 points of favorable prior year development, as business written in past years continued to develop well. On the other hand, the combined ratio is hurt by an uptick in the expense ratio as the company invest in people and systems to position itself for the future.
During the first quarter, CNA's Life & Group segment, which houses the long-term care business, produced a $2 million net operating loss compared with a $17 million loss in the first quarter of last year. This slight loss was essentially in line with expectations following the unlocking of the company's long-term care active life reserves at year-end. As discussed last quarter, these reserves are now based on management's current best estimate actuarial assumptions. The reset assumption should theoretically produce a breakeven underwriting result for long-term care, although some variability and period-to-period results is likely as quarterly results will reflect any variance between actual experience and the reset best estimate assumptions.
Turning to Diamond. Diamond's contribution to our net income increased dramatically from a loss of $126 million last year to earnings of $43 million of this year. Diamond's results last year were negatively impacted by an asset impairment charge relating to 8 rigs, which reduced our net income by $158 million. Absent this charge, Diamond's contribution to our net income was still up slightly year-over-year despite the dramatic decline in the offshore drilling market.
Let me explain. Diamond's contract drilling revenues were down 26% year-over-year, as the company experienced a 41% decline in revenue earning days. The fact that 3 of Diamond's new ultra-deepwater drillships worked during Q1 2016, but not during the prior year quarter, wasn't enough to offset the revenue decline from Deepwater, mid-water and jack-up rigs. Note that during this year's first quarter, Diamond's contract drilling revenues benefited from a onetime $40 million deep mobilization fee. Diamond management has aggressively managed operating expenses in response to the revenue declines and the change in the business environment. Contract drilling expenses were 39% lower in Q1 2016 than in the prior year. Additionally, Diamond's recent rig impairment and sales of rigs have reduced the company's ongoing depreciation expense. Diamond remains financially strong. The company is well positioned from a capital and liquidity standpoint to weather today's storms and continue as a leader in the offshore drilling space. 
On a personal note, we would like to thank Gary Clinic, Diamond's CFO, for his tremendous contributions to the company. Gary is retiring tomorrow and will be replaced by Kelly Youngblood, who is joining Diamond from Halliburton. Thank you, Gary. You will be missed, and welcome, Kelly.
Boardwalk posted a strong first quarter as net revenues were up 8%, EBITDA was up 9% and net income was up 30%. Boardwalk's contribution to our net income increased from $25 million last year to $31 million this year, driven by the strong underlying operating results. The real drivers of Boardwalk's quarter were revenue increases stemming from the Gulf South rate case, the return to service of the Evangeline ethylene pipeline and those growth projects placed into service over the last year. While earnings for the quarter were very strong, the midstream space is not without its challenges with many natural gas producers under financial pressure. As Boardwalk discussed earlier today, out of its top 50 customers, which represent approximately $1 billion of annual revenues, 6 are rated below investment grade. These customers represent approximately $170 [ph] million of annualized revenue. Importantly, these customers are not into fault, and the company does not have any material issue with its receivables. This is a situation that Boardwalk will continue to monitor and manage. 
At Loews Hotels & Resorts, pretax income was essentially flat with prior year, as underlying strength continued to be masked by the impact of new properties entering the chain and ramping up. Adjusted EBITDA increased by $8 million or 23% to $43 million.
Turning to the parent company. In the first quarter, the parent company investment portfolio generated an after-tax loss of $8 million compared with income of $19 million in the prior year quarter. This loss reflects lower performance of alternatives and equities, offset somewhat by the gold equities that we hold to the hedge. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $4.9 billion and parent company debt of $1.8 billion. During the quarter, we received $558 million in dividends from our subsidiaries; $545 million from CNA, which included its $2 per share special dividend; and $13 million from Boardwalk. 
In March, we issued 500 million of 10-year notes and retired 400 million of maturing notes. Our next debt maturity is not until 2023. Our share repurchase activity was muted during the quarter. We spent $33 million repurchasing just over 900,000 Loews' shares. Additionally, we spent $8 million purchasing 267,000 shares of CNA. Average shares outstanding were 339 million in the first quarter, down 9% from 373 million in Q1 2015. 
Let me now hand the call back to Jim."

Importantly, in each of our businesses, we have the leadership horse power needed to fuel this value creation. All of our CEOs are long-term veterans of their industries with the vision, experience and expertise necessary to position each company for future growth and development. At CNA, Tom [ph] has oversoon the company's dramatic move towards achieving its goal of becoming a top quartile underwriter, and the company has, since 2013, paid out to shareholders more than $2 billion in dividends. At Diamond Offshore, Mark Edwards is leading the charge with grace under extreme pressure. He's revolutionizing the offshore drilling industry with pressure control by the hour and other innovations, which are differentiating Diamond from the competition and cementing close relationships with Diamond's customers along the way.
Dan Horton at Boardwalk is one of the best strategic thinkers in the natural gas pipeline space. He has a vision being developed a full slate of very attractive investment opportunities, which will be coming online in the next few years and will form the foundation for growth. 
And finally, at Loews Hotels, Kirk Kinsell is continuing to build on the growth of our hotel business, increasing EBITDA and profitability while creating long-term value. Kirk has been focused on expanding the company's brand equity, tracking and retaining the best talent and most importantly, creating a wonderful experience for our guests.

It was relatively quiet, with solid performances from each of our subsidiaries. Just to review, CNA had significant reserve releases as well as strong operational results. However, this positive performance was distorted by a non-cash retroactive reinsurance charge relating to the company's asbestos policies. Investment losses from CNA's LP portfolio also muted while it was essentially a good quarter at CNA.
Diamond Offshore continued to manage well through the cyclical downturn, and benefited from revenue earned by its new drillships that are on long-term charters. 
Boardwalk Pipelines also had a smooth first quarter. Its favorable performance is attributable, in part, to higher rates taking effect as a result of the  Gulf South rate case and booked growth projects that've been placed in service over the last year.
Finally, Loews Hotels and Resorts also performed well. Its properties in Florida remained strong earners, as did some of the new hotels added to the chain in the past few years. David Edelson, our CFO, will walk you through the results of each of our subsidiaries in more detail later in our call. 
Since it the quarter was relatively uneventful, I thought I'd use this time to address some questions about the insurance in the oil markets that have come up in our discussions with shareholders.
Let's start with insurance. Over the last several years, there's been a significant increase in third-party capital coming into the insurance and the reinsurance markets, and this capital is increasing competition for the more generic insurance and reinsurance providers. It's having less of effect on CNA's book of business, however, because of the company's extensive and well-established nationwide agency network. This network is a tremendous asset, and CNA is one of only a handful of industry players with this type of distribution channel. This web of distributed offices with the local underwriters working with local agents is remarkably expensive to duplicate, creating high barriers to entry for new players. The strength of CNA's network did not happen by accident, it's been built up over decades. In recent years, CNA has focused substantial time and resources on bolstering and upgrading its field operations for its commercial lines business, and sees also increasing the origination of its specialty business through these offices. The result is that, these actions have made CNA's business lines less vulnerable to competition by new players in the industry.
CNA has been concentrating on growing in core customer segments, where it has deep underwriting expertise while culling less profitable business lines. This combination has dramatically changed CNA's property and casualty portfolio, and the underwriting returns. The result is that core customer segments have grown from 71% of the portfolio in 2011 to 80% in the last 2 years. In the past several years, CNA has had relatively flat top line growth. But below the surface, the company has shed unprofitable business.
CNA has 2 major lines of PNC business: Specialty and Commercial. The company's specialty business has always had a market-leading position, and has been the envy of its competitors. CNA's commercial lines business, however, has historically lagged behind specialty. Today, the company's focus on enhancing its underwriting expertise in commercial lines has resulted in more than 10 points of improvement in the underlying loss ratio from 2010 to 2015. This portfolio today is more stable, as demonstrated by the retention rate in the mid-80s.
Over the last few years, CNA's operational gains have been offset somewhat by an increasing expense ratio, which at 35% in the first quarter is too high. CNA has consciously increased investments in information technology, analytics and talent with the goal of becoming a top quartile underwriter. While these investments put pressure on margins today, we believe they will have a favorable impact on CNA's long-term profitability. Additionally, CNA has taken a number of actions to strengthen its operations, including exiting from nonperforming businesses, selling its life insurance company, and actively managing its long-term care runoff business. Over the last decade, CNA has become a company with a fortress balance sheet. CNA has never been stronger with regard to its capital, its brand and its competitive position.
Now from the good to the bad and the ugly. Let's take a look at the auto market. Since I often get asked about my outlook for oil, I thought I'd beat you to the punch today. One of my favorite sayings is, ""He who lives by the crystal ball must learn to eat ground grass."" And while I'm not a fan of ground grass, I'll share with you what I am seeing and forecasting, with respect to oil. 
The past few months have brought clarity to a couple of points. First, it is now abundantly clear that in the absence of OPEC intervention, U.S. shale oil is the world's swing producer. Shale production can come on quickly and relatively cheaply, and is largely developed by nimble independent producers who have the incentive to quickly respond to changing prices. 
The second point that's become clear, is that U.S. shale producers are unlikely to experience, anytime soon, the growth they enjoyed several years ago. In order to simply maintain production using internally generated cash, our guess is that the U.S. shale industry needs oil prices to be about $50 to $60 per barrel. With current prices at around $45 per barrel, U.S. production will continue to decline. 
So what does this mean for Diamond Offshore and the offshore drilling industry? Today, the world is dramatically under investing in oil exploration and production, and the effects of this underinvestment will start to be evident over the next 2 to 5 years. Oil price declines have largely been driven by the strength of supply, not the weakness of demand. In fact, demand for oil is still growing and remains quite healthy. If there's a silver lining in this -- in this oil price downturn, it's that the lack of drilling activity today will only help speed the recovery of the oil market tomorrow. U.S. shale drilling activity may be the first to turn on when the market rebounds, but these onshore resources only produce about 5 million barrels a day. In contrast, offshore productions supplies 25 million to 30 million barrels a day, or about 30% of global oil production. And when oil prices reach the levels where domestic shale production increases, many offshore oil drilling projects will be economic as well. 
The million-dollar question is, when will we arrive at the tipping point when the supply demand fundamentals drive oil prices higher? There's no shortage of opinions expressed on that subject, and I'm not going to throw my hat into that race. As I've said before, I'd rather predict where oil prices will be 2 years from now, than 2 months from now. 
And now that I've brought it up, my fearless forecast is that oil will be $65 per barrel or higher by the end of 2018. That's the price that I believe will be required for E&P companies to invest in productive capacity necessary to satisfy demand. It certainly won't happen at $45 per barrel. When you compare today's oil prices with the recent low of $27 per barrel reached in January of 2016, it looks like we could be half way to my fearless forecast.
While there are many unknowns in the relation to the oil and energy markets today, we have no doubt that Diamond Offshore will withstand this tough cyclical downturn, and hopefully use it as an opportunity for growth. Diamond has taken a number of steps to maintain its solid balance sheet, starting with reducing costs in 2015 by $100 million, and scrapping or selling 6 rigs it believed would not work again. Additionally, Diamond chose to eliminate its special and regular dividends, an action taken from a position of strength so that it could use its financial resources to invest in this depressed market when and if the opportunity arises.
Diamond is benefiting from earnings from its new drilling rigs, which are all contracted through 2019. With Diamond's strong capitalization and liquidity position, we are confident that Diamond will not only be able to weather the downturn but will emerge well positioned for the inevitable rebound.
And now to get back to the business at hand, let me turn the call over to David Edelson. David?"
285930,330928165,969497,"Loews Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 02, 2016",2016-05-02,"Earnings Calls","Loews Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning. For the first quarter, Loews reported net income of $102 million or $0.30 per share as compared to $109 million or $0.29 per share in last year's first quarter. As described in our earnings release, Boardwalk's and Diamon",1334,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning. For the first quarter, Loews reported net income of $102 million or $0.30 per share as compared to $109 million or $0.29 per share in last year's first quarter. As described in our earnings release, Boardwalk's and Diamond's contributions to our net income were up year-over-year while contributions from CNA and Loews Hotels were down. Parent company investment results were also below prior year.
Let me unpack this quarter's results to highlight 4 key drivers: one, strong underlying operating results at CNA and Boardwalk; two, challenged investment results at CNA and the parent company; three, a retroactive reinsurance charge at CNA relating to the company's agreement to see its asbestos and environmental liabilities to national indemnity; and four, the absence of a rig impairment charge at Diamond this quarter versus a substantial charge last year.
Turning to CNA. In the first quarter, CNA contributed $60 million to our net income, which includes $17 million of realized investment losses. This compares to a net income contribution of $210 million in the first quarter of 2015. The decrease is primarily driven by 3 items: lower net investment income; realized investment losses; and the retroactive reinsurance charge, all offset somewhat by improved operating results. CNA's limited partnership investments generated a small loss this quarter versus an almost 4% pretax return in last year's first quarter. This swing reduced CNA's year-over-year contribution to our first quarter net income by $74 million. Additionally, CNA posted realized investment losses this quarter versus realized gains last year, which reduced CNA's contribution to our first quarter net income by an additional $25 million. 
Finally, the retroactive reinsurance charge reduced CNA's contribution to our first quarter net income by $74 million. As a reminder, there was a retroactive reinsurance charge in last year's second quarter that reduced our net income by $49 million.
Let me recap the reason for this non-cash retroactive reinsurance charge. In 2010, CNA and National Indemnity, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway, completed a transaction whereby CNA ceded to National Indemnity, substantially all of its legacy asbestos and environmental pollution liabilities, subject to an aggregate limit of 4 billion. This reinsurance agreement is commonly referred to as a loss portfolio transfer. Under retroactive reinsurance accounting, CNA is not permitted to recognize the benefit of the National Indemnity cover until actual cash recoveries are made by CNA. This means that when CNA increases its asbestos and environmental pollution reserves, it must book a deferred retroactive reinsurance gain, which results in a GAAP income statement charge. This gain will ultimately be recognized back into CNA's earnings in the future, as losses are paid by National Indemnity. Think of it as a timing difference. 
For more information, please review Page 14 of CNA's first quarter earnings presentation. Setting aside investment results and the reinsurance charge, CNA performed well in the first quarter. The company posted a property casualty combined ratio of 96.1, down from 98.9 last year. The combined ratio was helped by a solid 62.0 accident year loss ratio and 3.6 points of favorable prior year development, as business written in past years continues to develop well. On the other hand, the combined ratio is hurt by an uptick in the expense ratio, as the company invested in people and systems to position itself for the future.
During the first quarter, CNA's Life & Group segment, which houses the long-term care business, produced a $2 million net operating loss, compared with a $17 million loss in the first quarter of last year. This slight loss was essentially in line with expectations, following the unlocking of the company's long-term care active life reserves at year-end. As discussed last quarter, these reserves are now based on management's current best estimate actuarial assumptions. The reset assumption should theoretically produce a breakeven underwriting result for long-term care, although some variability in period-to-period results is likely, as quarterly results will reflect any variance between actual experience and the reset best estimate assumptions.
Turning to Diamond. Diamond's contribution to our net income increased dramatically, from a loss of $126 million last year to earnings of $43 million of this year. Diamond's results last year were negatively impacted by an asset impairment charge relating to 8 rigs, which reduced our net income by $158 million. Absent this charge, Diamond's contribution to our net income was still up slightly year-over-year, despite the dramatic decline in the offshore drilling market.
Let me explain. Diamond's contract drilling revenues were down 26% year-over-year as the company experienced a 41% decline in revenue earning days. The fact that 3 of Diamond's new ultra-deepwater drillships worked during Q1 2016, but not during the prior year quarter, wasn't enough to offset the revenue decline from Deepwater, mid-water and jack-up rigs. Note that during this year's first quarter, Diamond's contract drilling revenues benefited from a onetime $40 million deep mobilization fee. Diamond's management has aggressively managed operating expenses in response to the revenue declines and the change in the business environment. Contract drilling expenses were 39% lower in Q1 2016 than in the prior year. Additionally, Diamond's recent rig impairments and sales of rigs have reduced the company's ongoing depreciation expense. Diamond remains financially strong. The company is well positioned from a capital and liquidity standpoint to weather today's storms and continue as a leader in the offshore drilling space. 
On a personal note, we would like to thank Gary Krenek, Diamond's CFO, for his tremendous contributions to the company. Gary is retiring tomorrow, and will be replaced by Kelly Youngblood, who is joining Diamond from Halliburton. Thank you, Gary, you will be missed, and welcome, Kelly.
Boardwalk posted a strong first quarter, as net revenues were up 8%, EBITDA was up 9% and net income was up 30%. Boardwalk's contribution to our net income increased from $25 million last year to $31 million this year, driven by the strong underlying operating results. The real drivers of Boardwalk's quarter were revenue increases stemming from the Gulf South rate case, the return to service of the Evangeline ethylene pipeline and those growth projects placed into service over the last year. While earnings for the quarter were very strong, the midstream space is not without its challenges, with many natural gas producers under financial pressure. As Boardwalk discussed earlier today, out of its top 50 customers, which represent approximately $1 billion of annual revenues, 6 are rated below investment grade. These customers represent approximately $170 million of annualized revenue. Importantly, these customers are not in default, and the company does not have any material issue with its receivables. This is a situation that Boardwalk will continue to monitor and manage. 
At Loews Hotels & Resorts, pretax income was essentially flat with prior year, as underlying strength continued to be masked by the impact of new properties entering the chain and ramping up. Adjusted EBITDA increased by $8 million or 23% to $43 million.
Turning to the parent company. In the first quarter, the parent company investment portfolio generated an after-tax loss of $8 million, compared with income of $19 million in the prior year quarter. This loss reflects lower performance of alternatives and equities, offset somewhat by the gold equities that we hold to the hedge. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $4.9 billion and parent company debt of $1.8 billion. During the quarter, we received $558 million in dividends from our subsidiaries; $545 million from CNA, which included its $2 per share special dividend; and $13 million from Boardwalk. 
In March, we issued 500 million of 10-year notes and retired 400 million of maturing notes. Our next debt maturity is not until 2023. Our share repurchase activity was muted during the quarter. We spent $33 million repurchasing just over 900,000 Loews' shares. Additionally, we spent $8 million purchasing 267,000 shares of CNA. Average shares outstanding were 339 million in the first quarter, down 9% from 373 million in Q1 2015. 
Let me now hand the call back to Jim."

It's a goal that has defined us for more than half a century, and it continues to define us today. Importantly, in each of our businesses, we have the leadership horsepower needed to fuel this value creation. All of our CEOs are long-term veterans of their industries, with the vision, experience and expertise necessary to position each company for future growth and development. At CNA, Tom Motamed has overseen the company's dramatic move towards achieving its goal of becoming a top quartile underwriter, and the company has, since 2013, paid out to shareholders more than $2 billion in dividends. At Diamond Offshore, Mark Edwards is leading the charge with grace under extreme pressure. He's revolutionizing the offshore drilling industry with pressure control by the hour and other innovations, which are differentiating Diamond from the competition and cementing close relationships with Diamond's customers along the way.
Dan Horton at Boardwalk is one of the best strategic thinkers in the natural gas pipeline space. He has envisioned being developed a full slate of very attractive investment opportunities, which will be coming online in the next few years, and will form the foundation for growth. 
And finally, at Loews Hotels, Kirk Kinsell is continuing to build on the growth of our hotel business, increasing EBITDA and profitability while creating long-term value. Kirk has been focused on expanding the company's brand equity, attracting and retaining the best talent, and most importantly, creating a wonderful experience for our guests.

While Warren Buffett complained about the fees, instead, we're looking at the returns.

It was relatively quiet, with solid performances from each of our subsidiaries. Just to review, CNA had significant reserve releases as well as strong operational results. However, this positive performance was distorted by a non-cash retroactive reinsurance charge relating to the company's asbestos policies. Investment losses from CNA's LP portfolio also muted what was essentially a good quarter at CNA.
Diamond Offshore continued to manage well through the cyclical downturn, and benefited from revenue earned by its new drillships that are on long-term charters. 
Boardwalk Pipelines also had a smooth first quarter. Its favorable performance is attributable, in part, to higher rates taking effect as a result of the  Gulf South rate case and booked growth projects that  have been placed in service over the last year.
Finally, Loews Hotels and Resorts also performed well. Its properties in Florida remained strong earners, as did some of the new hotels added to the chain in the past few years. David Edelson, our CFO, will walk you through the results of each of our subsidiaries in more detail later in our call. 
Since the quarter was relatively uneventful, I thought I'd use this time to address some questions about the insurance in the oil markets that have come up in our discussions with shareholders.
Let's start with insurance. Over the last several years, there's been a significant increase in third-party capital coming into the insurance and the reinsurance markets, and this capital is increasing competition for the more generic insurance and reinsurance providers. It's having less of effect on CNA's book of business, however, because of the company's extensive and well-established nationwide agency network. This network is a tremendous asset, and CNA is one of only a handful of industry players with this type of distribution channel. This web of distributed offices with the local underwriters working with local agents is remarkably expensive to duplicate, creating high barriers to entry for new players. The strength of CNA's network did not happen by accident, it's been built up over decades. In recent years, CNA has focused substantial time and resources on bolstering and upgrading its field operations for its commercial lines business, and C [ph] is also increasing the origination of its specialty business through these offices. The result is that, these actions have made CNA's business lines less vulnerable to competition by new players in the industry.
CNA has been concentrating on growing in core customer segments, where it has deep underwriting expertise while culling less profitable business lines. This combination has dramatically changed CNA's property and casualty portfolio, and the underwriting returns. The result is that core customer segments have grown from 71% of the portfolio in 2011 to 80% in the last 2 years. In the past several years, CNA has had relatively flat top line growth. But below the surface, the company has shed unprofitable business.
CNA has 2 major lines of PNC business: Specialty and Commercial. The company's specialty business has always had a market-leading position, and has been the envy of its competitors. CNA's commercial lines business, however, has historically lagged behind specialty. Today, the company's focus on enhancing its underwriting expertise in commercial lines has resulted in more than 10 points of improvement in the underlying loss ratio from 2010 to 2015. This portfolio today is more stable, as demonstrated by the retention rate in the mid-80s.
Over the last few years, CNA's operational gains have been offset somewhat by an increasing expense ratio, which at 35% in the first quarter is too high. CNA has consciously increased investments in information technology, analytics and talent with the goal of becoming a top quartile underwriter. While these investments put pressure on margins today, we believe they will have a favorable impact on CNA's long-term profitability. Additionally, CNA has taken a number of actions to strengthen its operations, including exiting from nonperforming businesses, selling its life insurance company, and actively managing its long-term care runoff business. Over the last decade, CNA has become a company with a fortress balance sheet. CNA has never been stronger with regard to its capital, its brand and its competitive position.
Now from the good to the bad and the ugly. Let's take a look at the auto market. Since I often get asked about my outlook for oil, I thought I'd beat you to the punch today. One of my favorite sayings is, ""He who lives by the crystal ball must learn to eat ground grass."" And while I'm not a fan of ground grass, I'll share with you what I am seeing and forecasting, with respect to oil. 
The past few months have brought clarity to a couple of points. First, it is now abundantly clear that in the absence of OPEC intervention, U.S. shale oil is the world's swing producer. Shale production can come on quickly and relatively cheaply, and is largely developed by nimble independent producers who have the incentive to quickly respond to changing prices. 
The second point that's become clear, is that U.S. shale producers are unlikely to experience, anytime soon, the growth they enjoyed several years ago. In order to simply maintain production using internally generated cash, our guess is that the U.S. shale industry needs oil prices to be about $50 to $60 per barrel. With current prices at around $45 per barrel, U.S. production will continue to decline. 
So what does this mean for Diamond Offshore and the offshore drilling industry? Today, the world is dramatically under investing in oil exploration and production, and the effects of this underinvestment will start to be evident over the next 2 to 5 years. Oil price declines have largely been driven by the strength of supply, not the weakness of demand. In fact, demand for oil is still growing and remains quite healthy. If there's a silver lining in this -- in this oil price downturn, it's that the lack of drilling activity today will only help speed the recovery of the oil market tomorrow. U.S. shale drilling activity may be the first to turn on when the market rebounds, but these onshore resources only produce about 5 million barrels a day. In contrast, offshore productions supplies 25 million to 30 million barrels a day, or about 30% of global oil production. And when oil prices reach the levels where domestic shale production increases, many offshore oil drilling projects will be economic as well. 
The million-dollar question is, when will we arrive at the tipping point when the supply demand fundamentals drive oil prices higher? There's no shortage of opinions expressed on that subject, and I'm not going to throw my hat into that race. As I've said before, I'd rather predict where oil prices will be 2 years from now, than 2 months from now. 
And now that I've brought it up, my fearless forecast is that oil will be $65 per barrel or higher by the end of 2018. That's the price that I believe will be required for E&P companies to invest in productive capacity necessary to satisfy demand. It certainly won't happen at $45 per barrel. When you compare today's oil prices with the recent low of $27 per barrel reached in January of 2016, it looks like we could be half way to my fearless forecast.
While there are many unknowns in the relation to the oil and energy markets today, we have no doubt that Diamond Offshore will withstand this tough cyclical downturn, and hopefully use it as an opportunity for growth. Diamond has taken a number of steps to maintain its solid balance sheet, starting with reducing costs in 2015 by $100 million, and scrapping or selling 6 rigs it believed would not work again. Additionally, Diamond chose to eliminate its special and regular dividends, an action taken from a position of strength so that it could use its financial resources to invest in this depressed market when and if the opportunity arises.
Diamond is benefiting from earnings from its new drilling rigs, which are all contracted through 2019. With Diamond's strong capitalization and liquidity position, we are confident that Diamond will not only be able to weather the downturn but will emerge well positioned for the inevitable rebound.
And now to get back to the business at hand, let me turn the call over to David Edelson. David?"
285930,330928165,969582,"Loews Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 02, 2016",2016-05-02,"Earnings Calls","Loews Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning. For the first quarter, Loews reported net income of $102 million or $0.30 per share as compared to $109 million or $0.29 per share in last year's first quarter. As described in our earnings release, Boardwalk's and Diamon",1333,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning. For the first quarter, Loews reported net income of $102 million or $0.30 per share as compared to $109 million or $0.29 per share in last year's first quarter. As described in our earnings release, Boardwalk's and Diamond's contributions to our net income were up year-over-year while contributions from CNA and Loews Hotels were down. Parent company investment results were also below prior year.
Let me unpack this quarter's results to highlight 4 key drivers: one, strong underlying operating results at CNA and Boardwalk; two, challenged investment results at CNA and the parent company; three, a retroactive reinsurance charge at CNA relating to the company's agreement to cede asbestos and environmental liabilities to national indemnity; and four, the absence of a rig impairment charge at Diamond this quarter versus a substantial charge last year.
Turning to CNA. In the first quarter, CNA contributed $60 million to our net income, which includes $17 million of realized investment losses. This compares to a net income contribution of $210 million in the first quarter of 2015. The decrease is primarily driven by 3 items: lower net investment income; realized investment losses; and the retroactive reinsurance charge, all offset somewhat by improved operating results. CNA's limited partnership investments generated a small loss this quarter versus an almost 4% pretax return in last year's first quarter. This swing reduced CNA's year-over-year contribution to our first quarter net income by $74 million. Additionally, CNA posted realized investment losses this quarter versus realized gains last year, which reduced CNA's contribution to our first quarter net income by an additional $25 million. 
Finally, the retroactive reinsurance charge reduced CNA's contribution to our first quarter net income by $74 million. As a reminder, there was a retroactive reinsurance charge in last year's second quarter that reduced our net income by $49 million.
Let me recap the reason for this non-cash retroactive reinsurance charge. In 2010, CNA and National Indemnity, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway, completed a transaction whereby CNA ceded to National Indemnity, substantially all of its legacy asbestos and environmental pollution liabilities, subject to an aggregate limit of 4 billion. This reinsurance agreement is commonly referred to as a loss portfolio transfer. Under retroactive reinsurance accounting, CNA is not permitted to recognize the benefit of the National Indemnity cover until actual cash recoveries are made by CNA. This means that when CNA increases its asbestos and environmental pollution reserves, it must book a deferred retroactive reinsurance gain, which results in a GAAP income statement charge. This gain will ultimately be recognized back into CNA's earnings in the future, as losses are paid by National Indemnity. Think of it as a timing difference. 
For more information, please review Page 14 of CNA's first quarter earnings presentation. Setting aside investment results and the reinsurance charge, CNA performed well in the first quarter. The company posted a property casualty combined ratio of 96.1, down from 98.9 last year. The combined ratio was helped by a solid 62.0 accident year loss ratio and 3.6 points of favorable prior year development, as business written in past years continues to develop well. On the other hand, the combined ratio is hurt by an uptick in the expense ratio, as the company invested in people and systems to position itself for the future.
During the first quarter, CNA's Life & Group segment, which houses the long-term care business, produced a $2 million net operating loss, compared with a $17 million loss in the first quarter of last year. This slight loss was essentially in line with expectations, following the unlocking of the company's long-term care active life reserves at year-end. As discussed last quarter, these reserves are now based on management's current best estimate actuarial assumptions. The reset assumption should theoretically produce a breakeven underwriting result for long-term care, although some variability in period-to-period results is likely, as quarterly results will reflect any variance between actual experience and the reset best estimate assumptions.
Turning to Diamond. Diamond's contribution to our net income increased dramatically, from a loss of $126 million last year to earnings of $43 million of this year. Diamond's results last year were negatively impacted by an asset impairment charge relating to 8 rigs, which reduced our net income by $158 million. Absent this charge, Diamond's contribution to our net income was still up slightly year-over-year, despite the dramatic decline in the offshore drilling market.
Let me explain. Diamond's contract drilling revenues were down 26% year-over-year as the company experienced a 41% decline in revenue earning days. The fact that 3 of Diamond's new ultra-deepwater drillships worked during Q1 2016, but not during the prior year quarter, wasn't enough to offset the revenue decline from Deepwater, mid-water and jack-up rigs. Note that during this year's first quarter, Diamond's contract drilling revenues benefited from a onetime $40 million deep mobilization fee. Diamond's management has aggressively managed operating expenses in response to the revenue declines and the change in the business environment. Contract drilling expenses were 39% lower in Q1 2016 than in the prior year. Additionally, Diamond's recent rig impairments and sales of rigs have reduced the company's ongoing depreciation expense. Diamond remains financially strong. The company is well positioned from a capital and liquidity standpoint to weather today's storms and continue as a leader in the offshore drilling space. 
On a personal note, we would like to thank Gary Krenek, Diamond's CFO, for his tremendous contributions to the company. Gary is retiring tomorrow, and will be replaced by Kelly Youngblood, who is joining Diamond from Halliburton. Thank you, Gary, you will be missed, and welcome, Kelly.
Boardwalk posted a strong first quarter, as net revenues were up 8%, EBITDA was up 9% and net income was up 30%. Boardwalk's contribution to our net income increased from $25 million last year to $31 million this year, driven by the strong underlying operating results. The real drivers of Boardwalk's quarter were revenue increases stemming from the Gulf South rate case, the return to service of the Evangeline ethylene pipeline and those growth projects placed into service over the last year. While earnings for the quarter were very strong, the midstream space is not without its challenges, with many natural gas producers under financial pressure. As Boardwalk discussed earlier today, out of its top 50 customers, which represent approximately $1 billion of annual revenues, 6 are rated below investment grade. These customers represent approximately $170 million of annualized revenue. Importantly, these customers are not in default, and the company does not have any material issue with its receivables. This is a situation that Boardwalk will continue to monitor and manage. 
At Loews Hotels & Resorts, pretax income was essentially flat with prior year, as underlying strength continued to be masked by the impact of new properties entering the chain and ramping up. Adjusted EBITDA increased by $8 million or 23% to $43 million.
Turning to the parent company. In the first quarter, the parent company investment portfolio generated an after-tax loss of $8 million, compared with income of $19 million in the prior year quarter. This loss reflects lower performance of alternatives and equities, offset somewhat by the gold equities that we hold to the hedge. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $4.9 billion and parent company debt of $1.8 billion. During the quarter, we received $558 million in dividends from our subsidiaries; $545 million from CNA, which included its $2 per share special dividend; and $13 million from Boardwalk. 
In March, we issued 500 million of 10-year notes and retired 400 million of maturing notes. Our next debt maturity is not until 2023. Our share repurchase activity was muted during the quarter. We spent $33 million repurchasing just over 900,000 Loews' shares. Additionally, we spent $8 million purchasing 267,000 shares of CNA. Average shares outstanding were 339 million in the first quarter, down 9% from 373 million in Q1 2015. 
Let me now hand the call back to Jim."

Loews reported a net loss of $65 million or $0.19 per share in Q2 2016, as opposed to net income of $170 million or $0.46 per share in last year's second quarter. Year-to-date, we have generated net income of $37 million",1504,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning. Loews reported a net loss of $65 million or $0.19 per share in Q2 2016, as opposed to net income of $170 million or $0.46 per share in last year's second quarter. Year-to-date, we have generated net income of $37 million or $0.11 per share. 
Our second quarter earnings were dominated by asset impairments at Diamond Offshore, which overwhelmed favorable results posted by CNA Financial and Boardwalk Pipeline, as well as good returns generated by our parent company investment portfolio. 
The impairments at Diamond, which totaled $678 million pretax on its books, reduced our net income by $267 million. Before I drill into Diamond's results, let me summarize the year-over-year quarterly net income contribution by each of our subsidiaries and by the parent company investment portfolio.
Two of our subsidiaries, CNA and Boardwalk, posted significant increases in net income contribution over the prior year. CNA contributed $189 million, including realized gains, up 52% from last year. And Boardwalk's contribution rose from $12 million last year to $17 million this year. In addition, the parent company investment portfolio generated $56 million of after-tax income this year, a big swing from last quarter's $8 million loss and a $7 million gain in Q2 2015. 
Our remaining 2 subsidiaries, Diamond and Loews Hotels, posted year-over-year declines in each case driven by unusual items. Diamond contributed a $290 million net loss in Q2 2016 versus net income of $45 million last year. And Loews Hotels essentially broke even in this quarter, down from net income of $8 million in the prior year. Loews Hotels results this quarter were significantly affected by the write-down of an equity investment in a joint venture hotel property. But clearly, Diamond drove our disappointing second quarter results, so let me start by explaining Diamond's second quarter.
The offshore drilling market continues to be extremely challenged with limited new drilling opportunities and an oversupply of rigs. In addition, customers are choosing not to extend current contracts and, in some cases, seeking ways to early terminate existing contracts. Diamond assessed its rig fleet for impairment at the end of the quarter. And in light of the difficult market environment and Diamond management's evolving view of the lengthened severity of the downturn, 8 rigs have been written down to substantially lower net book values. These rigs are a mix of third, fourth and fifth generation semi-submersibles. 4 of the 8 rigs being impaired or stacked, 2 are still on contract and 2 are being scrapped. 
There are 4 key drivers of the write-downs on the 6 rigs not being scrapped. Number one, longer elapsed time until the rates are projected to return to work. Number two , higher costs to reactivate the stacked rigs and ready them to return to work. Number three, lower expected future day rates once the rakes return to work. And finally, lower assumed utilization once of the rigs return to work.
Absent its asset impairments, Diamond's operating income was relatively weak during the quarter. The combination of fewer rigs on contract and an unexpectedly high amount of unscheduled downtime on its new build drillships led to a 42% decline in contract drilling revenues versus the second quarter of 2015. Diamond's net income in Q2 was further reduced by a valuation allowance for current and prior year tax assets associated with foreign tax credits, as Diamond no longer expects to be able to utilize these tax credits to offset income taxes in the U.S.
Jim will provide further talks on Diamond's prospects shortly. I would just emphasize that Diamond remains financially strong and is well-positioned from a capital and liquidity standpoint to weather today's storms, continue as a leader in the offshore drilling space and seek to turn adversity into opportunity.
Turning to CNA. In the second quarter, CNA contributed $189 million to our net income, which includes $6 million of realized investment gains. This compares to a net income contribution of $124 million in the second quarter of 2015. This substantial increase was primarily driven by 3 items. 
Number one, higher favorable prior development this year emanating from all 3 P&C businesses: Specialty, commercial and international. Number two, the absence in this year's second quarter of a retroactive reinsurance charge associated with a loss portfolio transfer of CNA's expenses and environmental liabilities with national indemnity. And three, improved results in the Life & Group segment reflective of the Q4 2015 reserve unlocking that reset the underlying actuarial assumption on the long-term care reserves. 
CNA's core P&C business posted net operating income for the quarter down slightly from the prior year despite a solid 1 point improvement in the calendar year combined ratio. From an underwriting standpoint, the impact of higher favorable prior development was offset by an increase in CNA international's accident year combined ratio. This increase was driven by higher catastrophe losses, as well as lower accident year noncat underwriting profit, attributable mostly to large loss activity. 
Additionally, P&C's net operating income during Q2 2016 was negatively affected by currency exchange rates. Last year, our attractive reinsurance charge reduced CNA's contribution to our second quarter net income by $49 million. There was no such charge in this year's second quarter, as CNA completed its asbestos environmental reserve reviews this year in the first quarter.
During the second quarter, CNA's Life & Group segment, which houses the long-term care business, produced a $4 million net operating loss compared with a $24 million operating loss in the second quarter of last year. This slight loss was essentially in line with expectations following the unlocking of the company's long-term care active life reserves at year-end 2015.
As a reminder, the financial results for CNA's long-term care business reflect the variance between actual experience and management's best estimate actuarial assumptions. On a year-to-date basis, the Life & Group segment has posted a $6 million net operating loss versus a loss of $41 million in the first half of 2015.
Onto Boardwalk. Boardwalk posted a strong second quarter as net revenues were up 8% year-over-year just as they were in Q1. EBITDA was up 14% and net income was up 63%. Boardwalk's contribution to our net income increased from $12 million last year to $17 million this year, driven by the strong underlying operating results. 
A reconciliation of Boardwalk's EBITDA to its net income can be found in this Q2 earnings release. The main drivers of Boardwalk's strong revenue quarter were the return to service of the Evangeline ethylene pipeline in mid-2015, recently completed growth projects placed into service over the last year and improved revenues from parking and lending and storage. This year's second quarter revenues were favorably impacted by a $13 million legal settlement, whereas last year's second quarter benefited from the receipt of $6 million of business interruption insurance proceeds.
I wanted to highlight 2 developments with respect to Boardwalk's funding profile. First, Loews agreed to extend the barring period under our $300 million subordinate loan agreement by 2 years, from December 2016 to December 2018. All other times remain the same. Boardwalk is yet to utilize this facility. And second, Boardwalk exercises -- exercise a 1-year extension option on its credit facility, extending the maturity date from May 2020 to May 2021. All but 1 bank participate in the extension resulting in $1.475 billion being extended to May 2021. Currently, Boardwalk is not drawn on its credit facility.
Now for a quick review of Loews Hotels, which contributed pretax income of $4 million, down from $14 million in the second quarter of 2015. The company's operational strides were masked by the write-down of an equity investment in one of its joint venture hotel properties. 
Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes this write-down, increased over the prior quarter. A reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income can be found in the Loews' quarterly snapshot at loews.com. Please note that we expect the hotel company's second half results to be somewhat muted by recently commenced renovations at the Loews Miami Beach Hotel. Let me turn to the parent company.
In the second quarter, the parent company investment portfolio generated after-tax income of $56 million compared with income of $7 million in the prior year quarter. Equities, including gold-related equity investments, accounted for the bulk of the income and the year-over-year increase. We ended the quarter with parent company cash investments of $4.9 billion and debt of $1.8 billion. 
During the quarter, we received $74 million in dividends from our subsidiaries, $61 million from CNA and $13 million from Boardwalk. Year-to-date, we have received total dividends of $632 million combine from CNA and Boardwalk. 
Our share repurchase activity since last quarter has been modest. We repurchased 1.9 million shares from April 1 through the end of July, spending $76 million. Year-to-date, we have spent just under $109 million repurchasing 2.8 million shares. Average shares outstanding were 339 million in the second quarter, down 8.5% from 370 million in Q2 2015. 
And now I will hand the call back to Jim."

Now I'd like to talk about the medium to long-term prospects of each of our subsidiaries. Actually, I think it's much, a much more fitting conversation for us to have since at Loews, quarterly results are not necessarily indicative of the long-term performance and ultimate value of our businesses. While we take notice of year term developments, we rarely measure this against of the events or the returns of an investment over the short term. As always, we are focused on the long-term value we can deliver to shareholders.
First, let's turn to Diamond Offshore. I want to start out by addressing the proverbial elephant in the room. Diamond's results in this quarter were severely impacted by the rate impairment charges David mentioned earlier in the call. Keep in mind that the severe downturn in the offshore drilling market, combined with a difficulty in predicting the timing and degree of its inevitable recovery, precipitated these impairments. 
It's important to note, however, that Diamond is scrapping only 2 of the 8 rigs being impaired today. Having been in the offshore drilling business for nearly 30 years and the super type of business for 7 years prior to that, I've seen cyclical downturns before. I'm hopeful that, in this case and similar to prior cases, the rigs being stacked today will work again and earn an attractive rate of return in the future. 
Holding onto and ultimately reactivating capable older rigs in the strategy that Diamond has employed historically to create value and differentiate itself from its competitors. There is no doubt that an oversupply of 6 generation drillships currently exist. However, I believe that the older 70 submersibles being stacked today may indeed find work as the market recovers on jobs for which these third, fourth and fifth generation rigs are better suited.
Diamond's innovative strategies, along with its financial strengths and conservative capital management, should enable the company to emerge from this turbulent market cycle stronger than any of its competitors. As I've said before, it is a silver lining to this price, oil price downturn, except the lack of drilling activity today will only help speed the recovery of oil prices tomorrow. The effects of the current underinvestment in oil drilling are already starting to be evident and will play out in the coming years. Demand for oil is still growing and remains quite healthy.
With all its new rigs contracted at least through 2019, I'm confident in Diamond's meeting the long-term prospects. While today, the situation may seem bleak, we've seen this movie's prequel before and remember well how it ended. Now let's turn to our other energy subsidiary, Boardwalk Pipeline Partners.
By discussing the future prospects of the pipeline space, I hear a lot about the challenges the industry faces, commodity pricing exposure, recontracting issues, booming Marcellus production and slowing gas demand growth. While all of these factors are important, we believe that demand for U.S. natural gas will once again reaccelerate, both domestically and internationally. 
As we know, exports of natural gas are increasing and the U.S. has the capability to produce an enormous amount of low-cost natural gas. As of today, there are commitments to build LNG export plants with capacity of 8.5 billion cubic feet per day. The majority of these plants are located on the Gulf Coast and are scheduled to come online before 2020. Pipeline exports to Mexico are also increasing. Last year, these exports grew by nearly 1 billion cubic feet per day, which represents a 1.5% of U.S. supply. Those exports are on track for a similar increase this year.
Additionally, industrial demand for natural gas and liquids is growing, spurred by petrochemical production. This growth is a boom for Boardwalk, which provide services for the Gulf Coast petrochemicals industry and has key assets located in Louisiana's industrial hub. 
Boardwalk is capitalizing on these trends with several natural gas and liquids projects already underway, all of which are on schedule and on budget. As these projects come into service over the next several years, they'll also help offset possible revenue declines from renewals of certain legacy contracts and contribute to Boardwalk's cash generation.
Turning to the insurance market and CNA. You're familiar with some of the challenges facing the sector, including industry consolidation, a full global economy, persistently low interest rates and decelerating premium rates. While not immune from these challenges, CNA has continued to make progress on its major strategic efforts to become a top quartile underwriter. CNA is also aided by the fact that it's operating at a time when the insurance industry's capital management is extremely disciplined.
Over the last few earnings calls, I've spent time explaining why I strongly believe that CNA can compete effectively in this environment while also delivering strong operating profits. Just to review. CNA has a strong foundation built on financial strength, outstanding human capital that is continually improving, a strong branch network and rigorous underwriting disciplines that have resulted in improved risk selection. So while the insurance industry may face some headwinds, CNA has never been stronger with regard to its capital, its brand and its competitive position.
And last but not least, let's take a look at Loews hotels. The hotel industry continues to enjoy favorable market fundamentals, albeit at a slowing pace. For the last 6 years, hotel room demand has outstripped supply and, while both continue to grow, supply has been catching up. The increase in supply of rooms does create a more competitive environment, but there's still plenty of growth to be had. 
Another industry dynamic is the trend towards consolidation of major hotel companies. We believe that this trend can be a good thing for smaller and more nimble companies, such as Loews Hotels. After all, it's much easier for our chain of 25 properties to roll out and deliver innovative new services and offers for our guests.
Loews Hotels will remain focused on opportunistically growing the chain in key markets. The focus of our growth will be on the group hotels, our sweet spot, as well as resort destinations such as Orlando. Just 2 weeks ago, Loews opened its fifth hotel in Orlando, the 1,000-room Sapphire Falls hotel, bringing our key count there to 5,200. The grand opening of this new properties is just the latest development in what has been an exceptionally successful partnership with Universal Orlando Resorts. 
Before we proceed to our Q&A, let me review why I'm confident about the medium to long-term prospects of each of our businesses. CNA has improved its underwriting performance and paid significant dividends to shareholders while maintaining its strong capital position. Diamond is currently in a very tough market. And although we can't predict when the market will turn, Diamond is weathering the storm well. It's been conserving its financial resources and maintaining its position as the strongest offshore drilling company in terms of credit rating, finance innovation and leadership. Boardwalk has made smart capital decisions that should allow it to fund its announced growth projects and to contribute to its cash flow once these projects come online.
And Loews Hotels continues to grow its chain steadily with an eye towards increased profitability and cash flow. As for Loews Corporation, we have always maintained a focused balance sheet. Our parent company cash and investments exceed our debt just as they have for the vast majority of the last 4 decades. Despite the current turbulence in the energy sector, our financial position remains ironclad and allows us to take advantage of opportunities as they arise.
Whatever the environment Loews and its subsidiaries are operating in, our strategic comparative remains the same, creating value for shareholders over the long term. And now I'd like to turn the call back to Mary Skafidas."

About a quarter ago with CNA stock dropping below 30 and trying to, I guess, capture what you expect to be about a $0.10 dividend yield, you bought back stock. So both Diamond and CNA might be attracted to you, not as attractive, but can we talk about the price of oil, the price of a 10% dividend yield and your willingness to buy back subsidiary stock as opposed to your own?"

We didn't anticipate that oil companies would cut back their capital budgets so dramatically. And we certainly didn't anticipate that utilization today of drilling rigs would be at the levels that they're at. So I think we were surprised and I dare say that the rest of the market was surprised by what's happened in the offshore drilling industry. 
But now I think we recognize very clearly exactly where we are in that business. With respect to CNA, I would say its just the opposite of Diamond. Things have worked out pretty much as we have expected. CNA continues to improve on its underwriting, its earnings, have come in very strong. And when we bought CNA's stock in the 20s, we said then and we say now, the stock is just too damn cheap. You're right, when we bought it, it did represent a 10% yield when you look at -- look in the rearview mirror and take into account the special dividend along with the regular dividend. And we believe very much in the strength of CNA's business. As I said in my remarks, we believe strongly in the capital level that CNA has. We believe strongly in the improvements that are taking place at CNA."

I think the, as I said in my remarks, I think oil companies in the world in general are dramatically under investing in oil production capacity. I think that's -- I think, I believe, I know that depletion is real, that oil wells do not continue producing forever. Some of them declined at 70% a year, some of them decline at 5% a year, but all of them decline. And to the extent that the world is not reinvesting in new, productive capacity, those declines in production will be felt in the coming years. Combined with that, even though some say that oil demand growth is sluggish, oil demand is still continuing to increase every year generally on the order by about 1 million barrels a day or about 1%. So as you add a few years to gather of underinvestment, combined with continued demand growth, I think you can see that in the few year's time, prices will habe to go up in order to provide the investment returns needed by oil companies in order to make the investment in more productive capacity. And I think that in 2 year's time, that will certainly happen. I call -- I -- in prior calls, I've said that $65 was my fearless forecast for year-end 2018 oil.

Loews reported a net loss of $65 million or $0.19 per share in Q2 2016, as opposed to net income of $170 million or $0.46 per share in last year's second quarter. Year-to-date, we have generated net income of $37 million",1508,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning. Loews reported a net loss of $65 million or $0.19 per share in Q2 2016, as opposed to net income of $170 million or $0.46 per share in last year's second quarter. Year-to-date, we have generated net income of $37 million or $0.11 per share. 
Our second quarter earnings were dominated by asset impairments at Diamond Offshore, which overwhelmed favorable results posted by CNA Financial and Boardwalk Pipeline, as well as good returns generated by our parent company investment portfolio. 
The impairments at Diamond, which totaled $678 million pretax on its books, reduced our net income by $267 million. Before I drill into Diamond's results, let me summarize the year-over-year quarterly net income contribution by each of our subsidiaries and by the parent company investment portfolio.
Two of our subsidiaries, CNA and Boardwalk, posted significant increases in net income contribution over the prior year. CNA contributed $189 million, including realized gains, up 52% from last year. And Boardwalk's contribution rose from $12 million last year to $17 million this year. In addition, the parent company investment portfolio generated $56 million of after-tax income this year, a big swing from last quarter's $8 million loss and a $7 million gain in Q2 2015. 
Our remaining 2 subsidiaries, Diamond and Loews Hotels, posted year-over-year declines, in each case, driven by unusual items. Diamond contributed a $290 million net loss in Q2 2016 versus net income of $45 million last year. And Loews Hotels essentially broke even in this quarter, down from net income of $8 million in the prior year. Loews Hotels' results this quarter were significantly affected by the write-down of an equity investment in a joint venture hotel property. But clearly, Diamond drove our disappointing second quarter results, so let me start by explaining Diamond's second quarter.
The offshore drilling market continues to be extremely challenged with limited new drilling opportunities and an oversupply of rigs. In addition, customers are choosing not to extend current contracts and, in some cases, seeking ways to early terminate existing contracts. Diamond assessed its rig fleet for impairment at the end of the quarter. And in light of the difficult market environment and Diamond management's evolving view of the lengthened severity of the downturn, 8 rigs have been written down to substantially lower net book values. These rigs are a mix of third-, fourth- and fifth-generation semi-submersibles. 4 of the 8 rigs are being impaired or stacked, 2 are still on contract and 2 are being scrapped. 
There are 4 key drivers of the write-downs on the 6 rigs not being scrapped: Number one, longer elapsed time until the rates are projected to return to work; number two , higher costs to reactivate the stacked rigs and ready them to return to work; number three, lower expected future day rates once the rigs return to work; and number -- and finally, lower assumed utilization once the rigs return to work.
Absent its asset impairments, Diamond's operating income was relatively weak during the quarter. The combination of fewer rigs on contract and an unexpectedly high amount of unscheduled downtime on its new build drillships led to a 42% decline in contract drilling revenues versus the second quarter of 2015. Diamond's net income in Q2 was further reduced by a valuation allowance for current and prior year tax assets associated with foreign tax credits as Diamond no longer expects to be able to utilize these tax credits to offset income taxes in the U.S.
Jim will provide further thoughts on Diamond's prospects shortly. I would just emphasize that Diamond remains financially strong and is well-positioned from a capital and liquidity standpoint to weather today's storms, continue as a leader in the offshore drilling space and seek to turn adversity into opportunity.
Turning to CNA. In the second quarter, CNA contributed $189 million to our net income, which includes $6 million of realized investment gains. This compares to a net income contribution of $124 million in the second quarter of 2015. This substantial increase was primarily driven by 3 items: Number one, higher favorable prior development this year emanating from all 3 P&C businesses, specialty, commercial and international; number two, the absence in this year's second quarter of a retroactive reinsurance charge associated with a loss portfolio transfer of CNA's expenses and environmental liabilities with national indemnity; and three, improved results in the Life & Group segment reflective of the Q4 2015 reserve unlocking that reset the underlying actuarial assumptions on the long-term care reserves. 
CNA's core P&C business posted net operating income for the quarter, down slightly from the prior year, despite a solid 1-point improvement in the calendar year combined ratio. From an underwriting standpoint, the impact of higher favorable prior year development was offset by an increase in CNA international's accident year combined ratio. This increase was driven by higher catastrophe losses, as well as lower accident year non-CAT underwriting profit, attributable mostly to large loss activity. 
Additionally, P&C's net operating income during Q2 2016 was negatively affected by currency exchange rates. Last year, a retroactive reinsurance charge reduced CNA's contribution to our second quarter net income by $49 million. There was no such charge in this year's second quarter as CNA completed its asbestos environmental reserve reviews this year in the first quarter.
During the second quarter, CNA's Life & Group segment, which houses the long-term care business, produced a $4 million net operating loss compared with a $24 million operating loss in the second quarter of last year. This slight loss was essentially in line with expectations following the unlocking of the company's long-term care active life reserves at year-end 2015.
As a reminder, the financial results for CNA's long-term care business reflect the variance between actual experience and management's best estimate actuarial assumptions. On a year-to-date basis, the Life & Group segment has posted a $6 million net operating loss versus a loss of $41 million in the first half of 2015.
Onto Boardwalk. Boardwalk posted a strong second quarter as net revenues were up 8% year-over-year, just as they were in Q1. EBITDA was up 14%, and net income was up 63%. Boardwalk's contribution to our net income increased from $12 million last year to $17 million this year, driven by the strong underlying operating results. 
A reconciliation of Boardwalk's EBITDA to its net income can be found in this Q2 earnings release. The main drivers of Boardwalk's strong revenue quarter were the return to service of the Evangeline ethylene pipeline in mid-2015, recently completed growth projects placed into service over the last year and improved revenues from parking and lending and storage. This year's second quarter revenues were favorably impacted by a $13 million legal settlement, whereas last year's second quarter benefited from the receipt of $6 million of business interruption insurance proceeds.
I wanted to highlight 2 developments with respect to Boardwalk's funding profile: First, Loews agreed to extend the borrowing period under our $300 million subordinate loan agreement by 2 years, from December 2016 to December 2018. All other terms remain the same. Boardwalk has yet to utilize this facility; and second, Boardwalk exercises -- exercised their 1-year extension option on its credit facility, extending the maturity date from May 2020 to May 2021. All but one bank participated in the extension resulting in $1.475 billion being extended to May 2021. Currently, Boardwalk is not drawn on its credit facility.
Now for a quick review of Loews Hotels, which contributed pretax income of $4 million, down from $14 million in the second quarter of 2015. The company's operational strides were masked by the write-down of an equity investment in one of its joint venture hotel properties. 
Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes this write-down, increased over the prior quarter. A reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income can be found in the Loews' quarterly snapshot on loews.com. Please note that we expect the hotel's -- hotel company's second-half results to be somewhat muted by recently commenced renovations at the Loews Miami Beach Hotel. Let me turn to the parent company.
In the second quarter, the parent company investment portfolio generated after-tax income of $56 million compared with income of $7 million in the prior year quarter. Equities, including gold-related equity investments, accounted for the bulk of the income and the year-over-year increase. We ended the quarter with parent company cash in investments of $4.9 billion and debt of $1.8 billion. 
During the quarter, we received $74 million in dividends from our subsidiaries, $61 million from CNA and $13 million from Boardwalk. Year-to-date, we have received total dividends of $632 million combined from CNA and Boardwalk. 
Our share repurchase activity since last quarter has been modest. We repurchased 1.9 million shares from April 1 through the end of July, spending $76 million. Year-to-date, we have spent just under $109 million repurchasing 2.8 million shares. Average shares outstanding were 339 million in the second quarter, down 8.5% from 370 million in Q2 2015. 
And now I will hand the call back to Jim."

Now I'd like to talk about the medium- to long-term prospects of each of our subsidiaries. Actually, I think it's much -- a much more fitting conversation for us to have since, at Loews, quarterly results are not necessarily indicative of the long-term performance and ultimate value of our businesses. While we take notice of near-term developments, we rarely measure this against of the events or the returns of an investment over the short term. As always, we are focused on the long-term value we can deliver to shareholders.
First, let's turn to Diamond Offshore. I want to start out by addressing the proverbial elephant in the room. Diamond's results this quarter were severely impacted by the rate impairment charges David mentioned earlier in the call. Keep in mind that the severe downturn in the offshore drilling market, combined with a difficulty in predicting the timing and degree of its inevitable recovery, precipitated these impairments. 
It's important to note, however, that Diamond is scrapping only 2 of the 8 rigs being impaired today. Having been in the offshore drilling business for nearly 30 years and the super tanker business for 7 years prior to that, I've seen cyclical downturns before. I'm hopeful that in this case, and similar to prior cases, the rigs being stacked today will work again and earn an attractive rate of return in the future. 
Holding onto and ultimately reactivating capable older rigs in the strategy that Diamond has employed historically to create value and differentiate itself from its competitors, there is no doubt that an oversupply of 6 generation drillships currently exist. However, I believe that the older 70 submersibles being stacked today may indeed find work as the market recovers on jobs for which these third-, fourth-, and fifth-generation rigs are better suited.
Diamond's innovative strategies, along with its financial strengths and conservative capital management, should enable the company to emerge from this turbulent market cycle stronger than any of its competitors. As I've said before, it is a silver lining to this price -- oil price downturn, except the lack of drilling activity today will only help speed the recovery of oil prices tomorrow. The effects of the current underinvestment in oil drilling are already starting to be evident and will play out in the coming years. Demand for oil is still growing and remains quite healthy.
With all its new rigs contracted, at least through 2019, I'm confident in Diamond's meeting the long-term prospects. While today, the situation may seem bleak, we've seen this movie's prequel before and remember well how it ended. 
Now let's turn to our other energy subsidiary, Boardwalk Pipeline Partners. When discussing the future prospects of the pipeline space, I hear a lot about the challenges the industry faces: commodity pricing exposure, recontracting issues, booming Marcellus production and slowing gas demand growth. While all of these factors are important, we believe that demand for U.S. natural gas will, once again, reaccelerate, both domestically and internationally. 
As we know, exports of natural gas are increasing, and the U.S. has the capability to produce an enormous amount of low-cost natural gas. As of today, there are commitments to build LNG export plants with capacity of 8.5 billion cubic feet per day. The majority of these plants are located on the Gulf Coast and are scheduled to come online before 2020. 
Pipeline exports to Mexico are also increasing. Last year, these exports grew by nearly 1 billion cubic feet per day, which represents a 1.5% of U.S. supply. Those exports are on track for a similar increase this year.
Additionally, industrial demand for natural gas and liquids is growing, spurred by petrochemical production. This growth is a boom for Boardwalk, which provide services to the Gulf Coast petrochemicals industry and has key assets located in Louisiana's industrial hub. 
Boardwalk is capitalizing on these trends with several natural gas and liquids projects already underway, all of which are on schedule and on budget. As these projects come into service over the next several years, they'll also help offset possible revenue declines from renewals of certain legacy contracts and contribute to Boardwalk's cash generation.
Turning to the insurance market and CNA. You're familiar with some of the challenges facing this sector, including industry consolidation, a full growth global economy, persistently low interest rates and decelerating premium rates. While not immune from these challenges, CNA has continued to make progress on its major strategic effort to become a top-quartile underwriter. CNA is also aided by the fact that it's operating at a time when the insurance industry's capital management is extremely disciplined.
Over the last few earnings calls, I've spent time explaining why I strongly believe that CNA can compete effectively in this environment while also delivering strong operating profits. Just to review, CNA has a strong foundation built on financial strength, outstanding human capital that is continually improving, a strong branch network and rigorous underwriting disciplines that have resulted in improved risk selection. So while the insurance industry may face some headwinds, CNA has never been stronger with regard to its capital, its brand and its competitive position.
And last but not least, let's take a look at Loews Hotels. The hotel industry continues to enjoy favorable market fundamentals, albeit at a slowing pace. For the last 6 years, hotel room demand has outstripped supply and, while both continue to grow, supply has been catching up. The increasing supply of rooms does create a more competitive environment, but there's still plenty of growth to be had. 
Another industry dynamic is the trend towards consolidation of major hotel companies. We believe that this trend can be a good thing for smaller and more nimble companies such as Loews Hotels. After all, it's much easier for our chain of 25 properties to roll out and deliver innovative new services and offers for our guests.
Loews Hotels will remain focused on opportunistically growing the chain in key markets. The focus of our growth will be on the group hotels, our sweet spot, as well as resort destinations such as Orlando. Just 2 weeks ago, Loews opened its fifth hotel in Orlando, the 1,000-room Sapphire Falls hotel, bringing our key count there to 5,200. The grand opening of this new property  just the latest development in what has been an exceptionally successful partnership with Universal Orlando Resorts. 
Before we proceed to our Q&A, let me review why I'm confident about the medium- to long-term prospects of each of our businesses. CNA has improved its underwriting performance and paid significant dividends to shareholders while maintaining its strong capital position. Diamond is currently in a very tough market. And although we can't predict when the market will turn, Diamond is weathering the storm well. It's been conserving its financial resources and maintaining its position as the strongest offshore drilling company in terms of credit rating, finance innovation and leadership. Boardwalk has made smart capital decisions that should allow it to fund its announced growth projects and to contribute to its cash flow once these projects come online.
And Loews Hotels continues to grow its chain steadily with an eye towards increased profitability and cash flow. As for Loews Corporation, we have always maintained a fortress balance sheet. Our parent company cash and investments exceed our debt, just as they have for the vast majority of the last 4 decades. Despite the current turbulence in the energy sector, our financial position remains ironclad and allows us to take advantage of opportunities as they arise.
Whatever the environment Loews and its subsidiaries are operating in, our strategic comparative remains the same: creating value for shareholders over the long term. And now I'd like to turn the call back to Mary Skafidas."

And we certainly didn't anticipate that utilization today of drilling rigs would be at the levels that they're at. So I think we were surprised, and I dare say that the rest of the market was surprised by what's happened in the offshore drilling industry. But now I think we recognize very clearly exactly where we are in that business. 
With respect to CNA, I would say it's just the opposite of Diamond. Things have worked out pretty much as we have expected. CNA continues to improve on its underwriting. Its earnings have come in very strong. And when we bought CNA's stock in the 20s, we said then and then we say now, the stock is just too damn cheap. You're right. When we bought it, it did represent a 10% yield when you look at -- look in the rearview mirror and take into account the special dividend along with the regular dividend.

I think the -- as I've said in my remarks, I think oil companies in the world in general are dramatically underinvesting in oil production capacity.

But all of them decline. And to the extent that the world is not reinvesting in new, productive capacity, those declines in production will be felt in the coming years. Combined with that, even though some say that oil demand growth is sluggish, oil demand is still continuing to increase every year generally on the order by about 1 million barrels a day or about 1%. So as you add a few years together of underinvestment, combined with continued demand growth, I think you can see that in the few year's time, prices will have to go up in order to provide the investment returns needed by oil companies in order to make the investment in more productive capacity. And I think that in 2 year's time, that will certainly happen. I call -- I -- in prior calls, I've said that $65 was my fearless forecast for year-end 2018 oil.

When you look at the economics of purchasing a third-, fourth- and fifth-generation rig, what you quickly realize is that the purchase price of the rig is really incidental and very small in comparison to the cost of recommissioning the rig and going through a special survey.

This time, the cost to recommission the rig after it's been in stack mode for a few years can, in some instances, be measured -- can be greater than $100 million. So it doesn't -- the economics aren't about -- are not driven by whether you pay $5 million for the rig or $7 million for the rig.

Loews reported a net loss of $65 million or $0.19 per share in Q2 2016, as opposed to net income of $170 million or $0.46 per share in last year's second quarter. Year-to-date, we have generated net income of $37 million",1508,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning. Loews reported a net loss of $65 million or $0.19 per share in Q2 2016, as opposed to net income of $170 million or $0.46 per share in last year's second quarter. Year-to-date, we have generated net income of $37 million or $0.11 per share. 
Our second quarter earnings were dominated by asset impairments at Diamond Offshore, which overwhelmed favorable results posted by CNA Financial and Boardwalk Pipeline, as well as good returns generated by our parent company investment portfolio. 
The impairments at Diamond, which totaled $678 million pretax on its books, reduced our net income by $267 million. Before I drill into Diamond's results, let me summarize the year-over-year quarterly net income contribution by each of our subsidiaries and by the parent company investment portfolio.
Two of our subsidiaries, CNA and Boardwalk, posted significant increases in net income contribution over the prior year. CNA contributed $189 million, including realized gains, up 52% from last year. And Boardwalk's contribution rose from $12 million last year to $17 million this year. In addition, the parent company investment portfolio generated $56 million of after-tax income this year, a big swing from last quarter's $8 million loss and a $7 million gain in Q2 2015. 
Our remaining 2 subsidiaries, Diamond and Loews Hotels, posted year-over-year declines, in each case, driven by unusual items. Diamond contributed a $290 million net loss in Q2 2016 versus net income of $45 million last year. And Loews Hotels essentially broke even in this quarter, down from net income of $8 million in the prior year. Loews Hotels' results this quarter were significantly affected by the write-down of an equity investment in a joint venture hotel property. But clearly, Diamond drove our disappointing second quarter results, so let me start by explaining Diamond's second quarter.
The offshore drilling market continues to be extremely challenged, with limited new drilling opportunities and an oversupply of rigs. In addition, customers are choosing not to extend current contracts and, in some cases, seeking ways to early terminate existing contracts. Diamond assessed its rig fleet for impairment at the end of the quarter. And in light of the difficult market environment and Diamond management's evolving view of the lengthened severity of the downturn, 8 rigs have been written down to substantially lower net book values. These rigs are a mix of third-, fourth- and fifth-generation semi-submersibles. 4 of the 8 rigs are being impaired or stacked, 2 are still on contract and 2 are being scrapped. 
There are 4 key drivers of the write-downs on the 6 rigs not being scrapped: Number one, longer elapsed time until the rigs are projected to return to work; number two, higher costs to reactivate the stacked rigs and ready them to return to work; number three, lower expected future day rates once the rigs return to work; and number -- and finally, lower assumed utilization once the rigs return to work.
Absent its asset impairments, Diamond's operating income was relatively weak during the quarter. The combination of fewer rigs on contract and an unexpectedly high amount of unscheduled downtime on its new build drillships led to a 42% decline in contract drilling revenues versus the second quarter of 2015. Diamond's net income in Q2 was further reduced by a valuation allowance for current and prior year tax assets associated with foreign tax credits as Diamond no longer expects to be able to utilize these tax credits to offset income taxes in the U.S.
Jim will provide further thoughts on Diamond's prospects shortly. I would just emphasize that Diamond remains financially strong and is well-positioned from a capital and liquidity standpoint to weather today's storms, continue as a leader in the offshore drilling space and seek to turn adversity into opportunity.
Turning to CNA. In the second quarter, CNA contributed $189 million to our net income, which includes $6 million of realized investment gains. This compares to a net income contribution of $124 million in the second quarter of 2015. This substantial increase was primarily driven by 3 items: number one, higher favorable prior development this year emanating from all 3 P&C businesses, specialty, commercial and international; number two, the absence in this year's second quarter of a retroactive reinsurance charge associated with a loss portfolio transfer of CNA's asbestos and environmental liabilities with National Indemnity; and three, improved results in the Life & Group segment reflective of the Q4 2015 reserve unlocking that reset the underlying actuarial assumptions on the long-term care reserves. 
CNA's core P&C business posted net operating income for the quarter, down slightly from the prior year, despite a solid 1-point improvement in the calendar year combined ratio. From an underwriting standpoint, the impact of higher favorable prior year development was offset by an increase in CNA international's accident year combined ratio. This increase was driven by higher catastrophe losses, as well as lower accident year non-CAT underwriting profit, attributable mostly to large-loss activity. 
Additionally, P&C's net operating income during Q2 2016 was negatively affected by currency exchange rates. Last year, a retroactive reinsurance charge reduced CNA's contribution to our second quarter net income by $49 million. There was no such charge in this year's second quarter as CNA completed its asbestos and environmental reserve reviews this year in the first quarter.
During the second quarter, CNA's Life & Group segment, which houses the long-term care business, produced a $4 million net operating loss compared with a $24 million operating loss in the second quarter of last year. This slight loss was essentially in line with expectations following the unlocking of the company's long-term care active life reserves at year-end 2015.
As a reminder, the financial results for CNA's long-term care business reflect the variance between actual experience and management's best estimate actuarial assumptions. On a year-to-date basis, the Life & Group segment has posted a $6 million net operating loss versus a loss of $41 million in the first half of 2015.
On to Boardwalk. Boardwalk posted a strong second quarter as net revenues were up 8% year-over-year, just as they were in Q1. EBITDA was up 14%, and net income was up 63%. Boardwalk's contribution to our net income increased from $12 million last year to $17 million this year, driven by the strong underlying operating results. 
A reconciliation of Boardwalk's EBITDA to its net income can be found in its Q2 earnings release. The main drivers of Boardwalk's strong revenue quarter were the return to service of the Evangeline ethylene pipeline in mid-2015, recently completed growth projects placed into service over the last year and improved revenues from parking and lending and storage. This year's second quarter revenues were favorably impacted by a $13 million legal settlement, whereas last year's second quarter benefited from the receipt of $6 million of business interruption insurance proceeds.
I wanted to highlight 2 developments with respect to Boardwalk's funding profile. First, Loews agreed to extend the borrowing period under our $300 million subordinate loan agreement by 2 years, from December 2016 to December 2018. All other terms remain the same. Boardwalk has yet to utilize this facility; and second, Boardwalk exercises -- exercised their 1-year extension option on its credit facility, extending the maturity date from May 2020 to May 2021. All but one bank participated in the extension resulting in $1.475 billion being extended to May 2021. Currently, Boardwalk is not drawn on its credit facility.
Now for a quick review of Loews Hotels, which contributed pretax income of $4 million, down from $14 million in the second quarter of 2015. The company's operational strides were masked by the write-down of an equity investment in one of its joint venture hotel properties. 
Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes this write-down, increased over the prior quarter. A reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income can be found in the Loews quarterly snapshot on loews.com. Please note that we expect the hotel's -- hotel company's second-half results to be somewhat muted by recently commenced renovations at the Loews Miami Beach Hotel. Let me turn to the parent company.
In the second quarter, the parent company investment portfolio generated after-tax income of $56 million compared with income of $7 million in the prior year quarter. Equities, including gold-related equity investments, accounted for the bulk of the income and the year-over-year increase. We ended the quarter with parent company cash in investments of $4.9 billion and debt of $1.8 billion. 
During the quarter, we received $74 million in dividends from our subsidiaries, $61 million from CNA and $13 million from Boardwalk. Year-to-date, we have received total dividends of $632 million combined from CNA and Boardwalk. 
Our share repurchase activity since last quarter has been modest. We repurchased 1.9 million shares from April 1 through the end of July, spending $76 million. Year-to-date, we have spent just under $109 million repurchasing 2.8 million shares. Average shares outstanding were 339 million in the second quarter, down 8.5% from 370 million in Q2 2015. 
And now I will hand the call back to Jim."
285930,374072628,1020411,"Loews Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 01, 2016",2016-08-01,"Earnings Calls","Loews Corporation","Executives","Thank you, David.

Now I'd like to talk about the medium- to long-term prospects of each of our subsidiaries. Actually, I think it's much -- a much more fitting conversation for us to have since, at Loews, quarterly results are not necessarily indicative of the long-term performance and ultimate value of our businesses. While we take notice of near-term developments, we rarely measure the against of the events or the returns of an investment over the short term. As always, we are focused on the long-term value we can deliver to shareholders.
First, let's turn to Diamond Offshore. I want to start out by addressing the proverbial elephant in the room. Diamond's results this quarter were severely impacted by the rig impairment charges David mentioned earlier in the call. Keep in mind that the severe downturn in the offshore drilling market, combined with a difficulty in predicting the timing and degree of its inevitable recovery, precipitated these impairments. 
It's important to note, however, that Diamond is scrapping only 2 of the 8 rigs being impaired to date. Having been in the offshore drilling business for nearly 30 years and the super tanker business for 7 years prior to that, I've seen cyclical downturns before. I'm hopeful that in this case, and similar to prior cases, the rigs being stacked today will work again and earn an attractive rate of return in the future. 
Holding onto and ultimately reactivating capable older rigs is the strategy that Diamond has employed historically to create value and differentiate itself from its competitors. There is no doubt that an oversupply of 6 generation drillships currently exists. However, I believe that the older semi-submersibles being stacked today may indeed find work as the market recovers on jobs for which these third-, fourth-, and fifth-generation rigs are better suited.
Diamond's innovative strategies, along with its financial strength and conservative capital management, should enable the company to emerge from this turbulent market cycle stronger than any of its competitors. As I've said before, if there is a silver lining to this price -- oil price downturn, it's that the lack of drilling activity today will only help speed the recovery of oil prices tomorrow. The effects of the current underinvestment in oil drilling are already starting to be evident and will play out in the coming years. Demand for oil is still growing and remains quite healthy.
With all its new rigs contracted, at least through 2019, I'm confident in Diamond's medium- to long-term prospects. While today, the situation may seem bleak, we've seen this movie's prequel before and remember well how it ended. 
Now let's turn to our other energy subsidiary, Boardwalk Pipeline Partners. When discussing the future prospects of the pipeline space, I hear a lot about the challenges the industry faces: commodity pricing exposure, recontracting issues, booming Marcellus production and slowing gas demand growth. While all of these factors are important, we believe that demand for U.S. natural gas will once again reaccelerate, both domestically and internationally. 
As we know, exports of natural gas are increasing, and the U.S. has the capability to produce an enormous amount of low-cost natural gas. As of today, there are commitments to build LNG export plants with a capacity of 8.5 billion cubic feet per day. The majority of these plants are located on the Gulf Coast and are scheduled to come online before 2020. 
Pipeline exports to Mexico are also increasing. Last year, these exports grew by nearly 1 billion cubic feet per day, which represents a 1.5% of U.S. supply. Those exports are on track for a similar increase this year.
Additionally, industrial demand for natural gas and liquids is growing, spurred by petrochemical production. This growth is a boom for Boardwalk, which provide services to the Gulf Coast petrochemicals industry and has key assets located in Louisiana's industrial hub. 
Boardwalk is capitalizing on these trends with several natural gas and liquids projects already under way, all of which are on schedule and on budget. As these projects come into service over the next several years, they'll also help offset possible revenue declines from renewals of certain legacy contracts and contribute to Boardwalk's cash generation.
Turning to the insurance market and CNA. You're familiar with some of the challenges facing this sector, including industry consolidation, a full-growth global economy, persistently low interest rates and decelerating premium rates. While not immune from these challenges, CNA has continued to make progress on its major strategic effort to become a top-quartile underwriter. CNA is also aided by the fact that it's operating at a time when the insurance industry's capital management is extremely disciplined.
Over the last few earnings calls, I've spent time explaining why I strongly believe that CNA can compete effectively in this environment while also delivering strong operating profits. Just to review, CNA has a strong foundation built on financial strength, outstanding human capital that is continually improving, a strong branch network and rigorous underwriting disciplines that have resulted in improved risk selection. So while the insurance industry may face some headwinds, CNA has never been stronger with regard to its capital, its brand and its competitive position.
And last but not least, let's take a look at Loews Hotels. The hotel industry continues to enjoy favorable market fundamentals, albeit at a slowing pace. For the last 6 years, hotel room demand has outstripped supply and, while both continue to grow, supply has been catching up. The increasing supply of rooms does create a more competitive environment, but there's still plenty of growth to be had. 
Another industry dynamic is the trend towards consolidation of major hotel companies. We believe that this trend can be a good thing for smaller and more nimble companies such as Loews Hotels. After all, it's much easier for our chain of 25 properties to roll out and deliver innovative new services and offers for our guests.
Loews Hotels will remain focused on opportunistically growing the chain in key markets. The focus of our growth will be on the group hotels, our sweet spot, as well as resort destinations such as Orlando. Just 2 weeks ago, Loews opened its fifth hotel in Orlando, the 1,000-room Sapphire Falls hotel, bringing our key count there to 5,200. The grand opening of this new property is just the latest development in what has been an exceptionally successful partnership with Universal Orlando Resorts. 
Before we proceed to our Q&A, let me review why I'm confident about the medium- to long-term prospects of each of our businesses. CNA has improved its underwriting performance and paid significant dividends to shareholders while maintaining its strong capital position. Diamond is currently in a very tough market. And although we can't predict when the market will turn, Diamond is weathering the storm well. It's been conserving its financial resources and maintaining its position as the strongest offshore drilling company in terms of credit rating, finance, innovation and leadership. Boardwalk has made smart capital decisions that should allow it to fund its announced growth projects and to contribute to its cash flow once these projects come online.
And Loews Hotels continues to grow its chain steadily with an eye towards increased profitability and cash flow. As for Loews Corporation, we have always maintained a fortress balance sheet. Our parent company cash and investments exceed our debt, just as they have for the vast majority of the last 4 decades. Despite the current turbulence in the energy sector, our financial position remains ironclad and allows us to take advantage of opportunities as they arise.
Whatever the environment Loews and its subsidiaries are operating in, our strategic comparative remains the same: creating value for shareholders over the long term. And now I'd like to turn the call back to Mary Skafidas."

About a quarter ago with CNA stock dropping below $30, and trying to, I guess, capture what you expect to be about a 10% dividend yield, you bought back stock. So both Diamond and CNA might be attractive to you, not as attractive, but can we talk about the price of oil, the price of a 10% dividend yield and your willingness to buy back subsidiary stock as opposed to your own?"

When we bought back the shares of Diamond, I think that we did not anticipate that the decline in offshore drilling would be as bad as it has been. We didn't anticipate that oil prices would go into the 20s. We didn't anticipate that oil companies would cut back their capital budgets so dramatically. And we certainly didn't anticipate that utilization today of drilling rigs would be at the levels that they're at. So I think we were surprised, and I dare say that the rest of the market was surprised by what's happened in the offshore drilling industry. But now I think we recognize very clearly exactly where we are in that business. 
With respect to CNA, I would say it's just the opposite of Diamond. Things have worked out pretty much as we have expected. CNA continues to improve on its underwriting. Its earnings have come in very strong. And when we bought CNA's stock in the 20s, we said then and we say now, the stock is just too damn cheap. You're right. When we bought it, it did represent a 10% yield when you look at -- look in the rearview mirror and take into account the special dividend along with the regular dividend. And we believe very much in the strength of CNA's business. As I said in my remarks, we believe strongly in the capital level that CNA has, and we believe strongly in the improvements that are taking place at CNA."

And from my perspective and the Loews Corporation perspective, we are constantly making judgments every day what is the best place for our capital.

I think the -- as I said in my remarks, I think oil companies in the world in general are dramatically underinvesting in oil-production capacity. I think that -- I think, I believe, I know that depletion is real, that oil wells do not continue producing forever. Some of them decline at 70% a year. Some of them decline at 5% a year. But all of them decline. And to the extent that the world is not reinvesting in new, productive capacity, those declines in production will be felt in the coming years. Combined with that, even though some say that oil demand growth is sluggish, oil demand is still continuing to increase every year generally on the order by about 1 million barrels a day or about 1%. So as you add a few years together of underinvestment combined with continued demand growth, I think you can see that in a few years' time, prices will have to go up in order to provide the investment returns needed by oil companies in order to make the investment in more productive capacity. And I think that in 2 years' time, that will certainly happen. I call -- I -- in prior calls, I've said that $65 was my fearless forecast for year-end 2018 oil. I think there's a good chance that oil will be significantly higher than that in the order of, say, $10 a barrel."

So I don't foresee Diamond purchasing any third-, fourth- or fifth-generation rigs. When you look at the economics of purchasing a third-, fourth- and fifth-generation rig, what you quickly realize is that the purchase price of the rig is really incidental and very small in comparison to the cost of recommissioning the rig and going through a special survey. So the -- in my opinion, the cycle is different, slightly different this time than last time because in the cycle, say, in the late '80s, early '90s, you were able to buy rigs, recommission them for very little, and, bingo, you would be back in business. This time, the cost to recommission the rig after it's been in stack mode for a few years can, in some instances, be measured -- can be greater than $100 million. So it doesn't -- the economics aren't about -- are not driven by whether you pay $5 million for the rig or $7 million for the rig. We feel that we have enough of that class of rigs that when and if the industry comes back, we will make a lot of money from those rigs, and we would anticipate making money then from sixth-generation and later rigs if the market truly improves."

The contrasting fortunes of CNA and Diamond Offshore are the proverbial corporate tale of 2 cities. Well, not exactly, but almost. While it may be the worst of times for Diamond and the offshore drilling industry; for CNA, we hope and expect to see even more improvement from its already stellar performance. Let's focus on the positive first and take a look at CNA and the commercial property casualty insurance market. 
CNA has come a long way since 2009 when Tom Motamed first took over as its CEO. Today, CNA is a consistently profitable insurance carrier with strong operating results and an intense focus on underwriting fundamentals. As previously announced, Tom will be retiring next month. And today marks his last CNA quarterly conference call, on which I made a surprise cameo appearance to sing his praises. I don't want to say that Tom took CNA from worst to first, but there certainly have been a vast improvement on his watch. And I think it's abundantly clear that this improvement is due to the herculean efforts of Tom and his team. While I could spend the entire call listing all of Tom's accomplishments, let's focus on just a few key highlights.
During his tenure, Tom has strengthened CNA's branch network, enhanced CNA's competitive position, dramatically upgraded CNA's talent, tremendously improved the commercial lines business, maintained specialty lines' preeminent market standing, mitigated operational and financial risks, significantly fortified CNA's balance sheet and, oh, yes, paid out about $2.5 billion of dividends in the past 5 years. 
Tom would be the first one to point out that there is still work to be done. However, the indisputable fact remains that Tom will leave CNA at a time when its capital competitive position and its brand have never been stronger. I want to thank Tom for his many contributions and wish him continued success as he moves on to the next chapter in his life.
And the good news for CNA continues with the arrival of Dino Robusto as the company's new CEO next month. Dino will take the helm on November 21 when his garden leave officially comes to an end. I'm confident that I speak for the rest of the CNA board when I say how much we look forward to working with Dino. The CNA that Dino inherits is poised for continued improvement and further value creation, and we fully believe that Dino and the CNA team will fulfill that potential.
Alas, [ph] all of life cannot be light and happiness. And with that in mind, let's move on to Diamond Offshore and the offshore drilling industry, where they are experiencing the aforementioned worst of time. It's clear that this industry is facing one of the sharpest downturns in its history, with canceled contracts, below [ph] operating cost day rates and customers seemingly unwilling to take advantage of these discounts. Despite the pain, Diamond Offshore's CEO, Marc Edwards, and his team continue to navigate these troubled waters with tireless focus, skill and determination. Just in the past few weeks, Marc has been in Singapore, Australia, Dubai, Rio de Janeiro and France, not to mention, New York and Houston, all in the quest of [ph] maintaining and generating business for Diamond Offshore.
And while the offshore drilling industry continues to operate in a depressed environment, the price of oil, the commodity to which the offshore drilling industry is most closely tied, seems to have begun its recovery. At the beginning of this year, oil dropped to about $27 a barrel, a new low in recent history. 2 weeks ago, oil was nearly double that price at almost $52 a barrel. And while oil prices may have partially recovered, day rates for offshore drilling rigs certainly have not. I'm hopeful that within the next several quarters, we'll start to see an uptick in the inquiries [ph] for offshore drilling rigs, a necessary precursor to improved day rates in the future.
While there are still many unknowns with regard to the oil and energy markets today, we have no doubt that Diamond Offshore will withstand this tough cyclical downturn. Diamond's innovative strategy, along with its financial strength, conservative capital management and stellar management team, should enable the company to emerge from this turbulent market cycle stronger and more resilient than ever.
Before I turn the call over to David Edelson, I wanted to mention that Jon Tisch has resumed the duties of CEO at Loews Hotels. Many of you may know that Kirk Kinsell has decided to leave the company. Loews Hotels is in strong shape, and the Loews Hotels team looks forward to building on the strong base already in place. The company is in great hands with Jon, who has been shepherding the expansion and strategic direction of Loews Hotels for the past 30 years. 
And now over to David."

For the third quarter, Loews reported net income of $327 million or $0.70 -- [ph] $0.97 per share as compared to net income of $182 million or $0.50 per share in last year's third quarter. The year-over-year increase in o",1627,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning. For the third quarter, Loews reported net income of $327 million or $0.70 -- [ph] $0.97 per share as compared to net income of $182 million or $0.50 per share in last year's third quarter. The year-over-year increase in our third quarter earnings came almost entirely from higher contributions from CNA Financial and from the parent company investment portfolio. 
Let me start by walking through the key drivers of our year-over-year quarterly improvement. For your information, these key drivers are set forth on Page 12 of our Q3 2016 earnings supplement, which can be found on loews.com. 
The first key driver was net investment income, both at the parent company and at CNA. The parent company portfolio generated a pretax gain of $36 million in Q3 2016 versus a pretax loss of $35 million last year. The gain was driven by alternative investments and gold-related equities, while last year's loss was primarily caused by equities, including gold-related equities and alternatives. The $71 million pretax improvement accounted for a $46 million after-tax improvement year-over-year.
At CNA, the year-over-year swing in net investment income of $170 million pretax was driven by LP investments, which swung from a $93 million pretax loss in Q3 2015 to a $65 million gain this past quarter. This $158 million pretax swing resulted in a $92 million increase in net income at the Loews level. 
The second key driver was a meaningful improvement in CNA's Life & Group segment, which swung from a $30 million after-tax loss in last year's third quarter to net operating income of $6 million this year. This $36 million year-over-year improvement was mostly attributable to the long-term care reserve unlocking at year-end 2015 that reset the underlying actuarial assumptions on the long-term care reserves. The turnaround in CNA's Life & Group segment accounted for a $32 million increase in net income at the Loews level.
The third key driver was realized investment gains and losses at CNA. CNA posted pretax realized gains of $46 million in Q3 2016 versus realized losses of $49 million in the last year's third quarter. This $95 million pretax improvement accounted for $56 million of the year-over-year increase in Loews's third quarter net income. 
The fourth and fifth key drivers partially offset the first 3 positives. CNA's P&C underwriting income was down year-over-year as CNA's combined ratio rose from 85.7 in Q3 2015 to 90.4 this past quarter. Let me pause and simply note that both of these combined ratios are extremely strong and result in substantial underwriting income.
As a reminder, underwriting income reflects earned premium less the sum of losses plus adjustment expenses and acquisition and underwriting expenses. While CNA's accident year loss ratio, including cat losses, was a solid 62.8 in both periods, the company booked 11 points of favorable prior year development last year against 8 points this year. Also, CNA incurred higher expenses attributable to both ongoing and nonrecurring costs. The combination of less favorable development and higher expenses caused CNA's P&C underwriting income to decline $73 million pretax year-over-year, accounting for a $43 million decline in net income at the Loews level. 
The last key driver was the substantial year-over-year fallouts in Diamond's operating results. With fewer working rigs and elevated unscheduled downtime, Diamond's contract drilling revenue declined 43% year-over-year, and its net income dropped to $14 million from $136 million in last year's third quarter. At the Loews level, Diamond's contribution to our net income fell $40 million from $47 million in Q3 2015 to $7 million this past quarter.
These 5 drivers -- net investment income, CNA's Life & Group segment, realized investment results at CNA, CNA's P&C underwriting income and Diamond's operating results -- netted to a positive $143 million after tax, essentially accounting for the $145 million year-over-year increase in Loews's third quarter net income.
Let me now briskly walk through our earnings by business segment. CNA contributed $308 million to our net income in Q3 2016, $281 million of net operating income and $27 million of realized investment gains. This compares to $161 million in the third quarter of 2015, net operating income of $190 million and $29 million of realized investment losses. As I've already mentioned, the key drivers of the net operating income improvement were net investment income, specifically returns on LP investments, and improved results in the Life & Group segment, partially offset by the decline in P&C underwriting income.
Before leaving CNA, I must highlight CNA's progress in generating underwriting profit. CNA posted a 90.4 combined ratio in the third quarter and 94.6 year-to-date. All 3 P&C businesses, specialty, commercial and international, posted sub-100 combined ratios in the quarter. As Jim noted, under Tom's leadership, CNA has made tremendous strides.
On to Diamond. Diamond contributed $7 million to our net income in Q3 2016, down from $47 million last year. Diamond itself posted net income of $14 million versus $136 million in Q3 2015. Let me remind you that in last year's third quarter, we wrote off $20 million of goodwill associated with our carrying value of Diamond. Without this goodwill charge, Diamond's contribution to our Q3 2015 net income would have been $67 million.
We have discussed the difficult conditions in the offshore drilling market previously, and Jim just mentioned them. And these conditions showed no signs of abating in the third quarter. Contract drilling revenues in Q3 were down 43% on a 44% decline in revenue-earning days. The bulk of the revenue decline was attributable to fewer rigs working this year versus last year. Additionally, the company experienced unscheduled downtime due to unanticipated customer and operational issues. 
I would note that Diamond continues to be the highest-rated company in the offshore drilling space. The company's liquidity position is solid, with $1.3 billion available today under its $1.5 billion revolving credit facility. No debt maturities until 2019 and no capital expenditure commitments for undelivered rates. [ph] 
Turning to Boardwalk. The company posted a strong third quarter as net revenues were up 6% year-over-year, EBITDA was up 9% and net income was up 23%. The main drivers of Boardwalk's strong revenue quarter, which flow through the EBITDA and net income, were favorable natural gas transportation, primarily from growth projects, and improved revenues from parking and lending and storage. Please note that a reconciliation of Boardwalk's EBITDA to its net income can be found in its Q3 earnings release.
Despite Boardwalk's strong quarter, you can see that its contribution to our net income declined by $4 million year-over-year. The reason is that in last year's third quarter, Loews benefited from a $6 million after-tax franchise tax refund related to Boardwalk. Excluding this nonrecurring item at the Loews level, Boardwalk's net income contribution was up $2 million from the prior year.
As you know, Boardwalk is undertaking various growth projects to position it for the future. The company recently placed into service 4 projects that represent approximately $320 million in CapEx. An additional $1.2 billion of projects are underway and expected to be placed into service between now and 2018. We are pleased that the 4 projects placed in service in 2016 came in approximately 9% below budget, reflecting management's keen focus on project execution.
Finally, S&P recently raised the issue-level ratings on Boardwalk's unsecured debt, including its revolving credit facility, from BB+ to BBB-. [ph] This means that all of Boardwalk's senior debt now carries investment-grade ratings from each of the major rating agencies. 
Let me now touch on Loews Hotels, which contributed net income of $3 million, up from $2 million in the third quarter of 2015. The company's adjusted EBITDA in Q3 was $37 million, up from $30 million in Q3 2015. A reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income can be found in our Q3 2016 earnings supplement. Contributing to the increase in adjusted EBITDA were improved results across the chain, including the Loews Regency in [ph] New York and the Orlando properties, offset somewhat by muted results at the Loews Miami Beach Hotel, which is under renovation. Third quarter results were also negatively impacted by preopening expenses related to the new 1,000-room Loews Sapphire Falls in Orlando which opened in July.
Turning to the parent company. As previously mentioned, the parent company investment portfolio generated after-tax income of $24 million compared with a loss of $22 million in the prior year quarter. At quarter end, the parent company portfolio totaled $5 billion, broken down as follows: just over 60% in cash and short-term investments; 17% in limited partnership investments; another 9% in marketable equity securities; and the bulk of the remainder in fixed maturities. We maintain a large and liquid portfolio of cash and investments for 2 neutrally reinforcing reasons: to enable us to take advantage of opportunities when they present themselves; and to help mitigate risk during tough times.
Capital deployment opportunities can take such forms as acquiring new business is helping our subsidiaries pursue their strategies and repurchasing our shares. Our liquidity, combined with our relatively low level of parent company debt and the extended maturity schedule of that debt, give us valuable optionality and protection.
During the third quarter, we have received $74 million in dividends from our subsidiaries: $61 million from CNA and $13 million from Boardwalk. Year-to-date, we have received total dividends of $706 million combined from CNA and Boardwalk. Our share repurchase activity since last quarter has been modest. We repurchased 440,000 shares in July 1 through this past Friday, spending approximately $17 million. Year-to-date, we have spent approximately $115 million repurchasing 3 million shares. Average shares outstanding were 338 million in the third quarter, down 6.5% from 361 million in Q3 2015. 
And with that, I'll now hand the call back to Mary."

It's just there is no one factor that can fully describe or explain why does we buy or don't buy -- repurchase our shares. When we think about share repurchases, there are an enormous number of factors that go into the equation. There's the price of Loews. There's the price of our subsidiaries. The value that we ascribe to our nonpublic businesses. There are times when even if we want to buy in the shares for one reason or another, we're not allowed to repurchase the share. There is what's going on in the wider market, both the market for interest rates and the market for shares. And there's not just what's going on today, but our outlook for the future. So we put all of these factors and more into our own special computer, which is collectively the brains of a few people around here. And we discussed it and decide what to do with respect to share repurchases. Like acquisitions, the one thing -- the one factor that drives us in determining whether to repurchase shares or not is our assessment of how it will contribute to the intermediate to long-term value for the remaining share, Loews shareholders. So it's all a long way of saying that we look at lots and lots of factors in determining whether to purchase shares. And as I like to say, we have a long and glorious history of share repurchases, where we have I think 80% of the shares outstanding -- sorry, 20 -- 30% of the shares outstanding today that we had in the 70s. And just since '07, we've purchased 40% of the shares outstanding in '07. So my advice, try not to make too much of what we do 1 quarter or 1 year.

Let me just talk about how we think about buying businesses for Loews. And our benchmark that we use is whether an acquisition would be accretive in terms of value over the intermediate for long-term from our shareholders. As I've said before and I'll say again, there are things we do look at and other things that we don't look at. The things we don't look at are things where a bad CEO in the course of 1 year or 2 could cause tremendous damage to a business. So we tend not to look at retailing businesses. We tend not to look at businesses where technological disruption could be an important factor. We tend not to look at technology businesses where if you miss one relatively quick cycle in terms of the technology, you can be out of business. So we're looking for businesses that we believe can stand the test of time and be with us for a long time to create value. We're also generally looking for businesses that are based here in the United States. They could have international operations, but we'd like them to be based here in the U.S. And as I said before, we kicked an awful lot of tires. We've gone down the path pretty far with a number of businesses. But in recent history, we haven't been able to close anything. When we think about buying businesses versus share repurchases, that's an important comparison that we make. We think about what is the future for Loews with the business and what would be the future of Loews without the business. And we think whether -- we think how compelling it is to repurchase shares at any point in time versus the value that we can get in buying a business that we don't already control. And we also think very carefully about what we don't know concerning any business that we might buy, and we compare that to what we do know about our own businesses that we own and control with respect to share repurchases. There's no given formula that we use in assessing repurchases -- purchases of businesses just as there's no formula that we use in assessing whether to repurchase shares. But I would say that what we're doing is generally what any other portfolio manager does when they think about adding new securities to their portfolios. That's how I was trained. That's how a lot of people here were trained. And that's how we think about buying new businesses, repurchasing our own shares or investing in any of our individual businesses."

First of all, CNA stock -- CNA shares have moved up rather significantly, almost 20% in the past few months or quarters. And I ascribe that to the fact that people are starting to recognize that CNA is a changed company, that it's got underwriting discipline, all the things that I spoke about with respect to my comments about Tom and CNA. Additionally, I think a very important factor is that people are starting to see that the dividend that CNA has paid out, which is, for the past 2 years at least have totaled $3 a share, makes it that at $30 a share, CNA was trading at a 10% yield, which is just too high a yield to be passed up. I think -- so I think that the 20% improvement over the past several quarters has been a recognition of those factors. I think a problem for people investing in CNA is that there is not significant liquidity. Loews owns 90% of CNA. We don't worry about the price from day to day, week to week or month to month. But the seeming lack of liquidity, I think, has kept a number of large purchasers from CNA. I think the other reason is that some people might be concerned about the long-term care book of business. I would say that we at Loews are very comfortable with it, but there's no doubt that some investors may be scared off a bit by it. The things that I would say is that the long-term care of book of business at CNA is being very aggressively managed in terms of the attention that it is -- the management attention that it is getting and the focus on the part of senior management. I think all that and who knows whatever factors may be out there that are affecting the overall valuation of CNA."

The contrasting fortunes of CNA and Diamond Offshore are the proverbial corporate tale of 2 cities. Well, not exactly, but almost.

The contrasting fortunes of CNA and Diamond Offshore are the proverbial corporate tale of 2 cities. Well, not exactly, but almost. While it may be the worst of times for Diamond and the offshore drilling industry; for CNA, we hope and expect to see even more improvement from its already stellar performance. Let's focus on the positive first and take a look at CNA and the commercial property casualty insurance market. 
CNA has come a long way since 2009 when Tom Motamed first took over as its CEO. Today, CNA is a consistently profitable insurance carrier with strong operating results and an intense focus on underwriting fundamentals. As previously announced, Tom will be retiring next month. And today marks his last CNA quarterly conference call, on which I made a surprise cameo appearance to sing his praises. I don't want to say that Tom took CNA from worst to first, but there certainly have been a vast improvement on his watch. And I think it's abundantly clear that this improvement is due to the herculean efforts of Tom and his team. While I could spend the entire call listing all of Tom's accomplishments, let's focus on just a few key highlights.
During his tenure, Tom has strengthened CNA's branch network, enhanced CNA's competitive position, dramatically upgraded CNA's talent, tremendously improved the commercial lines business, maintained specialty lines' preeminent market standing, mitigated operational and financial risks, significantly fortified CNA's balance sheet and, oh, yes, paid out about $2.5 billion of dividends in the past 5 years. 
Tom would be the first one to point out that there is still work to be done. However, the indisputable fact remains that Tom will leave CNA at a time when its capital competitive position and its brand have never been stronger. I want to thank Tom for his many contributions and wish him continued success as he moves on to the next chapter in his life.
And the good news for CNA continues with the arrival of Dino Robusto as the company's new CEO next month. Dino will take the helm on November 21 when his garden leave officially comes to an end. I'm confident that I speak for the rest of the CNA board when I say how much we look forward to working with Dino. The CNA that Dino inherits is poised for continued improvement and further value creation, and we fully believe that Dino and the CNA team will fulfill that potential.
Alas, all of life cannot be light and happiness. And with that in mind, let's move on to Diamond Offshore and the offshore drilling industry, where they are experiencing the aforementioned worst of time. It's clear that this industry is facing one of the sharpest downturns in its history, with canceled contracts, below operating cost day rates and customers seemingly unwilling to take advantage of these discounts. Despite the pain, Diamond Offshore's CEO, Marc Edwards, and his team continue to navigate these troubled waters with tireless focus, skill and determination. Just in the past few weeks, Marc has been in Singapore, Australia, Dubai, Rio de Janeiro and France, not to mention, New York and Houston, all in the quest of maintaining and generating business for Diamond Offshore.
And while the offshore drilling industry continues to operate in a depressed environment, the price of oil, the commodity to which the offshore drilling industry is most closely tied, seems to have begun its recovery. At the beginning of this year, oil dropped to about $27 a barrel, a new low in recent history. 2 weeks ago, oil was nearly double that price at almost $52 a barrel. And while oil prices may have partially recovered, day rates for offshore drilling rigs certainly have not. I'm hopeful that within the next several quarters, we'll start to see an uptick in the inquiries for offshore drilling rigs, a necessary precursor to improved day rates in the future.
While there are still many unknowns with regard to the oil and energy markets today, we have no doubt that Diamond Offshore will withstand this tough cyclical downturn. Diamond's innovative strategy, along with its financial strength, conservative capital management and stellar management team, should enable the company to emerge from this turbulent market cycle stronger and more resilient than ever.
Before I turn the call over to David Edelson, I wanted to mention that Jon Tisch has resumed the duties of CEO at Loews Hotels. Many of you may know that Kirk Kinsell has decided to leave the company. Loews Hotels is in strong shape, and the Loews Hotels team looks forward to building on the strong base already in place. The company is in great hands with Jon, who has been shepherding the expansion and strategic direction of Loews Hotels for the past 30 years. 
And now over to David."

For the third quarter, Loews reported net income of $327 million or $0.70 -- $0.97 per share as compared to net income of $182 million or $0.50 per share in last year's third quarter.

For the third quarter, Loews reported net income of $327 million or $0.70 -- $0.97 per share as compared to net income of $182 million or $0.50 per share in last year's third quarter. The year-over-year increase in our third quarter earnings came almost entirely from higher contributions from CNA Financial and from the parent company investment portfolio. 
Let me start by walking through the key drivers of our year-over-year quarterly improvement. For your information, these key drivers are set forth on Page 12 of our Q3 2016 earnings supplement, which can be found on loews.com. 
The first key driver was net investment income, both at the parent company and at CNA. The parent company portfolio generated a pretax gain of $36 million in Q3 2016 versus a pretax loss of $35 million last year. The gain was driven by alternative investments and gold-related equities, while last year's loss was primarily caused by equities, including gold-related equities and alternatives. The $71 million pretax improvement accounted for a $46 million after-tax improvement year-over-year.
At CNA, the year-over-year swing in net investment income of $170 million pretax was driven by LP investments, which swung from a $93 million pretax loss in Q3 2015 to a $65 million gain this past quarter. This $158 million pretax swing resulted in a $92 million increase in net income at the Loews level. 
The second key driver was a meaningful improvement in CNA's Life & Group segment, which swung from a $30 million after-tax loss in last year's third quarter to net operating income of $6 million this year. This $36 million year-over-year improvement was mostly attributable to the long-term care reserve unlocking at year-end 2015 that reset the underlying actuarial assumptions on the long-term care reserves. The turnaround in CNA's Life & Group segment accounted for a $32 million increase in net income at the Loews level.
The third key driver was realized investment gains and losses at CNA. CNA posted pretax realized gains of $46 million in Q3 2016 versus realized losses of $49 million in the last year's third quarter. This $95 million pretax improvement accounted for $56 million of the year-over-year increase in Loews's third quarter net income. 
The fourth and fifth key drivers partially offset the first 3 positives. CNA's P&C underwriting income was down year-over-year as CNA's combined ratio rose from 85.7 in Q3 2015 to 90.4 this past quarter. Let me pause and simply note that both of these combined ratios are extremely strong and result in substantial underwriting income.
As a reminder, underwriting income reflects earned premium less the sum of losses plus adjustment expenses and acquisition and underwriting expenses. While CNA's accident year loss ratio, including cat losses, was a solid 62.8 in both periods, the company booked 11 points of favorable prior year development last year against 8 points this year. Also, CNA incurred higher expenses attributable to both ongoing and nonrecurring costs. The combination of less favorable development and higher expenses caused CNA's P&C underwriting income to decline $73 million pretax year-over-year, accounting for a $43 million decline in net income at the Loews level. 
The last key driver was the substantial year-over-year fallouts in Diamond's operating results. With fewer working rigs and elevated unscheduled downtime, Diamond's contract drilling revenue declined 43% year-over-year, and its net income dropped to $14 million from $136 million in last year's third quarter. At the Loews level, Diamond's contribution to our net income fell $40 million from $47 million in Q3 2015 to $7 million this past quarter.
These 5 drivers -- net investment income, CNA's Life & Group segment, realized investment results at CNA, CNA's P&C underwriting income and Diamond's operating results -- netted to a positive $143 million after tax, essentially accounting for the $145 million year-over-year increase in Loews's third quarter net income.
Let me now briskly walk through our earnings by business segment. CNA contributed $308 million to our net income in Q3 2016, $281 million of net operating income and $27 million of realized investment gains. This compares to $161 million in the third quarter of 2015, net operating income of $190 million and $29 million of realized investment losses. As I've already mentioned, the key drivers of the net operating income improvement were net investment income, specifically returns on LP investments, and improved results in the Life & Group segment, partially offset by the decline in P&C underwriting income.
Before leaving CNA, I must highlight CNA's progress in generating underwriting profit. CNA posted a 90.4 combined ratio in the third quarter and 94.6 year-to-date. All 3 P&C businesses, specialty, commercial and international, posted sub-100 combined ratios in the quarter. As Jim noted, under Tom's leadership, CNA has made tremendous strides.
On to Diamond. Diamond contributed $7 million to our net income in Q3 2016, down from $47 million last year. Diamond itself posted net income of $14 million versus $136 million in Q3 2015. Let me remind you that in last year's third quarter, we wrote off $20 million of goodwill associated with our carrying value of Diamond. Without this goodwill charge, Diamond's contribution to our Q3 2015 net income would have been $67 million.
We have discussed the difficult conditions in the offshore drilling market previously, and Jim just mentioned them. And these conditions showed no signs of abating in the third quarter. Contract drilling revenues in Q3 were down 43% on a 44% decline in revenue-earning days. The bulk of the revenue decline was attributable to fewer rigs working this year versus last year. Additionally, the company experienced unscheduled downtime due to unanticipated customer and operational issues. 
I would note that Diamond continues to be the highest-rated company in the offshore drilling space. The company's liquidity position is solid, with $1.3 billion available today under its $1.5 billion revolving credit facility. No debt maturities until 2019 and no capital expenditure commitments for undelivered rates. 
Turning to Boardwalk. The company posted a strong third quarter as net revenues were up 6% year-over-year, EBITDA was up 9% and net income was up 23%. The main drivers of Boardwalk's strong revenue quarter, which flow through the EBITDA and net income, were favorable natural gas transportation, primarily from growth projects, and improved revenues from parking and lending and storage. Please note that a reconciliation of Boardwalk's EBITDA to its net income can be found in its Q3 earnings release.
Despite Boardwalk's strong quarter, you can see that its contribution to our net income declined by $4 million year-over-year. The reason is that in last year's third quarter, Loews benefited from a $6 million after-tax franchise tax refund related to Boardwalk. Excluding this nonrecurring item at the Loews level, Boardwalk's net income contribution was up $2 million from the prior year.
As you know, Boardwalk is undertaking various growth projects to position it for the future. The company recently placed into service 4 projects that represent approximately $320 million in CapEx. An additional $1.2 billion of projects are underway and expected to be placed into service between now and 2018. We are pleased that the 4 projects placed in service in 2016 came in approximately 9% below budget, reflecting management's keen focus on project execution.
Finally, S&P recently raised the issue-level ratings on Boardwalk's unsecured debt, including its revolving credit facility, from BB+ to BBB-. This means that all of Boardwalk's senior debt now carries investment-grade ratings from each of the major rating agencies. 
Let me now touch on Loews Hotels, which contributed net income of $3 million, up from $2 million in the third quarter of 2015. The company's adjusted EBITDA in Q3 was $37 million, up from $30 million in Q3 2015. A reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income can be found in our Q3 2016 earnings supplement. Contributing to the increase in adjusted EBITDA were improved results across the chain, including the Loews Regency New York and the Orlando properties, offset somewhat by muted results at the Loews Miami Beach Hotel, which is under renovation. Third quarter results were also negatively impacted by preopening expenses related to the new 1,000-room Loews Sapphire Falls in Orlando which opened in July.
Turning to the parent company. As previously mentioned, the parent company investment portfolio generated after-tax income of $24 million compared with a loss of $22 million in the prior year quarter. At quarter end, the parent company portfolio totaled $5 billion, broken down as follows: just over 60% in cash and short-term investments; 17% in limited partnership investments; another 9% in marketable equity securities; and the bulk of the remainder in fixed maturities. We maintain a large and liquid portfolio of cash and investments for 2 neutrally reinforcing reasons: to enable us to take advantage of opportunities when they present themselves; and to help mitigate risk during tough times.
Capital deployment opportunities can take such forms as acquiring new business is helping our subsidiaries pursue their strategies and repurchasing our shares. Our liquidity, combined with our relatively low level of parent company debt and the extended maturity schedule of that debt, give us valuable optionality and protection.
During the third quarter, we have received $74 million in dividends from our subsidiaries: $61 million from CNA and $13 million from Boardwalk. Year-to-date, we have received total dividends of $706 million combined from CNA and Boardwalk. Our share repurchase activity since last quarter has been modest. We repurchased 440,000 shares in July 1 through this past Friday, spending approximately $17 million. Year-to-date, we have spent approximately $115 million repurchasing 3 million shares. Average shares outstanding were 338 million in the third quarter, down 6.5% from 361 million in Q3 2015. 
And with that, I'll now hand the call back to Mary."

It's just there is no one factor that can fully describe or explain why does we buy or don't buy -- repurchase our shares. When we think about share repurchases, there are an enormous number of factors that go into the equation. There's the price of Loews. There's the price of our subsidiaries. There are the -- there's value that we ascribe to our non-public businesses. There are times when even if we want to buy the shares, for one reason or another, we're not allowed to repurchase the share. There is what's going on in the wider market, both the market for interest rates and the market for shares. And there's not just what's going on today, but our outlook for the future. So we put all of these factors and more into our own special computer, which is collectively the brains of a few people around here, and we discuss it and decide what to do with respect to share repurchases. Like acquisitions, the one thing -- the one factor that drives us in determining whether to repurchase shares or not is our assessment of how it will contribute to the intermediate- to long-term value for the remaining share -- Loews shareholders. So it's all a long way of saying that we look at lots and lots of factors in determining whether to purchase shares. And as I like to say, we have a long and glorious history of share repurchases, where we have, I think, 80% of the shares outstanding to -- sorry, 20% -- 30% of the shares outstanding today that we had in the '70s. And just since '07, we have purchased 40% of the shares outstanding in '07. So my advice: try not to make too much of what we do 1 quarter or 1 year. Look at the long-term picture because that's what we're looking at as well."

Or let me just talk about how we think about buying businesses for Loews. And our benchmark that we use is whether an acquisition would be accretive in terms of value over the intermediate to long term for our shareholders. As I've said before and I'll say again, there are things we do look at and other things that we don't look at. The things we don't look at are things where a bad CEO in the course of a year or 2 could cause tremendous damage to a business. So we tend not to look at retailing businesses. We tend not to look at businesses where technological disruption could be an important factor. We tend not to look at technology businesses where, if you miss one relatively quick cycle in terms of the technology, you could be out of business. So we're looking for businesses that we believe can stand the test of time and be with us for a long time to create value. We're also generally looking for businesses that are based here in the United States. They could have international operations, but we'd like them to be based here in the U.S. And as I said before, we kicked an awful lot of tires. We've gone down the path pretty far with a number of businesses. But in recent history, we haven't been able to close anything. When we think about buying businesses versus share repurchases, that's an important comparison that we make. We think about what is the future for Loews with the business and what would be the future of Loews without the business. And we think whether -- we think how compelling it is to repurchase shares at any point in time versus the value that we can get in buying a business that we don't already control. And we're also think very carefully about what we don't know concerning any business that we might buy. And we compare that to what we do know about our own businesses that we own and control with respect to share repurchases. There is no given formula that we use in assessing repurchases -- purchases of businesses just as there's no formula that we use in assessing whether to repurchase shares. But I would say that what we're doing is generally what any other portfolio manager does when they think about adding new securities to their portfolio. That's how I was trained. That's how a lot of people here were trained. And that's how we think about buying new businesses, repurchasing our own shares or investing in any of our individual businesses."

First of all, CNA stock -- CNA shares have moved up rather significantly, almost 20% in the past few months or quarters. And I ascribe that to the fact that people are starting to recognize that CNA is a changed company, that it's got underwriting discipline, all the things that I spoke about with respect to my comments about Tom and CNA. Additionally, I think a very important factor is that people are starting to see that the dividend that CNA has paid out, which is, for the past 2 years, at least have totaled $3 a share, makes it that at $30 a share, CNA was trading at a 10% yield, which is just too high a yield to be passed up. I think -- so I think that the 20% improvement over the past several quarters has been a recognition of those factors. I think a problem for people investing in CNA is that there is not significant liquidity. Loews owns 90% of CNA. We don't worry about the price from day to day, week to week or month to month. But the seeming lack of liquidity, I think, has kept a number of large purchasers from CNA. I think the other reason is that some people might be concerned about the long-term care book of business. I would say that we, at Loews, are very comfortable with it, but there's no doubt that some investors may be scared off a bit by it. The thing that I would say is that the long-term care book of business at CNA is being very aggressively managed in terms of the attention that it is -- the management attention that it is getting and the focus on the part of senior management. I think all that -- and who knows whatever factors may be out there that are affecting the overall valuation of CNA?"

The contrasting fortunes of CNA and Diamond Offshore are the proverbial corporate tale of 2 cities. Well, not exactly, but almost. While it may be the worst of times for Diamond and the offshore drilling industry; for CNA, we hope and expect to see even more improvement from its already stellar performance. Let's focus on the positive first and take a look at CNA and the commercial property casualty insurance market. 
CNA has come a long way since 2009 when Tom Motamed first took over as its CEO. Today, CNA is a consistently profitable insurance carrier with strong operating results and an intense focus on underwriting fundamentals. As previously announced, Tom will be retiring next month. And today marks his last CNA quarterly conference call, on which I made a surprise cameo appearance to sing his praises. I don't want to say that Tom took CNA from worst to first, but there certainly has been a vast improvement on his watch. And I think it's abundantly clear that this improvement is due to the herculean efforts of Tom and his team. While I could spend the entire call listing all of Tom's accomplishments, let's focus on just a few key highlights.
During his tenure, Tom has strengthened CNA's branch network, enhanced CNA's competitive position, dramatically upgraded CNA's talent, tremendously improved the commercial lines business, maintained specialty lines' preeminent market standing, mitigated operational and financial risks, significantly fortified CNA's balance sheet and, oh, yes, paid out about $2.5 billion of dividends in the past 5 years. 
Tom would be the first one to point out that there is still work to be done. However, the indisputable fact remains that Tom leaves CNA at a time when its capital, competitive position and its brand have never been stronger. I want to thank Tom for his many contributions and wish him continued success as he moves on to the next chapter in his life.
And the good news for CNA continues with the arrival of Dino Robusto as the company's new CEO next month. Dino will take the helm on November 21 when his garden leave officially comes to an end. I'm confident that I speak for the rest of the CNA board when I say how much we look forward to working with Dino. The CNA that Dino inherits is poised for continued improvement and further value creation, and we fully believe that Dino and the CNA team will fulfill that potential.
Alas, all of life cannot be light and happiness. And with that in mind, let's move on to Diamond Offshore and the offshore drilling industry, where they are experiencing the aforementioned worst of times. It's clear that this industry is facing one of the sharpest downturns in its history, with canceled contracts, below operating cost day rates and customers seemingly unwilling to take advantage of these discounts. Despite the pain, Diamond Offshore's CEO, Marc Edwards, and his team continue to navigate these troubled waters with tireless focus, skill and determination. Just in the past few weeks, Marc has been in Singapore, Australia, Dubai, Rio de Janeiro and France, not to mention, New York and Houston, all in the quest of maintaining and generating business for Diamond Offshore.
And while the offshore drilling industry continues to operate in a depressed environment, the price of oil, the commodity to which the offshore drilling industry is most closely tied, seems to have begun its recovery. At the beginning of this year, oil dropped to about $27 a barrel, a new low in recent history. 2 weeks ago, oil was nearly double that price at almost $52 a barrel. And while oil prices may have partially recovered, day rates for offshore drilling rigs certainly have not. I'm hopeful that within the next several quarters, we'll start to see an uptick in the inquiries for offshore drilling rigs, a necessary precursor to improved day rates in the future.
While there are still many unknowns with regard to the oil and energy markets today, we have no doubt that Diamond Offshore will withstand this tough cyclical downturn. Diamond's innovative strategy, along with its financial strength, conservative capital management and stellar management team, should enable the company to emerge from this turbulent market cycle stronger and more resilient than ever.
Before I turn the call over to David Edelson, I wanted to mention that Jon Tisch has resumed the duties of CEO of Loews Hotels. Many of you may know that Kirk Kinsell has decided to leave the company. Loews Hotels is in strong shape, and the Loews Hotels team looks forward to building on the strong base already in place. The company is in great hands with Jon, who has been shepherding the expansion and strategic direction of Loews Hotels for the past 30 years. 
And now over to David."
285930,404397142,1067422,"Loews Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 31, 2016",2016-10-31,"Earnings Calls","Loews Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning. For the third quarter, Loews reported net income of $327 million or $0.70 -- $0.97 per share as compared to net income of $182 million or $0.50 per share in last year's third quarter. The year-over-year increase in our th",1621,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning. For the third quarter, Loews reported net income of $327 million or $0.70 -- $0.97 per share as compared to net income of $182 million or $0.50 per share in last year's third quarter. The year-over-year increase in our third quarter earnings came almost entirely from higher contributions from CNA Financial and from the parent company investment portfolio. 
Let me start by walking through the key drivers of our year-over-year quarterly improvement. For your information, these key drivers are set forth on Page 12 of our Q3 2016 earnings supplement, which can be found on loews.com. 
The first key driver was net investment income, both at the parent company and at CNA. The parent company portfolio generated a pretax gain of $36 million in Q3 2016 versus a pretax loss of $35 million last year. The gain was driven by alternative investments and gold-related equities, while last year's loss was primarily caused by equities, including gold-related equities, and alternatives. The $71 million pretax improvement accounted for a $46 million after-tax improvement year-over-year.
At CNA, the year-over-year swing in net investment income of $170 million pretax was driven by LP investments, which swung from a $93 million pretax loss in Q3 2015 to a $65 million gain this past quarter. This $158 million pretax swing resulted in a $92 million increase in net income at the Loews level. 
The second key driver was a meaningful improvement in CNA's Life & Group segment, which swung from a $30 million after-tax loss in last year's third quarter to net operating income of $6 million this year. This $36 million year-over-year improvement was mostly attributable to the long-term care reserve unlocking at year-end 2015 that reset the underlying actuarial assumptions on the long-term care reserves. The turnaround in CNA's Life & Group segment accounted for a $32 million increase in net income at the Loews level.
The third key driver was realized investment gains and losses at CNA. CNA posted pretax realized gains of $46 million in Q3 2016 versus realized losses of $49 million in the last year's third quarter. This $95 million pretax improvement accounted for $56 million of the year-over-year increase in Loews's third quarter net income. 
The fourth and fifth key drivers partially offset the first 3 positives. CNA's P&C underwriting income was down year-over-year as CNA's combined ratio rose from 85.7 in Q3 2015 to 90.4 this past quarter. Let me pause and simply note that both of these combined ratios are extremely strong and result in substantial underwriting income.
As a reminder, underwriting income reflects earned premium less the sum of losses, loss adjustment expenses and acquisition and underwriting expenses. While CNA's accident year loss ratio, including cat losses, was a solid 62.8 in both periods, the company booked 11 points of favorable prior year development last year against 8 points this year. Also, CNA incurred higher expenses attributable to both ongoing and nonrecurring costs. The combination of less favorable development and higher expenses caused CNA's P&C underwriting income to decline $73 million pretax year-over-year, accounting for a $43 million decline in net income at the Loews level. 
The last key driver was the substantial year-over-year fallout in Diamond's operating results. With fewer working rigs and elevated unscheduled downtime, Diamond's contract drilling revenue declined 43% year-over-year, and its net income dropped to $14 million from $136 million in last year's third quarter. At the Loews level, Diamond's contribution to our net income fell $40 million from $47 million in Q3 2015 to $7 million this past quarter.
These 5 drivers -- net investment income, CNA's Life & Group segment, realized investment results at CNA, CNA's P&C underwriting income and Diamond's operating results -- netted to a positive $143 million after tax, essentially accounting for the $145 million year-over-year increase in Loews's third quarter net income.
Let me now briskly walk through our earnings by business segment. CNA contributed $308 million to our net income in Q3 2016, $281 million of net operating income and $27 million of realized investment gains. This compares to $161 million in the third quarter of 2015, net operating income of $190 million and $29 million of realized investment losses. As I've already mentioned, the key drivers of the net operating income improvement were net investment income, specifically returns on LP investments, and improved results in the Life & Group segment, partially offset by the decline in P&C underwriting income.
Before leaving CNA, I must highlight CNA's progress in generating underwriting profit. CNA posted a 90.4 combined ratio in the third quarter and 94.6 year-to-date. All 3 P&C businesses, specialty, commercial and international, posted sub-100 combined ratios in the quarter. As Jim noted, under Tom's leadership, CNA has made tremendous strides.
On to Diamond. Diamond contributed $7 million to our net income in Q3 2016, down from $47 million last year. Diamond itself posted net income of $14 million versus $136 million in Q3 2015. Let me remind you that in last year's third quarter, we wrote off $20 million of goodwill associated with our carrying value of Diamond. Without this goodwill charge, Diamond's contribution to our Q3 2015 net income would have been $67 million.
We have discussed the difficult conditions in the offshore drilling market previously, and Jim just mentioned them. And these conditions showed no signs of abating in the third quarter. Contract drilling revenues in Q3 were down 43% on a 44% decline in revenue-earning days. The bulk of the revenue decline was attributable to fewer rigs working this year versus last year. Additionally, the company experienced unscheduled downtime due to unanticipated customer and operational issues. 
I would note that Diamond continues to be the highest-rated company in the offshore drilling space. The company's liquidity position is solid, with $1.3 billion available today under its $1.5 billion revolving credit facility. No debt maturities until 2019 and no capital expenditure commitments for undelivered rigs. 
Turning to Boardwalk. The company posted a strong third quarter as net revenues were up 6% year-over-year, EBITDA was up 9% and net income was up 23%. The main drivers of Boardwalk's strong revenue quarter, which flowed through to EBITDA and net income, were favorable natural gas transportation, primarily from growth projects, and improved revenues from parking and lending and storage. Please note that a reconciliation of Boardwalk's EBITDA to its net income can be found in its Q3 earnings release.
Despite Boardwalk's strong quarter, you can see that its contribution to our net income declined by $4 million year-over-year. The reason is that in last year's third quarter, Loews benefited from a $6 million after-tax franchise tax refund related to Boardwalk. Excluding this nonrecurring item at the Loews level, Boardwalk's net income contribution was up $2 million from the prior year.
As you know, Boardwalk is undertaking various growth projects to position it for the future. The company recently placed into service 4 projects that represent approximately $320 million in CapEx. An additional $1.2 billion of projects are underway and expected to be placed into service between now and 2018. We are pleased that the 4 projects placed in service in 2016 came in approximately 9% below budget, reflecting management's keen focus on project execution.
Finally, S&P recently raised the issue-level ratings on Boardwalk's unsecured debt, including its revolving credit facility, from BB+ to BBB-. This means that all of Boardwalk's senior debt now carries investment-grade ratings from each of the major rating agencies. 
Let me now touch on Loews Hotels, which contributed net income of $3 million, up from $2 million in the third quarter of 2015. The company's adjusted EBITDA in Q3 was $37 million, up from $30 million in Q3 2015. A reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income can be found in our Q3 2016 earnings supplement. Contributing to the increase in adjusted EBITDA were improved results across the chain, including the Loews Regency New York and the Orlando properties, offset somewhat by muted results at the Loews Miami Beach Hotel, which is under renovation. Third quarter results were also negatively impacted by preopening expenses related to the new 1,000-room Loews Sapphire Falls in Orlando which opened in July.
Turning to the parent company. As previously mentioned, the parent company investment portfolio generated after-tax income of $24 million compared with a loss of $22 million in the prior year quarter. At quarter end, the parent company portfolio totaled $5 billion, broken down as follows: just over 60% in cash and short-term investments; 17% in limited partnership investments; another 9% in marketable equity securities; and the bulk of the remainder in fixed maturities. We maintain a large and liquid portfolio of cash and investments for 2 neutrally reinforcing reasons: to enable us to take advantage of opportunities when they present themselves; and to help mitigate risk during tough times.
Capital deployment opportunities can take such forms as acquiring new businesses, helping our subsidiaries pursue their strategies and repurchasing our shares. Our liquidity, combined with our relatively low level of parent company debt and the extended maturity schedule of that debt, give us valuable optionality and protection.
During the third quarter, we have received $74 million in dividends from our subsidiaries: $61 million from CNA and $13 million from Boardwalk. Year-to-date, we have received total dividends of $706 million combined from CNA and Boardwalk. Our share repurchase activity since last quarter has been modest. We repurchased 440,000 shares from July 1 through this past Friday, spending approximately $17 million. Year-to-date, we have spent approximately $115 million repurchasing 3 million shares. Average shares outstanding were 338 million in the third quarter, down 6.5% from 361 million in Q3 2015. 
And with that, I'll now hand the call back to Mary."

It's just there is no one factor that can fully describe or explain why it is we buy or don't buy -- repurchase our shares. When we think about share repurchases, there are an enormous number of factors that go into the equation. There's the price of Loews. There's the price of our subsidiaries. There are the -- there's value that we ascribe to our non-public businesses. There are times when even if we want to buy in the shares, for one reason or another, we're not allowed to repurchase the shares. There is what's going on in the wider market, both the market for interest rates and the market for shares. And there's not just what's going on today, but our outlook for the future. So we put all of these factors and more into our own special computer, which is collectively the brains of a few people around here, and we discuss it and decide what to do with respect to share repurchases. Like acquisitions, the one thing -- the one factor that drives us in determining whether to repurchase shares or not is our assessment of how it will contribute to the intermediate- to long-term value for the remaining share -- Loews shareholders. So it's all a long way of saying that we look at lots and lots of factors in determining whether to purchase shares. And as I like to say, we have a long and glorious history of share repurchases, where we have, I think, 80% of the shares outstanding to -- sorry, 20% -- 30% of the shares outstanding today that we had in the '70s. And just since '07, we have purchased 40% of the shares outstanding in '07. So my advice: try not to make too much of what we do 1 quarter or 1 year. Look at the long-term picture because that's what we're looking at as well."

Or let me just talk about how we think about buying businesses for Loews. And our benchmark that we use is whether an acquisition would be accretive in terms of value over the intermediate to long term for all our shareholders. As I've said before and I'll say again, there are things we do look at and other things that we don't look at. The things we don't look at are things where a bad CEO in the course of a year or 2 could cause tremendous damage to a business. So we tend not to look at retailing businesses. We tend not to look at businesses where technological disruption could be an important factor. We tend not to look at technology businesses where, if you miss one relatively quick cycle in terms of the technology, you could be out of business. So we're looking for businesses that we believe can stand the test of time and be with us for a long time to create value. We're also generally looking for businesses that are based here in the United States. They could have international operations, but we'd like them to be based here in the U.S. And as I said before, we've kicked an awful lot of tires. We've gone down the path pretty far with a number of businesses. But in recent history, we haven't been able to close anything. When we think about buying businesses versus share repurchases, that's an important comparison that we make. We think about what is the future for Loews with the business and what would be the future of Loews without the business. And we think whether -- we think how compelling it is to repurchase shares at any point in time versus the value that we can get in buying a business that we don't already control. And we're also -- think very carefully about what we don't know concerning any business that we might buy. And we compare that to what we do know about our own businesses that we own and control with respect to share repurchases. There is no given formula that we use in assessing repurchases -- purchases of businesses just as there's no formula that we use in assessing whether to repurchase shares. But I would say that what we're doing is generally what any other portfolio manager does when they think about adding new securities to their portfolio. That's how I was trained. That's how a lot of people here were trained. And that's how we think about buying new businesses, repurchasing our own shares or investing in any of our individual businesses."

First of all, CNA stock -- CNA shares have moved up rather significantly, almost 20% in the past few months or quarters. And I ascribe that to the fact that people are starting to recognize that CNA is a changed company, that it's got underwriting discipline, all the things that I spoke about with respect to my comments about Tom and CNA. Additionally, I think a very important factor is that people are starting to see that the dividend that CNA has paid out, which is -- for the past 2 years, at least, have totaled $3 a share, makes it that at $30 a share, CNA was trading at a 10% yield, which is just too high a yield to be passed up. I think -- so I think that the 20% improvement over the past several quarters has been a recognition of those factors. I think a problem for people investing in CNA is that there is not significant liquidity. Loews owns 90% of CNA. We don't worry about the price from day to day, week to week or month to month. But the seeming lack of liquidity, I think, has kept a number of large purchasers from CNA. I think the other reason is that some people might be concerned about the long-term care book of business. I would say that we, at Loews, are very comfortable with it, but there's no doubt that some investors may be scared off a bit by it. The thing that I would say is that the long-term care book of business at CNA is being very aggressively managed in terms of the attention that it is -- the management attention that it is getting and the focus on the part of senior management. I think all that -- and who knows whatever factors may be out there that are affecting the overall valuation of CNA."

The contrasting fortunes of CNA and Diamond Offshore are the proverbial corporate tale of 2 cities. Well, not exactly, but almost. While it may be the worst of times for Diamond and the offshore drilling industry; for CN",810,"Thank you, Mary, and good morning. The contrasting fortunes of CNA and Diamond Offshore are the proverbial corporate tale of 2 cities. Well, not exactly, but almost. While it may be the worst of times for Diamond and the offshore drilling industry; for CNA, we hope and expect to see even more improvement from its already stellar performance. Let's focus on the positive first and take a look at CNA and the commercial property casualty insurance market. 
CNA has come a long way since 2009 when Tom Motamed first took over as its CEO. Today, CNA is a consistently profitable insurance carrier with strong operating results and an intense focus on underwriting fundamentals. As previously announced, Tom will be retiring next month. And today marks his last CNA quarterly conference call, on which I made a surprise cameo appearance to sing his praises. I don't want to say that Tom took CNA from worst to first, but there certainly has been a vast improvement on his watch. And I think it's abundantly clear that this improvement is due to the herculean efforts of Tom and his team. While I could spend the entire call listing all of Tom's accomplishments, let's focus on just a few key highlights.
During his tenure, Tom has strengthened CNA's branch network, enhanced CNA's competitive position, dramatically upgraded CNA's talent, tremendously improved the commercial lines business, maintained specialty lines' preeminent market standing, mitigated operational and financial risks, significantly fortified CNA's balance sheet and, oh, yes, paid out about $2.5 billion of dividends in the past 5 years. 
Tom would be the first one to point out that there is still work to be done. However, the indisputable fact remains that Tom leaves CNA at a time when its capital, competitive position and its brand have never been stronger. I want to thank Tom for his many contributions and wish him continued success as he moves on to the next chapter in his life.
And the good news for CNA continues with the arrival of Dino Robusto as the company's new CEO next month. Dino will take the helm on November 21 when his garden leave officially comes to an end. I'm confident that I speak for the rest of the CNA board when I say how much we look forward to working with Dino. The CNA that Dino inherits is poised for continued improvement and further value creation, and we fully believe that Dino and the CNA team will fulfill that potential.
Alas, all of life cannot be light and happiness. And with that in mind, let's move on to Diamond Offshore and the offshore drilling industry, where they are experiencing the aforementioned worst of times. It's clear that this industry is facing one of the sharpest downturns in its history, with canceled contracts, below operating cost day rates and customers seemingly unwilling to take advantage of these discounts. Despite the pain, Diamond Offshore's CEO, Marc Edwards, and his team continue to navigate these troubled waters with tireless focus, skill and determination. Just in the past few weeks, Marc has been in Singapore, Australia, Dubai, Rio de Janeiro and France, not to mention, New York and Houston, all in the quest of maintaining and generating business for Diamond Offshore.
And while the offshore drilling industry continues to operate in a depressed environment, the price of oil, the commodity to which the offshore drilling industry is most closely tied, seems to have begun its recovery. At the beginning of this year, oil dropped to about $27 a barrel, a new low in recent history. 2 weeks ago, oil was nearly double that price at almost $52 a barrel. And while oil prices may have partially recovered, day rates for offshore drilling rigs certainly have not. I'm hopeful that within the next several quarters, we'll start to see an uptick in the inquiries for offshore drilling rigs, a necessary precursor to improved day rates in the future.
While there are still many unknowns with regard to the oil and energy markets today, we have no doubt that Diamond Offshore will withstand this tough cyclical downturn. Diamond's innovative strategy, along with its financial strength, conservative capital management and stellar management team, should enable the company to emerge from this turbulent market cycle stronger and more resilient than ever.
Before I turn the call over to David Edelson, I wanted to mention that Jon Tisch has resumed the duties of CEO of Loews Hotels. Many of you may know that Kirk Kinsell has decided to leave the company. Loews Hotels is in strong shape, and the Loews Hotels team looks forward to building on the strong base already in place. The company is in great hands with Jon, who has been shepherding the expansion and strategic direction of Loews Hotels for the past 30 years. 
And now over to David."

For the third quarter, Loews reported net income of $327 million or $0.70 -- $0.97 per share as compared to net income of $182 million or $0.50 per share in last year's third quarter. The year-over-year increase in our th",1621,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning. For the third quarter, Loews reported net income of $327 million or $0.70 -- $0.97 per share as compared to net income of $182 million or $0.50 per share in last year's third quarter. The year-over-year increase in our third quarter earnings came almost entirely from higher contributions from CNA Financial and from the parent company investment portfolio. 
Let me start by walking through the key drivers of our year-over-year quarterly improvement. For your information, these key drivers are set forth on Page 12 of our Q3 2016 earnings supplement, which can be found on loews.com. 
The first key driver was net investment income, both at the parent company and at CNA. The parent company portfolio generated a pretax gain of $36 million in Q3 2016 versus a pretax loss of $35 million last year. The gain was driven by alternative investments and gold-related equities, while last year's loss was primarily caused by equities, including gold-related equities, and alternatives. The $71 million pretax improvement accounted for a $46 million after-tax improvement year-over-year.
At CNA, the year-over-year swing in net investment income of $170 million pretax was driven by LP investments, which swung from a $93 million pretax loss in Q3 2015 to a $65 million gain this past quarter. This $158 million pretax swing resulted in a $92 million increase in net income at the Loews level. 
The second key driver was a meaningful improvement in CNA's Life & Group segment, which swung from a $30 million after-tax loss in last year's third quarter to net operating income of $6 million this year. This $36 million year-over-year improvement was mostly attributable to the long-term care reserve unlocking at year-end 2015 that reset the underlying actuarial assumptions on the long-term care reserves. The turnaround in CNA's Life & Group segment accounted for a $32 million increase in net income at the Loews level.
The third key driver was realized investment gains and losses at CNA. CNA posted pretax realized gains of $46 million in Q3 2016 versus realized losses of $49 million in the last year's third quarter. This $95 million pretax improvement accounted for $56 million of the year-over-year increase in Loews's third quarter net income. 
The fourth and fifth key drivers partially offset the first 3 positives. CNA's P&C underwriting income was down year-over-year as CNA's combined ratio rose from 85.7 in Q3 2015 to 90.4 this past quarter. Let me pause and simply note that both of these combined ratios are extremely strong and result in substantial underwriting income.
As a reminder, underwriting income reflects earned premium less the sum of losses, loss adjustment expenses and acquisition and underwriting expenses. While CNA's accident year loss ratio, including cat losses, was a solid 62.8 in both periods, the company booked 11 points of favorable prior year development last year against 8 points this year. Also, CNA incurred higher expenses attributable to both ongoing and nonrecurring costs. The combination of less favorable development and higher expenses caused CNA's P&C underwriting income to decline $73 million pretax year-over-year, accounting for a $43 million decline in net income at the Loews level. 
The last key driver was the substantial year-over-year fallout in Diamond's operating results. With fewer working rigs and elevated unscheduled downtime, Diamond's contract drilling revenue declined 43% year-over-year, and its net income dropped to $14 million from $136 million in last year's third quarter. At the Loews level, Diamond's contribution to our net income fell $40 million from $47 million in Q3 2015 to $7 million this past quarter.
These 5 drivers -- net investment income, CNA's Life & Group segment, realized investment results at CNA, CNA's P&C underwriting income and Diamond's operating results -- netted to a positive $143 million after tax, essentially accounting for the $145 million year-over-year increase in Loews's third quarter net income.
Let me now briskly walk through our earnings by business segment. CNA contributed $308 million to our net income in Q3 2016, $281 million of net operating income and $27 million of realized investment gains. This compares to $161 million in the third quarter of 2015, net operating income of $190 million and $29 million of realized investment losses. As I've already mentioned, the key drivers of the net operating income improvement were net investment income, specifically returns on LP investments, and improved results in the Life & Group segment, partially offset by the decline in P&C underwriting income.
Before leaving CNA, I must highlight CNA's progress in generating underwriting profit. CNA posted a 90.4 combined ratio in the third quarter and 94.6 year-to-date. All 3 P&C businesses, specialty, commercial and international, posted sub-100 combined ratios in the quarter. As Jim noted, under Tom's leadership, CNA has made tremendous strides.
On to Diamond. Diamond contributed $7 million to our net income in Q3 2016, down from $47 million last year. Diamond itself posted net income of $14 million versus $136 million in Q3 2015. Let me remind you that in last year's third quarter, we wrote off $20 million of goodwill associated with our carrying value of Diamond. Without this goodwill charge, Diamond's contribution to our Q3 2015 net income would have been $67 million.
We have discussed the difficult conditions in the offshore drilling market previously, and Jim just mentioned them. And these conditions showed no signs of abating in the third quarter. Contract drilling revenues in Q3 were down 43% on a 44% decline in revenue-earning days. The bulk of the revenue decline was attributable to fewer rigs working this year versus last year. Additionally, the company experienced unscheduled downtime due to unanticipated customer and operational issues. 
I would note that Diamond continues to be the highest-rated company in the offshore drilling space. The company's liquidity position is solid, with $1.3 billion available today under its $1.5 billion revolving credit facility. No debt maturities until 2019 and no capital expenditure commitments for undelivered rigs. 
Turning to Boardwalk. The company posted a strong third quarter as net revenues were up 6% year-over-year, EBITDA was up 9% and net income was up 23%. The main drivers of Boardwalk's strong revenue quarter, which flowed through to EBITDA and net income, were favorable natural gas transportation, primarily from growth projects, and improved revenues from parking and lending and storage. Please note that a reconciliation of Boardwalk's EBITDA to its net income can be found in its Q3 earnings release.
Despite Boardwalk's strong quarter, you can see that its contribution to our net income declined by $4 million year-over-year. The reason is that in last year's third quarter, Loews benefited from a $6 million after-tax franchise tax refund related to Boardwalk. Excluding this nonrecurring item at the Loews level, Boardwalk's net income contribution was up $2 million from the prior year.
As you know, Boardwalk is undertaking various growth projects to position it for the future. The company recently placed into service 4 projects that represent approximately $320 million in CapEx. An additional $1.2 billion of projects are underway and expected to be placed into service between now and 2018. We are pleased that the 4 projects placed in service in 2016 came in approximately 9% below budget, reflecting management's keen focus on project execution.
Finally, S&P recently raised the issue-level ratings on Boardwalk's unsecured debt, including its revolving credit facility, from BB+ to BBB-. This means that all of Boardwalk's senior debt now carries investment-grade ratings from each of the major rating agencies. 
Let me now touch on Loews Hotels, which contributed net income of $3 million, up from $2 million in the third quarter of 2015. The company's adjusted EBITDA in Q3 was $37 million, up from $30 million in Q3 2015. A reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income can be found in our Q3 2016 earnings supplement. Contributing to the increase in adjusted EBITDA were improved results across the chain, including the Loews Regency New York and the Orlando properties, offset somewhat by muted results at the Loews Miami Beach Hotel, which is under renovation. Third quarter results were also negatively impacted by preopening expenses related to the new 1,000-room Loews Sapphire Falls in Orlando which opened in July.
Turning to the parent company. As previously mentioned, the parent company investment portfolio generated after-tax income of $24 million compared with a loss of $22 million in the prior year quarter. At quarter end, the parent company portfolio totaled $5 billion, broken down as follows: just over 60% in cash and short-term investments; 17% in limited partnership investments; another 9% in marketable equity securities; and the bulk of the remainder in fixed maturities. We maintain a large and liquid portfolio of cash and investments for 2 neutrally reinforcing reasons: to enable us to take advantage of opportunities when they present themselves; and to help mitigate risk during tough times.
Capital deployment opportunities can take such forms as acquiring new businesses, helping our subsidiaries pursue their strategies and repurchasing our shares. Our liquidity, combined with our relatively low level of parent company debt and the extended maturity schedule of that debt, give us valuable optionality and protection.
During the third quarter, we have received $74 million in dividends from our subsidiaries: $61 million from CNA and $13 million from Boardwalk. Year-to-date, we have received total dividends of $706 million combined from CNA and Boardwalk. Our share repurchase activity since last quarter has been modest. We repurchased 440,000 shares from July 1 through this past Friday, spending approximately $17 million. Year-to-date, we have spent approximately $115 million repurchasing 3 million shares. Average shares outstanding were 338 million in the third quarter, down 6.5% from 361 million in Q3 2015. 
And with that, I'll now hand the call back to Mary."

It's just there is no one factor that can fully describe or explain why it is we buy or don't buy -- repurchase our shares. When we think about share repurchases, there are an enormous number of factors that go into the equation. There's the price of Loews. There's the price of our subsidiaries. There are the -- there's value that we ascribe to our non-public businesses. There are times when even if we want to buy in the shares, for one reason or another, we're not allowed to repurchase the shares. There is what's going on in the wider market, both the market for interest rates and the market for shares. And there's not just what's going on today, but our outlook for the future. So we put all of these factors and more into our own special computer, which is collectively the brains of a few people around here, and we discuss it and decide what to do with respect to share repurchases. Like acquisitions, the one thing -- the one factor that drives us in determining whether to repurchase shares or not is our assessment of how it will contribute to the intermediate- to long-term value for the remaining share -- Loews shareholders. So it's all a long way of saying that we look at lots and lots of factors in determining whether to purchase shares. And as I like to say, we have a long and glorious history of share repurchases, where we have, I think, 80% of the shares outstanding to -- sorry, 20% -- 30% of the shares outstanding today that we had in the '70s. And just since '07, we have purchased 40% of the shares outstanding in '07. So my advice: try not to make too much of what we do 1 quarter or 1 year. Look at the long-term picture because that's what we're looking at as well."

Or let me just talk about how we think about buying businesses for Loews. And our benchmark that we use is whether an acquisition would be accretive in terms of value over the intermediate to long term for all our shareholders. As I've said before and I'll say again, there are things we do look at and other things that we don't look at. The things we don't look at are things where a bad CEO in the course of a year or 2 could cause tremendous damage to a business. So we tend not to look at retailing businesses. We tend not to look at businesses where technological disruption could be an important factor. We tend not to look at technology businesses where, if you miss one relatively quick cycle in terms of the technology, you could be out of business. So we're looking for businesses that we believe can stand the test of time and be with us for a long time to create value. We're also generally looking for businesses that are based here in the United States. They could have international operations, but we'd like them to be based here in the U.S. And as I said before, we've kicked an awful lot of tires. We've gone down the path pretty far with a number of businesses. But in recent history, we haven't been able to close anything. When we think about buying businesses versus share repurchases, that's an important comparison that we make. We think about what is the future for Loews with the business and what would be the future of Loews without the business. And we think whether -- we think how compelling it is to repurchase shares at any point in time versus the value that we can get in buying a business that we don't already control. And we're also -- think very carefully about what we don't know concerning any business that we might buy. And we compare that to what we do know about our own businesses that we own and control with respect to share repurchases. There is no given formula that we use in assessing repurchases -- purchases of businesses just as there's no formula that we use in assessing whether to repurchase shares. But I would say that what we're doing is generally what any other portfolio manager does when they think about adding new securities to their portfolio. That's how I was trained. That's how a lot of people here were trained. And that's how we think about buying new businesses, repurchasing our own shares or investing in any of our individual businesses."

First of all, CNA stock -- CNA shares have moved up rather significantly, almost 20% in the past few months or quarters. And I ascribe that to the fact that people are starting to recognize that CNA is a changed company, that it's got underwriting discipline, all the things that I spoke about with respect to my comments about Tom and CNA. Additionally, I think a very important factor is that people are starting to see that the dividend that CNA has paid out, which is -- for the past 2 years, at least, have totaled $3 a share, makes it that at $30 a share, CNA was trading at a 10% yield, which is just too high a yield to be passed up. I think -- so I think that the 20% improvement over the past several quarters has been a recognition of those factors. I think a problem for people investing in CNA is that there is not significant liquidity. Loews owns 90% of CNA. We don't worry about the price from day to day, week to week or month to month. But the seeming lack of liquidity, I think, has kept a number of large purchasers from CNA. I think the other reason is that some people might be concerned about the long-term care book of business. I would say that we, at Loews, are very comfortable with it, but there's no doubt that some investors may be scared off a bit by it. The thing that I would say is that the long-term care book of business at CNA is being very aggressively managed in terms of the attention that it is -- the management attention that it is getting and the focus on the part of senior management. I think all that -- and who knows whatever factors may be out there that are affecting the overall valuation of CNA."
