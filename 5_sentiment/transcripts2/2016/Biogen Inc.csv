In 2015, Biogen generated revenues of $10.8 billion, an 11% increase over 2014 and non-GAAP EPS of $17.01, a 23% increase over 2014.

In 2015, Biogen generated revenues of $10.8 billion, an 11% increase over 2014 and non-GAAP EPS of $17.01, a 23% increase over 2014. Although the revenues were less than we had anticipated at the beginning of last year, I'm pleased that we were able to take appropriate action in the second half of the year to maintain healthy earnings growth while we continue to advise the potentially transformative therapies in our pipeline. 
TECFIDERA's demand has been stable in the U.S., and combined with growth in Europe, we expect TECFIDERA to continue to try for global leadership in multiple sclerosis. TECFIDERA is now not only the most prescribed oral MS therapy worldwide, it is also the most prescribed of all MS therapies in Germany, France and the U.K. Overall, more than 170,000 patients have been treated with TECFIDERA. 
Our hemophilia products, ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX, generated over $0.5 billion of revenue in their first full year on the market in the U.S. In November, the European Commission approved ELOCTA for the treatment of hemophilia A in the EU, which we believe will help to contribute growth in hemophilia this year, as our collaboration partner, Sobi, commercializes ELOCTA in additional markets. 
We also made progress in business development. We acquired Convergence Pharmaceuticals and Raxatrigine compound. Raxatrigine is an oral small molecule 1.7 blocker with promising Phase II data that will move into Phase III this year. We licensed Amiselimod, or MT-1303, for Mitsubishi Pharma, a late-stage S1P1 inhibitor for ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. We entered into a collaboration agreement with EGTC to develop gene-based therapies for multiple ophthalmic diseases. And this month, BENEPALI was approved in the EU. BENEPALI, the first biosimilar approved in the EU, is the first of 3 potential anti-TNFs to advance under our Samsung Bioepis joint venture with Samsung Biologics. Under our agreements with Samsung Bioepis, we will manufacture and commercialize BENEPALI in the EU. 
Meanwhile, we continued investing in 2015. We purchased land in Switzerland, and this Friday, January 29, we'll break ground on an advanced next-generation biologics manufacturing facility there. And we purchased a drug product manufacturing facility and supporting infrastructure in Research Triangle North Carolina. We also took actions to return capital and change the capital structure of the business. We fully implemented our $5 billion share repurchase program, and a portion of that repurchase was funded through the $6 billion debt offering that we completed in September. 
In R&D, we moved forward several exciting mid- and late-stage assets in our pipeline. It may seem like a long time ago now, but it was Q1 2015 that we presented the aducanumab data showing a statistically significant removal of pack and slowing of cognitive decline in Alzheimer's patients. We presented data suggesting that our anti-LINGO antibody is biologically active in remyelination, and the Phase II data for [indiscernible], generated by our partner Ionis, looks increasingly encouraging as a potential therapy for spinal muscular atrophy. We also initiated Phase I trials in ALS and Parkinson's disease. 
Al will discuss the many advances we made our pipeline in more detail, but I think this progress is a testament to our commitment to patients and our world-class capabilities across the breadth of R&D. 
We also continued to threaten our early-stage clinical and research capabilities. We bolstered research talent in our neuroscience group and established collaborations with first-rate academic centers around the world. As a result, I believe we're now in a better position than ever to both discovery novel therapies and accelerate drug development while minimizing risk. 
Lastly, summarizing 2015 would not be complete without commenting on the restructuring we implemented in October. Although it was a difficult decision, we've already seen positive results from the steps that we took. With the majority of the restructuring now completed, there's a palpable, reinvigorated focus on our key commercial initiatives and high-potential pipeline candidates, and our operating expenses are trending at a rate that we believe can continue to provide healthy earnings leverage going forward. 
So all in all, it was a busy and eventful year, and we believe that the progress we made and actions that lead positioned us well for a potentially transformative 2016 and beyond. 
With that, I'll pass the call along to Al for an update on R&D."

We advanced the next wave of potential medicines through the pipeline, added important assets through business development and acquisitions and expanded our research leadership by hiring world-class scientists. I believe our pipeline and our organization are stronger than they have ever been. 
Starting with Alzheimer's disease. Last year, we presented compelling interim Phase I data for aducanumab, the first investigational drug for Alzheimer's disease to demonstrate both the statistically significant reduction of amyloid plaque as well as slowing of cognitive decline. In August, we began enrolling patients into 2 pivotal Phase III trials of aducanumab in early Alzheimer's disease. We are pleased with the progress of these studies but recognize the inherent challenges in recruiting patients with early Alzheimer's disease and the limited availability of PET scanners. Fortunately, owing to the strong results from our clinical trials to date, there has been substantial interest in the program, which we believe has helped with recruitment. that said, we continue to anticipate that the Phase III enrollment duration will be similar to other large clinical trials in Alzheimer's disease. Looking ahead, in the second half of 2016, we expect to share additional safety data from the ongoing titration arms of the Phase Ib prime study for aducanumab. 
Our other 2 mid-stage clinical candidates for AD that are partnered with [indiscernible] continued to advance. [indiscernible] had indicated that they anticipate releasing interim safety data this year for E2609, a small molecule-based one inhibitor. And we are also expecting to see top line efficacy and safety data for Ban 2401, a monoclonal antibody targeting beta-amyloid. 
Moving to anti-LINGO. You may recall that last year, we presented Phase II data in acute optic neuritis. To our knowledge, this was the first clinical trial to show evidence of remyelination following an acute inflammatory demyelinating injury in humans. And we believe that these results support our ongoing development efforts. Our Phase II synergy study in MS is a 418-patient, double-blind, multicenter study assessing 4 doses of anti-LINGO versus placebo when added to Interferon beta therapy. It utilizes a composite endpoint comprising outcome measures of disability, cognition and physical function. We believe that a separation from placebo on any of these measures could be clinically meaningful. We are also looking at imaging endpoints that reflect the integrity of myelinated nerve fibers. Any differences in treatment effect between preexisting and newly acquired lesions will also be of interest. We believe that the robust design of this clinical trial will enable a better understanding of the therapy's potential in MS. An if the results are positive, the trial should provide valuable insight into the design of our Phase III program. Results for synergy are anticipated in mid-2016. 
Now turning to nusinersen. Our partner, Ionis, recently completed target enrollment of the Phase III study in children with child onset SMA. And by the first half of this year, we hope to complete enrollment in [indiscernible], the Phase III study evaluating nusinersen in infants with infantile onset SMA. This progress sets the stage for data -- from both of these rails to be available in the first half of 2017. Whereas the data from the early-stage open-label clinical trials are encouraging when compared to data from natural history studies, the well-controlled Phase III studies are designed to definitively assess the safety and efficacy of nusinersen. 
We are meeting frequently with regulators from Europe, Japan and the United States with the goal of making the drug available to SMA patients as rapidly as possible. 
Moving on to our hemophilia therapies. Last month, at the 57th American Society of Hematology annual meeting, we presented new data demonstrating that ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX effectively managed bleeding into joints and maintained low annualized bleeding rates in people with severe hemophilia A and B, reaffirming the benefits of these 2 therapies. In addition, teams from the University of Pittsburgh, the Hemophilia Center of Western Pennsylvania and the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center presented data showing that immune tolerance induction using ELOCTATE was successful in 3 children with inhibitors, including a child previously failing recombinant Factor 8 immune tolerance induction. The time to  achieving tolerance in the study was 4 to 12 weeks, which appears to be significantly shorter than with the standard of practice, which can take several months to several years. 
During the quarter, we, in collaboration with Ionis, also announced the initiation of a Phase I/II clinical study of an antisense drug against superoxide dismutase, or SOD1, in patients with [indiscernible] lateral sclerosis. I am pleased to announce that last week, we dosed our first patient in the trial. Mutations in the SOD1 gene result in the second most common form of familial ALS, affecting approximately 2% of all ALS patients. 
We also continue to make excellent progress toward initiating multiple late-stage clinical trials in 2016. Next month, we anticipate sharing additional Phase II study results for TYSABRI in acute ischemic stroke at the International Stroke Conference in Los Angeles. While single dose administered -- of natalizumab administered up to 9 hours after stroke onset did not reduce focal infarct volume, treatment was associated with meaningful improvements in clinical outcomes over the course of 90 days. 
The clinical profile and treatment window supports further investigation of natalizumab as a potential novel approach for treating acute ischemic stroke, and we intend to conduct a Phase IIb trial. 
Amiselimod, or MT-1303, an S1P1 inhibitor for inflammatory bowel disease, is anticipated to advance to Phase III trials this year. In the second half of the year, we plan to initiate Phase III studies for both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. We currently have no plans for the asset in MS but expect to continue to evaluate other options for the molecule in collaboration with our partner, Mitsubishi Tanabe. 
Raxatrigine, a small molecule inhibitor of the Nav 1.7 sodium channel, is in development for several pain indications. In the second half of the year, we anticipate initiating a Phase III trial to confirm the efficacy of Raxatrigine in patients with trigeminal neuralgia. We also plan to initiate a Phase II trial in patients with sciatica later this year. 
I'll now pass the call over to Paul."

Our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $3.77 in the fourth quarter and $15.34 for the full year. Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $4.50 in the fourth quarter and $17.01 for the full year. Total revenue for Q4 grew 8% year-over-year to approximately $2.8 billion and grew 11% for the full year to $10.8 billion. 
Foreign exchange, offset by hedging, weakened fourth quarter revenue by approximately $35 million versus prior year and by approximately $227 million for the full year versus prior year. 
Global Q4 TECFIDERA revenue was $993 million. We recorded revenues of $785 million in the U.S. and $208 million outside the U.S. TECFIDERA U.S. revenue benefited from an increase in wholesale inventory by approximately $30 million versus prior quarter. At this point, we believe TECFIDERA's safety perceptions in physician intend to prescribe has largely stabilized in the U.S. We're seeing positive leading indicators for the recently launched marketing campaign for TECFIDERA, including increased visits to our website and higher call volume into our patient services organization. In Europe, TECFIDERA continued its trend of solid patient growth this quarter, especially in more recently launched markets such as the U.K., Italy and Spain. The European label for TECFIDERA was updated in December, and we're actively educating physicians on appropriate patient monitoring. For the full year, worldwide TECFIDERA revenues were $3.6 billion, consisting of $2.9 billion in the U.S. and $730 million in sales outside the U.S. 
Foreign exchange impact, offset by hedging, weakened full year TECFIDERA revenue by approximately $27 million versus prior year. 
Interferon revenues, including both Avonex and PLEGRIDY, were $740 million during the fourth quarter, which includes $506 million in the U.S. and $233 million in sales outside the U.S. For the full year, worldwide Interferon revenues were $3 billion, consisting of $2 billion in the U.S. and $951 million in sales outside the U.S. Foreign exchange impact, offset by hedging, weakened full year Interferon revenues by approximately $88 million versus prior year. 
TYSABRI continued to add patients this quarter, with worldwide revenues of $481 million. These results were comprised of $278 million in the U.S. and $203 million internationally. For the full year, worldwide TYSABRI revenues were approximately $1.9 billion. We recorded U.S. revenue of $1.1 billion and $783 million internationally. Foreign exchange impact, offset by hedging, weakened full year revenue for TYSABRI by approximately $90 million versus prior year. 
Physicians continue to choose TYSABRI for patients requiring high efficacy, and nearly 10 years after approval, we believe its well-understood safeties profile positions TYSABRI. 
Turning to hemophilia business. ELOCTATE revenue for the quarter was $101 million and $320 million for the full year. ALPROLIX revenue in Q4 was $71 million and $234 million for the full year. 
Turning to our anti-CD20 unconsolidated joint business, which includes our profit share for Rituxan and GAZYVA in the U.S. as well as our profit share and royalties on sales of rituximab outside the U.S. We recorded $334 million for Q4 and $1.3 billion for the full year. While there was a slight inventory drawdown for Rituxan in the fourth quarter, we ended the year with a higher inventory level than we had anticipated. We also benefited from a $6 million payment from Roche in exchange for access to data supporting the development of ocrelizumab. 
Corporate partner revenues were $69 million for the fourth quarter compared to $40 million in the prior year quarter. The increase was related to contract manufacturing for Samsung Bioepis and another strategic partner. For the full year, corporate partner revenues were $189 million. 
During the quarter, we booked a total GAAP charge of approximately $93 million related to the restructuring announced in October. 
Now turning to the non-GAAP expense lines on the P&L. Q4 cost of goods sold were $332 million or 12% of revenue. For the full year, COGS were $1.2 billion or 12% of revenue. Q4 non-GAAP R&D expense was $542 million or 19% of revenue, which includes a $60 million payment to Mitsubishi Tanabe. For the full year, non-GAAP R&D expense was $2 billion or 19% of revenue. Q4 non-GAAP SG&A expense was $583 million or 21% of revenue. For the full year, non-GAAP SG&A expense was $2.1 billion or 20% of revenue. Other net expense was approximately $82 million in the fourth quarter, which includes $67 million in interest expense, primarily related to our recent bond offering. Full year other net expense was $124 million, including approximately $96 million in interest expense. 
Our Q4 non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 23% for the fourth quarter, as we benefited from the reinstated R&D tax credit. Our full year tax rate was approximately 24%. 
During the year, we repurchased approximately 16.8 million shares of our common stock, completing our previously authorized $5 billion share repurchase program. Our weighted average diluted share count was approximately 221 million for Q4, 231 million for the full year. And we ended the year with approximately 219 million basic shares outstanding. This brings us to our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share toward $4.50 [ph] for the fourth quarter and $17.01 for the full year, representing a 23% increase for the full year. 
We ended the year with approximately $62.2 billion in cash and marketable securities, split approximately 40-60 between the U.S. and ex U.S. 
So overall, we had a strong quarter, benefiting from favorable inventory dynamics for TECFIDERA, stronger-than-anticipated contract manufacturing in RITUXAN revenue and the restatement of the R&D tax credit. 
Let me turn to our full year 2016 guidance. We expect revenues of approximately $11.1 billion to $11.3 billion. Starting with multiple sclerosis. Our plan assumes relatively stable demand for TECFIDERA in 2016 in the United States. While we're hopeful our recently launched marketing campaign can reaccelerate growth, we remain cautious as we believe we will not ascertain the impact until the second quarter of this year. In Europe, we anticipate constant pricing through the rest of the year and continued patient growth, particularly in recently launched markets. For TYSABRI, we believe the therapy will remain on a stable trajectory. We believe the number of patients using Avonex and PLEGRIDY, combined, will continue to decline as patients move toward orals, but we remain well positioned within this segment of the market. 
Our financial guidance assumes no U.S. price increases for Avonex, PLEGRIDY and TECFIDERA for the remainder of the year. 
With respect to foreign exchange, our plan is based on the current spot rates. Of note, we had an approximately $170 million in hedge gains in 2015. Given our hedges, our usually placed 12-month forward, we expect limited hedge gains in 2016, so the year-over-year comparison is less favorable. 
Moving to our hemophilia therapies. We anticipate continued growth with ELOCTATE, as we believe there remains a significant portion of the patient population that can benefit from long-acting therapies. We're assuming moderating patient adds for ALPROLIX, given the rapid uptake in penetration so far. 
In 2016, we're assuming our profit share for Rituxan and GAZYVA will decrease to 39% from 40% upon FDA approval of GAZYVA and RITUXAN refractory indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Our plan assumes ocrelizumab will launch in 2017. 
Moving to an expense perspective. We anticipate slight upward pressure on cost of goods sold rate, largely due to increases in contract manufacturing, biosimilars and increased hemophilia royalties. We anticipate R&D expense between 19% and 20% of sales, which includes approximately $100 million earmarked for business development activity. We plan to invest in a number of R&D programs across our late-stage pipeline, including aducanumab, nusinersen, Raxatrigine and [indiscernible] for inflammatory bowel disease. 
SG&A expense is expected to be approximately 17% to 18% of revenue. The headcount reduction in restructuring announced in October is expected to benefit operating expenses by approximately $250 million. We've also planned to reduce targeted fees and services expenses, which are largely reflected in SG&A. 
From a tax perspective, we anticipate upward pressure on our 2016 tax rate, as our profitability mix shifts toward the U.S. We anticipate non-GAAP earnings per share results between $18.30 and $18.60 and GAAP EPS to be between $16.85 and $17.15. Our plan assumes share stabilization, with a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 219 million. 
From a cost perspective, we expect to pay $1.2 billion in CVR payments to Fumapharm in 2016 related to the sales of TECFIDERA. And we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $800 million to $850 million, an increase over 2015, primarily driven by the investment in the Swiss manufacturing plants. 
So the business plan is designed to provide investment to support TECFIDERA, surgically look to control spending and ensure we're heavily focused on investing in and progressing the pipeline. 
I'll turn the call over to George."

Clearly, the commercial trajectory of TECFIDERA was not where we thought it would be at the beginning of last year, and as a result, the revenues fell short of our initial projections. While obviously not happy with that, I'm very pleased with the way the company responded. We put additional marketing muscle behind TECFIDERA. We reduced cost and focused the company, and we accelerated our stock repurchase program. As a result, we maintained healthy earnings growth at the same time as we continued our investments in aducanumab, LINGO and the other exciting programs in our pipeline. We also continued to invest in additions to our pipeline. We acquired Convergence and its lead compound, Raxatrigine. We licensed Amiselimod from Mitsubishi Tanabe. We completed the gene therapy relationship with AGTC, and we brought additional compounds into the clinic from our own and partner's research efforts. 
Our commercial portfolio continued to expand globally, as we expanded our position as the worldwide leader in multiple sclerosis and significantly grew our hemophilia business. In 2016, we plan to remain focused on commercial execution and advancing our pipeline, which we expect to be the primary source of value creation over the long term. We're looking forward to many updates over the next year, including insight into the potential impact of TECFIDERA's recently launched marketing campaign by the second quarter; Phase II top line results for anti-LINGO in MS in the middle of the year; Phase II data for BAN2401 and E2609; continued Phase II data for nusinersen from Ionis, followed by Phase III data next year; and Phase Ib titration data for aducanumab in the second half of the year. 
We expect to launch up to 3 compounds this year: BENEPALI in Europe following approval from the European Commission earlier this month; ZINBRYTA pending approval in the first half of the year; and potentially [indiscernible] biosimilar also in Europe. 
Thinking even further ahead, we believe that we're entering the early years of a potentially transformative era in neuro generation drug discovery and development. And we believe that our commitment to research has the potential to yield results that are truly meaningful for patients and shareholders. As I said at the recent JPMorgan conference, I believe that our pipeline and our approach, which has the risk inherent in all truly innovative and ground-breaking approaches, is measured and thoughtful. The combination of a much better understanding of disease biology; the focus on genetically validated targets; the use of biomarkers to learn early, whether or not our compounds are having the desired biological effects; and the adoption of multiple therapeutic modalities may meaningfully increase success rates and identify those projects likely to fail early in the process before large amounts of time and money are spent. Our strategy is evident in the design of the aducanumab Phase Ib trial to Phase II study of nusinersen, the Phase II studies of anti-LINGO and our recently initiated Phase I trial for SOD1 ALS. We have additional examples, some of which we'll talk about as the year goes on. 
In closing, and as always, I'd like to thank our employees who are dedicated to making a positive impact on patients' lives and also the patients and physicians who are involved in our clinical development programs. The achievements we've been together could not have been realized without their passion and commitment. 
So thank you all for joining us this morning. And operator, we'll now open up the call for questions."

And in terms of what it means for the marketplace, I do believe that there's going to be a change ultimately in the way the patients are diagnosed early, perhaps, and certainly before their functional deficits, but when they have mild cognitive impairment, I believe the health care system will set up ways of identifying those patients who need treatment early.

I think what I'm try to stay with the LINGO, this is a Phase II trial, and it's pretty novel territory we're on, where not too many people have looked at repair strategies for any neurologic disease, including MS. So I would say that we're going to look at the totality of the data. We're going to combine the clinical outcome measures, along with the imaging outcome measures, learn as much as we can and really decide, does the program deserves a continued investment. And if so, can we go to Phase III? Are we ready to go to Phase III? Because in Phase III, we're going to have to employ outcome measures that everybody agrees, including regulators, obviously. But also the MS community, everybody agrees, will provide answers on whether or not the treatment effect is clinically meaningful. And in the case of the BACE inhibitor, the main thing we're going to be looking at is safety. And I don't think it's uncommon. In fact, I think all of our competitors have gone from early-stage safety data right to large registrational trials. And I think there are good reasons for that. We are confident in the pharmacodynamic effect that we see in that when we look at a beta 42 levels in CSF, we get nice, very strong, dose-dependent decreases in beta 42. So we're not going, I mean, as George said, we won a match their risk by making sure that we have a desired biological effect. And we're pretty confident already that we have that."

My confidence grows with every passing day because, as you know, these children are supposed to -- their median survival is 2 years. And so we're at the point where many of these babies are getting to that point or going beyond it. And so I think that if they are surviving, our confidence grows. And also we're also looking at whether or not they're gaining, whether they're making improvements. These children generally don't improve, and they're hitting milestones that are not commonly seen in the natural history. So we believe the data looking promising, but there are caveats to comparison to natural history studies. And we have to be cautious because everybody, including parents and the whole world, wants to see a cure for these babies. So our bias is certainly leaning toward wanting to see something, and we have to be cautious about that. So the Phase III trials are sham-controlled. They're blinded.

What we had noted in Q3 is that our estimate that the time was that there was about $10 million to $15 million of building in the SPP, in the specialty pharmacy part of the combined channel. And that was mostly what we believe related to a government purchase, related to kind of their fiscal year timing. I think, our belief is that, that's largely burned through.

What we know that in Q4 is actually related to the wholesaler portion of the channel and, on a quarter-over-quarter basis, that there was a little bit of build. So I think, as we move into Q1, we're really probably dealing with the $30 million to get to kind on a sequential quarter basis.

So Q1 oftentimes and gross in that change so discounts allowances rates close-up in Q1 as well for us as well as the industry. So we're always mindful of that. On PLEGRIDY, it's very interesting. Your checks are probably are consistent with what we're seeing as well. We saw early on, and to some extent, it was our marketing strategy early on was a conversion of Avonex patients. And we hit some speed bumps along that early on in the launch in the first -- in the last quarter of 2014 and going into early into 2015. We're starting to see both from a -- we're trying to do on a marketing strategy, but we're also starting to see the benefits of PLEGRIDY being seen as sourcing volumes from the other interferons.

And then in terms of ocrelizumab, it's great to have a new drug for patients, particularly for PPMS patients. I don't think that there were a lot of PPMS patients who are on TYSABRI, if that's what you're asking. There probably are some people who are have SPMS on TYSABRI because our label says relapsing forms of MS, and patients with SPMS have relapses in the early stages of SPMS. So it would be unlabeled to be on TYSABRI if you have relapsing SPMS. Now ocrelizumab, I don't think, will have a label for SPMS as far as I understand. I don't recall the data trial in SPMS. I don't see how that would affect the SPMS piece very much."

In 2015, Biogen generated revenues of $10.8 billion, an 11% increase over 2014, and non-GAAP EPS of $17.01, a 23% increase over 2014. Although the revenues were less than we had anticipated at the beginning of last year, I'm pleased that we were able to take appropriate action in the second half of the year to maintain healthy earnings growth while we continued to advance the potentially transformative therapies in our pipeline. 
TECFIDERA's demand has been stable in the U.S., and combined with growth in Europe, we expect TECFIDERA to continue to drive our global leadership in multiple sclerosis. TECFIDERA is now not only the most prescribed oral MS therapy worldwide, it is also the most prescribed of all MS therapies in Germany, France and the U.K. Overall, more than 170,000 patients have been treated with TECFIDERA. 
Our hemophilia products, ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX, generated over $0.5 billion of revenue in their first full year on the market in the U.S. In November, the European Commission approved ELOCTA for the treatment of hemophilia A in the EU, which we believe will help to contribute growth in hemophilia this year as our collaboration partner, Sobi, commercializes ELOCTA in additional markets. 
We also made progress in business development. We acquired Convergence Pharmaceuticals and raxatrigine, their early compound. Raxatrigine is an oral, small molecule Nav 1.7 blocker with promising Phase II data that will move into Phase III this year. 
We licensed amiselimod, or MT-1303, for Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma, a late-stage S1P1 inhibitor for ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. 
We entered into a collaboration agreement with AGTC to develop gene-based therapies for multiple ophthalmic diseases. 
And this month, BENEPALI was approved in the EU. BENEPALI, the first etanercept biosimilar approved in the EU, is the first of 3 potential anti-TNFs to advance under our Samsung Bioepis joint venture with Samsung Biologics. Under our agreements with Samsung Bioepis, we will manufacture and commercialize BENEPALI in the EU. 
Meanwhile, we continued investing in 2015. We purchased land in Solothurn, Switzerland, and this Friday, January 29, we'll break ground on an advanced next-generation biologics manufacturing facility there. And we purchased Eisai's drug product manufacturing facility and supporting infrastructure in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. 
We also took actions to return capital and change the capital structure of the business. We fully implemented our $5 billion share repurchase program, and a portion of that repurchase was funded through the $6 billion debt offering that we completed in September. 
In R&D, we moved forward several exciting mid- and late-stage assets in our pipeline. It may seem like a long time ago now, but it was Q1 2015 that we presented the aducanumab data showing a statistically significant removal of plaque and slowing of cognitive decline in Alzheimer's patients. 
We presented data suggesting that our anti-LINGO antibody is biologically active in remyelination, and the Phase II data for nusinersen generated by our partner Ionis looks increasingly encouraging as a potential therapy for spinal muscular atrophy. 
We also initiated Phase I trials in ALS and Parkinson's disease. 
Al will discuss the many advances we made in our pipeline in more detail, but I think this progress is a testament to our commitment to patients and our world-class capabilities across the breadth of R&D. 
We also continued to strengthen our early-stage clinical and research capabilities. We bolstered research talent in our neuroscience group and established collaborations with first-rate academic centers around the world. As a result, I believe we're now in a better position than ever to both discover novel therapies and accelerate drug development while minimizing risk. 
Lastly, summarizing 2015 would not be complete without commenting on the restructuring we implemented in October. Although it was a difficult decision, we've already seen positive results from the steps that we took. With the majority of the restructuring now completed, there's a palpable, reinvigorated focus on our key commercial initiatives and high-potential pipeline candidates, and our operating expenses are trending at a rate that we believe can continue to provide healthy earnings leverage going forward. 
So all in all, it was a busy and eventful year, and we believe that the progress we made and the actions we took positioned us well for a potentially transformative 2016 and beyond. 
With that, I'll pass the call along to Al for an update on R&D."

We advanced the next wave of potential medicines through the pipeline, added important assets through business development and acquisitions and expanded our research leadership by hiring world-class scientists. I believe our pipeline and our organization are stronger than they have ever been. 
Starting with Alzheimer's disease. Last year, we presented compelling interim Phase Ib data for aducanumab, the first investigational drug for Alzheimer's disease, to demonstrate both the statistically significant reduction of amyloid plaque as well as slowing of cognitive decline. In August, we began enrolling patients into 2 pivotal Phase III trials of aducanumab in early Alzheimer's disease. 
We are pleased with the progress of these studies but recognize the inherent challenges in recruiting patients with early Alzheimer's disease and the limited availability of PET scanners. Fortunately, owing to the strong results from our clinical trials to date, there has been substantial interest in the program, which we believe has helped with recruitment. That said, we continue to anticipate that the Phase III enrollment duration will be similar to other large clinical trials in Alzheimer's disease. Looking ahead, in the second half of 2016, we expect to share additional safety data from the ongoing titration arms of the Phase Ib PRIME study for aducanumab. 
Our other 2 mid-stage clinical candidates for AD that are partnered with Eisai continued to advance. Eisai had indicated that they anticipate releasing interim safety data this year for E2609, a small molecule BACE1 inhibitor, and we are also expecting to see top line efficacy and safety data for BAN2401, a monoclonal antibody targeting beta-amyloid. 
Moving to anti-LINGO. You may recall that last year, we presented Phase II data in acute optic neuritis. To our knowledge, this was the first clinical trial to show evidence of remyelination following an acute inflammatory demyelinating injury in humans. And we believe that these results support our ongoing development efforts. 
Our Phase II SYNERGY study in MS is a 418-patient, double-blind, multicenter study assessing 4 doses of anti-LINGO versus placebo when added to interferon beta therapy. It utilizes a composite endpoint comprising outcome measures of disability, cognition and physical function. We believe that a separation from placebo on any of these measures could be clinically meaningful. We are also looking at imaging endpoints that reflect the integrity of myelinated nerve fibers. Any differences in treatment effect between pre-existing and newly acquired lesions will also be of interest. 
We believe that the robust design of this clinical trial will enable a better understanding of the therapy's potential in MS. And if the results are positive, the trial should provide valuable insight into the design of our Phase III program. Results for SYNERGY are anticipated in mid-2016. 
Now turning to nusinersen. Our partner, Ionis, recently completed target enrollment of the Phase III CHERISH study in children with childhood-onset SMA. And by the first half of this year, we hope to complete enrollment in ENDEAR, the Phase III study evaluating nusinersen in infants with infantile-onset SMA. This progress sets the stage for data from both of these trials to be available in the first half of 2017. 
Whereas the data from the early-stage, open-label clinical trials are encouraging when compared to data from natural history studies, the well-controlled Phase III studies are designed to definitively assess the safety and efficacy of nusinersen. We are meeting frequently with regulators from Europe, Japan and the United States with the goal of making the drug available to SMA patients as rapidly as possible. 
Moving on to our hemophilia therapies. Last month, at the 57th American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting, we presented new data demonstrating that ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX effectively managed bleeding into joints and maintained low annualized bleeding rates in people with severe hemophilia A and B, reaffirming the benefits of these 2 therapies. In addition, teams from the University of Pittsburgh, The Hemophilia Center of Western Pennsylvania and The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center presented data showing that immune tolerance induction using ELOCTATE was successful in 3 children with inhibitors, including a child previously failing recombinant factor VIII immune tolerance induction The time to achieving tolerance in the study was 4 to 12 weeks, which appears to be significantly shorter than with the standard of practice, which can take several months to several years. 
During the quarter, we, in collaboration with Ionis, also announced the initiation of a Phase I/II clinical study of an antisense drug against superoxide dismutase, or SOD1, in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. I am pleased to announce that last week, we dosed our first patient in the trial. Mutations in the SOD1 gene result in the second most common form of familial ALS, affecting approximately 2% of all ALS patients. 
We also continue to make excellent progress toward initiating multiple late-stage clinical trials in 2016. Next month, we anticipate sharing additional Phase II study results for TYSABRI in acute ischemic stroke at the International Stroke Conference in Los Angeles. While a single dose of administered -- of natalizumab administered up to 9 hours after stroke onset did not reduce focal infarct volume, treatment was associated with meaningful improvements in clinical outcomes over the course of 90 days. The clinical profile and treatment window supports further investigation of natalizumab as a potential novel approach for treating acute ischemic stroke, and we intend to conduct a Phase IIb trial. 
Amiselimod, or MT-1303, an S1P1 inhibitor for inflammatory bowel disease, is anticipated to advance to Phase III trials this year. In the second half of the year, we plan to initiate Phase III studies for both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. We currently have no plans for the asset in MS but expect to continue to evaluate other options for the molecule in collaboration with our partner, Mitsubishi Tanabe. 
Raxatrigine, a small molecule inhibitor of the Nav 1.7 sodium channel, is in development for several pain indications. In the second half of the year, we anticipate initiating a Phase III trial to confirm the efficacy of raxatrigine in patients with trigeminal neuralgia. We also plan to initiate a Phase II trial in patients with sciatica later this year. 
I'll now pass the call over to Paul."

Our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $3.77 in the fourth quarter and $15.34 for the full year. Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $4.50 in the fourth quarter and $17.01 for the full year. 
Total revenue for Q4 grew 8% year-over-year to approximately $2.8 billion and grew 11% for the full year to $10.8 billion. Foreign exchange, offset by hedging, weakened fourth quarter revenue by approximately $35 million versus prior year and by approximately $227 million for the full year versus prior year. 
Global Q4 TECFIDERA revenue was $993 million. We recorded revenues of $785 million in the U.S. and $208 million outside the U.S. TECFIDERA U.S. revenue benefited from an increase in wholesale inventory by approximately $30 million versus prior quarter. At this point, we believe TECFIDERA's safety perceptions and physician intent to prescribe have largely stabilized in the U.S. We're seeing positive leading indicators for the recently launched marketing campaign for TECFIDERA, including increased visits to our website and higher call volume into our Patient Services organization. 
In Europe, TECFIDERA continued its trend of solid patient growth this quarter, especially in more recently launched markets such as the U.K., Italy and Spain. The European label for TECFIDERA was updated in December, and we're actively educating physicians on appropriate patient monitoring. 
For the full year, worldwide TECFIDERA revenues were $3.6 billion consisting of $2.9 billion in the U.S. and $730 million in sales outside the U.S. Foreign exchange impact, offset by hedging, weakened full year TECFIDERA revenue by approximately $27 million versus prior year. 
Interferon revenues, including both AVONEX and PLEGRIDY, were $740 million during the fourth quarter, which includes $506 million in the U.S. and $233 million in sales outside the U.S. 
For the full year, worldwide interferon revenues were $3 billion consisting of $2 billion in the U.S. and $951 million in sales outside the U.S. Foreign exchange impact, offset by hedging, weakened full year interferon revenues by approximately $88 million versus prior year. 
TYSABRI continued to add patients this quarter with worldwide revenues of $481 million. These results were comprised of $278 million in the U.S. and $203 million internationally. 
For the full year, worldwide TYSABRI revenues were approximately $1.9 billion. We recorded U.S. revenue of $1.1 billion and $783 million internationally. Foreign exchange impact, offset by hedging, weakened full year revenue for TYSABRI by approximately $90 million versus prior year. 
Physicians continued to choose TYSABRI for patients requiring high efficacy, and nearly 10 years after approval, we believe its well-understood safety profile positions TYSABRI well. 
Turning to hemophilia business. ELOCTATE revenue for the quarter was $101 million and $320 million for the full year. ALPROLIX revenue in Q4 was $71 million and $234 million for the full year. 
Turning to our anti-CD20 unconsolidated joint business, which includes our profit share for RITUXAN and GAZYVA in the U.S. as well as our profit share in royalties on sales of rituximab outside the U.S. We recorded $334 million for Q4 and $1.3 billion for the full year. While there was a slight inventory drawdown for RITUXAN in the fourth quarter, we ended the year with a higher inventory level than we had anticipated. We also benefited from a $6 million payment from Roche in exchange for access to data supporting the development of ocrelizumab. 
Corporate partner revenues were $69 million for the fourth quarter compared to $40 million in the prior quarter. The increase was related to contract manufacturing for Samsung Bioepis and another strategic partner. For the full year, corporate partner revenues were $189 million. 
During the quarter, we booked a total GAAP charge of approximately $93 million related to the restructuring announced in October. 
Now turning to the non-GAAP expense lines on the P&L. Q4 cost of goods sold were $332 million or 12% of revenue. For the full year, COGS were $1.2 billion or 12% of revenue. 
Q4 non-GAAP R&D expense was $542 million or 19% of revenue, which includes a $60 million payment to Mitsubishi Tanabe. For the full year, non-GAAP R&D expense was $2 billion or 19% of revenue. 
Q4 non-GAAP SG&A expense was $583 million or 21% of revenue. For the full year, non-GAAP SG&A expense was $2.1 billion or 20% of revenue. 
Other net expense was approximately $82 million in the fourth quarter, which includes $67 million in interest expense primarily related to our recent bond offering. Full year other net expense was $124 million, including approximately $96 million in interest expense. 
Our Q4 non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 23% for the fourth quarter as we benefited from the reinstated R&D tax credit. Our full year tax rate was approximately 24%. 
During the year, we repurchased approximately 16.8 million shares of our common stock, completing our previously authorized $5 billion share repurchase program. 
Our weighted average diluted share count was approximately 221 million for Q4, 231 million for the full year. And we ended the year with approximately 219 million basic shares outstanding. This brings us to our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $4.50 for the fourth quarter and $17.01 for the full year, representing a 23% increase for the full year. 
We ended the year with approximately $6.2 billion in cash and marketable securities, split approximately 40-60 between the U.S. and ex U.S. 
So overall, we had a strong quarter, benefiting from favorable inventory dynamics for TECFIDERA, stronger-than-anticipated contract manufacturing in RITUXAN revenue and the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit. 
Let me turn to our full year 2016 guidance. We expect revenues of approximately $11.1 billion to $11.3 billion. Starting with multiple sclerosis. Our plan assumes relatively stable demand for TECFIDERA in 2016 in the United States. While we're hopeful our recently launched marketing campaign can reaccelerate growth, we remain cautious as we believe we will not ascertain the impact until the second quarter of this year. In Europe, we anticipate constant pricing through the rest of the year and continued patient growth, particularly in recently launched markets. For TYSABRI, we believe the therapy will remain on a stable trajectory. We believe the number of patients using AVONEX and PLEGRIDY combined will continue to decline as patients move toward orals, but we remain well positioned within this segment of the market. 
Our financial guidance assumes no U.S. price increases for AVONEX, PLEGRIDY and TECFIDERA for the remainder of the year. 
With respect to foreign exchange, our plan is based on the current spot rates. Of note, we had an approximately $170 million in hedge gains in 2015. Given our hedges, our usually placed 12-month forward, we expect limited hedge gains in 2016, so the year-over-year comparison is less favorable. 
Moving to our hemophilia therapies. We anticipate continued growth with ELOCTATE as we believe there remains a significant portion of the patient population that can benefit from long-acting therapies. We're assuming moderating patient adds for ALPROLIX given the rapid uptake in penetration so far. 
In 2016, we are assuming our profit share for RITUXAN and GAZYVA will decrease to 39% from 40% upon FDA approval of GAZYVA in RITUXAN refractory indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Our plan assumes ocrelizumab will launch in 2017. 
Moving to an expense perspective. We anticipate slight upward pressure on cost of goods sold rate largely due to increases in contract manufacturing, biosimilars and increased hemophilia royalties. 
We anticipate R&D expense between 19% and 20% of sales, which includes approximately $100 million earmarked for business development activity. We plan to invest in a number of R&D programs across our late-stage pipeline, including aducanumab, nusinersen, raxatrigine and amiselimod for inflammatory bowel disease. 
SG&A expense is expected to be approximately 17% to 18% of revenue. The headcount reduction in restructuring announced in October is expected to benefit operating expenses by approximately $250 million. We've also planned to reduce targeted fees and services expenses, which are largely reflected in SG&A. 
From a tax perspective, we anticipate upward pressure on our 2016 tax rate as our profitability mix shifts toward the U.S. 
We anticipate non-GAAP earnings per share results between $18.30 and $18.60 and GAAP EPS to be between $16.85 and $17.15. 
Our plan assumes share stabilization with a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 219 million. 
From a cash perspective, we expect to pay $1.2 billion in CVR payments to Fumapharm in 2016 related to the sales of TECFIDERA. 
And we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $800 million to $850 million, an increase over 2015 primarily driven by the investment in the Swiss manufacturing plant. 
So the business plan is designed to provide investment to support TECFIDERA, surgically look to control spending and ensure we're utterly focused on investing in and progressing the pipeline. 
I'll turn the call over to George."

And as a result, the revenues fell short of our initial projections. While obviously not happy with that, I'm very pleased with the way the company responded. We put additional marketing muscle behind TECFIDERA, we reduced costs and focused the company and we accelerated our stock repurchase program. As a result, we maintained healthy earnings growth at the same time as we continued our investments in aducanumab, LINGO and the other exciting programs in our pipeline. We also continued to invest in additions to our pipeline. We acquired Convergence and its lead compound, raxatrigine. We licensed amiselimod from Mitsubishi Tanabe. We completed the gene therapy relationship with AGTC. And we brought additional compounds into the clinic from our own and partners' research efforts. 
Our commercial portfolio continued to expand  globally as we extended our position as the worldwide leader in multiple sclerosis and significantly grew our hemophilia business. In 2016, we plan to remain focused on commercial execution and advancing our pipeline, which we expect to be the primary source of value creation over the long term. We're looking forward to many updates over the next year, including insight into the potential impact of TECFIDERA's recently launched marketing campaign by the second quarter; Phase II top line results for anti-LINGO in MS in the middle of the year; Phase II data for BAN2401 and E2609; continued Phase II data for nusinersen from Ionis, followed by Phase III data next year; and Phase Ib titration data for aducanumab in the second half of the year. 
We expect to launch up to 3 compounds this year: BENEPALI in Europe following approval from the European Commission earlier this month, ZINBRYTA pending approval in the first half of the year and potentially an infliximab biosimilar, also in Europe. 
Thinking even further ahead, we believe that we're entering the early years of a potentially transformative era in neuro generation drug discovery and development. And we believe that our commitment to research has the potential to yield results that are truly meaningful for patients and shareholders. 
As I said at the recent JPMorgan conference, I believe that our pipeline and our approach, which has the risk inherent in all truly innovative and ground-breaking approaches, is measured and thoughtful. The combination of a much better understanding of disease biology, the focus on genetically validated targets, the use of biomarkers to learn early whether or not our compounds are having the desired biological effects and the adoption of multiple therapeutic modalities may meaningfully increase success rates and identify those projects likely to fail early in the process before large amounts of time and money are spent. Our strategy is evident in the design of the aducanumab Phase Ib trial, the Phase II study of nusinersen, the Phase II studies of anti-LINGO and our recently initiated Phase I trial for SOD1 ALS. We have additional examples, some of which we'll talk about as the year goes on. 
In closing, and as always, I'd like to thank our employees who are dedicated to making a positive impact on patients' lives, and also the patients and physicians who are involved in our clinical development programs. The achievements we made together could not have been realized without their passion and commitment. 
So thank you all for joining us this morning. And operator, we'll now open up the call for questions."

Well, we have learned a lot from our predecessors, including Lilly and others.

And of course, the patients have to get there. The other thing we're doing is to screen patients before they need PET scans by using a neuropsychological test battery to make sure that by the time they get to the PET scanner, there's a high likelihood they'll actually have amyloid. And then in terms of early AD, what we mean by early AD are prodromal and the earlier stages of mild Alzheimer's. And in terms of what it means for the marketplace, I do believe that there's going to be a change ultimately in the way the patients are diagnosed early. Perhaps -- and certainly before their functional deficits but when they have mild cognitive impairment, I believe the health care system will set up ways of identifying those patients who need treatment early. And we're working on many of those, too, along with many colleagues outside who are also thinking about the same thing."

I think what I'm trying to say with LINGO is that this is a Phase II trial and it's pretty novel territory we're on, where not too many people have looked at repair strategies for any neurologic disease, including MS. So I would say that we're going to look at the totality of the data. We're going to combine the clinical outcome measures, along with the imaging outcome measures, learn as much as we can and really decide, does the program deserve a continued investment? And if so, can we go to Phase III? Are we ready to go to Phase III? Because in Phase III, we're going to have to employ outcome measures that everybody agrees, including regulators, obviously, but also the MS community, everybody agrees will provide answers on whether or not the treatment effect is clinically meaningful. And in the case of the BACE inhibitor, the main thing we're going to be looking at is safety, and I don't think it's uncommon. And in fact, I think all of our competitors have gone from early-stage safety data right to large registrational trials. And I think there are good reasons for that. We are confident in the pharmacodynamic effect that we see in that when we look at Abeta 42 levels in CSF, we get nice, very strong, dose-dependent decreases in Abeta 42. So we're not going -- I mean, as George said, we want to manage the risk by making sure we have the desired biological effect, and we're pretty confident already that we have that."

And also, we're also looking at whether or not they're gaining, whether -- if they're making improvements. These children generally don't improve, and they're hitting motor milestones that are not commonly seen in the natural history. So we believe the data looking promising, but there are caveats to comparison to natural history studies. And we have to be cautious because everybody, including parents and the whole world, wants to see a cure for these babies.

And if I ask this question, because some of our checks seem to indicate there's been a shift where PLEGRIDY is taking patients now from other beta interferons versus more from AVONEX early on. I'm just kind of wondering if that's what you're seeing, too, if there's something else going on there."

TECFIDERA, let me just kind of level set and just clarify because you're exactly on it. What we had noted in Q3 is that our estimate at the time was that there was about $10 million to $15 million of build in the SPP",413,"Chris, great. questions. This is Paul. TECFIDERA, let me just kind of level set and just clarify because you're exactly on it. What we had noted in Q3 is that our estimate at the time was that there was about $10 million to $15 million of build in the SPP, in the specialty pharmacy, part of the combined channel. And that was mostly what we believe related to a government purchase, related to kind of their fiscal year timing. I think our belief is that, that's largely burned through. On a quarter-to-quarter basis within Specialty Pharmacies, there is sometimes ebbs and flows on inventory levels, and we'll try to do our best to point that out. But we think it's at -- and I would think that we may have things like what we had in Q3, but I think that's largely burned through. What we noted in Q4 is actually related to the wholesaler portion of the channel and, on a quarter-over-quarter basis, that there was a little bit of build. So I think what -- as we move into Q1, we're really probably dealing with the $30 million to get to kind of on a sequential quarter basis. We always -- just to complete the thought, we always deal with kind of a Q1 -- Q4 to Q1 dynamics that sometimes we don't have great visibility on the so-called shoebox effect, the change in Q1 with respect to patients on insurance and -- which is related, obviously, to shoebox. So Q1 oftentimes -- and gross-to-net-change, and so discounts and allowances rate, goes up in Q1 as well for us as well as the industry. So we're always -- be mindful of that. On PLEGRIDY, it's very interesting. Your checks probably are consistent with what we're seeing as well. We saw early on -- and to some extent, it was our marketing strategy early on was a conversion of AVONEX patients, and we hit some speed bumps along that early on in the launch in the first -- in the last quarter of 2014 and going into -- early into 2015. We're starting to see both from what we're trying to do on our marketing strategy, but we're also starting to see the benefits of PLEGRIDY being seen as sourcing volumes from the other interferons. Look, this is a great product vis-Ã -vis kind of capturing our -- penetrating and capturing share within that interferon segment of the marketplace. Great question. Thanks, Chris."

There are -- there probably are some people who are -- who have SPMS on TYSABRI because our label says relapsing forms of MS, and patients with SPMS have relapses in their early stages of SPMS. So it would be unlabeled to be on TYSABRI if you have relapsing SPMS. Now ocrelizumab, I don't think, will have a label for SPMS as far as I understand. I don't recall the data trial on SPMS.

In 2015, Biogen generated revenues of $10.8 billion, an 11% increase over 2014, and non-GAAP EPS of $17.01, a 23% increase over 2014. Although the revenues were less than we had anticipated at the beginning of last year, I'm pleased that we were able to take appropriate action in the second half of the year to maintain healthy earnings growth while we continued to advance the potentially transformative therapies in our pipeline. 
TECFIDERA's demand has been stable in the U.S., and combined with growth in Europe, we expect TECFIDERA to continue to drive our global leadership in multiple sclerosis. TECFIDERA is now not only the most prescribed oral MS therapy worldwide, it is also the most prescribed of all MS therapies in Germany, France and the U.K. Overall, more than 170,000 patients have been treated with TECFIDERA. 
Our hemophilia products, ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX, generated over $0.5 billion of revenue in their first full year on the market in the U.S. In November, the European Commission approved ELOCTA for the treatment of hemophilia A in the EU, which we believe will help to contribute growth in hemophilia this year as our collaboration partner, Sobi, commercializes ELOCTA in additional markets. 
We also made progress in business development. We acquired Convergence Pharmaceuticals and raxatrigine, their early compound. Raxatrigine is an oral, small molecule Nav 1.7 blocker with promising Phase II data that will move into Phase III this year. 
We licensed amiselimod, or MT-1303, for Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma, a late-stage S1P1 inhibitor for ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. 
We entered into a collaboration agreement with AGTC to develop gene-based therapies for multiple ophthalmic diseases. 
And this month, BENEPALI was approved in the EU. BENEPALI, the first etanercept biosimilar approved in the EU, is the first of 3 potential anti-TNFs to advance under our Samsung Bioepis joint venture with Samsung Biologics. Under our agreements with Samsung Bioepis, we will manufacture and commercialize BENEPALI in the EU. 
Meanwhile, we continued investing in 2015. We purchased land in Solothurn, Switzerland, and this Friday, January 29, we'll break ground on an advanced next-generation biologics manufacturing facility there. And we purchased Eisai's drug product manufacturing facility and supporting infrastructure in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. 
We also took actions to return capital and change the capital structure of the business. We fully implemented our $5 billion share repurchase program, and a portion of that repurchase was funded through the $6 billion debt offering that we completed in September. 
In R&D, we moved forward several exciting mid- and late-stage assets in our pipeline. It may seem like a long time ago now, but it was Q1 2015 that we presented the aducanumab data showing a statistically significant removal of plaque and slowing of cognitive decline in Alzheimer's patients. 
We presented data suggesting that our anti-LINGO antibody is biologically active in remyelination, and the Phase II data for nusinersen generated by our partner Ionis looks increasingly encouraging as a potential therapy for spinal muscular atrophy. 
We also initiated Phase I trials in ALS and Parkinson's disease. 
Al will discuss the many advances we made in our pipeline in more detail, but I think this progress is a testament to our commitment to patients and our world-class capabilities across the breadth of R&D. 
We also continued to strengthen our early-stage clinical and research capabilities. We bolstered research talent in our neuroscience group and established collaborations with first-rate academic centers around the world. As a result, I believe we're now in a better position than ever to both discover novel therapies and accelerate drug development while minimizing risk. 
Lastly, summarizing 2015 would not be complete without commenting on the restructuring we implemented in October. Although it was a difficult decision, we've already seen positive results from the steps that we took. With the majority of the restructuring now completed, there's a palpable, reinvigorated focus on our key commercial initiatives and high-potential pipeline candidates, and our operating expenses are trending at a rate that we believe can continue to provide healthy earnings leverage going forward. 
So all in all, it was a busy and eventful year, and we believe that the progress we made and the actions we took positioned us well for a potentially transformative 2016 and beyond. 
With that, I'll pass the call along to Al for an update on R&D."

We advanced the next wave of potential medicines through the pipeline, added important assets through business development and acquisitions and expanded our research leadership by hiring world-class scientists. I believe our pipeline and our organization are stronger than they have ever been. 
Starting with Alzheimer's disease. Last year, we presented compelling interim Phase Ib data for aducanumab, the first investigational drug for Alzheimer's disease, to demonstrate both the statistically significant reduction of amyloid plaque as well as slowing of cognitive decline. In August, we began enrolling patients into 2 pivotal Phase III trials of aducanumab in early Alzheimer's disease. 
We are pleased with the progress of these studies, but recognize the inherent challenges in recruiting patients with early Alzheimer's disease and the limited availability of PET scanners. Fortunately, owing to the strong results from our clinical trials to date, there has been substantial interest in the program, which we believe has helped with recruitment. That said, we continue to anticipate that the Phase III enrollment duration will be similar to other large clinical trials in Alzheimer's disease. Looking ahead, in the second half of 2016, we expect to share additional safety data from the ongoing titration arms of the Phase Ib PRIME study for aducanumab. 
Our other 2 mid-stage clinical candidates for AD that are partnered with Eisai continued to advance. Eisai had indicated that they anticipate releasing interim safety data this year for E2609, a small molecule BACE1 inhibitor, and we are also expecting to see top line efficacy and safety data for BAN2401, a monoclonal antibody targeting beta-amyloid. 
Moving to anti-LINGO. You may recall that last year, we presented Phase II data in acute optic neuritis. To our knowledge, this was the first clinical trial to show evidence of remyelination following an acute inflammatory demyelinating injury in humans. And we believe that these results support our ongoing development efforts. 
Our Phase II SYNERGY study in MS is a 418-patient, double-blind, multicenter study assessing 4 doses of anti-LINGO versus placebo when added to interferon beta therapy. It utilizes a composite endpoint comprising outcome measures of disability, cognition and physical function. We believe that a separation from placebo on any of these measures could be clinically meaningful. We are also looking at imaging endpoints that reflect the integrity of myelinated nerve fibers. Any differences in treatment effect between pre-existing and newly acquired lesions will also be of interest. 
We believe that the robust design of this clinical trial will enable a better understanding of the therapy's potential in MS. And if the results are positive, the trial should provide valuable insight into the design of our Phase III program. Results for SYNERGY are anticipated in mid-2016. 
Now turning to nusinersen. Our partner, Ionis, recently completed target enrollment of the Phase III CHERISH study in children with childhood-onset SMA. And by the first half of this year, we hope to complete enrollment in ENDEAR, the Phase III study evaluating nusinersen in infants with infantile-onset SMA. This progress sets the stage for data from both of these trials to be available in the first half of 2017. 
Whereas the data from the early-stage, open-label clinical trials are encouraging when compared to data from natural history studies, the well-controlled Phase III studies are designed to definitively assess the safety and efficacy of nusinersen. We are meeting frequently with regulators from Europe, Japan and the United States with the goal of making the drug available to SMA patients as rapidly as possible. 
Moving on to our hemophilia therapies. Last month, at the 57th American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting, we presented new data demonstrating that ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX effectively managed bleeding into joints and maintained low annualized bleeding rates in people with severe hemophilia A and B, reaffirming the benefits of these 2 therapies. In addition, teams from the University of Pittsburgh, The Hemophilia Center of Western Pennsylvania and The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center presented data showing that immune tolerance induction using ELOCTATE was successful in 3 children with inhibitors, including a child previously failing recombinant factor VIII immune tolerance induction The time to achieving tolerance in the study was 4 to 12 weeks, which appears to be significantly shorter than with the standard of practice, which can take several months to several years. 
During the quarter, we, in collaboration with Ionis, also announced the initiation of a Phase I/II clinical study of an antisense drug against superoxide dismutase, or SOD1, in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. I am pleased to announce that last week, we dosed our first patient in the trial. Mutations in the SOD1 gene result in the second most common form of familial ALS, affecting approximately 2% of all ALS patients. 
We also continue to make excellent progress toward initiating multiple late-stage clinical trials in 2016. Next month, we anticipate sharing additional Phase II study results for TYSABRI in acute ischemic stroke at the International Stroke Conference in Los Angeles. While a single dose of administered -- of natalizumab administered up to 9 hours after stroke onset did not reduce focal infarct volume, treatment was associated with meaningful improvements in clinical outcomes over the course of 90 days. The clinical profile and treatment window supports further investigation of natalizumab as a potential novel approach for treating acute ischemic stroke, and we intend to conduct a Phase IIb trial. 
Amiselimod, or MT-1303, an S1P1 inhibitor for inflammatory bowel disease, is anticipated to advance to Phase III trials this year. In the second half of the year, we plan to initiate Phase III studies for both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. We currently have no plans for the asset in MS but expect to continue to evaluate other options for the molecule in collaboration with our partner, Mitsubishi Tanabe. 
Raxatrigine, a small molecule inhibitor of the Nav 1.7 sodium channel, is in development for several pain indications. In the second half of the year, we anticipate initiating a Phase III trial to confirm the efficacy of raxatrigine in patients with trigeminal neuralgia. We also plan to initiate a Phase II trial in patients with sciatica later this year. 
I'll now pass the call over to Paul."

Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $4.50 in the fourth quarter and $17.01 for the full year. Total revenue for Q4 grew 8% year-over-",1447,"Thanks, Al. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $3.77 in the fourth quarter and $15.34 for the full year. Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $4.50 in the fourth quarter and $17.01 for the full year. 
Total revenue for Q4 grew 8% year-over-year to approximately $2.8 billion and grew 11% for the full year to $10.8 billion. Foreign exchange, offset by hedging, weakened fourth quarter revenue by approximately $35 million versus prior year and by approximately $227 million for the full year versus prior year. 
Global Q4 TECFIDERA revenue was $993 million. We recorded revenues of $785 million in the U.S. and $208 million outside the U.S. TECFIDERA U.S. revenue benefited from an increase in wholesale inventory by approximately $30 million versus prior quarter. At this point, we believe TECFIDERA's safety perceptions and physician intent to prescribe have largely stabilized in the U.S. We're seeing positive leading indicators for the recently launched marketing campaign for TECFIDERA, including increased visits to our website and higher call volume into our Patient Services organization. 
In Europe, TECFIDERA continued its trend of solid patient growth this quarter, especially in more recently launched markets such as the U.K., Italy and Spain. The European label for TECFIDERA was updated in December, and we're actively educating physicians on appropriate patient monitoring. 
For the full year, worldwide TECFIDERA revenues were $3.6 billion consisting of $2.9 billion in the U.S. and $730 million in sales outside the U.S. Foreign exchange impact, offset by hedging, weakened full year TECFIDERA revenue by approximately $27 million versus prior year. 
Interferon revenues, including both AVONEX and PLEGRIDY, were $740 million during the fourth quarter, which includes $506 million in the U.S. and $233 million in sales outside the U.S. 
For the full year, worldwide interferon revenues were $3 billion consisting of $2 billion in the U.S. and $951 million in sales outside the U.S. Foreign exchange impact, offset by hedging, weakened full year interferon revenues by approximately $88 million versus prior year. 
TYSABRI continued to add patients this quarter with worldwide revenues of $481 million. These results were comprised of $278 million in the U.S. and $203 million internationally. 
For the full year, worldwide TYSABRI revenues were approximately $1.9 billion. We recorded U.S. revenue of $1.1 billion and $783 million internationally. Foreign exchange impact, offset by hedging, weakened full year revenue for TYSABRI by approximately $90 million versus prior year. 
Physicians continued to choose TYSABRI for patients requiring high efficacy, and nearly 10 years after approval, we believe its well-understood safety profile positions TYSABRI well. 
Turning to hemophilia business. ELOCTATE revenue for the quarter was $101 million and $320 million for the full year. ALPROLIX revenue in Q4 was $71 million and $234 million for the full year. 
Turning to our anti-CD20 unconsolidated joint business, which includes our profit share for RITUXAN and GAZYVA in the U.S. as well as our profit share in royalties on sales of rituximab outside the U.S. We recorded $334 million for Q4 and $1.3 billion for the full year. While there was a slight inventory drawdown for RITUXAN in the fourth quarter, we ended the year with a higher inventory level than we had anticipated. We also benefited from a $6 million payment from Roche in exchange for access to data supporting the development of ocrelizumab. 
Corporate partner revenues were $69 million for the fourth quarter compared to $40 million in the prior quarter. The increase was related to contract manufacturing for Samsung Bioepis and another strategic partner. For the full year, corporate partner revenues were $189 million. 
During the quarter, we booked a total GAAP charge of approximately $93 million related to the restructuring announced in October. 
Now turning to the non-GAAP expense lines on the P&L. Q4 cost of goods sold were $332 million or 12% of revenue. For the full year, COGS were $1.2 billion or 12% of revenue. 
Q4 non-GAAP R&D expense was $542 million or 19% of revenue, which includes a $60 million payment to Mitsubishi Tanabe. For the full year, non-GAAP R&D expense was $2 billion or 19% of revenue. 
Q4 non-GAAP SG&A expense was $583 million or 21% of revenue. For the full year, non-GAAP SG&A expense was $2.1 billion or 20% of revenue. 
Other net expense was approximately $82 million in the fourth quarter, which includes $67 million in interest expense primarily related to our recent bond offering. Full year other net expense was $124 million, including approximately $96 million in interest expense. 
Our Q4 non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 23% for the fourth quarter as we benefited from the reinstated R&D tax credit. Our full year tax rate was approximately 24%. 
During the year, we repurchased approximately 16.8 million shares of our common stock, completing our previously authorized $5 billion share repurchase program. 
Our weighted average diluted share count was approximately 221 million for Q4, 231 million for the full year. And we ended the year with approximately 219 million basic shares outstanding. This brings us to our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $4.50 for the fourth quarter and $17.01 for the full year, representing a 23% increase for the full year. 
We ended the year with approximately $6.2 billion in cash and marketable securities, split approximately 40-60 between the U.S. and ex U.S. 
So overall, we had a strong quarter, benefiting from favorable inventory dynamics for TECFIDERA, stronger-than-anticipated contract manufacturing in RITUXAN revenue and the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit. 
Let me turn to our full year 2016 guidance. We expect revenues of approximately $11.1 billion to $11.3 billion. Starting with multiple sclerosis. Our plan assumes relatively stable demand for TECFIDERA in 2016 in the United States. While we're hopeful our recently launched marketing campaign can reaccelerate growth, we remain cautious as we believe we will not ascertain the impact until the second quarter of this year. In Europe, we anticipate constant pricing through the rest of the year and continued patient growth, particularly in recently launched markets. For TYSABRI, we believe the therapy will remain on a stable trajectory. We believe the number of patients using AVONEX and PLEGRIDY combined will continue to decline as patients move toward orals, but we remain well positioned within this segment of the market. 
Our financial guidance assumes no U.S. price increases for AVONEX, PLEGRIDY and TECFIDERA for the remainder of the year. 
With respect to foreign exchange, our plan is based on the current spot rates. Of note, we had an approximately $170 million in hedge gains in 2015. Given our hedges are usually placed 12-month forward, we expect limited hedge gains in 2016, so the year-over-year comparison is less favorable. 
Moving to our hemophilia therapies. We anticipate continued growth with ELOCTATE as we believe there remains a significant portion of the patient population that can benefit from long-acting therapies. We're assuming moderating patient adds for ALPROLIX, given the rapid uptake in penetration so far. 
In 2016, we are assuming our profit share for RITUXAN and GAZYVA will decrease to 39% from 40% upon FDA approval of GAZYVA in RITUXAN refractory indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Our plan assumes ocrelizumab will launch in 2017. 
Moving to an expense perspective. We anticipate slight upward pressure on cost of goods sold rate largely due to increases in contract manufacturing, biosimilars and increased hemophilia royalties. 
We anticipate R&D expense between 19% and 20% of sales, which includes approximately $100 million earmarked for business development activity. We plan to invest in a number of R&D programs across our late-stage pipeline, including aducanumab, nusinersen, raxatrigine and amiselimod for inflammatory bowel disease. 
SG&A expense is expected to be approximately 17% to 18% of revenue. The headcount reduction and restructuring announced in October is expected to benefit operating expenses by approximately $250 million. We've also planned to reduce targeted fees and services expenses, which are largely reflected in SG&A. 
From a tax perspective, we anticipate upward pressure on our 2016 tax rate as our profitability mix shifts toward the U.S. 
We anticipate non-GAAP earnings per share results between $18.30 and $18.60 and GAAP EPS to be between $16.85 and $17.15. 
Our plan assumes share stabilization with a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 219 million. 
From a cash perspective, we expect to pay $1.2 billion in CVR payments to Fumapharm in 2016 related to the sales of TECFIDERA. 
And we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $800 million to $850 million, an increase over 2015 primarily driven by the investment in the Swiss manufacturing plant. 
So the business plan is designed to provide investment to support TECFIDERA, surgically look to control spending and ensure we're utterly focused on investing in and progressing the pipeline. 
I'll turn the call over to George."

And as a result, the revenues fell short of our initial projections. While obviously not happy with that, I'm very pleased with the way the company responded. We put additional marketing muscle behind TECFIDERA, we reduced costs and focused the company and we accelerated our stock repurchase program. As a result, we maintained healthy earnings growth at the same time as we continued our investments in aducanumab, LINGO and the other exciting programs in our pipeline. We also continued to invest in additions to our pipeline. We acquired Convergence and its lead compound, raxatrigine. We licensed amiselimod from Mitsubishi Tanabe. We completed the gene therapy relationship with AGTC. And we brought additional compounds into the clinic from our own and partners' research efforts. 
Our commercial portfolio continued to expand  globally as we extended our position as the worldwide leader in multiple sclerosis and significantly grew our hemophilia business. In 2016, we plan to remain focused on commercial execution and advancing our pipeline, which we expect to be the primary source of value creation over the long term. We're looking forward to many updates over the next year, including insight into the potential impact of TECFIDERA's recently launched marketing campaign by the second quarter; Phase II top line results for anti-LINGO in MS in the middle of the year; Phase II data for BAN2401 and E2609; continued Phase II data for nusinersen from Ionis, followed by Phase III data next year; and Phase Ib titration data for aducanumab in the second half of the year. 
We expect to launch up to 3 compounds this year: BENEPALI in Europe following approval from the European Commission earlier this month, ZINBRYTA pending approval in the first half of the year and potentially an infliximab biosimilar, also in Europe. 
Thinking even further ahead, we believe that we're entering the early years of a potentially transformative era in neuro generation drug discovery and development. And we believe that our commitment to research has the potential to yield results that are truly meaningful for patients and shareholders. 
As I said at the recent JPMorgan conference, I believe that our pipeline and our approach, which has the risk inherent in all truly innovative and ground-breaking approaches, is measured and thoughtful. The combination of a much better understanding of disease biology, the focus on genetically validated targets, the use of biomarkers to learn early whether or not our compounds are having the desired biological effects and the adoption of multiple therapeutic modalities may meaningfully increase success rates and identify those projects likely to fail early in the process before large amounts of time and money are spent. Our strategy is evident in the design of the aducanumab Phase Ib trial, the Phase II study of nusinersen, the Phase II studies of anti-LINGO and our recently initiated Phase I trial for SOD1 ALS. We have additional examples, some of which we'll talk about as the year goes on. 
In closing, and as always, I'd like to thank our employees who are dedicated to making a positive impact on patients' lives, and also the patients and physicians who are involved in our clinical development programs. The achievements we made together could not have been realized without their passion and commitment. 
So thank you all for joining us this morning. And operator, we'll now open up the call for questions."

Well, we have learned a lot from our predecessors, including Lilly and others. And we are employing actually pretty innovative ways of finding where the patients are and where the sites are and -- which includes where the PET scans are because the scans -- the scanners have to be pretty close to where the ligands are made. And of course, the patients have to get there. The other thing we're doing is to screen patients before they need PET scans by using a neuropsychological test battery to make sure that by the time they get to the PET scanner, there's a high likelihood they'll actually have amyloid. And then in terms of early AD, what we mean by early AD are prodromal and the earlier stages of mild Alzheimer's. And in terms of what it means for the marketplace, I do believe that there's going to be a change ultimately in the way the patients are diagnosed early. Perhaps -- and certainly before they are functional deficits but when they have mild cognitive impairment, I believe the health care system will set up ways of identifying those patients who need treatment early. And we're working on many of those, too, along with many colleagues outside who are also thinking about the same thing."

I think what I'm trying to say with LINGO is that this is a Phase II trial and it's pretty novel territory we're on, where not too many people have looked at repair strategies for any neurologic disease, including MS. So I would say that we're going to look at the totality of the data. We're going to combine the clinical outcome measures, along with the imaging outcome measures, learn as much as we can and really decide, does the program deserve a continued investment? And if so, can we go to Phase III? Are we ready to go to Phase III? Because in Phase III, we're going to have to employ outcome measures that everybody agrees, including regulators, obviously, but also the MS community, everybody agrees will provide answers on whether or not the treatment effect is clinically meaningful. And in the case of the BACE inhibitor, the main thing we're going to be looking at is safety, and I don't think it's uncommon. And in fact, I think all of our competitors have gone from early-stage safety data right to large registrational trials. And I think there are good reasons for that. We are confident in the pharmacodynamic effect that we see in that when we look at Abeta42 levels in CSF, we get nice, very strong, dose-dependent decreases in Abeta42.

My confidence grows with every passing day because as you know, these children are supposed to -- their median survival is 2 years. And so we're at the point where many of these babies are getting to that point or going beyond it. And so I think that if they are surviving, our confidence grows. And also, we're also looking at whether or not they're gaining, whether -- if they're making improvements. These children generally don't improve, and they're hitting motor milestones that are not commonly seen in the natural history. So we believe the data are looking promising, but there are caveats to comparison to natural history studies. And we have to be cautious because everybody, including parents and the whole world, wants to see a cure for these babies. So our bias is certainly leaning toward wanting to see something, and we have to be cautious about that. So the Phase III trials are sham-controlled, they're blinded.

TECFIDERA, let me just kind of level set and just clarify because you're exactly on it. What we had noted in Q3 is that our estimate at the time was that there was about $10 million to $15 million of build in the SPP, in the specialty pharmacy, part of the combined channel. And that was mostly what we believe were related to a government purchase, related to kind of their fiscal year timing. I think our belief is that, that's largely burned through. On a quarter-to-quarter basis within Specialty Pharmacies, there is sometimes ebbs and flows on inventory levels, and we'll try to do our best to point that out. But we think it's at -- and I would think that we may have things like what we had in Q3, but I think that's largely burned through. What we noted in Q4 is actually related to the wholesaler portion of the channel and, on a quarter-over-quarter basis, that there was a little bit of build. So I think what -- as we move into Q1, we're really probably dealing with the $30 million to get to kind of on a sequential quarter basis. We always -- just to complete the thought, we always deal with kind of a Q1 -- Q4 to Q1 dynamics that sometimes we don't have great visibility on the so-called shoebox effect, the change in Q1 with respect to patients on insurance and -- which is related, obviously, to shoebox. So Q1 oftentimes -- and gross-to-net-change, and so discounts and allowances rate, goes up in Q1 as well for us as well as the industry. So we're always -- be mindful of that. On PLEGRIDY, it's very interesting. Your checks probably are consistent with what we're seeing as well. We saw early on -- and to some extent, it was our marketing strategy early on was a conversion of AVONEX patients, and we hit some speed bumps along that early on in the launch in the first -- in the last quarter of 2014 and going into -- early into 2015. We're starting to see both from what we're trying to do on our marketing strategy, but we're also starting to see the benefits of PLEGRIDY being seen as sourcing volumes from the other interferons. Look, this is a great product vis-à-vis kind of capturing our -- and penetrating and capturing share within that interferon segment of the marketplace. Great question. Thanks, Chris."

Before we begin, I encourage everyone to go to the Investors section of biogen.com to find the press release and related financial tables, including a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures that we'll discuss today.
Our GAAP financials are provided in Tables 1 and 2. Table 3 includes a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. We believe non-GAAP financial results better represent the ongoing economics of our business and reflect how we manage the business internally.
We have also posted slides on our website that follow the discussions related to this call.
I would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements, which are based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially. I encourage you to consult our SEC filings for additional detail.
On today's call, I'm joined by our Chief Executive Officer, Dr. George Scangos; Dr. Al Sandrock, our Chief Medical Officer; our CFO, Paul Clancy; and our new Chief Commercial Officer, Michel Vounatsos, is with us here today. Now I'll turn the call over to George."

For the first quarter of 2016, Biogen generated $2.7 billion in total revenues, 7% increase from the same period a year ago. And our non-GAAP EPS was $4.79, 25% increase from the same period a year ago. 
As you've heard from us since the beginning of the year, our cornerstone to our strategy for sustainable growth is our healthy commercial business and a strong focus on managing expenses and I think these results should reinforce that message. 
TECFIDERA continues to gain share globally, now with more than 190,000 patients having been treated. And at AAN this week, we presented compelling data that showcase its strong and sustained efficacy in newly diagnosed MS patients, emphasizing that earlier treatment with TECFIDERA improves long-term clinical outcomes. We also presented compelling data about TECFIDERA's real-world efficacy. 
Last month, we announced that our new Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer, Michel Vounatsos have joined us. Michel brings a wealth of experience from 20 successful years of increasing responsibility at Merck, most recently as President of primary care and customer centricity. Michel officially started on Monday and we're excited to be working with him. He'll be instrumental in driving our near-term growth, while helping to prepare the organization to support our exciting pipeline.
In the first quarter we launched BENEPALI, our biosimilar version of Enbrel, in 6 European countries, the U.K., Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden and the Netherlands. And FLIXABI, our biosimilar version of Remicade, receive a positive opinion from the CHMP and we're awaiting approval from the European Commission shortly.
And, of course, an important part of our strategy for sustainable growth is our pipeline of potential future therapies. Notably, aducanumab is enrolling patients into a Phase III trials; opicinumab, which is anti-LINGO, results are expected midyear; and nusinersen, in collaboration with Ionis, is close to completing enrollment of the Phase III trial called [indiscernible]. Al will provide more color on the pipeline during his comments.
Finally, I'd like to make a few comments to address some questions that I know will come. First, we're in the final stages of hiring an R&D head and expect to make an announcement shortly. Second, like you, we've read the media reports about our hemophilia business and the subsequent analyst reports. As a matter of policy, we do not comment on speculation and will not do so in this instance. We're in an exciting stage in the evolution of Biogen. We're encouraged by the trajectory of our commercial portfolio and will continue to focus on cost containment to maximize our earnings. We're eagerly awaiting the data from opicinumab and nusinersen, and we're pleased with the early enthusiasm for our biosimilars in Europe. We recently brought several new compounds into development, and we continue to look for opportunities outside of Biogen. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Al, who'll update you on our progress in R&D."

This quarter, we continue to execute on our pipeline candidates and generate new data to support our commercialized products. Starting with opicinumab or anti-LINGO, we are looking forward to seeing the Phase II data, which is still scheduled for the middle of this year. I should note that no one has seen this data. But after more than a decade of work on LINGO, beginning with discovering the gene and elucidating its biology, most of which was conducted at Biogen, we're excited to learn about opicinumab's potential as a reparative therapy for MS.
In Alzheimer's disease, we are working diligently to enroll our aducanumab Phase III trials and are pleased with progress, thus far. Looking ahead, we anticipate safety data from the titration arm of the Phase 1b PRIME study in the second half of this year.
Amiselimod or MT-1303, our S1P1 inhibitor for IBD, is currently being tested in the Phase II trial in Crohn's disease and we're working toward the start of Phase III studies in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease in the second half of this year.
Raxatrigine, a small molecule inhibitor of the Nav 1.7 sodium channel, is anticipated to begin a Phase III trial to confirm its efficacy in patients with trigeminal neuralgia. And we are also planning to initiate a Phase II trial in patients with painful, lumbosacral later this year. 
Turning to our hemophilia products, we find the data that was presented at the December ASH meeting on immune tolerance induction with ELOCTATE quite encouraging. We believe that the SC portion of this fusion proteins utilized in both ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX may offer additional benefits beyond half-life extension. Although these preliminary findings will require comp confirmation from additional studies. 
At this week's American Academy of Neurology meeting, we presented important new data demonstrating the breadth and diversity of our marketed and pipeline multiple sclerosis therapies, including TECFIDERA, TYSABRI, ZINBRYTA and PLEGRIDY. Let me provide some of the highlights of our presentation.
TECFIDERA was shown to provide sustained and strong efficacy in newly diagnosed MS patients, reinforcing that earlier treatment with TECFIDERA is important in improving long-term clinical outcomes. We also presented the results of another study that retrospectively examine the health insurance claims database of more than 5,000 patients in routine clinical practice. 
Annualized relapse rates 1 year after starting disease-modifying therapy were compared to the year before therapy initiation. These real-world data support the efficacy of TECFIDERA treatment seen in the controlled clinical trials and this combined with the safety profile and oral convenience make it a very compelling therapeutic option for MS patients.
Data presented at AAN reinforce the nearly 10 years of clinical experience with TYSABRI confirming its high efficacy, reversible immune effects and well-characterized safety profile. ZINBRYTA with its targeted and reversible mechanism of action, was shown to be positive on key MS cognitive outcomes. PLEGRIDY was shown to reduce the conversion of newly acquired MS lesions into T1 black holes, which have been associated with external loss.
Also at AAN, our collaboration partner, Ionis, presented an update on the ongoing open-label Phase II trial of nusinersen in infants with spinal muscular atrophy. An analysis as of January 2016 showed no new events as defined by progression to permanent ventilation or death in the study since December of 2014, continued increases in muscle function scores and achievement of new motor milestones when compared to natural history studies. We believe these data look increasingly encouraging and nusinersen could represent an important new therapy for spinal muscular atrophy.
With respect to our earlier stage efforts, at our R&D day last November, we talked about using human genetics to identify cause of biological pathways as we strive to discover and develop new treatment for difficult diseases. In February, we joined the Centre for Therapeutic Target Validation, the pioneering public-private collaboration that fosters interactions between academic and industry members for the purpose of developing open, transformative approaches to selecting validated novel targets in drug development. This collaboration expands on our strategy of using genetically validated targets, biomarkers and multiple therapeutic approaches to decrease the risk of drug development. 
With that, I'll now pass the call to Paul."
29726,328802932,960509,"Biogen Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2016",2016-04-21,"Earnings Calls","Biogen Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Al. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $4.43 in the first quarter, while our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $4.79. Total revenue for Q1 grew 7% year-over-year to approximately $2.7 billion.Our revenue growth was driven by the sta",1000,"Thanks, Al. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $4.43 in the first quarter, while our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $4.79. Total revenue for Q1 grew 7% year-over-year to approximately $2.7 billion.
Our revenue growth was driven by the stable patient trends we now see for TECFIDERA and TYSABRI in the U.S. and continued growth in ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX. 
Although PLEGRIDY showed meaningful growth, our overall interferon business decline compared to the first quarter of last year as the market continues to migrate to orals. Overall, we're pleased that the breadth and strength of our product portfolio enabled us to absorb such fluctuations, expand our top line and maintain our global MS market share of approximately 38%.
As a reminder, we had $173 million in foreign exchange hedge gains in the 2015, which has begun to impact our year-over-year comparisons. Compared to the first quarter of last year, we had $26 million less in hedge gains this quarter. Combined with the $24 million headwind from natural foreign exchange rates, overall revenue was weakened by approximately $50 million year-over-year. I'll highlight the FX impact for each of the therapies.
Global first quarter TECFIDERA revenue was $946 million. We recorded revenues of $744 million in the U.S. and $202 million outside the U.S. In the U.S., we believe there was drawdown of TECFIDERA inventory in the wholesale channel representing approximately $20 million versus prior quarter. Despite an expected choppy start to the quarter as we work through the typical seasonality issues, we believe underlying U.S. TECFIDERA patient demand is largely stable. U.S. of gross to net percentage was comparable to Q4 and largely consistent with our average expected rate for the balance of the year.
Outside the U.S., foreign exchange impact including the reduction in hedge gains, weakened full year TECFIDERA revenue by approximately $14 million year-over-year. Last October, we bolstered our marketing efforts in the U.S. by launching a television campaign aimed at increasing patient awareness about MS and TECFIDERA. We believe we did increase awareness. Our current TV campaign will expire in the middle of this year. For various reasons, we plan to sunset this lever and don't currently plan to purchase additional TV spots beyond the middle of the year.
We do, nevertheless, plan to continue our marketing efforts across other print and digital channels. Interferon revenues, including both AVONEX and PLEGRIDY, were $670 million during the first quarter, which includes $467 million in the U.S. and $203 million in sales outside the U.S.
In the U.S., the results were weaker than anticipated due to a combination of lower underlying demand as patients continued to move toward orals, seasonality issues and a drawdown of AVONEX wholesale inventory of approximately $20 million. Outside the U.S., foreign exchange impact inclusive of a reduction in hedge gains, weakened Q1 interferon revenues by approximately $20 million year-over-year.
Now moving to TYSABRI. With nearly 10 years of postmarketing experience, TYSABRI continued to add patients this quarter with worldwide revenues of $477 million. These results were comprised of $288 million in the U.S. and $189 million internationally. We believe TYSABRI's well-understood safety profile and robust efficacy position it well. Foreign exchange impacts, including a reduction in hedge gains, weakened Q1 TYSABRI revenue by approximately $14 million year-over-year.
Turning to our hemophilia business. ELOCTATE revenue for the quarter was $108 million and ALPROLIX revenue in Q1 was $75 million. We recorded $329 million for Q1 in our anti-CD20 collaboration, which includes our profit share from RITUXAN and GAZYVA in the U.S. as well as our profit share in royalties on sales of rituximab outside the U.S. As expected, our share of pretax profits in the U.S. on sales of Rituxan decreased from 40% to 39% at the end of February, following approval of GAZYVA in RITUXAN refractory indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Total other revenues, which include revenues from collaboration relationships, royalties and contract manufacturing were $88 million. We continue to benefit this quarter from contract manufacturing revenue related to a strategic partner.
Now turning to the expense lines on the P&L. Q1 cost of goods sold were $313 million or 11% of revenue as we experience lower-than-typical write-ups of manufacturing runs in inventory. Q1 R&D expense was $437 million or 16% of revenue. Of note, in Q1, we did not have any meaningful business development expense. Recall in the fourth quarter, we made a $60 million payment to Mitsubishi Tanabe related to the in-licensing of MT-1303. Additionally, the lower-than-expected R&D run rate seen in Q1 was also favorably impacted by the timing of clinical manufacturing campaigns in other R&D activities.
Q1 SG&A expense was $497 million or 18% of revenue. We remain focused on achieving savings in nonlabor expenses with the objective of reducing lower priority fees and services for the balance of 2016. Other net expense was $53 million in Q1, which includes the interest expense related to our 2015 bond offering.
In Q1, our non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 26%. This rate was negatively impacted by approximately 150 basis points related to discrete items.
Our weighted average diluted share count was approximately 219 million for Q1. And we ended the quarter with approximately $6.8 billion in cash and marketable securities with approximately 45% of this in the U.S.
This brings us to our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, which were $4.79 for the quarter, representing a strong 25% increase year-over-year. Over the last few years, we've gone to an unprecedented number of product launches and thought it was the right strategy to not be penny wise and pound foolish. 
Starting in 2015, we pivoted to initiate a number of measures to curve operating expense growth. And late in 2015, we announced a restructuring, and we believe the benefits materialize this quarter.
For the balance of the year, we're focused on commercial execution and diligent efforts to further reduce spending where appropriate, while ensuring we simultaneously support the advancement of the pipeline. 
I'll turn the call over to George for his closing remarks comments."

Look, I'm pleased with the start of the year, and especially with the 25% increase in earnings versus Q1 of 2015. For the remainder of the year, we're focused on 3 areas: careful control of our costs, maximizing our revenues and rapidly advancing the pipeline. The cost reduction actions that we took last year resulted in a meaningful increase in earnings this quarter and as we move through the year we'll continue to focus on cost control to do all that we can to concentrate our resources in the activities that do we believe will have the greatest value.
On the revenue side, we're pleased to have Michel Vounatsos join us. I'm very confident in Michel and look forward to all that he and his did will do to maximize the value of our commercial portfolio as we move through this year and into next. We have great drugs that are benefiting a lot of patients, and we want to maximize the benefits to both patients and our shareholders.
Additionally, we hope to launch 2 additional compounds this year, ZINBRYTA and in the EU, FLIXABI. Since we think of revenue on a multiyear basis, we also will continue our focus on pursuing opportunities outside of Biogen. We continue to attract companies and compounds that are potentially interesting for us, and we are in constant discussions with multiple parties from the types of tuck-in acquisitions that we've done historically to later-stage assets closer to commercialization. And as we said in previous calls, we want to be active in this area, while remaining financially discipline.
This is a very important year for the advancement of our internal pipeline. It is important to make sure that the enrollment in the 2 Phase III trials of aducanumab continues to go well. We're pleased with how we're tracking so far but it's still early and we want to make sure that we stay on or ideally ahead of schedule for patient enrollment.
We aim to get the Phase III trials for raxatrigine and amiselimod starting on schedule. And we need to make sure that our early pipeline progresses quickly and that we make fact-based, go, no-go decisions. And, of course, once we have the Phase II data for opicinumab in the middle of the year, we'll quickly decide on the appropriate path forward for opicinumab itself and for the other remyelinating programs in our pipeline. 
As Al mentioned, the open-label data for nusinersen continue to look encouraging, and we need to do everything that we can to minimize the time to see data from the Phase III trials and if positive, to get the drug to patients as soon as possible
Although not so visible from outside the company, we'll continue to invest in R&D. We believe that our strategy of building world-class research and development will not only help us identify important new therapies ourselves but will also help us to make thoughtful, sophisticated decisions about what to bring in from outside the company.
So we have a lot to do. This is a year for us to keep our heads down and focus on execution and all of the areas that I just outlined. We have a great team and a dedicated group of employees. And as always, I'd like to thank our employees for making a positive impact on patients' lives and to thank the patients and physicians involved in our clinical development programs. The achievements that we've made together could not have been realized without their passion and commitment.

That's an important market outside the United States as you all know. When I go across other parts that really the big contributors outside the United States, it's kind of obviously France, U.K., Southern Europe countries of Italy and Spain. And we're very pleased with the performance in Southern Europe. Those our early days in terms of the launch curves for TECFIDERA specifically. We're very, very pleased with that. The performance has exceeded our expectations and certainly as we pointed out in the past, our U.K. performance is exceptionally strong. We've got what we feel is a remarkable team is there. They've kind of really -- really kind of broken down the marketplace and affected quite vigorously across the suite of Biogen MS therapies. So I think very pleased I'd say with the performance outside the United States with a little bit of homework to do in Germany, which, I think, we're actually showing some early signs, very early signs late in the quarter, positive signs. With respect to contracting, it is as people know, specific to AVONEX and PLEGRIDY, specific to newly diagnosed patients. I think that you combine that with typical seasonality issues in Q1, and we still feel we made the right choices there in terms of as we moved into 2016. So I think that's kind of -- we don't think there's been a meaningful impact. Certainly, we've kind of working through prior authorizations and things like that for some of the patients has become a more active part of what we do in our patient services organization."

And then we can then start to understand the relationship between reduction and plaque burden and cognitive outcome. In our hands, in the aducanumab program, only the patients who reduced plaque burden by greater than 1 standard deviation change relative to what the placebo patient did, in other words, beyond the noise. Those are the people who got cognitive benefit. The people who did not do that did not have any benefit that we could detect. So we think that's an important piece to look at."

You obviously have gotten a tailwind here with the significantly lower R&D expenses. You've tighten your belt on SG&A. But you did have what looks like $45 million of sequential currency headwind or loss of hedging from Q4. So how should we think about of those drivers for the rest of the year? Can you keep this sort of level on R&D and SG&A? And should we anticipate this kind the magnitude of currency effects through the balance of the year because of your hedge positions?"

So that was actually part of our business plan as we swung into 2016. And fundamentally, we're not -- we don't make productions about where the currency is going to go. But we fully anticipate anticipated the fact that we had hatched gains throughout the P&L in 2015 that really come about from the hedges that we put on in 2014. So it's essentially a wrap around effects of the currency changes, mostly in the EU as we kind of ended, ended if you remember the changes were a very end of December 2014 and January of 2015. So that was fully expected. And so we believe that, that will just continue to be a bit of a headwind, which we have talked about. The R&D, I think, I'd point out 1 key dynamic is it's always a little bit choppy R&D as a percentage of sales based on business development activity. And we certainly want to and would welcome really good business development activity that's always a positive investment, a positive expense if done correctly. With all that said, no doubt about it that, as I said, we have made cost control and feel like we're reaping the benefits of what we did late in 2015 as we came into this year. And I think it will continue to be a meaningful effort for me, from the whole organization to make sure we focus on efficiencies throughout the year."

In the longer term, there are a number of products as there are in every therapeutic area coming forward and we're keeping a close eye on them. There is certainly we saw data, which are interesting but early. I mean, I haven't seen anything that you haven't seen. I saw good [indiscernible] levels that persisted for some period of time, and we saw some liver enzyme ambitious that needed to be treated with corticosteroids specs, and we will see how that plays out over time. Those are early. I would say interesting data but early. A similar, I think, lower immune tolerance induction the that, that we have with ELOCTATE. And if you -- we haven't talked about this a lot but a fair number of hemophilia develop hematuria antibodies when they are treated and that results in the necessity for immune tolerance induction, which means high levels of factory that are given over a 12 to 18 months before immune intolerance emerges. There have been a very limited number of patients, 3, so I don't want to overstate this. Again, these are very early data and I don't want to be here overstating the case. But again, these are early data but also in encouraging. So of the 3 patients that have been treated with ELOCTATE from the intolerance induction, they all became tolerant within about 3 to 4 months. So a much shorter period of time. If those data are confirmed in further studies, we believe that, that could be important opportunities for ELOCTATE. So I think there are lots of early data emerging. They all need to be confirmed with larger studies. And we feel good about the business and where we are. We have our own longer-acting factors coming. We talked about some of them, there are earlier once that are in our research group now.

So I think that we've gone through the destocking of what we talked about last quarter and just wanted to kind of clarify with the prepared remarks. With respect to the balance sheet, I think it gets to the broader question of capital allocation. Currently, we're actually sitting on a pretty high cash balance. As I pointed out, like many others, we have the peculiar situation of ex-U.S. cash a little bit more than half of that. But outside from that, that largely arises out 2 things, the great strong cash flow generation of the company, coupled with the debt financing that we did in the fall of 2015. Look, I think that we're going to look to strategically deploy it. And if we come up that there are not options to strategically deploy it, we will look towards returning capital to shareholders. We don't measure that on as we've talked about before in the 90 day basis just because that's not the kind of clock speed of things. In both situations, it depends on price and value. So it continues to -- it depends. And in both situations, the financial objective is to maximize intrinsic value per share. So we look towards investing in and deployment of capital that really drive great internal rate of return. I think, I'd also point out, look, over a longer period of time, I think these companies with the great cash flow generation has flexibly to do both."

I think there are enough of those in the market. There are more coming. For many MS patients, those don't stop the progression, they the progression but they don't stop the progression. And so we believe like LINGO actually are the types of compounds that could actually transform that market and give additional vibrancy as we move out through the 20s.

And so what drives the progression beyond that? We believe is probably all. TAL comes on later. If you look at the imaging studies, tall comes on later and there's a lot of data, preclinical data that shows that the data triggers TAL pathology. So we're learning a lot about TAL now. We know in normal aging there is some aggravated TAL in the medial temporal lobe but in patients with Alzheimer's disease, it spreads beyond the medial temporal lobe and that spread is probably triggered by A beta. And so that's the reason why we have some programs in TAL. We've just -- we have some preclinical as well as early clinical programs of both antibodies as well as antisense. And so in the later stages, we might need to treat for TAL, perhaps, in combination with the A beta therapies because I don't think you want to reaccumulate  A beta once we remove it."

We've actually tested lambskin in our oligodendrocyte differentiation assay here and then in our hands it's less potent than our [ph] 61, our oral compound that we have in early clinical trials and it's also less effective overall in a side-by-side comparison in our hands. Nevertheless, I did look at the data, crossover designs like the 1 that they did are not, probably not the best approach for looking up disease-modifying therapies because when you switch from to placebo, I don't expect that if it is causing myelination, how would the placebo patients look? They would continue to get the benefit from the that they had received in the period prior. So, nevertheless, they did show a modest effect on latency of the conduction between the retina and the brain. And we're keeping a close eye on that. I think that these are all early day experiments in reparative therapies and I believe we have established one of the best ways of looking at this in our anti-LINGO program, both in the acute optic neuritis as well as the MS program.

And our non-GAAP EPS was $4.79, 25% increase from the same period a year ago. 
As you've heard from us since the beginning of the year, our cornerstone to our strategy for sustainable growth is our healthy commercial business and a strong focus on properly managing expenses. And I think these results should reinforce that message. 
TECFIDERA continues to gain share globally, now with more than 190,000 patients having been treated. And at AAN this week, we presented compelling data that showcased its strong and sustained efficacy in newly diagnosed MS patients, emphasizing that earlier treatment with TECFIDERA improves long-term clinical outcomes. We also presented compelling data about TECFIDERA's real-world efficacy. 
Last month, we announced that our new Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer, Michel Vounatsos have joined us. Michel brings a wealth of experience from 20 successful years of increasing responsibility at Merck, most recently as President of Primary Care and Customer Centricity. Michel officially started on Monday, and we're excited to be working with him. He'll be instrumental in driving our near-term growth, while helping to prepare the organization to support our exciting pipeline.
In the first quarter, we launched BENEPALI, our biosimilar version of Enbrel, in 6 European countries: the U.K., Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden and the Netherlands. And FLIXABI, our biosimilar version of Remicade, received a positive opinion from the CHMP, and we're awaiting approval from the European Commission shortly.
And of course, an important part of our strategy for sustainable growth is our pipeline of potential future therapies. Notably, aducanumab is enrolling patients in 2 Phase III trials; opicinumab, which is anti-LINGO, results are expected midyear; and nusinersen, in collaboration with Ionis, is close to completing enrollment of the Phase III trial called ENDEAR. Al will provide more color on the pipeline during his comments.
Finally, I'd like to make a few comments to address some questions that I know will come. First, we're in the final stages of hiring an R&D head and expect to make an announcement shortly. Second, like you, we've read the media reports about our hemophilia business and the subsequent analyst reports. As a matter of policy, we do not comment on speculation and will not do so in this instance. We're in an exciting stage in the evolution of Biogen. We're encouraged by the trajectory of our commercial portfolio, and will continue to focus on cost containment to maximize our earnings. We're eagerly awaiting the data from opicinumab and nusinersen, and we're pleased with the early enthusiasm for our biosimilars in Europe. We've recently brought several new compounds into development, and we continue to look for opportunities outside of Biogen. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Al, who'll update you on our progress in R&D."

This quarter, we continue to execute on our pipeline candidates and generate new data to support our commercialized products. Starting with opicinumab or anti-LINGO, we are looking forward to seeing the Phase II data, which is still scheduled for the middle of this year. I should note that no one has seen this data yet, but after more than a decade of work on LINGO, beginning with discovering the gene and in elucidating its biology, most of which was conducted at Biogen, we're excited to learn about opicinumab's potential as a reparative therapy for MS.
In Alzheimer's disease, we are working diligently to enroll our aducanumab Phase III trials, and are pleased with progress thus far. Looking ahead, we anticipate safety data from the titration arm of the Phase 1b PRIME study in the second half of this year.
Amiselimod or MT-1303, our S1P1 inhibitor for IBD, is currently being tested in the Phase II trial in Crohn's disease, and we are working toward the start of Phase III studies in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease in the second half of this year.
Raxatrigine, a small molecule inhibitor of the Nav 1.7 sodium channel, is anticipated to begin a Phase III trial to confirm its efficacy in patients with trigeminal neuralgia. And we are also planning to initiate a Phase II trial in patients with painful, lumbosacral radiculopathy later this year. 
Turning to our hemophilia products, we find the data that was presented at the December ASH meeting on immune tolerance induction with ELOCTATE quite encouraging. We believe that the SC portion of these fusion proteins utilized in both ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX may offer additional benefits beyond half-life extension, although these preliminary findings will require confirmation from additional studies. 
At this week's American Academy of Neurology meeting, we presented important new data demonstrating the breadth and diversity of our marketed and pipeline multiple sclerosis therapies, including TECFIDERA, TYSABRI, ZINBRYTA and PLEGRIDY. Let me provide some of the highlights of our presentation.
TECFIDERA was shown to provide sustained and strong efficacy in newly diagnosed MS patients, reinforcing that earlier treatment with TECFIDERA is important in improving long-term clinical outcomes. We also presented the results of another study that retrospectively examined the health insurance claims database of more than 5,000 patients in routine clinical practice. 
Annualized relapse rates 1 year after starting disease-modifying therapy were compared to the year before therapy initiation. These real-world data support the efficacy of TECFIDERA treatment seen in the controlled clinical trials and this, combined with its safety profile and oral convenience, make it a very compelling therapeutic option for MS patients.
Data presented at AAN reinforced the nearly 10 years of clinical experience with TYSABRI, confirming its high efficacy, reversible immune effects and well-characterized safety profile. 
ZINBRYTA, with its targeted and reversible mechanism of action, was shown to be positive on key MS cognitive outcomes. 
PLEGRIDY was shown to reduce the conversion of newly acquired MS lesions into T1 black holes, which have been associated with axonal loss.
Also at AAN, our collaboration partner, Ionis, presented an update on the ongoing open-label Phase II trial of nusinersen in infants with spinal muscular atrophy. An analysis as of January 2016 showed no new events as defined by progression to permanent ventilation or death in the study since December of 2014, continued increases in muscle function scores and achievement of new motor milestones when compared to natural history studies. We believe these data look increasingly encouraging, and that nusinersen could represent an important new therapy for spinal muscular atrophy.
With respect to our earlier stage efforts, at our R&D day last November, we talked about using human genetics to identify causal biological pathways as we strive to discover and develop new treatment for difficult diseases. In February, we joined the Centre for Therapeutic Target Validation, the pioneering public-private collaboration that fosters interactions between academic and industry members for the purpose of developing open, transformative approaches to selecting and validating novel targets in drug development. This collaboration expands on our strategy of using genetically validated targets, biomarkers and multiple therapeutic approaches to decrease the risk of drug development. 
With that, I'll now pass the call to Paul."

Our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $4.43 in the first quarter, while our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $4.79.

Our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $4.43 in the first quarter, while our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $4.79. Total revenue for Q1 grew 7% year-over-year to approximately $2.7 billion.
Our revenue growth was driven by the stable patient trends we now see for TECFIDERA and TYSABRI in the U.S. and continued growth in ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX. 
Although PLEGRIDY showed meaningful growth, our overall interferon business declined compared to the first quarter of last year as the market continues to migrate to orals. Overall, we're pleased that the breadth and strength of our product portfolio enabled us to absorb such fluctuations, expand our top line and maintain our global MS market share of approximately 38%.
As a reminder, we had $173 million in foreign exchange hedge gains in the 2015, which has begun to impact our year-over-year comparisons. Compared to the first quarter of last year, we had $26 million less in hedge gains this quarter. Combined with the $24 million headwind from natural foreign exchange rates, overall revenue was weakened by approximately $50 million year-over-year. I'll highlight the FX impact for each of the therapies.
Global first quarter TECFIDERA revenue was $946 million. We recorded revenues of $744 million in the U.S. and $202 million outside the U.S. In the U.S., we believe there was a drawdown of TECFIDERA inventory in the wholesale channel, representing approximately $20 million versus prior quarter. Despite an expected choppy start to the quarter as we work through the typical seasonality issues, we believe underlying U.S. TECFIDERA patient demand is largely stable. U.S. gross-to-net percentage was comparable to Q4 and largely consistent with our average expected rate for the balance of the year.
Outside the U.S., foreign exchange impact, including the reduction in hedge gains, weakened full year TECFIDERA revenue by approximately $14 million year-over-year. Last October, we bolstered our marketing efforts in the U.S. by launching a television campaign aimed at increasing patient awareness about MS and TECFIDERA. We believe we did increase awareness. Our current TV campaign will expire in the middle of this year. For various reasons, we plan to sunset this lever, and don't currently plan to purchase additional TV spots beyond the middle of the year.
We do, nevertheless, plan to continue our marketing efforts across other print and digital channels. Interferon revenues, including both AVONEX and PLEGRIDY, were $670 million during the first quarter, which includes $467 million in the U.S. and $203 million in sales outside the U.S.
In the U.S., the results were weaker than anticipated due to a combination of lower underlying demand as patients continued to move toward orals, seasonality issues and a drawdown of AVONEX wholesale inventory of approximately $20 million. Outside the U.S., foreign exchange impact, inclusive of a reduction in hedge gains, weakened Q1 interferon revenues by approximately $20 million year-over-year.
Now moving to TYSABRI. With nearly 10 years of postmarketing experience, TYSABRI continued to add patients this quarter with worldwide revenues of $477 million. These results were comprised of $288 million in the U.S. and $189 million internationally. We believe TYSABRI's well-understood safety profile and robust efficacy position it well. Foreign exchange impacts, including a reduction in hedge gains, weakened Q1 TYSABRI revenue by approximately $14 million year-over-year.
Turning to our hemophilia business. ELOCTATE revenue for the quarter was $108 million and ALPROLIX revenue in Q1 was $75 million. We recorded $329 million for Q1 in our anti-CD20 collaboration, which includes our profit share from RITUXAN and GAZYVA in the U.S. as well as our profit share in royalties on sales of rituximab outside the U.S. As expected, our share of pretax profits in the U.S. on sales of RITUXAN decreased from 40% to 39% at the end of February, following approval of GAZYVA in RITUXAN refractory indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. 
Total other revenues, which include revenues from collaboration relationships, royalties and contract manufacturing were $88 million. We continue to benefit this quarter from contract manufacturing revenue related to a strategic partner.
Now turning to the expense lines on the P&L. Q1 cost of goods sold were $313 million or 11% of revenue as we experienced lower-than-typical write-offs of manufacturing runs in inventory. Q1 R&D expense was $437 million or 16% of revenue. Of note, in Q1, we did not have any meaningful business development expense. Recall, in the fourth quarter, we made a $60 million payment to Mitsubishi Tanabe related to the in-licensing of MT-1303. Additionally, the lower-than-expected R&D run rate seen in Q1 was also favorably impacted by the timing of clinical manufacturing campaigns in other R&D activities.
Q1 SG&A expense was $497 million or 18% of revenue. We remain focused on achieving savings in nonlabor expenses with the objective of reducing lower priority fees and services for the balance of 2016. Other net expense was $53 million in Q1, which includes the interest expense related to our 2015 bond offering.
In Q1, our non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 26%. This rate was negatively impacted by approximately 150 basis points related to discrete items.
Our weighted average diluted share count was approximately 219 million for Q1. And we ended the quarter with approximately $6.8 billion in cash and marketable securities, with approximately 45% of this in the U.S.
This brings us to our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, which were $4.79 for the quarter, representing a strong 25% increase year-over-year. Over the last few years, we've gone to an unprecedented number of product launches and thought it was the right strategy to not be penny wise and pound foolish. 
Starting in 2015, we pivoted to initiate a number of measures to curb operating expense growth. And late in 2015, we announced a restructuring, and we believe the benefits materialize this quarter.
For the balance of the year, we're focused on commercial execution and diligent efforts to further reduce spending where appropriate, while ensuring we simultaneously support the advancement of the pipeline. 
I'll turn the call over to George for his closing comments."

For the remainder of the year, we're focused on 3 areas: careful control of our costs, maximizing our revenues and rapidly advancing the pipeline. The cost reduction actions that we took last year resulted in a meaningful increase in earnings this quarter. And as we move through the year, we'll continue to focus on cost control to do all that we can to concentrate our resources on the activities that we believe will add the greatest value.
On the revenue side, we're pleased to have Michel Vounatsos join us. I'm very confident in Michel and look forward to all that he and his team will do to maximize the value of our commercial portfolio as we move through this year and into next. We have great drugs that are benefiting a lot of patients, and we want to maximize the benefits to both patients and our shareholders.
Additionally, we hope to launch 2 additional compounds this year, ZINBRYTA; and in the EU, FLIXABI. Since we think of revenue on a multiyear basis, we also will continue our focus on pursuing opportunities outside of Biogen. We continue to attract companies and compounds that are potentially interesting for us, and we are in constant discussions with multiple parties from the types of tuck-in acquisitions that we've done historically to later-stage assets closer to commercialization. And as we said in previous calls, we want to be active in this area, while remaining financially disciplined.
This is a very important year for the advancement of our internal pipeline, and it's important to make sure that the enrollment in the 2 Phase III trials of aducanumab continues to go well. We're pleased with how we're tracking so far, but it's still early and we want to make sure that we stay on or ideally ahead of schedule for patient enrollment.
We aim to get the Phase III trials for raxatrigine and amiselimod started on schedule. And we need to make sure that our early pipeline progresses quickly and that we make fact-based go, no-go decisions. And of course, once we have the Phase II data for opicinumab in the middle of the year, we'll quickly decide on the appropriate path forward for opicinumab itself and for the other remyelinating programs in our pipeline. 
As Al mentioned, the open-label data for nusinersen continue to look encouraging, and we need to do everything that we can to minimize the time to see data from the Phase III trials and, if positive, to get the drug to patients as soon as possible.
Although not so visible from outside the company, we'll continue to invest in R&D. We believe that our strategy of building world-class research and development will not only help us identify important new therapies ourselves but will also help us to make thoughtful, sophisticated decisions about what to bring in from outside the company.
So we have a lot to do. This is a year for us to keep our heads down and focus on execution in all of the areas that I just outlined. We have a great team and a dedicated group of employees. And as always, I'd like to thank our employees for making a positive impact on patients' lives and to thank the patients and physicians involved in our clinical development programs. The achievements that we've made together could not have been realized without their passion and commitment.

That's an important market outside the United States, as you all know. When I go across other parts that really are the big contributors outside the United States, it's kind of, obviously, France, U.K., Southern Europe countries of Italy and Spain. And we're very pleased with the performance in Southern Europe. Those are early days in terms of the launch curves for TECFIDERA specifically. We're very, very pleased with that. The performance has exceeded our expectations. And certainly, as we pointed out in the past, our U.K. performance is exceptionally strong. We've got what we feel is a remarkable team there. They've kind of really -- really kind of broken down the marketplace and attacked it quite vigorously across the suite of Biogen MS therapies. So I think very pleased, I'd say, with the performance outside the United States, with a little bit of homework to do in Germany which, I think, we're actually showing some early signs, very early signs late in the quarter, positive signs. With respect to contracting, it is as people know, specific to AVONEX and PLEGRIDY, specific to newly diagnosed patients. I think that you combine that with typical seasonality issues in Q1, and we still feel we made the right choices there in terms of as we moved into 2016.

On the -- so many questions asked, maybe Al, just because this is the one I get the most, just going back to the Eisai collaboration and the Abeta antibody that may or may not have data shortly. The question that I've been getting -- I just love to hear your thoughts are, you emphasized a lot when looking at these competing Abeta antibody is really understanding if -- what the imaging data show post therapy, that is, is it draining plaque from the brain? And if the answer to that is no, then the clinical outcome is perhaps less important because it doesn't do what your amaB does, so to speak. And -- but there's been some questions about, specifically, where the Eisai BAN antibody binds, which types of fibrils and whether or not, given its binding -- its specific binding affinities, whether or not you would expect necessarily to see changes on PET scan? So I just wondered if you could talk us through that."

The question for me is, does it do that, first of all; and second, to what degree? The thing that was remarkable about aducanumab was that we had a very substantial reduction in the course of 1 year. Arguably, 85% or so. Competitor antibodies have not done that, and I don't know where 2401 will land but that's an important piece. And then we can then start to understand the relationship between reduction and plaque burden and cognitive outcome. In our hands, in the aducanumab program, only the patients who reduced plaque burden by greater than 1 standard deviation changed relative to what the placebo patient did, in other words, beyond the noise. Those are the people who got cognitive benefit. The people who did not do that did not have any benefit that we could detect. So we think that's an important piece to look at."

We actually, importantly, think that we're kind of on -- and hopefully, on the backside of that; that the medical education has largely been completed.

So that was actually part of our business plan as we swung into 2016. And fundamentally, we're not -- we don't make predictions about where the currencies are going to go. But we fully anticipated the fact that we had hedge gains throughout the P&L in 2015 that really come about from the hedges that we put on in 2014. So it's essentially a wraparound effect of the currency changes, mostly in the EU as we kind of ended, very end -- if you remember the changes were very end of December 2014 and January of 2015. So that was fully expected. And so we believe that, that will just continue to be a bit of a headwind, which we had thought about. The R&D, I think, I'd point out 1 key dynamic is it's always a little bit choppy, R&D as a percentage of sales, based on business development activity. And we certainly want to and would welcome really good business development activity that's always a positive investment, a positive expense if done correctly. With all that said, no doubt about it that, as I said, we have made cost control and feel like we're reaping the benefits of what we did late in 2015 as we came into this year. And I think it will continue to be a meaningful effort for me, from the whole organization to make sure we focus on efficiencies throughout the year."

So we're feeling good about them here. We have not yet seen any impact on their trajectories from the introduction of other long-acting factors. So we take that as a positive sign. So I think the prospects for the business look quite healthy. In the longer term, there are a number of products, as there are in every therapeutic area, coming forward; and we're keeping a close eye on them. There is certainly -- we saw BioMarin's data, which are interesting but early. I mean, I haven't seen anything that you haven't seen. I saw good factor VIII levels that persisted for some period of time, and we saw some liver enzyme issues that needed to be treated with corticosteroids. So we'll see how that plays out over time. Those are early. I would say interesting data, but early. It's similar, I think, to our immune tolerance induction data that we have with ELOCTATE. And if you -- we haven't talked about this a lot, but a fair number of hemophiliacs [ph] develop inhibitory antibodies when they're treated, and that results in the necessity for immune tolerance induction, which means high levels of factor that are given over 12 to 18 months before immune tolerance emerges. There have been a very limited number of patients, 3, so I don't want to overstate this. Again, these are very early data, so -- and I don't want to be here overstating the case. But again, these are early data but also encouraging. So of the 3 patients that have been treated with ELOCTATE from the immune tolerance induction, they all became tolerant within about 3 to 4 months. So a much shorter period of time. If those data are confirmed in further studies, we believe that, that could be an important upward lift for ELOCTATE. So I think there are lots of early data emerging. They all need to be confirmed with larger studies. And we feel good about the business and where we are. We have our own longer-acting factors coming. We talked about some of them, there are earlier ones that are in our research group now.

So I think that we've gone through the destocking of what we talked about last quarter and just wanted to kind of clarify it with the prepared remarks. With respect to the balance sheet, I think it gets to the broader question of capital allocation. Currently, we're actually sitting on a pretty high cash balance. As I pointed out, like many others, we have the peculiar situation of ex U.S. cash as a little bit more than half of that. But aside from that, that largely arises out of 2 things, the great strong cash flow generation of the company, coupled with the debt financing that we did in the fall of 2015. Look, I think we're going to -- we will look to strategically deploy it. And if we come up that there are not options to strategically deploy it, we will look towards returning capital to shareholders. We don't measure that on a -- as we've talked about before, on a 90-day basis just because that's not the kind of clock speed of things. In both situations, it depends on price and value. So it continues to -- it depends. And in both situations, the financial objective is to maximize intrinsic value per share. So we look towards investing in deployments of capital that really drive great internal rates of return. I think I'd also point out, look, over a longer period of time, I think this company, with the great cash flow generation it has, has flexibly to do both."

And so we believe things like LINGO actually are the types of compounds that could actually transform that market and give it additional vibrancy as we move out through the 20s.

But the standard of practice changes over time. So these patients might be getting better over time just by the clinical practice improving. On the other hand, when you start to see lack of events of the type that was shown at the AAN since December of 2014, no new events, that's pretty striking difference. And these are hard endpoints, like time to tracheostomy or ventilation and time to death. It's hard for me to see how that kind of thing could be happening due to simply improving medical care. So I think we're getting more and more encouraged, but I would note that we have these 2 well-controlled trials, 1 in infant onset SMA and 1 in childhood onset SMA. And that, to me, is the definitive data set that we're going to be looking at. And in terms of the opportunities in infant and childhood, I mean, I think they're both big opportunities and I look forward to being able to help patients in both categories."

If you look at the imaging studies, tau comes on later and there's a lot of data, preclinical data, that shows that Abeta pathology triggers tau pathology. So we're learning a lot about tau now. We know that in normal aging, there is some aggregated tau in the medial temporal lobe; but in patients with Alzheimer's disease, it spreads beyond the medial temporal lobe. And that spread is probably triggered by Abeta. And so that's the reason why we have some programs in tau. We've just -- we have some preclinical as well as early clinical programs of both antibodies as well as antisense. And so in the later stages, we might need to treat for tau, perhaps, in combination with the Abeta therapies because I don't think you want to reaccumulate Abeta once you've removed it."

And what they found was that there were a number of antimuscarinic compounds that work, benztropine as well as clemastine. We've actually tested clemastine in our oligodendrocyte differentiation assay here and in our hands, it's less potent than BIIB061, our oral compound that we have in early clinical trials and it's also less effective overall in a side-by-side comparison in our hands. Nevertheless, I did look at the data, crossover designs like the one that they did are not -- probably not the best approach for looking at disease-modifying therapies because when you switch from clemastine to placebo, I don't expect that if it is causing myelination, how would the placebo patients look? They would continue to get the benefit from the clemastine that they had received in the period prior. So nevertheless, they did show a modest effect on latency of the conductions between the retina and the brain. And we're keeping a close eye on that.

As you've heard from us since the beginning of the year, a cornerstone to our strategy for sustainable growth is our healthy commercial business and a strong focus on properly managing expenses. And I think these results should reinforce that message. 
TECFIDERA continues to gain share globally, now with more than 190,000 patients having been treated. And at AAN this week, we presented compelling data that showcased its strong and sustained efficacy in newly diagnosed MS patients, emphasizing that earlier treatment with TECFIDERA improves long-term clinical outcomes. We also presented compelling data about TECFIDERA's real-world efficacy. 
Last month, we announced that our new Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer, Michel Vounatsos had joined us. Michel brings a wealth of experience from 20 successful years of increasing responsibility at Merck, most recently as President of Primary Care and Customer Centricity. Michel officially started on Monday, and we're excited to be working with him. He'll be instrumental in driving our near-term growth, while helping to prepare the organization to support our exciting pipeline.
In the first quarter, we launched BENEPALI, our biosimilar version of Enbrel, in 6 European countries: the U.K., Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden and the Netherlands. And FLIXABI, our biosimilar version of Remicade, received a positive opinion from the CHMP, and we're awaiting approval from the European Commission shortly.
And of course, an important part of our strategy for sustainable growth is our pipeline of potential future therapies. Notably, aducanumab is enrolling patients in 2 Phase III trials; opicinumab, which is anti-LINGO, results are expected midyear; and nusinersen, in collaboration with Ionis, is close to completing enrollment of the Phase III trial called ENDEAR. Al will provide more color on the pipeline during his comments.
Finally, I'd like to make a few comments to address some questions that I know will come. First, we're in the final stages of hiring an R&D head and expect to make an announcement shortly. Second, like you, we've read the media reports about our hemophilia business and the subsequent analyst reports. As a matter of policy, we do not comment on speculation and will not do so in this instance. We're in an exciting stage in the evolution of Biogen. We're encouraged by the trajectory of our commercial portfolio, and we'll continue to focus on cost containment to maximize our earnings. We're eagerly awaiting the data from opicinumab and nusinersen, and we're pleased with the early enthusiasm for our biosimilars in Europe. We've recently brought several new compounds into development, and we continue to look for opportunities outside of Biogen. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Al, who'll update you on our progress in R&D."

This quarter, we continued to execute on our pipeline candidates and generate new data to support our commercialized products. Starting with opicinumab, or anti-LINGO, we are looking forward to seeing the Phase II data, which is still scheduled for the middle of this year. I should note that no one has seen these data yet, but after more than a decade of work on LINGO, beginning with discovering the gene and then elucidating its biology, most of which was conducted at Biogen, we're excited to learn about opicinumab's potential as a reparative therapy for MS.
In Alzheimer's disease, we are working diligently to enroll our aducanumab Phase III trials, and are pleased with progress thus far. Looking ahead, we anticipate safety data from the titration arm of the Phase 1b PRIME study in the second half of this year.
Amiselimod, or MT-1303, our S1P1 inhibitor for IBD, is currently being tested in a Phase II trial in Crohn's disease, and we are working toward the start of Phase III studies in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease in the second half of this year.
Raxatrigine, a small molecule inhibitor of the Nav 1.7 sodium channel, is anticipated to begin a Phase III trial to confirm its efficacy in patients with trigeminal neuralgia. And we are also planning to initiate a Phase II trial in patients with painful lumbosacral radiculopathy later this year. 
Turning to our hemophilia products, we find the data that was presented at the December ASH meeting on immune tolerance induction with ELOCTATE quite encouraging. We believe that the SC portion of these fusion proteins utilized in both ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX may offer additional benefits beyond half-life extension, although these preliminary findings will require confirmation from additional studies. 
At this week's American Academy of Neurology meeting, we presented important new data demonstrating the breadth and diversity of our marketed and pipeline multiple sclerosis therapies, including TECFIDERA, TYSABRI, ZINBRYTA and PLEGRIDY. Let me provide some of the highlights of our presentation.
TECFIDERA was shown to provide sustained and strong efficacy in newly diagnosed MS patients, reinforcing that earlier treatment with TECFIDERA is important in improving long-term clinical outcomes. We also presented the results of another study that retrospectively examined the health insurance claims database of more than 5,000 patients in routine clinical practice. 
Annualized relapse rates 1 year after starting disease-modifying therapy were compared to the year before therapy initiation. These real-world data support the efficacy of TECFIDERA treatment seen in the controlled clinical trials, and this, combined with its safety profile and oral convenience, make it a very compelling therapeutic option for MS patients.
Data presented at AAN reinforced the nearly 10 years of clinical experience with TYSABRI, confirming its high efficacy, reversible immune effects and well-characterized safety profile. 
ZINBRYTA, with its targeted and reversible mechanism of action, was shown to be positive on key MS cognitive outcomes. 
PLEGRIDY was shown to reduce the conversion of newly acquired MS lesions into T1 black holes, which have been associated with axonal loss.
Also at AAN, our collaboration partner, Ionis, presented an update on the ongoing open-label Phase II trial of nusinersen in infants with spinal muscular atrophy. An analysis as of January 2016 showed no new events as defined by progression to permanent ventilation or death in the study since December of 2014, continued increases in muscle function scores and achievement of new motor milestones when compared to natural history studies. We believe these data look increasingly encouraging, and that nusinersen could represent an important new therapy for spinal muscular atrophy.
With respect to our earlier stage efforts, at our R&D day last November, we talked about using human genetics to identify causal biological pathways as we strive to discover and develop new treatment for difficult diseases. In February, we joined the Centre for Therapeutic Target Validation, the pioneering public-private collaboration that fosters interactions between academic and industry members for the purpose of developing open, transformative approaches to selecting unvalidated novel targets in drug development. This collaboration expands on our strategy of using genetically validated targets, biomarkers and multiple therapeutic approaches to decrease the risk of drug development. 
With that, I'll now pass the call to Paul."

Our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $4.43 in the first quarter, while our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $4.79. Total revenue for Q1 grew 7% year-over-year to approximately $2.7 billion.
Our revenue growth was driven by the stable patient trends we now see for TECFIDERA and TYSABRI in the U.S. and continued growth in ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX. 
Although PLEGRIDY showed meaningful growth, our overall interferon business declined compared to the first quarter of last year as the market continues to migrate to orals. Overall, we're pleased that the breadth and strength of our product portfolio enabled us to absorb such fluctuations, expand our top line and maintain our global MS market share of approximately 38%.
As a reminder, we had $173 million in foreign exchange hedge gains in 2015, which has begun to impact our year-over-year comparisons. Compared to the first quarter of last year, we had $26 million less in hedge gains this quarter. Combined with a $24 million headwind from natural foreign exchange rates, overall revenue was weakened by approximately $50 million year-over-year. I'll highlight the FX impact for each of the therapies.
Global first quarter TECFIDERA revenue was $946 million. We recorded revenues of $744 million in the U.S. and $202 million outside the U.S. In the U.S., we believe there was a drawdown of TECFIDERA inventory in the wholesale channel, representing approximately $20 million versus prior quarter. Despite an expected choppy start to the quarter as we work through the typical seasonality issues, we believe underlying U.S. TECFIDERA patient demand is largely stable. U.S. gross-to-net percentage was comparable to Q4 and largely consistent with our average expected rate for the balance of the year.
Outside the U.S., foreign exchange impact, including the reduction in hedge gains, weakened full year TECFIDERA revenue by approximately $14 million year-over-year. Last October, we bolstered our marketing efforts in the U.S. by launching a television campaign aimed at increasing patient awareness about MS and TECFIDERA. We believe we did increase awareness. Our current TV campaign will expire in the middle of this year. For various reasons, we plan to sunset this lever, and don't currently plan to purchase additional TV spots beyond the middle of the year.
We do, nevertheless, plan to continue our marketing efforts across other print and digital channels. Interferon revenues, including both AVONEX and PLEGRIDY, were $670 million during the first quarter, which includes $467 million in the U.S. and $203 million in sales outside the U.S.
In the U.S., the results were weaker than anticipated due to a combination of lower underlying demand as patients continued to move toward orals, seasonality issues and a drawdown of AVONEX wholesale inventory of approximately $20 million. Outside the U.S., foreign exchange impact, inclusive of a reduction in hedge gains, weakened Q1 interferon revenues by approximately $20 million year-over-year.
Now moving to TYSABRI. With nearly 10 years of postmarketing experience, TYSABRI continued to add patients this quarter, with worldwide revenues of $477 million. These results were comprised of $288 million in the U.S. and $189 million internationally. We believe TYSABRI's well-understood safety profile and robust efficacy position it well. Foreign exchange impact, including a reduction in hedge gains, weakened Q1 TYSABRI revenue by approximately $14 million year-over-year.
Turning to our hemophilia business. ELOCTATE revenue for the quarter was $108 million and ALPROLIX revenue in Q1 was $75 million. We recorded $329 million for Q1 in our anti-CD20 collaboration, which includes our profit share from RITUXAN and GAZYVA in the U.S. as well as our profit share in royalties on sales of rituximab outside the U.S. As expected, our share of pretax profits in the U.S. on sales of RITUXAN decreased from 40% to 39% at the end of February, following approval of GAZYVA in RITUXAN refractory indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. 
Total other revenues, which include revenues from collaboration relationships, royalties and contract manufacturing were $88 million. We continued to benefit this quarter from contract manufacturing revenue related to a strategic partner.
Now turning to the expense lines on the P&L. Q1 cost of goods sold were $313 million or 11% of revenue as we experienced lower-than-typical write-offs of manufacturing runs in inventory. Q1 R&D expense was $437 million or 16% of revenue. Of note, in Q1, we did not have any meaningful business development expense. Recall, in the fourth quarter, we made a $60 million payment to Mitsubishi Tanabe related to the in-licensing of MT-1303. Additionally, the lower-than-expected R&D run rate seen in Q1 was also favorably impacted by the timing of clinical manufacturing campaigns and other R&D activities.
Q1 SG&A expense was $497 million or 18% of revenue. We remain focused on achieving savings in nonlabor expenses with the objective of reducing lower priority fees and services for the balance of 2016. Other net expense was $53 million in Q1, which includes the interest expense related to our 2015 bond offering.
In Q1, our non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 26%. This rate was negatively impacted by approximately 150 basis points related to discrete items.
Our weighted average diluted share count was approximately 219 million for Q1. And we ended the quarter with approximately $6.8 billion in cash and marketable securities, with approximately 45% of this in the U.S.
This brings us to our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, which were $4.79 for the quarter, representing a strong 25% increase year-over-year. Over the last few years, we've gone through an unprecedented number of product launches and thought it was the right strategy to not be penny wise and pound foolish. 
Starting in 2015, we pivoted to initiate a number of measures to curb operating expense growth. And late in 2015, we announced a restructuring, and we believe the benefits materialized this quarter.
For the balance of the year, we're focused on commercial execution and diligent efforts to further reduce spending where appropriate, while ensuring we simultaneously support the advancement of the pipeline. 
I'll turn the call over to George for his closing comments."

Look, I'm pleased with the start of the year, and especially with the 25% increase in earnings versus Q1 of 2015. For the remainder of the year, we're focused on 3 areas: careful control of our costs, maximizing our revenues and rapidly advancing the pipeline. The cost reduction actions that we took last year resulted in a meaningful increase in earnings this quarter. And as we move through the year, we'll continue to focus on cost control to do all that we can to concentrate our resources on the activities that we believe will add the greatest value.
On the revenue side, we're pleased to have Michel Vounatsos join us. I'm very confident in Michel and look forward to all that he and his team will do to maximize the value of our commercial portfolio as we move through this year and into next. We have great drugs that are benefiting a lot of patients, and we want to maximize the benefits to both patients and our shareholders.
Additionally, we hope to launch 2 additional compounds this year, ZINBRYTA; and in the EU, FLIXABI. Since we think of revenue on a multiyear basis, we also will continue our focus on pursuing opportunities outside of Biogen. We continue to attract companies and compounds that are potentially interesting for us, and we are in constant discussions with multiple parties from the types of tuck-in acquisitions that we've done historically to later-stage assets closer to commercialization. And as we said in previous calls, we want to be active in this area, while remaining financially disciplined.
This is a very important year for the advancement of our internal pipeline, and it's important to make sure that the enrollment in the 2 Phase III trials of aducanumab continues to go well. We're pleased with how we're tracking so far, but it's still early and we want to make sure that we stay on or ideally ahead of schedule for patient enrollment.
We aim to get the Phase III trials for raxatrigine and amiselimod started on schedule. And we need to make sure that our early pipeline progresses quickly and that we make fact-based go, no-go decisions. And of course, once we have the Phase II data for opicinumab in the middle of the year, we'll quickly decide on the appropriate path forward for opicinumab itself and for the other remyelinating programs in our pipeline. 
As Al mentioned, the open-label data for nusinersen continue to look encouraging, and we need to do everything that we can to minimize the time to see data from the Phase III trials and, if positive, to get the drug to patients as soon as possible.
Although not so visible from outside the company, we'll continue to invest in R&D. We believe that our strategy of building world-class research and development will not only help us identify important new therapies ourselves but will also help us to make thoughtful, sophisticated decisions about what to bring in from outside the company.
So we have a lot to do. This is a year for us to keep our heads down and focus on execution in all of the areas that I just outlined. We have a great team and a dedicated group of employees. And as always, I'd like to thank our employees for making a positive impact on patients' lives and to thank the patients and physicians involved in our clinical development programs. The achievements that we've made together could not have been realized without their passion and commitment. 
So thank you all for joining us this morning."

That's an important market outside the United States, as you all know. When I go across other parts that really are the big contributors outside the United States, it's kind of, obviously, France, U.K., Southern Europe countries of Italy and Spain. And we're very pleased with the performance in Southern Europe. Those are early days in terms of the launch curves for TECFIDERA specifically. We're very, very pleased with that. The performance has exceeded our expectations. And certainly, as we've pointed out in the past, our U.K. performance is exceptionally strong. We've got what we feel is a remarkable team there. They've kind of really -- really kind of broken down the marketplace and attacked it quite vigorously across the suite of Biogen MS therapies. So I think very pleased, I'd say, with the performance outside the United States, with a little bit of homework to do in Germany, which, I think, we're actually showing some early signs, very early signs late in the quarter, positive signs. With respect to contracting, it is as people know, specific to AVONEX and PLEGRIDY, specific to newly diagnosed patients. I think that you combine that with typical seasonality issues in Q1, and we still feel we made the right choices there in terms of as we moved into 2016.

The question that I've been getting -- I'd just love to hear your thoughts are, you emphasized a lot when looking at these competing Abeta antibodies really understanding if -- what the imaging data show post therapy, that is, is it draining plaque from the brain? And if the answer to that is no, then the clinical outcome is perhaps less important because it doesn't do what your amaB does, so to speak. And -- but there's been some questions about, specifically, where the Eisai BAN antibody binds, which types of fibrils and whether or not, given its binding -- its specific binding affinities, whether or not you would expect necessarily to see changes on PET scan?

Arguably 85% or so. Competitor antibodies have not done that, and I don't know where 2401 will land but that's an important piece. And then we can then start to understand the relationship between reduction in plaque burden and cognitive outcome. In our hands, in the aducanumab program, only the patients who reduced plaque burden by greater than 1 standard deviation change relative to what the placebo patients did, in other words, beyond the noise, those are the people who got cognitive benefit. The people who did not do that did not have any benefit that we could detect. So we think that's an important piece to look at."

And all the disease-modifying therapies have discontinuation rates. And we think that TECFIDERA experienced higher discontinuation rates than normal as we moved through 2015, largely due to lymphocyte monitoring and kind of a label change. We actually, importantly, think that we're kind of on -- hopefully, on the back side of that; that the medical education has largely been completed.

So that was actually part of our business plan as we swung into 2016. And fundamentally, we're not -- we don't make predictions about where currencies are going to go. But we fully anticipated the fact that we had hedge gains throughout the P&L in 2015 that really come about from the hedges that we put on in 2014. So it's essentially a wraparound effect of the currency changes, mostly in the EU, as we kind of ended, very end -- if you remember the changes were very end of December of 2014 and January of 2015. So that was fully expected. And so we believe that, that will just continue to be a bit of a headwind, which we had thought about. The R&D, I think I'd point out one key dynamic is it's always a little bit choppy, R&D as a percentage of sales, it's based on business development activity. And we certainly want to and would welcome really good business development activity, that's always a positive investment, a positive expense if done correctly. With all that said, no doubt about it that, as I said, we have made cost control and feel like we're reaping the benefits of what we did late in 2015 as we came into this year.

In the longer term, there are a number of products, as there are in every therapeutic area, coming forward, and we're keeping a close eye on them. There is certainly -- we saw BioMarin's data, which are interesting but early. I mean, I haven't seen anything that you haven't seen. I saw good factor VIII levels that persisted for some period of time, and we saw some liver enzyme issues that needed to be treated with corticosteroids. So we'll see how that plays out over time. Those are early. I would say interesting data, but early. It's similar, I think, to our immune tolerance induction data that we have with ELOCTATE. And if you -- we haven't talked about this a lot, but a fair number of hemophiliacs develop inhibitory antibodies when they're treated, and that results in the necessity for immune tolerance induction, which means high levels of factor that are given over 12 to 18 months before immune tolerance emerges. There have been a very limited number of patients, 3, so I don't want to overstate this. Again, these are very early data, so -- and I don't want to be here overstating the case. But again, these are early data but also encouraging. So of the 3 patients that have been treated with ELOCTATE from the intolerance induction, they all became tolerant within about 3 to 4 months. So a much shorter period of time. If those data are confirmed in further studies, we believe that, that could be an important upward lift for ELOCTATE. So I think there are lots of early data emerging. They all need to be confirmed with larger studies. And we feel good about the business and where we are. We have our own longer-acting factors coming. We've talked about some of them, there are earlier ones that are in our research group now.

With respect to the balance sheet, I think it gets to the broader question of capital allocation. Currently, we're actually sitting on a pretty high cash balance. As I pointed out, like many others, we have the peculiar situation of ex U.S. cash as a little bit more than half of that. But aside from that, that largely arises out of 2 things, the great strong cash flow generation of the company coupled with the debt financing that we did in the fall of 2015. Look, I think we're going to -- we will look to strategically deploy it. And if we come up that there are not options to strategically deploy it, we will look towards returning capital to shareholders. We don't measure that on a -- as we've talked about before, on a 90-day basis just because that's not the kind of clock speed of things. In both situations, it depends on price and value. So it continues to -- it depends. And in both situations, the financial objective is to maximize intrinsic value per share.

And how are you thinking about maybe derisking the company from such an event? None of us think of it as a near-term event, but it's something that could happen over the long term. So maybe just help us think about like the longer-term strategy of the company and your thoughts on price."

Look, we are -- I think we're feeling good about the MS business as it exists today. We're going right. But if you look at our pipeline, you'll see that many of the things we're working on are not in MS. We think LINGO, actually, could be a transformative event in the treatment of MS, so -- and we are not working beyond ZINBRYTA on novel, let's say, additional drugs that would down regulate the immune system. I think there are enough of those on the market. There are more coming. For many MS patients, those don't stop the progression. They slow the progression but they don't stop the progression. And so we believe things like LINGO actually are the types of compounds that could actually transform that market and give it additional vibrancy as we move out through the 20s. That being said, if you look at what we're emphasizing now and what we have in Phase III, it's nusinersen for SMA, it's aducanumab for Alzheimer's disease, it's raxatrigine for neuropathic pain, it's amiselimod for IBD and Crohn's disease. So we have deliberately brought in a series of compounds and are conducting late-stage trials in things that are outside of MS, partially for the reason you just outlined."

On the other hand, when you start to see lack of events of the type that was shown at AAN, since December of 2014, no new events, that's a pretty striking difference. And these are hard endpoints, like time to tracheostomy or ventilation and time to death. It's hard for me to see how that kind of thing could be happening due to simply improving medical care. So I think we're getting more and more encouraged, but I would note that we have these 2 well-controlled trials, one in infant onset SMA and one in childhood onset SMA.

If you look at the imaging studies, tau comes on later, and there's a lot of data, preclinical data, that shows that Abeta pathology triggers tau pathology. So we're learning a lot about tau now. We know that in normal aging, there is some aggregated tau in the medial temporal lobe; but in patients with Alzheimer's disease, it spreads beyond the medial temporal lobe. And that spread is probably triggered by Abeta. And so that's the reason why we have some programs in tau. We've just -- we have some preclinical as well as early clinical programs of both antibodies as well as antisense. And so in the later stages, we might need to treat for tau, perhaps in combination with the Abeta therapies because I don't think you want to reaccumulate Abeta once you've removed it."

Nevertheless, I did look at the data, it's -- crossover designs like the one that they did are not -- probably not the best approach for looking at disease-modifying therapies because when you switch from clemastine to placebo, I don't expect that if it is causing myelination, how would the placebo patients look? They would continue to get the benefit from the clemastine that they had received in the period prior. So nevertheless, they did show a modest effect on latency of the conductions between the retina and the brain. And we're keeping a close eye on that.

And our non-GAAP EPS was $4.79, 25% increase from the same period a year ago. 
As you've heard from us since the beginning of the year, a cornerstone to our strategy for sustainable growth is our healthy commercial business and a strong focus on properly managing expenses. And I think these results should reinforce that message. 
TECFIDERA continues to gain share globally, now with more than 190,000 patients having been treated. And at AAN this week, we presented compelling data that showcased its strong and sustained efficacy in newly diagnosed MS patients, emphasizing that earlier treatment with TECFIDERA improves long-term clinical outcomes. We also presented compelling data about TECFIDERA's real-world efficacy. 
Last month, we announced that our new Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer, Michel Vounatsos had joined us. Michel brings a wealth of experience from 20 successful years of increasing responsibility at Merck, most recently as President of Primary Care and Customer Centricity. Michel officially started on Monday, and we're excited to be working with him. He'll be instrumental in driving our near-term growth, while helping to prepare the organization to support our exciting pipeline.
In the first quarter, we launched BENEPALI, our biosimilar version of Enbrel, in 6 European countries: the U.K., Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden and the Netherlands. And FLIXABI, our biosimilar version of Remicade, received a positive opinion from the CHMP, and we're awaiting approval from the European Commission shortly.
And of course, an important part of our strategy for sustainable growth is our pipeline of potential future therapies. Notably, aducanumab is enrolling patients in 2 Phase III trials; opicinumab, which is anti-LINGO, results are expected midyear; and nusinersen, in collaboration with Ionis, is close to completing enrollment of the Phase III trial called ENDEAR. Al will provide more color on the pipeline during his comments.
Finally, I'd like to make a few comments to address some questions that I know will come. First, we're in the final stages of hiring an R&D head and expect to make an announcement shortly. Second, like you, we've read the media reports about our hemophilia business and the subsequent analyst reports. As a matter of policy, we do not comment on speculation and will not do so in this instance. We're in an exciting stage in the evolution of Biogen. We're encouraged by the trajectory of our commercial portfolio, and we'll continue to focus on cost containment to maximize our earnings. We're eagerly awaiting the data from opicinumab and nusinersen, and we're pleased with the early enthusiasm for our biosimilars in Europe. We've recently brought several new compounds into development, and we continue to look for opportunities outside of Biogen. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Al, who'll update you on our progress in R&D."

This quarter, we continued to execute on our pipeline candidates and generate new data to support our commercialized products.

I should note that no one has seen these data yet, but after more than a decade of work on LINGO, beginning with discovering the gene and then elucidating its biology, most of which was conducted at Biogen, we're excited to learn about opicinumab's potential as a reparative therapy for MS.
In Alzheimer's disease, we are working diligently to enroll our aducanumab Phase III trials, and are pleased with progress thus far. Looking ahead, we anticipate safety data from the titration arm of the Phase 1b PRIME study in the second half of this year.
Amiselimod, or MT-1303, our S1P1 inhibitor for IBD, is currently being tested in a Phase II trial in Crohn's disease, and we are working toward the start of Phase III studies in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease in the second half of this year.
Raxatrigine, a small molecule inhibitor of the Nav 1.7 sodium channel, is anticipated to begin a Phase III trial to confirm its efficacy in patients with trigeminal neuralgia. And we are also planning to initiate a Phase II trial in patients with painful lumbosacral radiculopathy later this year. 
Turning to our hemophilia products, we find the data that was presented at the December ASH meeting on immune tolerance induction with ELOCTATE quite encouraging. We believe that the SC portion of these fusion proteins utilized in both ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX may offer additional benefits beyond half-life extension, although these preliminary findings will require confirmation from additional studies. 
At this week's American Academy of Neurology meeting, we presented important new data demonstrating the breadth and diversity of our marketed and pipeline multiple sclerosis therapies, including TECFIDERA, TYSABRI, ZINBRYTA and PLEGRIDY. Let me provide some of the highlights of our presentation.
TECFIDERA was shown to provide sustained and strong efficacy in newly diagnosed MS patients, reinforcing that earlier treatment with TECFIDERA is important in improving long-term clinical outcomes. We also presented the results of another study that retrospectively examined the health insurance claims database of more than 5,000 patients in routine clinical practice. 
Annualized relapse rates 1 year after starting disease-modifying therapy were compared to the year before therapy initiation. These real-world data support the efficacy of TECFIDERA treatment seen in the controlled clinical trials, and this, combined with its safety profile and oral convenience, make it a very compelling therapeutic option for MS patients.
Data presented at AAN reinforced the nearly 10 years of clinical experience with TYSABRI, confirming its high efficacy, reversible immune effects and well-characterized safety profile. 
ZINBRYTA, with its targeted and reversible mechanism of action, was shown to be positive on key MS cognitive outcomes. 
PLEGRIDY was shown to reduce the conversion of newly acquired MS lesions into T1 black holes, which have been associated with axonal loss.
Also at AAN, our collaboration partner, Ionis, presented an update on the ongoing open-label Phase II trial of nusinersen in infants with spinal muscular atrophy. An analysis as of January 2016 showed no new events as defined by progression to permanent ventilation or death in the study since December of 2014, continued increases in muscle function scores and achievement of new motor milestones when compared to natural history studies. We believe these data look increasingly encouraging, and that nusinersen could represent an important new therapy for spinal muscular atrophy.
With respect to our earlier stage efforts, at our R&D day last November, we talked about using human genetics to identify causal biological pathways as we strive to discover and develop new treatment for difficult diseases. In February, we joined the Centre for Therapeutic Target Validation, the pioneering public-private collaboration that fosters interactions between academic and industry members for the purpose of developing open, transformative approaches to selecting unvalidated novel targets in drug development. This collaboration expands on our strategy of using genetically validated targets, biomarkers and multiple therapeutic approaches to decrease the risk of drug development. 
With that, I'll now pass the call to Paul."

Our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $4.43 in the first quarter, while our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $4.79. Total revenue for Q1 grew 7% year-over-year to approximately $2.7 billion.Our revenue growth was driven by the sta",996,"Thanks, Al. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $4.43 in the first quarter, while our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $4.79. Total revenue for Q1 grew 7% year-over-year to approximately $2.7 billion.
Our revenue growth was driven by the stable patient trends we now see for TECFIDERA and TYSABRI in the U.S. and continued growth in ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX. 
Although PLEGRIDY showed meaningful growth, our overall interferon business declined compared to the first quarter of last year as the market continues to migrate to orals. Overall, we're pleased that the breadth and strength of our product portfolio enabled us to absorb such fluctuations, expand our top line and maintain our global MS market share of approximately 38%.
As a reminder, we had $173 million in foreign exchange hedge gains in 2015, which has begun to impact our year-over-year comparisons. Compared to the first quarter of last year, we had $26 million less in hedge gains this quarter. Combined with a $24 million headwind from natural foreign exchange rates, overall revenue was weakened by approximately $50 million year-over-year. I'll highlight the FX impact for each of the therapies.
Global first quarter TECFIDERA revenue was $946 million. We recorded revenues of $744 million in the U.S. and $202 million outside the U.S. In the U.S., we believe there was a drawdown of TECFIDERA inventory in the wholesale channel, representing approximately $20 million versus prior quarter. Despite an expected choppy start to the quarter as we work through the typical seasonality issues, we believe underlying U.S. TECFIDERA patient demand is largely stable. U.S. gross-to-net percentage was comparable to Q4 and largely consistent with our average expected rate for the balance of the year.
Outside the U.S., foreign exchange impact, including the reduction in hedge gains, weakened full year TECFIDERA revenue by approximately $14 million year-over-year. Last October, we bolstered our marketing efforts in the U.S. by launching a television campaign aimed at increasing patient awareness about MS and TECFIDERA. We believe we did increase awareness. Our current TV campaign will expire in the middle of this year. For various reasons, we plan to sunset this lever, and don't currently plan to purchase additional TV spots beyond the middle of the year.
We do, nevertheless, plan to continue our marketing efforts across other print and digital channels. Interferon revenues, including both AVONEX and PLEGRIDY, were $670 million during the first quarter, which includes $467 million in the U.S. and $203 million in sales outside the U.S.
In the U.S., the results were weaker than anticipated due to a combination of lower underlying demand as patients continued to move toward orals, seasonality issues and a drawdown of AVONEX wholesale inventory of approximately $20 million. Outside the U.S., foreign exchange impact, inclusive of a reduction in hedge gains, weakened Q1 interferon revenues by approximately $20 million year-over-year.
Now moving to TYSABRI. With nearly 10 years of postmarketing experience, TYSABRI continued to add patients this quarter, with worldwide revenues of $477 million. These results were comprised of $288 million in the U.S. and $189 million internationally. We believe TYSABRI's well-understood safety profile and robust efficacy position it well. Foreign exchange impact, including a reduction in hedge gains, weakened Q1 TYSABRI revenue by approximately $14 million year-over-year.
Turning to our hemophilia business. ELOCTATE revenue for the quarter was $108 million and ALPROLIX revenue in Q1 was $75 million. We recorded $329 million for Q1 in our anti-CD20 collaboration, which includes our profit share from RITUXAN and GAZYVA in the U.S. as well as our profit share in royalties on sales of rituximab outside the U.S. As expected, our share of pretax profits in the U.S. on sales of RITUXAN decreased from 40% to 39% at the end of February, following approval of GAZYVA in RITUXAN refractory indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. 
Total other revenues, which include revenues from collaboration relationships, royalties and contract manufacturing were $88 million. We continued to benefit this quarter from contract manufacturing revenue related to a strategic partner.
Now turning to the expense lines on the P&L. Q1 cost of goods sold were $313 million or 11% of revenue as we experienced lower-than-typical write-offs of manufacturing runs in inventory. Q1 R&D expense was $437 million or 16% of revenue. Of note, in Q1, we did not have any meaningful business development expense. Recall, in the fourth quarter, we made a $60 million payment to Mitsubishi Tanabe related to the in-licensing of MT-1303. Additionally, the lower-than-expected R&D run rate seen in Q1 was also favorably impacted by the timing of clinical manufacturing campaigns and other R&D activities.
Q1 SG&A expense was $497 million or 18% of revenue. We remain focused on achieving savings in nonlabor expenses with the objective of reducing lower priority fees and services for the balance of 2016. Other net expense was $53 million in Q1, which includes the interest expense related to our 2015 bond offering.
In Q1, our non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 26%. This rate was negatively impacted by approximately 150 basis points related to discrete items.
Our weighted average diluted share count was approximately 219 million for Q1. And we ended the quarter with approximately $6.8 billion in cash and marketable securities, with approximately 45% of this in the U.S.
This brings us to our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, which were $4.79 for the quarter, representing a strong 25% increase year-over-year. Over the last few years, we've gone through an unprecedented number of product launches and thought it was the right strategy to not be penny wise and pound foolish. 
Starting in 2015, we pivoted to initiate a number of measures to curb operating expense growth. And late in 2015, we announced a restructuring, and we believe the benefits materialized this quarter.
For the balance of the year, we're focused on commercial execution and diligent efforts to further reduce spending where appropriate, while ensuring we simultaneously support the advancement of the pipeline. 
I'll turn the call over to George for his closing comments."

Look, I'm pleased with the start of the year, and especially with the 25% increase in earnings versus Q1 of 2015. For the remainder of the year, we're focused on 3 areas: careful control of our costs, maximizing our revenues and rapidly advancing the pipeline. The cost reduction actions that we took last year resulted in a meaningful increase in earnings this quarter. And as we move through the year, we'll continue to focus on cost control to do all that we can to concentrate our resources on the activities that we believe will add the greatest value.
On the revenue side, we're pleased to have Michel Vounatsos join us. I'm very confident in Michel and look forward to all that he and his team will do to maximize the value of our commercial portfolio as we move through this year and into next. We have great drugs that are benefiting a lot of patients, and we want to maximize the benefits to both patients and our shareholders.
Additionally, we hope to launch 2 additional compounds this year, ZINBRYTA; and in the EU, FLIXABI. Since we think of revenue on a multiyear basis, we also will continue our focus on pursuing opportunities outside of Biogen. We continue to attract companies and compounds that are potentially interesting for us, and we are in constant discussions with multiple parties from the types of tuck-in acquisitions that we've done historically to later-stage assets closer to commercialization. And as we said in previous calls, we want to be active in this area, while remaining financially disciplined.
This is a very important year for the advancement of our internal pipeline, and it's important to make sure that the enrollment in the 2 Phase III trials of aducanumab continues to go well. We're pleased with how we're tracking so far, but it's still early and we want to make sure that we stay on or ideally ahead of schedule for patient enrollment.
We aim to get the Phase III trials for raxatrigine and amiselimod started on schedule. And we need to make sure that our early pipeline progresses quickly and that we make fact-based go, no-go decisions. And of course, once we have the Phase II data for opicinumab in the middle of the year, we'll quickly decide on the appropriate path forward for opicinumab itself and for the other remyelinating programs in our pipeline. 
As Al mentioned, the open-label data for nusinersen continue to look encouraging, and we need to do everything that we can to minimize the time to see data from the Phase III trials and, if positive, to get the drug to patients as soon as possible.
Although not so visible from outside the company, we'll continue to invest in R&D. We believe that our strategy of building world-class research and development will not only help us identify important new therapies ourselves but will also help us to make thoughtful, sophisticated decisions about what to bring in from outside the company.
So we have a lot to do. This is a year for us to keep our heads down and focus on execution in all of the areas that I just outlined. We have a great team and a dedicated group of employees. And as always, I'd like to thank our employees for making a positive impact on patients' lives and to thank the patients and physicians involved in our clinical development programs. The achievements that we've made together could not have been realized without their passion and commitment.

It probably looks a lot like the United States performance of TECFIDERA kind of getting to -- darn close to a 20 share and not being -- not punching through over the course of 2015. That's an important market outside the United States, as you all know. When I go across other parts that really are the big contributors outside the United States, it's kind of, obviously, France, U.K., Southern Europe countries of Italy and Spain. And we're very pleased with the performance in Southern Europe. Those are early days in terms of the launch curves for TECFIDERA specifically. We're very, very pleased with that. The performance has exceeded our expectations. And certainly, as we've pointed out in the past, our U.K. performance is exceptionally strong. We've got what we feel is a remarkable team there. They've kind of really -- really kind of broken down the marketplace and attacked it quite vigorously across the suite of Biogen MS therapies. So I think very pleased, I'd say, with the performance outside the United States, with a little bit of homework to do in Germany, which, I think, we're actually showing some early signs, very early signs late in the quarter, positive signs. With respect to contracting, it is as people know, specific to AVONEX and PLEGRIDY, specific to newly diagnosed patients. I think that you combine that with typical seasonality issues in Q1, and we still feel we made the right choices there in terms of as we moved into 2016. And so I think that's kind of -- we don't think there's been a meaningful impact. Certainly, kind of working through prior authorizations and things like that for some of the patients has become a more active part of what we do in our Patient Services organization."

The question that I've been getting -- I'd just love to hear your thoughts are, you emphasized a lot when looking at these competing Abeta antibodies really understanding if -- what the imaging data show post therapy, that is, is it draining plaque from the brain? And if the answer to that is no, then the clinical outcome is perhaps less important because it doesn't do what your amaB does, so to speak. And -- but there's been some questions about, specifically, where the Eisai BAN antibody binds, which types of fibrils and whether or not, given its binding -- its specific binding affinities, whether or not you would expect necessarily to see changes on PET scan?

Arguably 85% or so. Competitor antibodies have not done that, and I don't know where 2401 will land but that's an important piece. And then we can then start to understand the relationship between reduction in plaque burden and cognitive outcome. In our hands, in the aducanumab program, only the patients who reduced plaque burden by greater than 1 standard deviation change relative to what the placebo patients did, in other words, beyond the noise, those are the people who got cognitive benefit. The people who did not do that did not have any benefit that we could detect. So we think that's an important piece to look at."

We actually, importantly, think that we're kind of on -- hopefully, on the back side of that; that the medical education has largely been completed.

So we're feeling good about there. We have not yet seen any impact on their trajectories from the introduction of other long-acting factors. So we take that as a positive sign. So I think the prospects for the business look quite healthy. In the longer term, there are a number of products, as there are in every therapeutic area, coming forward, and we're keeping a close eye on them. There is certainly -- we saw BioMarin's data, which are interesting but early. I mean, I haven't seen anything that you haven't seen. I saw good factor VIII levels that persisted for some period of time, and we saw some liver enzyme issues that needed to be treated with corticosteroids. So we'll see how that plays out over time. Those are early. I would say interesting data, but early. It's similar, I think, to our immune tolerance induction data that we have with ELOCTATE. And if you -- we haven't talked about this a lot, but a fair number of hemophiliacs develop inhibitory antibodies when they're treated, and that results in the necessity for immune tolerance induction, which means high levels of factor that are given over 12 to 18 months before immune tolerance emerges. There have been a very limited number of patients, 3, so I don't want to overstate this. Again, these are very early data, so -- and I don't want to be here overstating the case. But again, these are early data but also encouraging. So of the 3 patients that have been treated with ELOCTATE from the intolerance induction, they all became tolerant within about 3 to 4 months. So a much shorter period of time. If those data are confirmed in further studies, we believe that, that could be an important upward lift for ELOCTATE. So I think there are lots of early data emerging. They all need to be confirmed with larger studies. And we feel good about the business and where we are. We have our own longer-acting factors coming. We've talked about some of them, there are earlier ones that are in our research group now. So I think we feel good about the current products, and we feel good about the future of the business as well."

So the $30 million that I talked about last quarter was our best estimate at that time. In retrospect now, it probably is closer to the $20 million. In reality, it's probably in between. So I think that we've gone through the destocking of what we talked about last quarter and just wanted to kind of clarify it with the prepared remarks. With respect to the balance sheet, I think it gets to the broader question of capital allocation. Currently, we're actually sitting on a pretty high cash balance. As I pointed out, like many others, we have the peculiar situation of ex U.S. cash as a little bit more than half of that. But aside from that, that largely arises out of 2 things, the great strong cash flow generation of the company coupled with the debt financing that we did in the fall of 2015. Look, I think we're going to -- we will look to strategically deploy it. And if we come up that there are not options to strategically deploy it, we will look towards returning capital to shareholders. We don't measure that on a -- as we've talked about before, on a 90-day basis just because that's not the kind of clock speed of things. In both situations, it depends on price and value. So it continues to -- it depends. And in both situations, the financial objective is to maximize intrinsic value per share. So we look towards investing in deployments of capital that really drive great internal rates of return. I think I'd also point out, look, over a longer period of time, I think this company, with the great cash flow generation it has, has flexibly to do both."

I think there are enough of those on the market. There are more coming. For many MS patients, those don't stop the progression. They slow the progression but they don't stop the progression. And so we believe things like LINGO actually are the types of compounds that could actually transform that market and give it additional vibrancy as we move out through the 20s.

They would continue to get the benefit from the clemastine that they had received in the period prior. So nevertheless, they did show a modest effect on latency of the conductions between the retina and the brain. And we're keeping a close eye on that. I think that these are all early day experiments in reparative therapies, and I believe we have established one of the best ways of looking at this in our anti-LINGO program, both in acute optic neuritis as well as the MS program."

The board and I recognize that this is an excellent time",1072,"Okay. Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. I'd like to begin with a personal statement, I'll be stepping down as CEO of a Biogen some time within the next few months. The board and I recognize that this is an excellent time for transition. The company is doing well now. The management team is complete and extremely capable. The commercial and R&D activities are going well and we're on our way to adding to the pipeline through internal and external opportunities. So good time for a new CEO to take the helm and see Biogen through to what I believe is a very exciting future. 
This also is an opportune time for me to return to the West Coast, take on one more set of activities and spend more time with my family. I've been at Biogen for 6 years, I'm proud of the company and what we've been able to accomplish in that time. We've introduced 6 new products onto the market and increased our levels, earnings and stock price all by several fold. And I believe that we're well positioned to keep delivering on our potential to bring even more therapies to patients and returns to investors. 
Our R&D and commercial organizations are now world-class, joining our already industry-leading biologics manufacturing capabilities. All aspects of the company are operating at a high-level. We've brought several potential game-changing compounds into later-stage development and are in the process of adding further to that pipeline. 
The addition of Michel Vounatsos, Mike Ehlers and Paul McKenzie, the company has a full and vibrant leadership team that's capable of moving the company thoughtfully forward. I truly believe that the company has a bright future and it's with mixed emotions that I leave at this time and not see that future come fully to fruition. 
We're making the announcement now in order to provide an orderly transition for the company and to allow the board to conduct an open and effective search. I'll work with the board to find a great successor who can continue to build on what we have accomplished. We expect to consider both internal and external candidates, and I'm confident that we'll identify an outstanding new leader. I expect to remain as CEO until a successor is identified and can begin. In the interim, I'll continue to work with the board and management team to accomplish Biogen's goals for 2016. I believe that we're in a good trajectory, that we have a great new additions to the management team, and I look forward to a successful second half of the year. 
So enough about me. Let's turn to the business. Biogen had a solid second quarter, delivering strong financial performance and important advances in our pipeline. For the second quarter of 2016, Biogen generated $2.9 billion in total revenues, a 12% increase from the same period a year ago. Our GAAP earnings were $4.79 per share, a 22% increase year-over-year, and non-GAAP EPS was $5.21, a 23% increase year-over-year. 
We continued to grow our leading MS franchise and our hemophilia business and our efforts to maximize revenues while thoughtfully managing expenses helped to drive attractive earnings growth. As a result, we've raised our financial guidance for the full year. And today, we announced that our Board of Directors has authorized a program to repurchase up to $5 billion of our common stock. 
Looking back, we had quite an eventful second quarter. To begin, we welcome 3 new members of our management team, a new Head of commercial, Michel Vounatsos, joined us in April. He's completed a thorough assessment and has identified 4 key priorities for driving our MS business forward, which he'll share with you later on this call. Our new Head of R&D, Mike Ehlers, joined us at the end of May. Mike is a brilliant neuroscientist and an established R&D leader who has excelled in both academic and corporate settings. Mike has demonstrated the ability to translate science into the development of important new medicines and he's already bringing terrific leadership to the organization. And finally, with John Cox preparing to lead the new hemophilia company, we promoted Paul McKenzie to oversee our Pharmaceutical Operations and Technology Group. This 3 new leaders bring a wealth of experience and expertise, and we believe that they are poised to take Biogen to its next phase of growth. I'm proud to have them in our organization. 
Last quarter brought a number of positive developments for both our commercial products and our pipeline. We announced our intent the spinoff our hemophilia business. That business continues to perform well with combined second quarter revenues of over $200 million for ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX. ALPROLIX also was approved by the European Commission for the treatment of hemophilia B and would be commercialized in the EU by our collaboration partner, Sobi. 
We had a positive label update for TYSABRI in Europe, including an extended indication. We received regulatory approval for ZINBRYTA in both the U.S. and the EU for the treatment of relapsing MS. [indiscernible] biosimilar referencing Remicade received approval in Europe. This will be the second anti-TNF biosimilar that we'll manufacture and commercialize in the EU. And SB5, an adalimumab biosimilar candidate referencing Humira has been accepted for review by the European Medicines Agency. Aducanumab was accepted into the European Medicines Agency's PRIority MEdicines program, known as PRIME. It was 1 of only 4 applications accepted out of 18 submitted and the only Alzheimer's disease therapy in development that was accepted. On the early-stage research front, we entered into a broad collaboration and alliance with the University of Pennsylvania and 2 world-renowned gene therapy experts, Dr. James Wilson and Jean Bennett. 
This quarter, we also reported the top line results of this synergy trial for opicinumab. As you are all aware, opicinumab missed both the primary and secondary endpoints, it certainly was disappointing. However, the rigorous design and planning of synergy has yielded an abundance of data that will help us make a well-informed decision about our path forward with opicinumab and our work in remyelination, generally. These results are indicative of the significant challenge of targeting neuro repair. During the upcoming [indiscernible] conference in September, we expect to present more detailed efficacy, biomarker and safety data. 
I'll now turn the call over to Mike, and we're eager for you to get to know Mike and experience his passion for our business."

By way of introduction, I spent a number of years in academia as professor in Howard Hughs Medical Institute, investigator at Duke University where my research was focused on cell biological and circuit mechanisms of brain function in a normal developing and deceased nervous system. My career took an exciting turn 6 years ago when I joined Pfizer. I served as the Chief Scientific Officer for the company's neuroscience and pain research unit and ultimately became group leader for biotherapeutics R&D with responsibly over rare disease, the centers for therapeutic innovation and all large biomolecules sciences. 
I'm just now finishing my second month at Biogen, so there is still a lot I'm getting up to speed on. But I can tell you from the outset that I am working to reshape and progress our pipeline while aggressively pursuing promising assets, both internally and externally. I plan to update you on progress on these fronts in the future. 
In the meantime, I will comment on the important clinical study redux this quarter and note some good progress made in advancing our clinical programs. 
Starting with opicinumab, our anti-LINGO, as George discussed. The top line results from the Phase II SYNERGY study were reported in which opicinumab unfortunately missed both of the primary and secondary endpoints. However, evidence of a clinical effect with a complex unexpected dose response was observed. The SYNERGY top line efficacy safety and biomarker results will be presented at ECTRIMS in September. 
Continuing in MS. EC approval was received for an extended indication for TYSABRI and highly active relapsing-remitting MS patients with inadequate response to prior MS therapy. TYSABRI was previously only indicated for patients who had failed to respond to beta interferon or a glatiramer acetate. This label extension follows recent EC approval for a new patient management plan, including an updated risk algorithm based on JC virus antibody index values. These changes will allow physicians to have more individualized benefit risk discussions with their patients. 
Turning to other promising late-stage assets, our collaboration partner, Ionis, continues to execute a Phase III studies of nusinersen for infants and children with spinal muscular atrophy, both of which are now fully enrolled. In Alzheimer's disease, it was recently announced that aducanumab was one of only 4 applicants accepted at the European Medicine Agency's PRIority MEdicines program or PRIME. PRIME aims to bring treatments to patients faster by enhancing the EMA's support for the development of investigational medicines for diseases without available treatment or in need of better treatment options. 
We continue to work diligently to enroll our aducanumab Phase III trials. Looking ahead, safety data from the titration arm of the Phase 1b study is anticipated by the end of this year. 
We are working toward the start of Phase III trials for amiselimod or MT-1303 in inflammatory bowel disease and did 074 formerly known as raxatrigine in trigeminal neuralgia an initiation of the Phase II trial with [indiscernible] 074 in patients with neuropathic pain, from [indiscernible] is planned for later this year. 
And further activities, natalizumab's clinical profile and treatment window supports its continued investigation as a potential novel approach for treating acute ischemic stroke and the first patient was recently dosed in a second Phase II study in stroke called action II. Encouraging data was recently generated on earlier stage assets, BIIB059 or anti [indiscernible] for systemic lupus erythematosus and BG11 or stx100 for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Anti-BDCA2 data in healthy volunteers and a lupus cohort of 12 subjects is provided confidence to move into Phase II with trial initiation plan to begin over the summer. These data are anticipated to be presented later this year. 
The BG 11 study is enrolling its final cohort and it is expected that data will be presented after the trial completes. Finally, ask George mentioned, Biogen announced the broad collaboration and alliance with the University of Pennsylvania, and Dr. James Wilson and Jean Bennett to advance gene therapy and gene editing technologies. The expanse of research and translational development collaboration is multiple objectives and will primary focus on the development of therapeutic approach as the target of the eye, skeletal muscle and the central nervous system. 
Again, I am pleased to participate in my  first earnings call here at Biogen. I anticipate sharing more detail on the advancement of the Biogen pipeline in the coming months as the company works diligently to deliver new therapies to patients. With that, I will now pass the call to my good colleague, Michel Vounatsos."
29726,366896620,1009229,"Biogen Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2016",2016-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Biogen Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike. I'm very pleased to be with you this morning. I shared my initial thoughts on the MS market and OMS portfolio, outline my priorities going forward and then I will we discuss this quarter's results for MS products. Since I arrived at Biogen",1131,"Thanks, Mike. I'm very pleased to be with you this morning. I shared my initial thoughts on the MS market and OMS portfolio, outline my priorities going forward and then I will we discuss this quarter's results for MS products. 
Since I arrived at Biogen 3 months ago, I have spent time in the field with our operations team, meeting with patients, the neurology community and many of the scientifical leaders in multiple sclerosis. Also, I have engaged with the strong Biogen leaders across our commercial organizations. I have listened and learned a lot. And together with the team, we have prioritized immediate opportunities across 4 key areas. 
We believe these opportunities will benefit our MS franchise today and at the same time, prepare the organization for potential future product launches. Before speaking about our therapies, I think it is important to note MS is a growing market, with approximately 850,000 treated patients worldwide out of a global prevalence estimated at 2.3 million, which includes progressive forms of MS. 
We estimate the number of treated patients worldwide is growing in the mid-single digits on an annual basis, driven by low single-digit growth in the U.S. and high single-digit growth in Europe. The relatively higher market growth rate overseas is largely due to increasing the rate of diagnosis and treatment. And as a leader in MS, we believe we are well-positioned to benefit from this trend over time. 
Using the U.S. as an example, where we have the most detailed data, we estimate that approximately 3/4 of the 300,000 treated patients are stable and presumably satisfied on the current therapy. We believe Biogen is holding a clear leadership position in this stable segment of the market. 
We believe the dynamic opportunity of patients in the U.S. is comprised of approximately 15,000 newly diagnosed patients and approximately 60,000 patients changing medication each year. We believe that Biogen also holds a leadership position in new patient stuffs within this dynamic portion of the market. 
Turning to our MS portfolio. We believe that the value of our products is well-recognized in the eyes of many of our customers, as reflected in our leading global market share of approximately 38%. We believe the breadth of our portfolio is and will continue to be a source of strength in the marketplace by allowing a physician to prescribe the right drug to the right patient at the right time. 
As the most prescribed oral therapy for MS worldwide, TECFIDERA benefits from a compelling combination of efficacy, convenience and relative safety. As a result, we estimate that TECFIDERA captures roughly 25% of newly diagnosed and switching patients. 
Our market research indicates that TYSABRI is clearly viewed as differentiated in terms of efficacy and retains an important role for patients with highly active disease, capturing roughly 30% of all patients switching for efficacy reasons. Our interferon products, AVONEX and PLEGRIDY, combined, hold leading share amongst the interferon therapies. Despite facing headwinds due to the uptake of the orals, we believe these products will continue to play an important role going forward. 
We are also preparing to launch ZINBRYTA next month in the U.S. and Germany. ZINBRYTA is the first is a new class of MS therapy. We believe it will be used by patients switching for efficacy reasons, benefiting from once-monthly at home subcutaneous administration and a differentiated mechanism of action. 
Going forward, we will concentrate our work in the commercial across 4 key priorities, namely: portfolio strategy, commercial excellence, medical leadership, trust and value. With portfolio strategy, we plan to further define our strategy for products, market segments and geographies. We will work to ensure that our targeted growth opportunities drives consistency across our resource allocation, messaging, marketing tactics and sales force execution. 
Within commercial excellence, we will work to increase our sophistication in multichannel marketing, including enhancing our digital capabilities while also strengthening our engagement with key customers at the local level. 
While clearly perceived as a leader in neurology research and clinical development, we believe we also have an opportunity to further enhance our medical leadership, these includes close collaboration with our medical field teams and partnership with scientific leaders. 
Finally, trust and value. We will work towards developing innovative, beyond the peel solution for our customers to enhance our reputation and strengthen our partnership and role as a leader in MS. I think that as the leader in MS, we have this responsibility. Today, we already have a well-defined plan outlining next steps and target dates, which we have started to implement across the organization. We are initiating this with the aim to accelerate our business to be more focused, to make conscious choices and to be diligent in resource allocation. We believe that this work will be beneficial for our company and our shareholders. For competitive reasons, I am not prepared to go more into the details of these 4 initiatives, but I look forward to updating you on our progress at future meetings. 
Turning to the results for the quarter. Total MS revenues were $2.2 billion, an increase of 9% versus Q2 of last year. We believe our global market share continue to grow. Starting with TECFIDERA, in the U.S., we saw a modest increase in demand compared to the first quarter, largely due to a normalization of the seasonality typically seen early in the year. All of our metric lead us to expect a continued stable trend for TECFIDERA going forward. 
Outside the U.S., we continue to see increased adoption in the U.K., Italy, Spain. In fact, the number of TECFIDERA patients in Europe has increased approximately 40% of the last year. PLEGRIDY is now available in roughly 20 markets in Europe, and when launched, we believe it is helping to slow the rate of decline of our interferons. 
TYSABRI continued to outpatient this quarter. We recognize the potential for increased competition from other high-efficacy therapies, but we believe TYSABRI's 10 years of post-marketing experience and well understood safety profile position it very well. In collaboration with AbbVie, we are actively repairing to launch ZINBRYTA starting next month. We are particularly encouraged by the broad indication and data reinforcing, the product safety, included in the EU label. We are also making progress in our biosimilar business this quarter. We are seeing strong initial update for BENEPALI, the first biosimilar approved in the EU referencing Enbrel, and we expect to launch FLIXABI, our biosimilar referencing Remicade, in the coming weeks. While we only expect a modest contribution from biosimilars in 2016, we do believe this is an active opportunity in the longer term. So the team delivered a very solid quarter. I look forward to taking Biogen into what I believe is an exciting future. 
With that, I turn the call over to Paul."

In the second quarter, our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $4.79, a 22% increase year-over-year, while our none-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $5.21, an increase of 23%. Total revenue for Q2 grew 12% year-over-year to approximat",1154,"Thanks, Michel. In the second quarter, our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $4.79, a 22% increase year-over-year, while our none-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $5.21, an increase of 23%. Total revenue for Q2 grew 12% year-over-year to approximately to $2.9 billion. It's important to note we had $173 million in foreign exchange hedge gains in the full year of 2015, which impact our year-over-year revenue comparisons this year. 
In Q2, versus prior year, revenues were unfavorably impacted by $45 million from hedging, combined with the $1 million benefit from foreign exchange rates, overall revenue was weakened by approximately $44 million year-over-year. I'll highlight the impact of foreign exchange in hedging on each of our major MS therapies. 
Global second quarter TECFIDERA revenue was $987 million, an increase of 12% versus the same quarter last year. This included revenues at $780 million in the U.S., and $206 million outside the U.S. In the U.S., TECFIDERA modestly benefited from an inventory rebalancing in the whole seller China versus prior quarter. Outside the U.S., foreign exchange and hedge impacts weakened TECFIDERA revenue comparison by approximately $13 million. 
Interferon revenues, including both AVONEX and PLEGRIDY, were $728 million during the second quarter, an increase of 6% versus the same quarter last year. This included $519 million in the U.S. and $209 million in sales outside the U.S. In the U.S., AVONEX also modestly benefited from an inventory rebalancing in the wholesaler channel versus prior quarter. Outside the U.S., foreign exchange in the hedge impacts weakened interpret revenue comparison by approximately $17 million. TYSABRI world-wide revenues were $497 million this quarter, an increase of 7% versus the same quarter last year. This included $305 million in the U.S. and $192 million outside the U.S. 
Foreign exchange and the hedge impacts weakened TYSABRI revenue comparison by approximately $13 million. 
Turning to our hemophilia business, which generated $205 million this quarter. ELOCTATE revenue for the quarter was $125 million and ALPROLIX revenue in Q2 was $80 million. We can continue to work towards spinning off our hemophilia business and related assets and plan to file the form 10 later this summer and complete the distribution in early 2017. 
Turning to our anti-CD20 revenues. We recorded $349 million for Q2, on increase from prior year quarter, driven by solid demand. Total other revenues, which include revenues from collaboration relationships, royalties and contract manufacturing, were $79 million. Now turning to the expense lines on the P&L. You to gap cost of goods sold were $370 million or 13% of revenue. Non-GAAP cost of goods sold were $354 million or 12% of revenue. As a percentage of cells, COGS was impacted by increased inventory write-offs versus the lowest teen in prior quarter. In addition, based on our evaluation of our small-scale manufacturing capacity needs, we bought a GAAP only charge for accelerated depreciation related to our intent to close or they've asked our small-scale manufacturing facility in Cambridge. Q2 GAAP and non-GAAP R&D expense was $473 million or 16% of revenue, which includes $20 million related to the gene therapy collaboration with the University of Pennsylvania. Overall, R&D reflects relatively low business development expense though this remains a critical a strategic priority for us as we look to bring in high quality assets. 
Q2 GAAP SG&A was $492 million or 17% of revenue. Q2 non-GAAP SG&A expense was $489 million, also 17% of revenue. We remain committed to achieving savings by reducing lower priority priorities and services for the balance of the year. Recall over the last three years, we've gone through a number of product launches and thought it was the right decision to invest behind these products. 
Starting in 2015, we pivoted, we took a number of actions to curb operating expense growth, including restructuring and further efforts to reduce costs., which is reflected in our operating leverage for the quarter. This will also allow us to reinvest in the pipeline. Other net expense was $59 million in Q2, which includes $66 million in interest expense related toward our 2015 bond offering. 
In Q2, both of our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were approximately 25%. Our weighted average diluted share count was approximately $219 million for Q2. This brings us to our diluted earnings per share, which were $4.79 on a GAAP basis and $5.21 on a non-GAAP basis for the second quarter. We ended the quarter with approximately $7.3 billion in cash and marketable securities with approximately 40% of these in the United States. Today, we also announced that $5 billion share repurchase program, which we anticipate will be executed over the course of the next 3 years. 
We believe this leaves ample room for flexibility for strategic deployment. So overall, we had a strong quarter, driven by revenue growth from our MS therapies, rebounding from the seasonality seen in the first quarter, continued growth from our hemophilia business and diligent cost controls. Is now brings us to our full year 2016 guidance. We now expect revenues of approximately $11.2 billion to $11.4 billion for modest improvement from prior guidance. Our outlook questions continued stable demand, patient demand for TECFIDERA in 2016 in the United States. We believe TYSABRI will also remain on a stable trajectory for the balance of the year. Our outlook questions AVONEX and PLEGRIDY patients combined will continue to gradually decline as business move toward orals. 
For ZINBRYTA, we anticipate a modest revenue contribution in the U.S. and EU as launches are expected to be again in August. In our revenues outlook is based on a stable foreign exchange rates. So on up was expense perspective, licks expect upward pressure on cost of goods sold to do the unexpected issuance by the U.S. patents office of a patent to a third-party related to recombinant interferon beta protein. This patent issued on June 28 and expiring in June 2033 is relevant to AVONEX and PLEGRIDY. We will play pay royal in the mid-single digits during the life of this patent. For the remainder of 2016, we expect the royalty payment to be approximately $50 million. We anticipate GAAP and non-GAAP R&D expense between 17% and 18% of sales and GAAP and non-GAAP SG&A expense to be between 16% and 17% of revenue. We anticipate GAAP EPS results between 1810 and 1840 and non-GAAP EPS to be between $19.70 and $20. 
Our outlook assumes a very modest reduction in our full year weighted average diluted share count. Of note, this guidance assumes contribution from our hemophilia business through the balance of the year, as we expect the spinoff to complete in early 2017. 
Additionally, this guidance does not include any impact from potential acquisitions or large late stage business development transactions as both are hard to predict. Overall, this increase in guidance reflects this, solid revenues seen this quarter, combined with the continued operating expense control. 
I'll turn the call over to George for his closing comments."

Financially, I'm pleased with where we are so for this year. Our results year-to-date have been better than expected. We've raised guidance, and we have a new share repurchase program authorized by the board. We've made good progress towards the 3 focus areas I discussed after the fourth quarter, careful management of expenses, maximizing revenues and rapidly advancing the pipeline. As I look forward and think about the future growth of Biogen, I want to stress how those key focus areas will evolve. The team expects to continue managing expenses but as you know, we can save our way to growth. Maximizing revenues and rapidly advancing the pipeline will become front and center. Especially with Michel and Mike now in their respective roles. Michel Sparky priorities portfolio strategy, commercial excellence, medical leadership and trust and value will be the pillars we used to maximize revenues. And under Matt's leadership the momentum to reshape the pipeline, rationalize existing programs and aggressively pursue promising assets of both internally and externally. We believe this focus will help advance more assets for the pipeline and ideally deliver more therapies to patients. At the same time, as we're bringing focus and investment to our core areas of expertise in neurology, we'll continue to be opportunistic when we see internal and external opportunities to enhance shareholder value. As a result, we progress some of the most promising earlier stage assets that we have in our pipeline even outside of neurology. We have invested in our biosimilar joint venture to leverage our competitive strengths in manufacturing and commercialization. 
We've chosen to spinoff our growing hemophilia business because we believe it's the right decision to ensure fit and glucose. And as we've announced today, we'll buy back shares when appropriate. So we've delivered strong financial results this quarter, while making progress advancing our pipeline and our commercial business.

So it's a leadership position on interferons, a leadership position on orals, a leadership position on high efficacy products. So this is a remarkable situation. And on top of that, we are launching ZINBRYTA. So the dynamic is very good. Having said that, when you peel the onion and you get to discover the opportunity and the operations, you'll find ways to do better. And this is why, together with the team, we have prioritized 4 key areas, portfolio management, 5, 6 assets in the same therapy area. It's a challenge on how to manage that well. Commercial excellence, medical leadership, value. And I believe that with those, we'll be able to make further difference. Geographically, also we can see that some parts are better managed than others. And I have already started to make some decisions. We don't wait, and you can expect that more will come.

One is to combine 2 drugs, each of which are active, to increase the efficacy overall or to reduce the dose of 2 active therapies so that you get better safety or tolerability for the same efficacy. And also there may be sequential treatments where you start early, perhaps even before symptoms with one type of medicine and then treat with something else when you have a high burden and then something else still when [indiscernible] starts to progress. When you start to think about combination therapy, though, it's often difficult to do the right studies without some evidence of efficacy of each drug as monotherapy.

So first, I want to say this is a really large and rich data set, really the first of its kind, not only in MS but to my knowledge, in neurology where we're in the early stages of figuring out how to repair the brain and how to measure measurements of outcome measures of repair. The things we are focusing on right now when we look at this rich data set are what are the right cohort of patients to treat? In this trial, we've looked at relapsing MS, patients all the way to secondary progressive. So it's a wide range of patients. What's the optimal cohort? What's the right dose? We studied 4 different doses, and we saw a complex dose response curve. What we actually saw was sort of a bell-shaped curve where we lost efficacy at the highest dose and then the middle doses, we think we see a signal of efficacy. And so we'll share some of that at ECTRIMS. What's the right concomitant medicine to use? We envision that these repair therapies will be added to immunomodulators and so we'll be looking at that. And in particular, whether ongoing inflammation in the brain impedes repair. And finally, how do we actually measure the effects of repair if it occurs particularly on clinical outcome measures. So some of these questions will be answered by doing further analyses, which we're in the middle of doing right now intensively. And we'll share whatever we find out at ECTRIMS. And some may need another study. And so what we're honing in on is what's the next step, what's the next study? And obviously, this will be a judicious investment. If we can go to Phase III, we will try. I don't know until I see that the specific design. It could be a Phase II, it could be a Phase III, it could be a Phase II/III. And at that part, we probably won't be able to share at ECTRIMS, but sometime soon, we hope to be able to share that."

And what we need is good leadership and somebody who can work with people who are here, work with Michel, maximize the commercial potential, work with Mike, maximize the potential of our pipeline, grow the pipeline and can work with the rest of the organization to ensure that we go forward in a way that is responsible, where we minimize expenses but that where we invest aggressively in those areas that really have the potential to add value. So being CEO is complicated, and I think those are the priorities I would set, of course, the search will be conducted by the board. But I don't think they would be do it too differently. I think there would be a continued focus on innovation, and I am confident we'll get someone excellent."

Those patients, during the first phase on their product, are suffering for some of them abdominal pain, diarrhea, discomfort that is leading, in some cases, with very high level of variability, to discontinue on the product. And this impacts not only the outflow but eventually the inflow. Variability is tremendous. I was in the field lately on the Eastern Coast in the U.S., 1.5% of the patient discontinued at 6 months, in some others, it was 30%.

I'd like to begin with a personal statement. I'll be stepping down as CEO of a Biogen sometime within the next few months. The board and I recognize that this is an excellent time for a transition. The company is doing well now. The management team is complete and extremely capable. The commercial and R&D activities are going well, and we're on our way to adding to the pipeline through internal and external opportunities. So good time for a new CEO to take the helm and see Biogen through to what I believe is a very exciting future. This also is an opportune time for me to return to the West Coast, take on one more set of activities and spend more time with my family. 
I've been at Biogen for 6 years. I'm proud of the company and what we've been able to accomplish in that time. We've introduced 6 new products on to the market and increased our revenues, earnings and stock price all by severalfold, and I believe that we're well positioned to keep delivering on our potential to bring even more therapies to patients and returns to investors. Our R&D and commercial organizations are now world class, joining our already industry-leading biologics manufacturing capabilities. All aspects of the company are operating at a high level. We brought several potentially game-changing compounds into later-stage development and are in the process of adding further to that pipeline. The addition of Michel Vounatsos, Mike Ehlers and Paul McKenzie, the company has a full and vibrant leadership team that's capable of moving the company thoughtfully forward. I truly believe that the company has a bright future, and it's with mixed emotions that I leave at this time and not see that future come fully to fruition. 
We're making the announcement now in order to provide an orderly transition for the company and to allow the board to conduct an open and effective search. I'll work with the board to find a great successor who can continue to build on what we have accomplished. We expect to consider both internal and external candidates, and I'm confident that we'll identify an outstanding new leader. I expect to remain as CEO until a successor is identified and can begin. In the interim, I continue to work with the board and management team to accomplish Biogen's goals for 2016. I believe that we're in a good trajectory, that we have a great new additions to the management team and I look forward to a successful second half of the year. 
So enough about me. Let's turn to the business. Biogen had a solid second quarter, delivering strong financial performance and important advances in our pipeline. For the second quarter of 2016, Biogen generated $2.9 billion in total revenues, a 12% increase from the same period a year ago. Our GAAP earnings were $4.79 per share, a 22% increase year-over-year, and non-GAAP EPS was $5.21, a 23% increase year-over-year. We continue to grow our leading MS franchise and our hemophilia business, and our efforts to maximize revenues while thoughtfully managing expenses helped to drive attractive earnings growth. As a result, we've raised our financial guidance for the full year. And today, we announced that our Board of Directors has authorized a program to repurchase up to $5 billion of our common stock. 
Looking back, we had quite an eventful second quarter. To begin, we welcome 3 new members of our management team, a new Head of Commercial, Michel Vounatsos, joined us in April. He's completed a thorough assessment and has identified 4 key priorities for driving our MS business forward, which he'll share with you later in this call. Our new Head of R&D, Mike Ehlers, joined us at the end of May. Mike is a brilliant neuroscientist and an established R&D leader who has excelled in both academic and corporate settings. Mike has demonstrated the ability to translate science into the development of important new medicines, and he's already bringing terrific leadership to the organization. And finally, with John Cox preparing to lead the new hemophilia company, we promoted Paul McKenzie to oversee our Pharmaceutical Operations and Technology group. These 3 new leaders bring a wealth of experience and expertise, and we believe that they're poised to take Biogen into its next phase of growth. I'm proud to have them in our organization. 
Last quarter brought a number of positive developments for both our commercial products and our pipeline. We announced our intent to spin off our hemophilia business. That business continues to perform well with combined second quarter revenues of over $200 million for ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX. ALPROLIX also was approved by the European Commission for the treatment of hemophilia B and would be commercialized in the EU by our collaboration partner, Sobi. We had a positive label update for TYSABRI in Europe, including an extended indication. We received regulatory approval for ZINBRYTA in both the U.S. and the EU for the treatment of relapsing MS. FLIXABI  an infliximab biosimilar referencing Remicade, received approval in Europe. This will be the second anti-TNF biosimilar that we'll manufacture and commercialize in the EU. And SB5, an adalimumab biosimilar candidate referencing Humira, has been accepted for review by the European Medicines Agency. Aducanumab was accepted into the European Medicines Agency's PRIority MEdicines program, known as PRIME. It was one of only 4 applications accepted out of 18 submitted and the only Alzheimer's disease therapy in development that was accepted. On the early-stage research front, we entered into a broad collaboration and alliance with the University of Pennsylvania and 2 world-renowned gene therapy experts, Drs. James Wilson and Jean Bennett. 
This quarter, we also reported the top line results of the SYNERGY trial for opicinumab. As you are all aware, opicinumab missed both the primary and secondary endpoints. It was -- certainly was disappointing. However, the rigorous design and planning of SYNERGY has yielded an abundance of data that will help us make a well-informed decision about our path forward with opicinumab and our work in remyelination generally. These results are indicative of the significant challenge of targeting neurorepair. During the upcoming ECTRIMS conference in September, we expect to present more detailed efficacy, biomarker and safety data. 
I'll now turn the call over to Mike, and we're eager for you to get to know Mike and experience his passion for our business."

By way of introduction, I spent a number of years in academia as professor in Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator at Duke University where my research was focused on cell biological and circuit mechanisms of brain function in a normal, developing and diseased nervous system. My career took an exciting turn 6 years ago when I joined Pfizer. I served as the Chief Scientific Officer for the company's Neuroscience and Pain Research Unit and, ultimately, became group leader for BioTherapeutics R&D with responsibility over rare disease, the centers for therapeutic innovation and all large biomolecule sciences. 
I'm just now finishing my second month at Biogen, so there is still a lot I'm getting up to speed on. But I can tell you from the outset that I am working to reshape and progress our pipeline while aggressively pursuing promising assets, both internally and externally. I plan to update you on progress on these fronts in the future. In the meantime, I will comment on the important clinical study readouts this quarter and note some good progress made in advancing our clinical programs. 
Starting with opicinumab, or anti-LINGO, as George discussed. The top line results from the Phase II SYNERGY study were reported in which opicinumab unfortunately missed both of the primary and secondary endpoints. However, evidence of a clinical effect with a complex, unexpected dose response was observed. The SYNERGY top line efficacy safety and biomarker results will be presented at ECTRIMS in September. 
Continuing in MS. EC approval was received for an extended indication for TYSABRI in highly active, relapsing-remitting MS patients with inadequate response to prior MS therapy. TYSABRI was previously only indicated for patients who had failed to respond to beta interferon or a glatiramer acetate. This label extension follows recent EC approval for a new patient management plan, including an updated risk algorithm based on JC virus antibody index values. These changes will allow physicians to have more individualized benefit risk discussions with their patients. 
Turning to other promising late-stage assets. Our collaboration partner, Ionis, continues to execute the Phase III studies of nusinersen for infants and children with spinal muscular atrophy, both of which are now fully enrolled. In Alzheimer's disease, it was recently announced that aducanumab was one of only 4 applicants accepted into the European Medicine Agency's PRIority MEdicines program, or PRIME. PRIME aims to bring treatments to patients faster by enhancing the EMA's support for the development of investigational medicines for diseases without available treatment or in need of better treatment options. We continue to work diligently to enroll our aducanumab Phase III trials. Looking ahead, safety data from the titration arm of the Phase 1b study is anticipated by the end of this year. We are working toward the start of Phase III trials for amiselimod or MT-1303 in inflammatory bowel disease and BIIB074, formerly known as raxatrigine, in trigeminal neuralgia. An initiation of the Phase II trial with BIIB074 in patients with neuropathic pain from lumbosacral radiculopathy is planned for later this year. 
In further activities, natalizumab's clinical profile and treatment window supports its continued investigation as a potential novel approach for treating acute ischemic stroke, and the first patient was recently dosed in a second Phase II study in stroke called ACTION 2. Encouraging data was recently generated on earlier-stage assets, BIIB059 or anti-BDCA2 for systemic lupus erythematosus and BG11 (sic) [ BG00011 ] or STX-100 for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Anti-BDCA2 data in healthy volunteers and a lupus cohort of 12 subjects has provided confidence to move into Phase II with trial initiation plan to begin over the summer. These data are anticipated to be presented later this year. The BG11 study is enrolling its final cohort and it is expected that data will be presented after the trial completes. 
Finally, as George mentioned, Biogen announced the broad collaboration and alliance with the University of Pennsylvania and Dr. James Wilson and Jean Bennett to advance gene therapy and gene editing technologies. The expansive research and translational development collaboration has multiple objectives and will primarily focus on the development of therapeutic approaches that target the eye, skeletal muscle and the central nervous system. 
Again, I am pleased to participate in my  first earnings call here at Biogen. I anticipate sharing more detail on the advancement of the Biogen pipeline in the coming months as the company works diligently to deliver new therapies to patients. 
With that, I will now pass the call to my good colleague, Michel Vounatsos."
29726,366896620,1009546,"Biogen Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2016",2016-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Biogen Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike. I'm very pleased to be with you this morning. I share my initial thoughts on the MS market and our MS portfolio, outline my priorities going forward and then I will discuss this quarter's results for MS products. Since I arrived at Biogen",1131,"Thanks, Mike. I'm very pleased to be with you this morning. I share my initial thoughts on the MS market and our MS portfolio, outline my priorities going forward and then I will discuss this quarter's results for MS products. 
Since I arrived at Biogen 3 months ago, I have spent time in the field with our operations team, meeting with patients, the neurology community and many of the scientific leaders in multiple sclerosis. Also, I have engaged with the strong Biogen leaders across our commercial organizations. I have listened and learned a lot, and together with the team, we have prioritized immediate opportunities across 4 key areas. We believe these opportunities will benefit our MS franchise today and, at the same time, prepare the organization for potential future product launches. 
Before speaking about our therapies, I think it is important to note, MS is a growing market with approximately 850,000 treated patients worldwide out of a global prevalence estimated at 2.3 million, which includes progressive forms of MS. We estimate the number of treated patients worldwide is growing in the mid-single digits on an annual basis, driven by low single-digit growth in the U.S. and high single-digit growth in Europe. The relatively higher market growth rate overseas is largely due to increasing rate of diagnosis and treatment. And as a leader in MS, we believe we are well positioned to benefit from this trend over time. 
Using the U.S. as an example, where we have the most detailed data, we estimate that approximately 3/4 of the 300,000 treated patients are stable and presumably satisfied on the current therapy. We believe Biogen is holding a clear leadership position in this stable segment of the market. We believe the dynamic opportunity of patients in the U.S. is comprised of approximately 15,000 newly diagnosed patients and approximately 60,000 patients changing medication each year. We believe that Biogen also holds a leadership position in new patient starts within this dynamic portion of the market. 
Turning to our MS portfolio. We believe that the value of our products is well recognized in the eyes of many of our customers as reflected in our leading global market share of approximately 38%. We believe the breadth of our portfolio is and will continue to be a source of strength in the marketplace by allowing physician to prescribe the right drug to the right patient at the right time.   
As the most prescribed oral therapy for MS worldwide, TECFIDERA benefits from a compelling combination of efficacy, convenience and relative safety. As a result, we estimate that TECFIDERA captures roughly 25% of newly diagnosed and switching patients. Our market research indicates that TYSABRI is clearly viewed as differentiated in terms of efficacy and retains an important role for patients with highly active disease, capturing roughly 30% of all patients switching for efficacy reasons. Our interferon products, AVONEX and PLEGRIDY, combined, hold leading share amongst the interferon therapies. Despite facing headwinds due to the uptake of the orals, we believe these products will continue to play an important role going forward. We are also preparing to launch ZINBRYTA next month in the U.S and Germany. ZINBRYTA is the first in a new class of MS therapy. We believe it will be used by patients switching for efficacy reasons, benefiting from ""once monthly at home"" subcutaneous administration and a differentiated mechanism of action. 
Going forward, we will concentrate our work in the commercial across 4 key priorities, namely portfolio strategy, commercial excellence, medical leadership, trust and value. With portfolio strategy, we plan to further define our strategy for products, market segments and geographies. We will work to ensure that our targeted growth opportunities drive consistency across our resource allocation, messaging, marketing tactics and sales force execution. Within commercial excellence, we will work to increase our sophistication in multichannel marketing, including enhancing our digital capabilities while also strengthening our engagement with key customers at the local level. While clearly perceived as a leader in neurology research and clinical development, we believe we also have an opportunity to further enhance our medical leadership. This includes close collaboration with our medical field teams and partnership with scientific leaders. Finally, trust and value. We will work towards developing innovative beyond-the-pill solution for our customers to enhance our reputation and strengthen our partnership and role as a leader in MS. I think that as the leader in MS, we have this responsibility. 
Today, we already have a well-defined plan outlining next steps and target dates, which we have started to implement across the organization. We are initiating this with the aim to accelerate our business to be more focused, to make conscious choices and to be diligent in resource allocation. We believe that this work will be beneficial for our company and our shareholders. For competitive reasons, I am not prepared to go more into the details of these 4 initiatives, but I look forward to updating you on our progress at future meetings. 
Turning to the results for the quarter. Total MS revenues were $2.2 billion this quarter, an increase of 9% versus Q2 of last year. We believe our global market share continues to grow. 
Starting with TECFIDERA. In the U.S., we saw a modest increase in demands compared to the first quarter, largely due to  normalization of the seasonality typically seen early in the year. All of our metric lead us to expect a continued, stable trend for TECFIDERA going forward. Outside the U.S., we continue to see increased adoption in the U.K., Italy, Spain. In fact, the number of TECFIDERA patients in Europe has increased approximately 40% over the last year. 
PLEGRIDY is now available in roughly 20 markets in Europe, and where launched, we believe it is helping to slow the rate of decline of our interferons. 
TYSABRI continued to add patient this quarter. We recognize the potential for increased competition from other high-efficacy therapies, but we believe TYSABRI's 10 years of post-marketing experience and well-understood safety profile position it very well. 
In collaboration with AbbVie, we are actively preparing to launch ZINBRYTA starting next month. We are particularly encouraged by the broad indication and data, reinforcing the product safety included in the EU label. 
We are also making progress in our biosimilar business this quarter. We are seeing strong initial update for BENEPALI, the first biosimilar approved in the EU referencing Enbrel, And we expect to launch FLIXABI, our biosimilar referencing Remicade, in the coming weeks. While we only expect a modest contribution from biosimilars in 2016, we do believe this is an attractive opportunity in the longer term. 
So the team delivered a very solid quarter. I look forward to taking Biogen into what I believe is an exciting future. 
With that, I turn the call over to Paul."

In Q2, versus prior year, revenues were unfavorably impacted by $45 million from hedging. Combined with the $1 million benefit from foreign exchange rates, overall revenue was weakened by approximately $44 million year-over-year. I'll highlight the impact of foreign exchange in hedging on each of our major MS therapies. 
Global second quarter TECFIDERA revenue was $987 million, an increase of 12% versus the same quarter last year. This included revenues at $780 million in the U.S. and $206 million outside the U.S. In the U.S., TECFIDERA modestly benefited from an inventory rebalancing in the wholesaler channel versus prior quarter. Outside the U.S., foreign exchange and hedge impact weakened TECFIDERA revenue comparison by approximately $13 million. 
Interferon revenues, including both AVONEX and PLEGRIDY, were $728 million during the second quarter, an increase of 6% versus the same quarter last year. This included $519 million in the U.S. and $209 million in sales outside the U.S. In the U.S., AVONEX also modestly benefited from an inventory rebalancing in the wholesaler channel versus prior quarter. Outside the U.S., foreign exchange and the hedge impact weakened interferon revenue comparison by approximately $17 million. 
TYSABRI worldwide revenues were $497 million this quarter, an increase of 7% versus the same quarter last year. This included $305 million in the U.S. and $192 million outside the U.S. Foreign exchange and the hedge impact weakened TYSABRI revenue comparison by approximately $13 million. 
Turning to our hemophilia business, which generated $205 million this quarter. ELOCTATE revenue for the quarter was $125 million, and ALPROLIX revenue in Q2 was $80 million. We continue to work towards spinning off our hemophilia business and related assets and plan to file the Form 10 later this summer and complete the distribution in early 2017. 
Turning to our anti-CD20 revenues. We recorded $349 million for Q2, an increase from prior quarter, driven by solid demand. Total other revenues, which include revenues from collaboration relationships, royalties and contract manufacturing, were $79 million. 
Now turning to the expense lines on the P&L. Q2 GAAP cost of goods sold were $370 million or 13% of revenue. Non-GAAP cost of goods sold were $354 million or 12% of revenue. As a percentage of sales, COGS was impacted by increased inventory write-offs versus the lows seen in prior quarter. In addition, based on our evaluation of our small-scale manufacturing capacity needs, we booked a GAAP-only charge for accelerated depreciation related to our intent to close or divest our small-scale manufacturing facility in Cambridge. 
Q2 GAAP and non-GAAP R&D expense was $473 million or 16% of revenue, which includes $20 million related to the gene therapy collaboration with the University of Pennsylvania. Overall, R&D reflects relatively low business development expense, though this remains a critical strategic priority for us as we look to bring in high-quality assets. 
Q2 GAAP SG&A was $492 million or 17% of revenue. Q2 non-GAAP SG&A expense was $489 million, also 17% of revenue. We remain committed to achieving savings by reducing lower priorities and services for the balance of the year. Recall, over the last few years, we've gone through a number of product launches and thought it was the right decision to invest behind these products. Starting in 2015, we pivoted and took a number of actions to curb operating expense growth, including a restructuring in further efforts to reduce costs, which is reflected in our operating leverage for the quarter. This will also allow us to reinvest in the pipeline. Other net expense was $59 million in Q2, which includes $66 million in interest expense related to our 2015 bond offering. 
In Q2, both our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were approximately 25%. Our weighted average diluted share count was approximately $219 million for Q2. This brings us to our diluted earnings per share, which were $4.79 on a GAAP basis and $5.21 on a non-GAAP basis for the second quarter. We ended the quarter with approximately $7.3 billion in cash and marketable securities with approximately 40% of this in the United States. Today, we also announced a $5 billion share repurchase program, which we anticipate will be executed over the course of the next 3 years. We believe this leaves ample room for flexibility for strategic deployment. 
So overall, we had a strong quarter, driven by revenue growth from our MS therapies rebounding from the seasonality seen in the first quarter, continued growth from our hemophilia business and diligent cost controls. 
This now brings us to our full year 2016 guidance. We now expect revenues of approximately $11.2 billion to $11.4 billion, a modest improvement from prior guidance. Our outlook assumes continued stable demand, patient demand for TECFIDERA in 2016 in the United States. We believe TYSABRI will also remain on a stable trajectory for the balance of the year. Our outlook questions AVONEX and PLEGRIDY patients, combined, will continue to gradually decline as patients move toward orals. For ZINBRYTA, we anticipate a modest revenue contribution in the U.S. and EU as launches are expected to begin in August. And our revenues outlook is based on stable foreign exchange rates. 
From an expense perspective, we anticipate upward pressure on cost of goods sold due to the unexpected issuance by the U.S. Patent Office of a patent to a third party related to recombinant interferon beta protein. This patent, issued on June 28 and expiring in June 2033, is relevant to AVONEX and PLEGRIDY. We will play -- pay royalties in the mid-single digits during the life of this patent. For the remainder of 2016, we expect the royalty payment to be approximately $50 million. We anticipate GAAP and non-GAAP R&D expense between 17% and 18% of sales and GAAP and non-GAAP SG&A expense to be between 16% and 17% of revenue. We anticipate GAAP EPS results between $18.10 and $18.40 and non-GAAP EPS to be between $19.70 and $20. Our outlook assumes a very modest reduction in our full year weighted average diluted share count. 
Of note, this guidance assumes contribution from our hemophilia business through the balance of the year as we expect the spin-off to complete in early 2017. Additionally, this guidance does not include any impact from potential acquisitions or large late-stage business development transactions as both are hard to predict. Overall, this increase in guidance reflects the solid revenues seen this quarter, combined with the continued operating expense control. 
I'll turn the call over to George for his closing comments."

Look, financially, I'm pleased with where we are so far this year. Our results year-to-date have been better than expected. We've raised guidance, and we have a new share repurchase program authorized by the board. We've made good progress towards the 3 focus areas I discussed after the first quarter: careful management of expenses, maximizing revenues and rapidly advancing the pipeline. 
As I look forward and think about the future growth of Biogen, I want to stress how those key focus areas will evolve. The team expects to continue managing expenses, but as you know, we can't save our way to growth. Maximizing revenues and rapidly advancing the pipeline will become front and center, Especially with Michel and Mike now in their respective roles. Michel's 4 key priorities of portfolio strategy, commercial excellence, medical leadership and trust and value will be the pillars we use to maximize revenues. And under Mike's leadership, we intend to reshape the pipeline, rationalize existing programs and aggressively pursue promising assets, both internally and externally. We believe this focus will help advance more assets through the pipeline and ideally deliver more therapies to patients. 
At the same time as we're bringing focus and investment to our core area of expertise in neurology, we'll continue to be opportunistic when we see internal and external opportunities to enhance shareholder value. As a result, we progressed some of the most promising earlier-stage assets that we have in our pipeline even outside of neurology. We have invested in our biosimilar joint venture to leverage our competitive strengths in manufacturing and commercialization. We've chosen to spin-off our growing hemophilia business because we believe it's the right decision to ensure fit and focus, And as we've announced today, we'll buy back shares when appropriate. 
So we've delivered strong financial results this quarter while making progress advancing our pipeline and our commercial business. We have a great leadership team and a passionate group of employees who come to work every day to make a positive impact on patients' lives. It's been an honor and a privilege to serve this organization as the CEO for the last 6 years, and I remain committed to leading the company until my successor is identified. 
I want to take this opportunity to thank all of our employees for their hard work and dedication, And I want to thank you, all, for joining us this morning. 
And operator, we'll now open up the call for questions."

And we like the idea of combination, to think one day we will be using combination therapies for Alzheimer's disease. One of the reasons why we brought in BACE inhibitor into our pipeline with our collaboration with Eisai, the reason why we have tau programs internally and that we're in search of even other things potentially to add to the mix is based on -- in part on that belief, that combination could be helpful. And you can think of it in 2 ways. One is to combine 2 drugs, each of which are active, to increase the efficacy overall or to reduce the dose of 2 active therapies so that you get better safety or tolerability for the same efficacy. And also, there may be sequential treatments where you start early, perhaps even before symptoms, with one type of medicine and then treat with something else when you have a high plaque burden and then something else still when tau starts to progress. When you start to think about combination therapy though, it's often difficult to do the right studies without some evidence of efficacy of each drug as monotherapy, and then you can start to think about the right dosing regimen. And so I hope that's helpful."

So first, I want to say this is a really large and rich data set, really the first of its kind, not only in MS but, to my knowledge, in neurology where we're in the early stages of figuring out how to repair the brain and how to measure measurements of outcome, measures of repair. The things we're focusing on right now when we look at this rich data set are what are the right cohort of patients to treat. In this trial, we've looked at relapsing MS patients, all the way to secondary progressive. So it's a wide range of patients. What's the right -- what's the optimal cohort? What's the right dose? We studied 4 different doses, and we saw a complex dose response curve. What we actually saw was sort of a bell-shaped curve where we lost efficacy at the highest dose, and then the middle doses, we think we see a signal of efficacy. And so we'll share some of that at ECTRIMS. What's the right concomitant medicine to use? We envision that these repair therapies will be added to immunomodulators, and so we'll be looking at that and, in particular, whether ongoing inflammation in the brain impedes repair. And finally, how do we actually measure the effects of repair if it occurs, particularly, on clinical outcome measures? So some of these questions will be answered by doing further analyses, which we're in the middle of doing right now, intensively, and we'll share whatever we find out at ECTRIMS. And some may need another study. And so what we're honing in on is what's the next step, what's the next study? And obviously, this will be a judicious investment. If we can go to Phase III, we would try. I don't know until I see the specific design. It's -- it could be a Phase II, it could be a Phase III, it could be a Phase II/III. And at that part, we probably won't be able to share at ECTRIMS, but sometime soon, we hope to be able to share that."

Two out of the 3 are approved and are underway to be launched. The preliminary results are very encouraging. As you can imagine, there is a tremendous level of variation viability between countries in terms of tendering, in terms of aggressivity of competition, in terms of provider decision-making, and it's difficult to take an overall, I would say, recipe on how to best launch. What I can say is that the 3 anti-TNFs that we'll have the opportunity to launch will be addressing a current market that is higher than $9 billion in Europe. So this is significant and with Biogen quality. So we have put together a stand-alone BU that is flexible, agile in order to launch the product.

And this impacts not only the outflow but, eventually, the inflow. Viability is tremendous.

I'd like to begin with a personal statement. I'll be stepping down as CEO of a Biogen sometime within the next few months. The board and I recognize that this is an excellent time for a transition. The company is doing well now. The management team is complete and extremely capable. The commercial and R&D activities are going well, and we're on our way to adding to the pipeline through internal and external opportunities. So a good time for a new CEO to take the helm and see Biogen through to what I believe is a very exciting future. This also is an opportune time for me to return to the West Coast, take on one more set of activities and spend more time with my family. 
I've been at Biogen for 6 years. I'm proud of the company and what we've been able to accomplish in that time. We've introduced 6 new products on to the market and increased our revenues, earnings and stock price all by severalfold, and I believe that we're well positioned to keep delivering on our potential to bring even more therapies to patients and returns to our investors. Our R&D and commercial organizations are now world class, joining our already industry-leading biologics manufacturing capabilities. All aspects of the company are operating at a high level. We have brought several potentially game-changing compounds into later-stage development and are in the process of adding further to that pipeline. With the addition of Michel Vounatsos, Mike Ehlers and Paul McKenzie, the company has a full and vibrant leadership team that's capable of moving the company thoughtfully forward. I truly believe that the company has a bright future, and it's with mixed emotions that I leave at this time and not see that future come fully to fruition. 
We're making the announcement now in order to provide an orderly transition for the company and to allow the board to conduct an open and effective search. I'll work with the board to find a great successor who can continue to build on what we have accomplished. We expect to consider both internal and external candidates, and I'm confident that we'll identify an outstanding new leader. I expect to remain as CEO until a successor is identified and can begin. In the interim, I continue to work with the board and management team to accomplish Biogen's goals for 2016. I believe that we're on a good trajectory, that we have great new additions to the management team and I look forward to a successful second half of the year. 
So enough about me. Let's turn to the business. Biogen had a solid second quarter, delivering strong financial performance and important advances in our pipeline. For the second quarter of 2016, Biogen generated $2.9 billion in total revenues, a 12% increase from the same period a year ago. Our GAAP earnings were $4.79 per share, a 22% increase year-over-year, and non-GAAP EPS was $5.21, a 23% increase year-over-year. We continue to grow our leading MS franchise and our hemophilia business, and our efforts to maximize revenues while thoughtfully managing expenses helped to drive attractive earnings growth. As a result, we've raised our financial guidance for the full year. And today, we announced that our Board of Directors has authorized a program to repurchase up to $5 billion of our common stock. 
Looking back, we had quite an eventful second quarter. To begin, we welcome 3 new members of our management team, a new Head of Commercial, Michel Vounatsos, joined us in April. He's completed a thorough assessment and has identified 4 key priorities for driving our MS business forward, which he'll share with you later in this call. Our new Head of R&D, Mike Ehlers, joined us at the end of May. Mike is a brilliant neuroscientist and an established R&D leader who has excelled in both academic and corporate settings. Mike has demonstrated the ability to translate science into the development of important new medicines, and he's already bringing terrific leadership to the organization. And finally, with John Cox preparing to lead the new hemophilia company, we promoted Paul McKenzie to oversee our Pharmaceutical Operations and Technology group. These 3 new leaders bring a wealth of experience and expertise, and we believe that they're poised to take Biogen into its next phase of growth. I'm proud to have them in our organization. 
Last quarter brought a number of positive developments for both our commercial products and our pipeline. We announced our intent to spin off our hemophilia business. That business continues to perform well with combined second quarter revenues of over $200 million for ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX. ALPROLIX also was approved by the European Commission for the treatment of hemophilia B and will be commercialized in the EU by our collaboration partner, Sobi. We had a positive label update for TYSABRI in Europe, including an extended indication. We received regulatory approval for ZINBRYTA in both the U.S. and the EU for the treatment of relapsing MS. FLIXABI an infliximab biosimilar referencing Remicade, received approval in Europe. This will be the second anti-TNF biosimilar that we'll manufacture and commercialize in the EU. And SB5, an adalimumab biosimilar candidate referencing Humira, has been accepted for review by the European Medicines Agency. Aducanumab was accepted into the European Medicines Agency's PRIority MEdicines program, known as PRIME. It was one of only 4 applications accepted out of 18 submitted and the only Alzheimer's disease therapy in development that was accepted. On the early-stage research front, we entered into a broad collaboration and alliance with the University of Pennsylvania and 2 world-renowned gene therapy experts, Drs. James Wilson and Jean Bennett. 
This quarter, we also reported the top line results of the SYNERGY trial for opicinumab. As you are all aware, opicinumab missed both the primary and secondary endpoints. It was -- certainly was disappointing. However, the rigorous design and planning of SYNERGY has yielded an abundance of data that will help us make a well-informed decision about our path forward with opicinumab and our work in remyelination generally. These results are indicative of the significant challenge of targeting neurorepair. During the upcoming ECTRIMS conference in September, we expect to present more detailed efficacy, biomarker and safety data. 
I'll now turn the call over to Mike, and we're eager for you to get to know Mike and experience his passion for our business."

By way of introduction, I spent a number of years in academia as professor and Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator at Duke University, where my research was focused on cell biological and circuit mechanisms of brain function in the normal, developing and diseased nervous system. My career took an exciting turn 6 years ago when I joined Pfizer. I served as the Chief Scientific Officer for the company's Neuroscience and Pain Research Unit and, ultimately, became group leader for BioTherapeutics R&D with responsibility over rare disease, the centers for therapeutic innovation and all large biomolecule sciences. 
I'm just now finishing my second month at Biogen, so there is still a lot I'm getting up to speed on. But I can tell you from the outset that I am working to reshape and progress our pipeline while aggressively pursuing promising assets, both internally and externally. I plan to update you on progress on these fronts in the future. In the meantime, I will comment on the important clinical study readouts this quarter and note some good progress made in advancing our clinical programs. 
Starting with opicinumab, or anti-LINGO, as George discussed. The top line results from the Phase II SYNERGY study were reported in which opicinumab unfortunately missed both the primary and secondary endpoints. However, evidence of a clinical effect with a complex, unexpected dose response was observed. The SYNERGY top line efficacy safety and biomarker results will be presented at ECTRIMS in September. 
Continuing in MS. EC approval was received for an extended indication for TYSABRI in highly active, relapsing-remitting MS patients with inadequate response to prior MS therapy. TYSABRI was previously only indicated for patients who had failed to respond to beta interferon or a glatiramer acetate. This label extension follows recent EC approval for a new patient management plan, including an updated risk algorithm based on JC virus antibody index values. These changes will allow physicians to have more individualized benefit risk discussions with their patients. 
Turning to other promising late-stage assets. Our collaboration partner, Ionis, continues to execute the Phase III studies of nusinersen for infants and children with spinal muscular atrophy, both of which are now fully enrolled. In Alzheimer's disease, it was recently announced that aducanumab was one of only 4 applicants accepted into the European Medicine Agency's PRIority MEdicines program, or PRIME. PRIME aims to bring treatments to patients faster by enhancing the EMA's support for the development of investigational medicines for diseases without available treatment or in need of better treatment options. We continue to work diligently to enroll our aducanumab Phase III trials. Looking ahead, safety data from the titration arm of the Phase 1b study is anticipated by the end of this year. We are working toward the start of Phase III trials for amiselimod or MT-1303 in inflammatory bowel disease and BIIB074, formerly known as raxatrigine, in trigeminal neuralgia. An initiation of the Phase II trial with BIIB074 in patients with neuropathic pain from lumbosacral radiculopathy is planned for later this year. 
In further activities, natalizumab's clinical profile and treatment window supports its continued investigation as a potential novel approach for treating acute ischemic stroke, and the first patient was recently dosed in a second Phase II study in stroke called ACTION 2. Encouraging data was recently generated on earlier-stage assets, BIIB059 or anti-BDCA2 for systemic lupus erythematosus and BG11 (sic) [ BG00011 ] or STX-100 for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Anti-BDCA2 data in healthy volunteers and a lupus cohort of 12 subjects has provided confidence to move into Phase II with trial initiation planned to begin over the summer. These data are anticipated to be presented later this year. The BG11 study is enrolling its final cohort and it is expected that data will be presented after the trial completes. 
Finally, as George mentioned, Biogen announced the broad collaboration and alliance with the University of Pennsylvania and Dr. James Wilson and Jean Bennett to advance gene therapy and gene editing technologies. The expansive research and translational development collaboration has multiple objectives and will primarily focus on the development of therapeutic approaches that target the eye, skeletal muscle and the central nervous system. 
Again, I am pleased to participate in my first earnings call here at Biogen. I anticipate sharing more detail on the advancement of the Biogen pipeline in the coming months as the company works diligently to deliver new therapies to patients. 
With that, I will now pass the call to my good colleague, Michel Vounatsos."
29726,366896620,1009744,"Biogen Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2016",2016-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Biogen Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike. I'm very pleased to be with you this morning. I share my initial thoughts on the MS market and our MS portfolio, outline my priorities going forward and then I will discuss this quarter's results for MS products. Since I arrived at Biogen",1132,"Thanks, Mike. I'm very pleased to be with you this morning. I share my initial thoughts on the MS market and our MS portfolio, outline my priorities going forward and then I will discuss this quarter's results for MS products. 
Since I arrived at Biogen 3 months ago, I have spent time in the field with our operations team, meeting with patients, the neurology community and many of the scientific leaders in multiple sclerosis. Also, I have engaged with the strong Biogen leaders across our commercial organizations. I have listened and learned a lot, and together with the team, we have prioritized immediate opportunities across 4 key areas. We believe these opportunities will benefit our MS franchise today and, at the same time, prepare the organization for potential future product launches. 
Before speaking about our therapies, I think it is important to note, MS is a growing market with approximately 850,000 treated patients worldwide out of a global prevalence estimated at 2.3 million, which includes progressive forms of MS. We estimate the number of treated patients worldwide is growing in the mid-single digits on an annual basis, driven by low single-digit growth in the U.S. and high single-digit growth in Europe. The relatively higher market growth rate overseas is largely due to increasing rate of diagnosis and treatment. And as a leader in MS, we believe we are well positioned to benefit from this trend over time. 
Using the U.S. as an example, where we have the most detailed data, we estimate that approximately 3/4 of the 300,000 treated patients are stable and presumably satisfied on the current therapy. We believe Biogen is holding a clear leadership position in this stable segment of the market. We believe the dynamic opportunity of patients in the U.S. is comprised of approximately 15,000 newly diagnosed patients and approximately 60,000 patients changing medication each year. We believe that Biogen also holds a leadership position in new patient starts within this dynamic portion of the market. 
Turning to our MS portfolio. We believe that the value of our products is well recognized in the eyes of many of our customers, as reflected in our leading global market share of approximately 38%. We believe the breadth of our portfolio is and will continue to be a source of strength in the marketplace by allowing physician to prescribe the right drug to the right patient at the right time.   
As the most prescribed oral therapy for MS worldwide, TECFIDERA benefits from a compelling combination of efficacy, convenience and relative safety. As a result, we estimate that TECFIDERA captures roughly 25% of newly diagnosed and switching patients. Our market research indicates that TYSABRI is clearly viewed as differentiated in terms of efficacy and retains an important role for patients with highly active disease, capturing roughly 30% of all patients switching for efficacy reasons. Our interferon products, AVONEX and PLEGRIDY, combined, hold leading share amongst the interferon therapies. Despite facing headwinds due to the uptake of the orals, we believe these products will continue to play an important role going forward. We are also preparing to launch ZINBRYTA next month in the U.S and Germany. ZINBRYTA is the first in a new class of MS therapy. We believe it will be used by patients switching for efficacy reasons, benefiting from ""once monthly at home"" subcutaneous administration and a differentiated mechanism of action. 
Going forward, we will concentrate our work in the commercial organization across 4 key priorities, namely portfolio strategy, commercial excellence, medical leadership, trust and value. With portfolio strategy, we plan to further define our strategy for products, market segments and geographies. We will work to ensure that our targeted growth opportunities drive consistency across our resource allocation, messaging, marketing tactics and sales force execution. Within commercial excellence, we will work to increase our sophistication in multichannel marketing, including enhancing our digital capabilities while also strengthening our engagement with key customers at the local level. While clearly perceived as a leader in neurology research and clinical development, we believe we also have an opportunity to further enhance our medical leadership. This includes close collaboration with our medical field teams and partnership with scientific leaders. Finally, trust and value. We will work towards developing innovative beyond-the-pill solution for our customers to enhance our reputation and strengthen our partnership and role as a leader in MS. I think that as the leader in MS, we have this responsibility. 
Today, we already have a well-defined plan outlining next steps and target dates, which we have started to implement across the organization. We are initiating this with the aim to accelerate our business to be more focused, to make conscious choices and to be diligent in resource allocation. We believe that this work will be beneficial for our company and our shareholders. For competitive reasons, I am not prepared to go more into the details of these 4 initiatives, but I look forward to updating you on our progress at future meetings. 
Turning to the results for the quarter. Total MS revenues were $2.2 billion this quarter, an increase of 9% versus Q2 of last year. We believe our global market share continues to grow. 
Starting with TECFIDERA. In the U.S., we saw a modest increase in demands compared to the first quarter, largely due to normalization of the seasonality typically seen early in the year. All of our metric lead us to expect a continued, stable trend for TECFIDERA going forward. Outside the U.S., we continue to see increased adoption in the U.K., Italy, Spain. In fact, the number of TECFIDERA patients in Europe has increased approximately 40% over the last year. 
PLEGRIDY is now available in roughly 20 markets in Europe, and where launched, we believe it is helping to slow the rate of decline of our interferons. 
TYSABRI continued to add patient this quarter. We recognize the potential for increased competition from other high-efficacy therapies, but we believe TYSABRI's 10 years of post-marketing experience and well-understood safety profile position it very well. 
In collaboration with AbbVie, we are actively preparing to launch ZINBRYTA starting next month. We are particularly encouraged by the broad indication and data, reinforcing the product safety included in the EU label. 
We are also making progress in our biosimilar business this quarter. We are seeing strong initial update for BENEPALI, the first biosimilar approved in the EU referencing Enbrel, and we expect to launch FLIXABI, our biosimilar referencing Remicade, in the coming weeks. While we only expect a modest contribution from biosimilars in 2016, we do believe this is an attractive opportunity in the longer term. 
So the team delivered a very solid quarter. I look forward to taking Biogen into what I believe is an exciting future. 
With that, I turn the call over to Paul."
29726,366896620,1009744,"Biogen Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2016",2016-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Biogen Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Michel. In the second quarter, our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $4.79, a 22% increase year-over-year, while our none-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $5.21, an increase of 23%. Total revenue for Q2 grew 12% year-over-year to approximat",1141,"Thanks, Michel. In the second quarter, our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $4.79, a 22% increase year-over-year, while our none-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $5.21, an increase of 23%. Total revenue for Q2 grew 12% year-over-year to approximately $2.9 billion. It's important to note we had $173 million in foreign exchange hedge gains in the full year of 2015, which impact our year-over-year revenue comparisons this year. In Q2, versus prior year, revenues were unfavorably impacted by $45 million from hedging. Combined with the $1 million benefit from foreign exchange rates, overall revenue was weakened by approximately $44 million year-over-year. I'll highlight the impact of foreign exchange in hedging on each of our major MS therapies. 
Global second quarter TECFIDERA revenue was $987 million, an increase of 12% versus the same quarter last year. This included revenues of $780 million in the U.S. and $206 million outside the U.S. In the U.S., TECFIDERA modestly benefited from an inventory rebalancing in the wholesaler channel versus prior quarter. Outside the U.S., foreign exchange and hedge impact weakened TECFIDERA revenue comparison by approximately $13 million. 
Interferon revenues, including both AVONEX and PLEGRIDY, were $728 million during the second quarter, an increase of 6% versus the same quarter last year. This included $519 million in the U.S. and $209 million in sales outside the U.S. In the U.S., AVONEX also modestly benefited from an inventory rebalancing in the wholesaler channel versus prior quarter. Outside the U.S., foreign exchange and the hedge impact weakened interferon revenue comparison by approximately $17 million. 
TYSABRI worldwide revenues were $497 million this quarter, an increase of 7% versus the same quarter last year. This included $305 million in the U.S. and $192 million outside the U.S. Foreign exchange and the hedge impact weakened TYSABRI revenue comparison by approximately $13 million. 
Turning to our hemophilia business, which generated $205 million this quarter. ELOCTATE revenue for the quarter was $125 million, and ALPROLIX revenue in Q2 was $80 million. We continue to work towards spinning off our hemophilia business and related assets and plan to file the Form 10 later this summer and complete the distribution in early 2017. 
Turning to our anti-CD20 revenues. We recorded $349 million for Q2, an increase from prior quarter, driven by solid demand. Total other revenues, which include revenues from collaboration relationships, royalties and contract manufacturing, were $79 million. 
Now turning to the expense lines on the P&L. Q2 GAAP cost of goods sold were $370 million or 13% of revenue. Non-GAAP cost of goods sold were $354 million or 12% of revenue. As a percentage of sales, COGS was impacted by increased inventory write-offs versus the lows seen in prior quarter. In addition, based on our evaluation of our small-scale manufacturing capacity needs, we booked a GAAP-only charge for accelerated depreciation related to our intent to close or divest our small-scale manufacturing facility in Cambridge. 
Q2 GAAP and non-GAAP R&D expense was $473 million or 16% of revenue, which includes $20 million related to the gene therapy collaboration with the University of Pennsylvania. Overall, R&D reflects relatively low business development expense, though this remains a critical strategic priority for us as we look to bring in high-quality assets. 
Q2 GAAP SG&A was $492 million or 17% of revenue. Q2 non-GAAP SG&A expense was $489 million, also 17% of revenue. We remain committed to achieving savings by reducing lower priorities and services for the balance of the year. Recall, over the last few years, we've gone through a number of product launches and thought it was the right decision to invest behind these products. Starting in 2015, we pivoted and took a number of actions to curb operating expense growth, including a restructuring and further efforts to reduce costs, which is reflected in our operating leverage for the quarter. This will also allow us to reinvest in the pipeline. Other net expense was $59 million in Q2, which includes $66 million in interest expense related to our 2015 bond offering. 
In Q2, both our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were approximately 25%. Our weighted average diluted share count was approximately $219 million for Q2. This brings us to our diluted earnings per share, which were $4.79 on a GAAP basis and $5.21 on a non-GAAP basis for the second quarter. We ended the quarter with approximately $7.3 billion in cash and marketable securities with approximately 40% of this in the United States. Today, we also announced a $5 billion share repurchase program, which we anticipate will be executed over the course of the next 3 years. We believe this leaves ample room for flexibility for strategic deployment. 
So overall, we had a strong quarter, driven by revenue growth from our MS therapies rebounding from the seasonality seen in the first quarter, continued growth from our hemophilia business and diligent cost controls. 
This now brings us to our full year 2016 guidance. We now expect revenues of approximately $11.2 billion to $11.4 billion, a modest improvement from prior guidance. Our outlook assumes continued stable demand, patient demand for TECFIDERA in 2016 in the United States. We believe TYSABRI will also remain on a stable trajectory for the balance of the year. Our outlook assumes AVONEX and PLEGRIDY patients, combined, will continue to gradually decline as patients move toward orals. For ZINBRYTA, we anticipate a modest revenue contribution in the U.S. and EU as launches are expected to begin in August. And our revenues outlook is based on stable foreign exchange rates. 
From an expense perspective, we anticipate upward pressure on cost of goods sold due to the unexpected issuance by the U.S. Patent Office of a patent to a third party related to recombinant interferon beta protein. This patent, issued on June 28 and expiring in June 2033, is relevant to AVONEX and PLEGRIDY. We will play -- pay royalties in the mid-single digits during the life of this patent. For the remainder of 2016, we expect the royalty payment to be approximately $50 million. We anticipate GAAP and non-GAAP R&D expense between 17% and 18% of sales and GAAP and non-GAAP SG&A expense to be between 16% and 17% of revenue. We anticipate GAAP EPS results between $18.10 and $18.40 and non-GAAP EPS to be between $19.70 and $20. Our outlook assumes a very modest reduction in our full year weighted average diluted share count. 
Of note, this guidance assumes contribution from our hemophilia business through the balance of the year as we expect the spin-off to complete in early 2017. Additionally, this guidance does not include any impact from potential acquisitions or large late-stage business development transactions as both are hard to predict. Overall, this increase in guidance reflects the solid revenues seen this quarter, combined with the continued operating expense control. 
I'll turn the call over to George for his closing comments."

Look, financially, I'm pleased with where we are so far this year. Our results year-to-date have been better than expected. We've raised guidance, and we have a new share repurchase program authorized by the board. We have made good progress towards the 3 focus areas I discussed after the first quarter: careful management of expenses, maximizing revenues and rapidly advancing the pipeline. 
As I look forward and think about the future growth of Biogen, I want to stress how those key focus areas will evolve. The team expects to continue managing expenses, but as you know, we can't save our way to growth. Maximizing revenues and rapidly advancing the pipeline will become front and center, especially with Michel and Mike now in their respective roles. Michel's 4 key priorities of portfolio strategy, commercial excellence, medical leadership and trust and value will be the pillars we use to maximize revenues. And under Mike's leadership, we intend to reshape the pipeline, rationalize existing programs and aggressively pursue promising assets, both internally and externally. We believe this focus will help advance more assets through the pipeline and ideally deliver more therapies to patients. 
At the same time as we're bringing focus and investment to our core area of expertise in neurology, we'll continue to be opportunistic when we see internal and external opportunities to enhance shareholder value. As a result, we have progressed some of the most promising earlier-stage assets that we have in our pipeline even outside of neurology. We have invested in our biosimilar joint venture to leverage our competitive strengths in manufacturing and commercialization. We've chosen to spin-off our growing hemophilia business because we believe it's the right decision to ensure fit and focus. And as we've announced today, we'll buy back shares when appropriate. 
So we've delivered strong financial results this quarter while making progress advancing our pipeline and our commercial business. We have a great leadership team and a passionate group of employees who come to work every day to make a positive impact on patients' lives. It's been an honor and a privilege to serve this organization as the CEO for the last 6 years, and I remain committed to leading the company until my successor is identified. 
I want to take this opportunity to thank all of our employees for their hard work and dedication. And I want to thank you, all, for joining us this morning.

And it's pretty stable unit trends on TECFIDERA, pretty stable unit trends on TYSABRI and modest gradual decline on the interferon franchise. Ex United States, we are not seeing any pricing on a year-over-year basis, and all of the gains are attributable to volume and unit expansion. TYSABRI is holding well outside the United States as well as the interferon business, and we continue to, in a small way, penetrate some markets and get some accretive benefits of things even outside of Europe. And TECFIDERA continues to expand on a year-over-year basis and gaining market share, particularly as we are moving into relatively early launch timing in Southern European countries and having very good success in the U.K."

So it's a leadership position on interferons, a leadership position on orals, a leadership position on high-efficacy products. So this is a remarkable situation. And on top of that, we are launching ZINBRYTA. So the dynamic is very good. Having said that, when you peel the onion and you get to discover the opportunity and the operations, you'll find ways to do better. And this is why, together with the team, we have prioritized 4 key areas: portfolio management, 5, 6 assets in the same therapy area. It's a challenge on how to manage that well; commercial excellence; medical leadership; trust and value. And I believe that with those, we'll be able to make further difference. Geographically, also, we can see that some parts are better managed than others. And I have already started to make some decisions. We don't wait, and you can expect that more will come. So this is what I would like to say -- and the portfolio management doesn't mean that all the products will be resourced and promoted equally. It's all about the growth opportunity, the way that you outline, and this is where there will be a clear, I would say, alignment between those resource allocation and execution."

One of the reasons why we brought in BACE inhibitor into our pipeline with our collaboration with Eisai, the reason why we have tau programs internally and that we're in search of even other things potentially to add to the mix is based on -- in part on that belief, that combination could be helpful. And you can think of it in 2 ways. One is to combine 2 drugs, each of which are active, to increase the efficacy overall or to reduce the dose of 2 active therapies so that you get better safety or tolerability for the same efficacy. And also, there may be sequential treatments where you start early, perhaps even before symptoms, with one type of medicine and then treat with something else when you have a high plaque burden and then something else still when tau starts to progress. When you start to think about combination therapy though, it's often difficult to do the right studies without some evidence of efficacy of each drug as monotherapy, and then you can start to think about the right dosing regimen. And so I hope that's helpful."

So first, I want to say this is a really large and rich data set, really the first of its kind, not only in MS but, to my knowledge, in neurology where we're in the early stages of figuring out how to repair the brain and how to measure measurements of outcome, measures of repair. The things we're focusing on right now when we look at this rich data set are what are the right cohort of patients to treat. In this trial, we've looked at relapsing MS patients, all the way to secondary progressive. So it's a wide range of patients. What's the right -- what's the optimal cohort? What's the right dose? We studied 4 different doses, and we saw a complex dose response curve. What we actually saw was sort of a bell-shaped curve where we lost efficacy at the highest dose, and then the middle doses, we think we see a signal of efficacy. And so we'll share some of that at ECTRIMS. What's the right concomitant medicine to use? We envision that these repair therapies will be added to immunomodulators, and so we'll be looking at that and, in particular, whether ongoing inflammation in the brain impedes repair. And finally, how do we actually measure the effects of repair if it occurs, particularly, on clinical outcome measures? So some of these questions will be answered by doing further analyses, which we're in the middle of doing right now, intensively, and we'll share whatever we find out at ECTRIMS. And some may need another study. And so what we're honing in on is what's the next step, what's the next study? And obviously, this will be a judicious investment. If we can go to Phase III, we would try. I don't know until I see the specific design. It's -- it could be a Phase II, it could be a Phase III, it could be a Phase II/III. And that part, we probably won't be able to share at ECTRIMS, but sometime soon, we hope to be able to share that."

As you can imagine, there is a tremendous level of variation viability between countries in terms of tendering, in terms of aggressivity of competition, in terms of provider decision-making, and it's difficult to take an overall, I would say, recipe on how to best launch. What I can say is that the 3 anti-TNFs that we'll have the opportunity to launch will be addressing a current market that is higher than $9 billion in Europe. So this is significant and with Biogen quality. So we have put together a stand-alone BU that is flexible, agile in order to launch the product.

Those patients, during the first phase on the product, are suffering, for some of them, on abdominal pain, diarrhea, discomfort that is leading, in some cases, with very high level of viability to discontinue on the product. And this impacts not only the outflow but, eventually, the inflow. Viability is tremendous.

Thanks for joining us. I'd like to begin with a personal statement. I'll be stepping down as CEO of a Biogen sometime within the next few months. The board and I recognize that this is an excellent time",1080,"Okay. Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. 
I'd like to begin with a personal statement. I'll be stepping down as CEO of a Biogen sometime within the next few months. The board and I recognize that this is an excellent time for a transition. The company is doing well now. The management team is complete and extremely capable. The commercial and R&D activities are going well, and we're on our way to adding to the pipeline through internal and external opportunities. So a good time for a new CEO to take the helm and see Biogen through to what I believe is a very exciting future. This also is an opportune time for me to return to the West Coast, take on one more set of activities and spend more time with my family. 
I've been at Biogen for 6 years. I'm proud of the company and what we've been able to accomplish in that time. We've introduced 6 new products on to the market and increased our revenues, earnings and stock price all by severalfold, and I believe that we're well positioned to keep delivering on our potential to bring even more therapies to patients and returns to our investors. Our R&D and commercial organizations are now world class, joining our already industry-leading biologics manufacturing capabilities. All aspects of the company are operating at a high level. We have brought several potentially game-changing compounds into later-stage development and are in the process of adding further to that pipeline. With the addition of Michel Vounatsos, Mike Ehlers and Paul McKenzie, the company has a full and vibrant leadership team that's capable of moving the company thoughtfully forward. I truly believe that the company has a bright future, and it's with mixed emotions that I leave at this time and not see that future come fully to fruition. 
We're making the announcement now in order to provide an orderly transition for the company and to allow the board to conduct an open and effective search. I'll work with the board to find a great successor who can continue to build on what we have accomplished. We expect to consider both internal and external candidates, and I'm confident that we'll identify an outstanding new leader. I expect to remain as CEO until a successor is identified and can begin. In the interim, I continue to work with the board and management team to accomplish Biogen's goals for 2016. I believe that we're on a good trajectory, that we have great new additions to the management team and I look forward to a successful second half of the year. 
So enough about me. Let's turn to the business. Biogen had a solid second quarter, delivering strong financial performance and important advances in our pipeline. For the second quarter of 2016, Biogen generated $2.9 billion in total revenues, a 12% increase from the same period a year ago. Our GAAP earnings were $4.79 per share, a 22% increase year-over-year, and non-GAAP EPS was $5.21, a 23% increase year-over-year. We continue to grow our leading MS franchise and our hemophilia business, and our efforts to maximize revenues while thoughtfully managing expenses helped to drive attractive earnings growth. As a result, we've raised our financial guidance for the full year. And today, we announced that our Board of Directors has authorized a program to repurchase up to $5 billion of our common stock. 
Looking back, we had quite an eventful second quarter. To begin, we welcome 3 new members of our management team, a new Head of Commercial, Michel Vounatsos, joined us in April. He's completed a thorough assessment and has identified 4 key priorities for driving our MS business forward, which he'll share with you later in this call. Our new Head of R&D, Mike Ehlers, joined us at the end of May. Mike is a brilliant neuroscientist and an established R&D leader who has excelled in both academic and corporate settings. Mike has demonstrated the ability to translate science into the development of important new medicines, and he's already bringing terrific leadership to the organization. And finally, with John Cox preparing to lead the new hemophilia company, we promoted Paul McKenzie to oversee our Pharmaceutical Operations and Technology group. These 3 new leaders bring a wealth of experience and expertise, and we believe that they're poised to take Biogen into its next phase of growth. I'm proud to have them in our organization. 
Last quarter brought a number of positive developments for both our commercial products and our pipeline. We announced our intent to spin off our hemophilia business. That business continues to perform well with combined second quarter revenues of over $200 million for ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX. ALPROLIX also was approved by the European Commission for the treatment of hemophilia B and will be commercialized in the EU by our collaboration partner, Sobi. We had a positive label update for TYSABRI in Europe, including an extended indication. We received regulatory approval for ZINBRYTA in both the U.S. and the EU for the treatment of relapsing MS. FLIXABI an infliximab biosimilar referencing Remicade, received approval in Europe. This will be the second anti-TNF biosimilar that we'll manufacture and commercialize in the EU. And SB5, an adalimumab biosimilar candidate referencing Humira, has been accepted for review by the European Medicines Agency. Aducanumab was accepted into the European Medicines Agency's PRIority MEdicines program, known as PRIME. It was one of only 4 applications accepted out of 18 submitted and the only Alzheimer's disease therapy in development that was accepted. On the early-stage research front, we entered into a broad collaboration and alliance with the University of Pennsylvania and 2 world-renowned gene therapy experts, Drs. James Wilson and Jean Bennett. 
This quarter, we also reported the top line results of the SYNERGY trial for opicinumab. As you are all aware, opicinumab missed both the primary and secondary endpoints. It was -- certainly was disappointing. However, the rigorous design and planning of SYNERGY has yielded an abundance of data that will help us make a well-informed decision about our path forward with opicinumab and our work in remyelination generally. These results are indicative of the significant challenge of targeting neurorepair. During the upcoming ECTRIMS conference in September, we expect to present more detailed efficacy, biomarker and safety data. 
I'll now turn the call over to Mike, and we're eager for you to get to know Mike and experience his passion for our business."

By way of introduction, I spent a number of years in academia as professor and Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator at Duke University, where my research was focused on cell biological and circuit mechanisms of brain function in the normal, developing and diseased nervous system. My career took an exciting turn 6 years ago when I joined Pfizer. I served as the Chief Scientific Officer for the company's Neuroscience and Pain Research Unit and, ultimately, became group leader for BioTherapeutics R&D with responsibility over rare disease, the centers for therapeutic innovation and all large biomolecule sciences. 
I'm just now finishing my second month at Biogen, so there is still a lot I'm getting up to speed on. But I can tell you from the outset that I am working to reshape and progress our pipeline while aggressively pursuing promising assets, both internally and externally. I plan to update you on progress on these fronts in the future. In the meantime, I will comment on the important clinical study readouts this quarter and note some good progress made in advancing our clinical programs. 
Starting with opicinumab, or anti-LINGO, as George discussed. The top line results from the Phase II SYNERGY study were reported in which opicinumab unfortunately missed both the primary and secondary endpoints. However, evidence of a clinical effect with a complex, unexpected dose response was observed. The SYNERGY top line efficacy safety and biomarker results will be presented at ECTRIMS in September. 
Continuing in MS. EC approval was received for an extended indication for TYSABRI in highly active, relapsing-remitting MS patients with inadequate response to prior MS therapy. TYSABRI was previously only indicated for patients who had failed to respond to beta interferon or a glatiramer acetate. This label extension follows recent EC approval for a new patient management plan, including an updated risk algorithm based on JC virus antibody index values. These changes will allow physicians to have more individualized benefit risk discussions with their patients. 
Turning to other promising late-stage assets. Our collaboration partner, Ionis, continues to execute the Phase III studies of nusinersen for infants and children with spinal muscular atrophy, both of which are now fully enrolled. In Alzheimer's disease, it was recently announced that aducanumab was one of only 4 applicants accepted into the European Medicine Agency's PRIority MEdicines program, or PRIME. PRIME aims to bring treatments to patients faster by enhancing the EMA's support for the development of investigational medicines for diseases without available treatment or in need of better treatment options. We continue to work diligently to enroll our aducanumab Phase III trials. Looking ahead, safety data from the titration arm of the Phase 1b study is anticipated by the end of this year. We are working toward the start of Phase III trials for amiselimod or MT-1303 in inflammatory bowel disease and BIIB074, formerly known as raxatrigine, in trigeminal neuralgia. An initiation of the Phase II trial with BIIB074 in patients with neuropathic pain from lumbosacral radiculopathy is planned for later this year. 
In further activities, natalizumab's clinical profile and treatment window supports its continued investigation as a potential novel approach for treating acute ischemic stroke, and the first patient was recently dosed in a second Phase II study in stroke called ACTION 2. Encouraging data was recently generated on earlier-stage assets, BIIB059 or anti-BDCA2 for systemic lupus erythematosus and BG11 (sic) [ BG00011 ] or STX-100 for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Anti-BDCA2 data in healthy volunteers and a lupus cohort of 12 subjects has provided confidence to move into Phase II with trial initiation planned to begin over the summer. These data are anticipated to be presented later this year. The BG11 study is enrolling its final cohort and it is expected that data will be presented after the trial completes. 
Finally, as George mentioned, Biogen announced the broad collaboration and alliance with the University of Pennsylvania and Dr. James Wilson and Jean Bennett to advance gene therapy and gene editing technologies. The expansive research and translational development collaboration has multiple objectives and will primarily focus on the development of therapeutic approaches that target the eye, skeletal muscle and the central nervous system. 
Again, I am pleased to participate in my first earnings call here at Biogen. I anticipate sharing more detail on the advancement of the Biogen pipeline in the coming months as the company works diligently to deliver new therapies to patients. 
With that, I will now pass the call to my good colleague, Michel Vounatsos."
29726,366896620,1010156,"Biogen Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2016",2016-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Biogen Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike. I'm very pleased to be with you this morning. I share my initial thoughts on the MS market and our MS portfolio, outline my priorities going forward and then I will discuss this quarter's results for MS products. Since I arrived at Biogen",1132,"Thanks, Mike. I'm very pleased to be with you this morning. I share my initial thoughts on the MS market and our MS portfolio, outline my priorities going forward and then I will discuss this quarter's results for MS products. 
Since I arrived at Biogen 3 months ago, I have spent time in the field with our operations team, meeting with patients, the neurology community and many of the scientific leaders in multiple sclerosis. Also, I have engaged with the strong Biogen leaders across our commercial organizations. I have listened and learned a lot, and together with the team, we have prioritized immediate opportunities across 4 key areas. We believe these opportunities will benefit our MS franchise today and, at the same time, prepare the organization for potential future product launches. 
Before speaking about our therapies, I think it is important to note, MS is a growing market with approximately 850,000 treated patients worldwide out of a global prevalence estimated at 2.3 million, which includes progressive forms of MS. We estimate the number of treated patients worldwide is growing in the mid-single digits on an annual basis, driven by low single-digit growth in the U.S. and high single-digit growth in Europe. The relatively higher market growth rate overseas is largely due to increasing rate of diagnosis and treatment. And as a leader in MS, we believe we are well positioned to benefit from this trend over time. 
Using the U.S. as an example, where we have the most detailed data, we estimate that approximately 3/4 of the 300,000 treated patients are stable and presumably satisfied on the current therapy. We believe Biogen is holding a clear leadership position in this stable segment of the market. We believe the dynamic opportunity of patients in the U.S. is comprised of approximately 15,000 newly diagnosed patients and approximately 60,000 patients changing medication each year. We believe that Biogen also holds a leadership position in new patient starts within this dynamic portion of the market. 
Turning to our MS portfolio. We believe that the value of our products is well recognized in the eyes of many of our customers, as reflected in our leading global market share of approximately 38%. We believe the breadth of our portfolio is and will continue to be a source of strength in the marketplace by allowing physician to prescribe the right drug to the right patient at the right time.   
As the most prescribed oral therapy for MS worldwide, TECFIDERA benefits from a compelling combination of efficacy, convenience and relative safety. As a result, we estimate that TECFIDERA captures roughly 25% of newly diagnosed and switching patients. Our market research indicates that TYSABRI is clearly viewed as differentiated in terms of efficacy and retains an important role for patients with highly active disease, capturing roughly 30% of all patients switching for efficacy reasons. Our interferon products, AVONEX and PLEGRIDY, combined, hold leading share amongst the interferon therapies. Despite facing headwinds due to the uptake of the orals, we believe these products will continue to play an important role going forward. We are also preparing to launch ZINBRYTA next month in the U.S and Germany. ZINBRYTA is the first in a new class of MS therapy. We believe it will be used by patients switching for efficacy reasons, benefiting from ""once monthly at home"" subcutaneous administration and a differentiated mechanism of action. 
Going forward, we will concentrate our work in the commercial organization across 4 key priorities, namely portfolio strategy, commercial excellence, medical leadership, trust and value. With portfolio strategy, we plan to further define our strategy for products, market segments and geographies. We will work to ensure that our targeted growth opportunities drive consistency across our resource allocation, messaging, marketing tactics and sales force execution. Within commercial excellence, we will work to increase our sophistication in multichannel marketing, including enhancing our digital capabilities while also strengthening our engagement with key customers at the local level. While clearly perceived as a leader in neurology research and clinical development, we believe we also have an opportunity to further enhance our medical leadership. This includes close collaboration with our medical field teams and partnership with scientific leaders. Finally, trust and value. We will work towards developing innovative beyond-the-pill solution for our customers to enhance our reputation and strengthen our partnership and role as a leader in MS. I think that as the leader in MS, we have this responsibility. 
Today, we already have a well-defined plan outlining next steps and target dates, which we have started to implement across the organization. We are initiating this with the aim to accelerate our business to be more focused, to make conscious choices and to be diligent in resource allocation. We believe that this work will be beneficial for our company and our shareholders. For competitive reasons, I am not prepared to go more into the details of these 4 initiatives, but I look forward to updating you on our progress at future meetings. 
Turning to the results for the quarter. Total MS revenues were $2.2 billion this quarter, an increase of 9% versus Q2 of last year. We believe our global market share continues to grow. 
Starting with TECFIDERA. In the U.S., we saw a modest increase in demands compared to the first quarter, largely due to normalization of the seasonality typically seen early in the year. All of our metric lead us to expect a continued, stable trend for TECFIDERA going forward. Outside the U.S., we continue to see increased adoption in the U.K., Italy, Spain. In fact, the number of TECFIDERA patients in Europe has increased approximately 40% over the last year. 
PLEGRIDY is now available in roughly 20 markets in Europe, and where launched, we believe it is helping to slow the rate of decline of our interferons. 
TYSABRI continued to add patient this quarter. We recognize the potential for increased competition from other high-efficacy therapies, but we believe TYSABRI's 10 years of post-marketing experience and well-understood safety profile position it very well. 
In collaboration with AbbVie, we are actively preparing to launch ZINBRYTA starting next month. We are particularly encouraged by the broad indication and data, reinforcing the product safety included in the EU label. 
We are also making progress in our biosimilar business this quarter. We are seeing strong initial update for BENEPALI, the first biosimilar approved in the EU referencing Enbrel, and we expect to launch FLIXABI, our biosimilar referencing Remicade, in the coming weeks. While we only expect a modest contribution from biosimilars in 2016, we do believe this is an attractive opportunity in the longer term. 
So the team delivered a very solid quarter. I look forward to taking Biogen into what I believe is an exciting future. 
With that, I turn the call over to Paul."

In the second quarter, our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $4.79, a 22% increase year-over-year, while our none-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $5.21, an increase of 23%. Total revenue for Q2 grew 12% year-over-year to approximat",1141,"Thanks, Michel. In the second quarter, our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $4.79, a 22% increase year-over-year, while our none-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $5.21, an increase of 23%. Total revenue for Q2 grew 12% year-over-year to approximately $2.9 billion. It's important to note we had $173 million in foreign exchange hedge gains in the full year of 2015, which impact our year-over-year revenue comparisons this year. In Q2, versus prior year, revenues were unfavorably impacted by $45 million from hedging. Combined with the $1 million benefit from foreign exchange rates, overall revenue was weakened by approximately $44 million year-over-year. I'll highlight the impact of foreign exchange in hedging on each of our major MS therapies. 
Global second quarter TECFIDERA revenue was $987 million, an increase of 12% versus the same quarter last year. This included revenues of $780 million in the U.S. and $206 million outside the U.S. In the U.S., TECFIDERA modestly benefited from an inventory rebalancing in the wholesaler channel versus prior quarter. Outside the U.S., foreign exchange and hedge impact weakened TECFIDERA revenue comparison by approximately $13 million. 
Interferon revenues, including both AVONEX and PLEGRIDY, were $728 million during the second quarter, an increase of 6% versus the same quarter last year. This included $519 million in the U.S. and $209 million in sales outside the U.S. In the U.S., AVONEX also modestly benefited from an inventory rebalancing in the wholesaler channel versus prior quarter. Outside the U.S., foreign exchange and the hedge impact weakened interferon revenue comparison by approximately $17 million. 
TYSABRI worldwide revenues were $497 million this quarter, an increase of 7% versus the same quarter last year. This included $305 million in the U.S. and $192 million outside the U.S. Foreign exchange and the hedge impact weakened TYSABRI revenue comparison by approximately $13 million. 
Turning to our hemophilia business, which generated $205 million this quarter. ELOCTATE revenue for the quarter was $125 million, and ALPROLIX revenue in Q2 was $80 million. We continue to work towards spinning off our hemophilia business and related assets and plan to file the Form 10 later this summer and complete the distribution in early 2017. 
Turning to our anti-CD20 revenues. We recorded $349 million for Q2, an increase from prior quarter, driven by solid demand. Total other revenues, which include revenues from collaboration relationships, royalties and contract manufacturing, were $79 million. 
Now turning to the expense lines on the P&L. Q2 GAAP cost of goods sold were $370 million or 13% of revenue. Non-GAAP cost of goods sold were $354 million or 12% of revenue. As a percentage of sales, COGS was impacted by increased inventory write-offs versus the lows seen in prior quarter. In addition, based on our evaluation of our small-scale manufacturing capacity needs, we booked a GAAP-only charge for accelerated depreciation related to our intent to close or divest our small-scale manufacturing facility in Cambridge. 
Q2 GAAP and non-GAAP R&D expense was $473 million or 16% of revenue, which includes $20 million related to the gene therapy collaboration with the University of Pennsylvania. Overall, R&D reflects relatively low business development expense, though this remains a critical strategic priority for us as we look to bring in high-quality assets. 
Q2 GAAP SG&A was $492 million or 17% of revenue. Q2 non-GAAP SG&A expense was $489 million, also 17% of revenue. We remain committed to achieving savings by reducing lower priorities and services for the balance of the year. Recall, over the last few years, we've gone through a number of product launches and thought it was the right decision to invest behind these products. Starting in 2015, we pivoted and took a number of actions to curb operating expense growth, including a restructuring and further efforts to reduce costs, which is reflected in our operating leverage for the quarter. This will also allow us to reinvest in the pipeline. Other net expense was $59 million in Q2, which includes $66 million in interest expense related to our 2015 bond offering. 
In Q2, both our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were approximately 25%. Our weighted average diluted share count was approximately $219 million for Q2. This brings us to our diluted earnings per share, which were $4.79 on a GAAP basis and $5.21 on a non-GAAP basis for the second quarter. We ended the quarter with approximately $7.3 billion in cash and marketable securities with approximately 40% of this in the United States. Today, we also announced a $5 billion share repurchase program, which we anticipate will be executed over the course of the next 3 years. We believe this leaves ample room for flexibility for strategic deployment. 
So overall, we had a strong quarter, driven by revenue growth from our MS therapies rebounding from the seasonality seen in the first quarter, continued growth from our hemophilia business and diligent cost controls. 
This now brings us to our full year 2016 guidance. We now expect revenues of approximately $11.2 billion to $11.4 billion, a modest improvement from prior guidance. Our outlook assumes continued stable demand, patient demand for TECFIDERA in 2016 in the United States. We believe TYSABRI will also remain on a stable trajectory for the balance of the year. Our outlook assumes AVONEX and PLEGRIDY patients, combined, will continue to gradually decline as patients move toward orals. For ZINBRYTA, we anticipate a modest revenue contribution in the U.S. and EU as launches are expected to begin in August. And our revenues outlook is based on stable foreign exchange rates. 
From an expense perspective, we anticipate upward pressure on cost of goods sold due to the unexpected issuance by the U.S. Patent Office of a patent to a third party related to recombinant interferon beta protein. This patent, issued on June 28 and expiring in June 2033, is relevant to AVONEX and PLEGRIDY. We will play -- pay royalties in the mid-single digits during the life of this patent. For the remainder of 2016, we expect the royalty payment to be approximately $50 million. We anticipate GAAP and non-GAAP R&D expense between 17% and 18% of sales and GAAP and non-GAAP SG&A expense to be between 16% and 17% of revenue. We anticipate GAAP EPS results between $18.10 and $18.40 and non-GAAP EPS to be between $19.70 and $20. Our outlook assumes a very modest reduction in our full year weighted average diluted share count. 
Of note, this guidance assumes contribution from our hemophilia business through the balance of the year as we expect the spin-off to complete in early 2017. Additionally, this guidance does not include any impact from potential acquisitions or large late-stage business development transactions as both are hard to predict. Overall, this increase in guidance reflects the solid revenues seen this quarter, combined with the continued operating expense control. 
I'll turn the call over to George for his closing comments."

Look, financially, I'm pleased with where we are so far this year. Our results year-to-date have been better than expected. We've raised guidance, and we have a new share repurchase program authorized by the board. We have made good progress towards the 3 focus areas I discussed after the first quarter: careful management of expenses, maximizing revenues and rapidly advancing the pipeline. 
As I look forward and think about the future growth of Biogen, I want to stress how those key focus areas will evolve. The team expects to continue managing expenses, but as you know, we can't save our way to growth. Maximizing revenues and rapidly advancing the pipeline will become front and center, especially with Michel and Mike now in their respective roles. Michel's 4 key priorities of portfolio strategy, commercial excellence, medical leadership and trust and value will be the pillars we use to maximize revenues. And under Mike's leadership, we intend to reshape the pipeline, rationalize existing programs and aggressively pursue promising assets, both internally and externally. We believe this focus will help advance more assets through the pipeline and ideally deliver more therapies to patients. 
At the same time as we're bringing focus and investment to our core area of expertise in neurology, we'll continue to be opportunistic when we see internal and external opportunities to enhance shareholder value. As a result, we have progressed some of the most promising earlier-stage assets that we have in our pipeline even outside of neurology. We have invested in our biosimilar joint venture to leverage our competitive strengths in manufacturing and commercialization. We've chosen to spin-off our growing hemophilia business because we believe it's the right decision to ensure fit and focus. And as we've announced today, we'll buy back shares when appropriate. 
So we've delivered strong financial results this quarter while making progress advancing our pipeline and our commercial business. We have a great leadership team and a passionate group of employees who come to work every day to make a positive impact on patients' lives. It's been an honor and a privilege to serve this organization as the CEO for the last 6 years, and I remain committed to leading the company until my successor is identified. 
I want to take this opportunity to thank all of our employees for their hard work and dedication. And I want to thank you, all, for joining us this morning.

Having said that, we have a strong presence in the high-efficacy segment of the market, and this is basically a market trend where we can see that basically provide us a treating earlier and physician treating earlier more aggressively.

And on top of that, we are launching ZINBRYTA. So the dynamic is very good. Having said that, when you peel the onion and you get to discover the opportunity and the operations, you'll find ways to do better. And this is why, together with the team, we have prioritized 4 key areas: portfolio management, 5, 6 assets in the same therapy area. It's a challenge on how to manage that well; commercial excellence; medical leadership; trust and value. And I believe that with those, we'll be able to make further difference. Geographically, also, we can see that some parts are better managed than others. And I have already started to make some decisions. We don't wait, and you can expect that more will come. So this is what I would like to say -- and the portfolio management doesn't mean that all the products will be resourced and promoted equally.

And you can think of it in 2 ways. One is to combine 2 drugs, each of which are active, to increase the efficacy overall or to reduce the dose of 2 active therapies so that you get better safety or tolerability for the same efficacy. And also, there may be sequential treatments where you start early, perhaps even before symptoms, with one type of medicine and then treat with something else when you have a high plaque burden and then something else still when tau starts to progress. When you start to think about combination therapy though, it's often difficult to do the right studies without some evidence of efficacy of each drug as monotherapy, and then you can start to think about the right dosing regimen.

So first, I want to say this is a really large and rich data set, really the first of its kind, not only in MS but, to my knowledge, in neurology where we're in the early stages of figuring out how to repair the brain and how to measure measurements of outcome, measures of repair. The things we're focusing on right now when we look at this rich data set are what are the right cohort of patients to treat. In this trial, we've looked at relapsing MS patients, all the way to secondary progressive. So it's a wide range of patients. What's the right -- what's the optimal cohort? What's the right dose? We studied 4 different doses, and we saw a complex dose response curve. What we actually saw was sort of a bell-shaped curve where we lost efficacy at the highest dose, and then the middle doses, we think we see a signal of efficacy. And so we'll share some of that at ECTRIMS. What's the right concomitant medicine to use? We envision that these repair therapies will be added to immunomodulators, and so we'll be looking at that and, in particular, whether ongoing inflammation in the brain impedes repair. And finally, how do we actually measure the effects of repair if it occurs, particularly, on clinical outcome measures? So some of these questions will be answered by doing further analyses, which we're in the middle of doing right now, intensively, and we'll share whatever we find out at ECTRIMS. And some may need another study. And so what we're honing in on is what's the next step, what's the next study? And obviously, this will be a judicious investment. If we can go to Phase III, we would try. I don't know until I see the specific design. It's -- it could be a Phase II, it could be a Phase III, it could be a Phase II/III.

So as you have seen, 2 great companies came together with complementary capabilities in order to launch anti-TNFs, to get started with, and then we see what these -- the follow-up opportunities. So as far as Biogen is involved, together with the partners, we have launched the products, the 3 anti-TNFs that we -- for which we have the agreement on. Two out of the 3 are approved and are underway to be launched. The preliminary results are very encouraging. As you can imagine, there is a tremendous level of variation viability between countries in terms of tendering, in terms of aggressivity of competition, in terms of provider decision-making, and it's difficult to take an overall, I would say, recipe on how to best launch. What I can say is that the 3 anti-TNFs that we'll have the opportunity to launch will be addressing a current market that is higher than $9 billion in Europe. So this is significant and with Biogen quality. So we have put together a stand-alone BU that is flexible, agile in order to launch the product. And we learn country after country, today, mostly in the Nordics and Scandinavia, where we have had very, very good results. But as I said earlier, it's still early to comment much on the results that are negligible for 2016, but will be more important moving forward."

I have, for my field visits and from talking to leaders, identified one major issue, which is the discontinuation due to GI safety. Those patients, during the first phase on the product, are suffering, for some of them, on abdominal pain, diarrhea, discomfort that is leading, in some cases, with very high level of viability to discontinue on the product. And this impacts not only the outflow but, eventually, the inflow. Viability is tremendous. I was in the field lately and -- on the Eastern Coast in the U.S. 1.5% of the patient discontinued at 6 months. In some others, it was 30%.

Happy to say, Biogen delivered another solid quarter, complete with strong financial performance and significant advancements in the pipeline. For the third quarter of 2016, Biogen generated a record $3 billion in revenues, 6% increase in the same period a year ago. Our GAAP earnings were $4.71 per share, a 13% increase versus Q3 last year, and non-GAAP earnings were $5.19 per share, a 16% increase. 
I'll come back to the financials in a minute, but first, I'd like to highlight some of the important third quarter pipeline progress. One of the most exciting milestones this quarter was the positive interim analysis of nusinersen in the ENDEAR study. Recognizing the tremendous need in the SMA community, we move quickly to establish the expanded access program and completed the NDA filing with the FDA in less than 2 months, the fastest time of filing time in Biogen's 38-year history. We continue to be grateful to the patients, families, investigators and employees who work tirelessly to bring this program program to this point. We've also filed with the EMA where nusinersen has received Accelerated  Assessment status. If approved, nusinersen would be the first treatment for patients with spinal muscular atrophy, a leading genetic cause of death in infants. 
We were honored when one of our key pipeline programs was featured on the cover of Nature, specifically, the results of our preclinical research in Phase Ib study of aducanumab. This redistinction [ph] was a first for Biogen research and one that I think further highlights the important work that we're doing in the area of Alzheimer's disease. We also announced that aducanumab was granted Fast Track designation by the FDA. 
Our commercial business continue to deliver solid results this quarter. We furthered our leadership in MS with the launch of ZINBRYTA in collaboration with AbbVie, and we continue to grow the number of patients benefiting from our full portfolio of MS products. 
Our third quarter hemophilia revenues grew to $217 million, and we made further progress with the spinoff of our hemophilia business into a separate, independent, publicly traded company, known as Bioverativ, with the initial filing of the Form 10 in August. We continue to expect to complete that transaction in early 2017. 
In Europe, we doubled our biosimilars revenues over the prior quarter as BENEPALI continues to launch in markets across the continent and pick up share at a rate previously unseen for a biosimilar anti-TNF, and we launched FLIXABI, our biosimilar of infliximab. We continue to believe that our work in biosimilars is an important growth opportunity for Biogen. 
So we've seen great progress in both our pipeline and our commercial portfolio during the quarter. As you'll hear shortly from Mike and Michel, our entire executive leadership team is focused on driving commercial performance, prioritizing our assets, advancing our clinical programs and reshaping our pipeline, and our 70,000 employees globally remain committed to delivering therapies that we believe can make a positive difference in the lives of patients. 
I'll now turn the call over to Mike so that he can give you a thorough update on our pipeline."

Let me provide some highlights from this quarter, starting with multiple sclerosis. Last month, at ECTRIMS, we presented clinical findings from our broad portfolio MS therapies as well as top line results for opicinumab, or anti-LINGO, a potential neuroreparative therapy for people with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. 
We presented real-world data and clinical evidence showing that TECFIDERA consistently demonstrates strong efficacy by reducing MS disease activity in patients who have had up to 9 years of treatment. These data also affirm TECFIDERA's well-characterized safety profile. Importantly, we believe these findings provide additional support for the early use of TECFIDERA to improve patient outcomes. 
Data were also presented for ZINBRYTA, our newly launched once-monthly, self-administered subcutaneous treatment option for relapsing forms of MS. A new post-hoc analysis from the pivotal DECIDE study show that a significantly greater number of people treated with ZINBRYTA showed no evidence of disease activity compared to those taking intramuscular interferon. Additional new interim data from the long-term extension study EXTEND show that treatment with ZINBRYTA had long-term benefits in the proportion of patients who remained relapse-free as well as those who did not experience 24-week confirmed disability progression. 
For opicinumab, we presented top line results from the Phase II SYNERGY study in MS, in which opicinumab missed the primary endpoint. However, we believe the robust design of the study has allowed us to identify an appropriate patient population and dose to move forward with development. Within the 10 mg per kg dosing arm of the study, we identified a treatment effect in patients who's MRI scans had specific features suggesting evidence that reduce myelination and intact axons at study entry. This subset represented approximately 1/4 of all patients in the SYNERGY study. Based on these data, we had hypothesized that patients with similar features may have the potential to benefit from treatment with opicinumab. We're in the final stages of designing the next study and look forward to providing an update in the coming months. 
Turning to another late-stage asset. We made significant progress advancing nusinersen this quarter. As George highlighted, in August, Biogen and Ionis announced that we met the prespecified primary endpoint upon interim analysis of ENDEAR. In the analysis, patients with infantile onset SMA or SMA consistent with Type 1 who were treated with nusinersen demonstrated a highly statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in the achievement of motor milestones, as measured by the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination. The responder analysis looked to the achievement of tangible milestones, like kicking, head control, rolling, sitting, crawling, standing and walking, and we believe the results provide a real demonstration of the value nusinersen could bring for patients and their families. Data from the other end points analyzed were also consistently in favor of the treated infants. 
The ENDEAR study remains ongoing and will be stopped once enrolled patients complete their next office visit when [ph] it is anticipated to happen for all patients before the end of the year. Once this occurs, we'll be able to provide more detailed efficacy data, including an analysis on survival. 
During the quarter, we also successfully completed the rolling submission of a new drug application to the FDA for nusinersen. The U.S. filing was submitted less than 2 months after the positive interim analysis of the ENDEAR trial, a significant accomplishment for the company and recognition of the urgent need in this community. We have applied for Priority Review, which, if granted, will shorten the review period for nusinersen following the agency's acceptance of the filing. 
Earlier this month, we also filed the Marketing Authorization Application to the European Medicines Agency. The EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use has granted nusinersen Accelerated Assessment status, which can also reduce the standard review time, and we look forward to working with both agencies over the coming months to bring this treatment to patients as quickly as possible. 
For nusinersen, our regulatory submissions are comprised of results from from the prespecified interim analysis of ENDEAR as well as all other clinical and preclinical data currently available, including open-label data in both Types 2 and 3 SMA patients. We're seeking a broad label for the treatment of SMA and are current filing applications in the U.S. and the EU. 
Our other randomized, placebo-controlled Phase III study, CHERISH, in children with later-onset SMA consistent with Type 2 was fully enrolled in March this year and remains on track for completion in the first half of 2017. 
Earlier this month, we presented additional data for nusinersen at the 2016 World Muscle Society Congress in Granada, Spain. The presentations included safety results from the interim analysis of the Phase III ENDEAR study, which demonstrated a favorable safety profile. 
Analysis of the ongoing Phase II open-label study NURTURE demonstrated a positive effect in genetically diagnosed and presymptomatic SMA infants. In the NURTURE interim analysis, all 13 infants have demonstrated increases in mean [ph] Hammersmith Infant Neurological Exam scores over time, and no infants have discontinued, withdrawn from the study or reached the primary endpoint of death or respiratory intervention in patients who had been enrolled for a minimum of 64 days and up to 13 months. 
A recent analysis of data from the CS2 and CS12 open-label studies in patients with later-onset SMA, which included both Type 2 and Type 3 patients, was also presented at World Muscle. The data showed that children with SMA treated with nusinersen exhibited improvements on several measures of motor function for up to nearly 3 years. These results are in contrast to the stable or slow decline in scores typically observed in patients with later-onset SMA over time. We continue to be encouraged by the consistently positive results for nusinersen, which we believe support its benefit in SMA. 
Now turning to Alzheimer's disease. During the quarter, a number of exciting developments occurred for our lead candidate, aducanumab. As George mentioned, results from preclinical research in the Phase 1b study of aducanumab were published in Nature, a significant achievement for the program and recognition of Biogen's high-caliber science. Aducanumab was granted Fast Track designation by the FDA, an important step in bringing this potential therapy to patients as quickly as possible. 
And in a recently completed interim analysis from the Phase 1b study, which included the titration cohort, arms 8 and 9 and the portion of the long-term extension study, efficacy and safety were consistent with results previously reported and support the design of the ongoing Phase III ENGAGE and EMERGE studies. The data from both the titration  cohort and the portion of the long-term extension study of PRIME have been accepted to the 9th Clinical Trials on Alzheimer's Disease meeting in San Diego, and we look forward to sharing additional safety and efficacy data with you in December. 
We're also making important progress across our pipeline, and we continue to shape our R&D engine for the future. Last year, we announced an agreement to license amiselimod, an oral sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulator, for Mitsubishi Tanabe. Since announcing the license agreement, we assessed the compound for a number of autoimmune indications with a particular interest in inflammatory bowel disease. As we prioritize our strategic objectives and the IBD landscape continues to evolve, [ph] we've decided to discontinue our current development plan for amiselimod. 
As we mentioned last quarter, we generated encouraging Phase I data on BIIB059, or anti-BDCA2, for lupus. The anti-BDCA2 Phase I study included both healthy volunteers and a cohort of 12 lupus subjects. We anticipate presenting these data at ACR next month, including results from the lupus cohort. A Phase II study evaluating the efficacy and safety of BIIB059 is underway with the first subject dose this month. 
We're also working to advance BIIB074, a novel investigational state-dependent subtype selective sodium channel blocker for neuropathic pain. We have initiated and open to enrollment a Phase I -- Phase IIb trial for lumbosacral radiculopathy, also known as sciatica. We're also close to completing enrollment in a small exploratory Phase IIa study in erythromelalgia, and we are working toward initiating a Phase III study in trigeminal neuralgia in 2017. 
BG11, or STX-100, for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is enrolling its final cohort in a Phase IIa study, and we expect to present the data after the trial completes in the second half of next year. BG11 blocks alpha(v)beta(6) integrin, which is selectively up-regulated in epithelial cells in fibrotic conditions, such as IPF, and is known to be a key mediator of TGF-beta activations. We believe early safety and biomarker results from this study evaluating BG11 in IPF patients are encouraging. 
In summary, we continue to make strong progress across our pipeline, and we are working aggressively to optimize and reshape our R&D activities, focusing resources to rapidly advance assets that present the greatest opportunity and address unmet need. 
With that, I will now pass the call to Michel."

Our portfolio of MS therapies delivered revenues of $2.3 billion, an increase of 3% versus Q3 last year and 2% versus Q2. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, MS revenues increased 5% versus Q3 last year and 2.5% versus Q2. Biogen maintained its global leading market share of 38% and remains the leader for both newly diagnosed and switch patients, representing the dynamic portion of the MS market. 
As I communicated during our last call, the commercial organization is now focusing on 4 key opportunities: portfolio strategy, commercial excellence, medical leadership, trust and value. Since the beginning of Q3, we are now in execution mode, especially for MS in the U.S. 
With portfolio strategy, we have progressed and now identified our prioritized growth opportunities for now and 2017. It is all about making hard choices, driving consistency in resource allocation and following through with tactical plans and execution. 
With commercial excellence, in the U.S., we have piloted and defined a specific engagement model with key MS centers. The rollout is expected to be completed by year-end. Additionally, we are currently enhancing our sophistication in multichannel marketing with a strong focus on digital execution capabilities. We need to meet our customers where they are, defined by the customer journey, to provide a seamless and differentiated Biogen engagement experience, whether through direct, digital or other media. These are important steps, not only to improve performance in the short term, but also towards the creation of a new go-to-market model that is more effective and at a lower cost. 
In terms of medical leadership, during the third quarter, our R&D colleagues have identified several key opportunities as to how to improve MS care today. We believe we have the opportunity to bring to use regular and quantitative measurement of disease progression, including cognition and imaging. In addition, we just launched our MS Path initiative that will be -- we believe will create a standardized, high-quality data repository from a very diverse real-world patient population in the U.S. and EU. We believe this will open new and differentiated engagement opportunities with major MS clinical centers in the U.S. and in Europe. 
And finally, trust and value. We are developing beyond the beyond the [ph] solutions that we believe will meet customers' day-to-day needs in living with or treating MS. We are working on establishing the leading ecosystem for patients and providers to improve patient outcomes. We believe that Biogen is the only company that has the position and commitment to MS to be able to provide this level of support in a trustworthy and valuable way. 
Across these 4 priority areas, we have a well-defined plans and, as I said, since early Q3, we are now in execution mode. Delivering on those well means enhancing the fundamental capability of the commercial operation at Biogen. These priorities are intended to not only drive performance for our in-line products, but also to prepare the organization for current and future product launches. 
Turning to MS performance. In the U.S., overall MS market has experienced a 2% decline in commercial patients versus Q3 last year. While in Europe, the market continues to grow with a 7% increase in patients versus Q3 last year. For TECFIDERA, global market share has increased by approximately 1 point to 15% versus Q3 last year. 
In the U.S., we have a stable TECFIDERA performance. TECFIDERA continues to capture roughly half of all patients starting on an oral with the current oral share of 51% and overall patient share remains relatively stable at 20% since the beginning of the year. This is a clear leadership position for all 3 metrics. 
In Europe, they are approximately 65,000 patients on TECFIDERA, an increase of approximately 30% versus Q3 last year and approximately 4% versus Q2. TECFIDERA is now the most prescribed MS therapy in Germany, France, the U.K. and Italy, with more recently launched market continuing to drive patient growth. We do aspire to restore growth to the more mature markets, and we are very pleased to see early indicators that TECFIDERA again share this quarter in France, following 2 quarters of flat performance. 
Over the past year, TYSABRI has seen steady incremental share gains globally, as it continues to add patients, driven by increased share in the U.S, as well as in the emerging markets. As we continue to see shift toward increased use of high efficacy therapies, we believe TYSABRI is benefiting from growing first-line use in the U.S. 
In Europe, we are also encouraged by the recent update extending the indication for TYSABRI and allowing physician to better optimize risk management based on JC virus antibody index values. Following the EU label approval, we have also received similar label update in Japan, Canada and Switzerland. 
Our interferon therapies continue to play an important role amongst the injectable portion of the market. We believe PLEGRIDY is helping to slow the decline of our interferons, though it does not completely compensate for the loss of AVONEX patients. 
In collaboration with AbbVie, we launched ZINBRYTA in August in the U.S. and Germany, and we recently just recently obtained approval in Australia. We believe the launch of ZINBRYTA comps at the right time as we see our trend towards the increased use of high efficacy products we both grants therapies and the future entrance. 
While early in the launch, we are encouraged by the level of physician and patient interest in the strong product profile. In the U.S. for example, over half of our target physician have completed enrollment on our REMS Program, enabling them to begin prescribing. 
These are early data that we see indications that we are capturing many switching patients who otherwise may not have chosen a Biogen product. So it appears that our positioning and execution is working. 
Looking forward, we expect to receive reimbursement for ZINBRYTA in all the major European markets within the next 12 to 18 months. So overall, we had a solid performance this quarter across our MS business, despite a recent slowdown in the overall MS commercial market in the U.S. We are also very excited by the continued progress of our biosimilar business. BENEPALI is now available in 13 countries. And in most markets, we are seeing a conversion rate superior to the first infliximab biosimilar launch in Europe, with up to 60 to 80% conversion in markets, such as Norway or Denmark. 
With [ph] we believe we are able to compete beyond price. We are seeing a strong presence for the autoinjector versus that of the originator, with our research indicating that 86% of the nurse prefer our device. 
We recently also launched our infliximab biosimilar, FLIXABI, which is now available in Germany, the U.K. and the Netherlands, with 3 additional countries anticipated in Q4. We believe our ability to potentially be the first company to offer all 3 major anti-TNF in Europe could put us in a position of strength in the market. We believe biosimilars are an important growth opportunity for Biogen as we work to optimize our engagement with stakeholders across the health care system. 
In summary, we had a very productive quarter across our MS business in terms of performance. We are encouraged with our new product launches, and we see clear progress as we work hard to elevate our commercial execution capabilities to new levels and as we improve our go-to-market model. 
Also, we are particularly excited about the potential to soon launch nusinersen for SMA, with approximately 20,000 patients across the U.S., Europe and Japan and no available treatments today, we believe nusinersen represents a significant operative for both Biogen and more importantly, for the patients who today have no treatment option. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Paul."

Interferon revenues included both AVONEX and [ph] were $708 million during the third quarter, a decrease of 10% versus Q3 last year. This included $506 million in the U.S. and $203 million in sales outside the U.S. 
In the U.S., we believe there was a drawdown of AVONEX inventory in the wholesale channel, resulting approximately $10 million versus Q2. Outside the U.S., foreign exchange and hedge impact weakened interferon revenue by approximately $20 million versus Q3 last year. 
TYSABRI worldwide revenues were $515 million this quarter, an increase of 7% to versus Q3 last year. This included $301 million in the U.S. and $214 million outside the U.S. Outside the U.S., TYSABRI revenue benefited by $20 million due to a favorable adjustment to our discounts and allowances. 
Foreign exchange and the hedge impact weakened TYSABRI revenue by approximately $16 million versus Q3 last year. Our hemophilia products continue to perform well this quarter. ELOCTATE revenues for the quarter were $132 million, an increase of 46% versus Q3 last year. This includes $110 million in the U.S. and $22 million outside the U.S. 
ALPROLIX revenues in Q3 were $85 million, an increase of 30% versus Q3 last year, including $67 million in the U.S. and $19 million outside the U.S. 
Our biosimilar business generated $31 million in revenues this quarter, driven primarily by BENEPALI. 
Turning to our anti-CD20 revenues, which include our profit share from RITUXAN and [ph] in the United States, as well as our profit share and royalties on sales of rituximab outside the U.S. 
We recorded $318 million for Q3, a decrease from Q2, driven by a reduction in inventory from the second quarter. Total other revenues, which include revenues from collaboration relationships, royalties and contract manufacturing were $99 million in the third quarter. The increase versus Q2 was related to contract manufacturing for strategic partner, slightly offset by $13 million loss in our AbbVie collaboration profit share. 
Now turning to the expense lines on the P&L. Q3 GAAP cost of goods sold was $417 million or 14% of revenue. Non-GAAP COGS was $396 million or 13% of revenue. The increase versus Q2 was primarily attributable to a mid-single-digit royalty on U.S. sales of both AVONEX and PLEGRIDY. 
Q3 GAAP and non-GAAP R&D expense was $529 million or 18% of revenue. Both GAAP and non-GAAP R&D expense included a $75 million payment to Ionis related to the exercise of our opt-in right to develop and commercialize nusinersen globally. 
I'd like to note that our collaboration partner, E side, has stated their goal to start of Phase III trial for E2609. A $50 million milestone payment is expected to be triggered once the first patient is dosed in the E2609 Phase III trial, and there's a potential chance they could dose the first patient by the end of this year. The $50 million milestone was not considered in our midyear 2016 R&D guidance. 
Q3 GAAP SG&A expense was $463 million. Q3 non-GAAP SG&A expense was $461 million or 16% of revenue. Other net expense was $58 million in Q3, which includes $66 million in interest expense, primarily related to our 2015 bond offering. 
In Q3, both our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were approximately 25%. Our weighted average diluted share count was approximately 219 million for Q3. Which brings us to our diluted earnings per share which were $4.71 on a GAAP basis and $5.19 on a non-GAAP basis. 
We ended the quarter with $7.4 billion in cash and marketable securities, with approximately 40% of this in the United States. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.1 million shares of the company's common stock for a total value of $349 million. So as often, we had a number of puts and takes in the quarter, nevertheless, a very solid financial quarter. 
I'll turn the call over to George for his closing comments."

We delivered solid commercial performance, strong financial results and important advances in the pipeline. I'm particularly excited about the direction we're heading as we finish 2016 and look forward to 2017 and beyond. 
As I've said, I believe we are at the beginning of a transformative a record in the near the generation, which could result in a new era for Biogen as well. We're already starting to see the types of discoveries that can be expected, the science advances and the innovative child designs that you previously unseen in results and insights. We believe they are leading the effort aducanumab point to additional opportunities to invest in novel sciences, to address Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases. The insights we've gained from SYNERGY trial are teaching us more about remyelination and very enthusiastic about moving on to smoke forward. And the encouraging results reusing from nusinersen pointed a possibility that there can be internally new mechanisms and modalities for treating the many daunting diseases of the central nervous system. 
I'm proud to have led Biogen for more than 6 years now and it's gratifying to me to be in the position to turn a high-performing organization over to a successor. Our board search for a new CEO is progressing. We don't have a formal update on timing yet but as you'd expect, the opportunity to lead Biogen is generating plenty of interest. And in the meantime, I working closely with our management team as we strive to realize our goals for 2016 and kick off a busy and productive 2017. 
We're fortunate to have a great leadership team and a passionate group of employees who come to work everyday to make a positive impact on patients' lives and I think all of them for their hard work and dedication. Thanks to all of you for joining us this morning. And we'll open up the call for questions."

With that, I'm going to let talk about the launch based on that, but let me address a couple of the other things that you mentioned. Our extended access program is active. We've got patients who are receiving drug. This is obviously country-by-country specific in how they're administering it and it's an ongoing work in progress. That program will really be relevant during this period and while were filing before we've got the approval. We anticipate that, that it's going to be out small number of patients that we can get in the relevant countries based on the greater the established on our expanded access program. On the incidence and prevalence in the label, what we would say is this is 20,000 patients prevalence today in the U.S., Europe and Japan. SMA, as a whole, has an incidental of about 13,000 patients here across those roughly. The data that we've submitted through from the interim analysis of ENDEAR, these are type 1 patients. We've included data across all of our [ph] as well as preclinical data. We are going to seek a broad lable for the treatment of SMA. That's obviously will be something under review. And based on that, that will determine the overall size of the patient population. I'll also let Michel sort of comment and I'll turn it over to him. My final comment to that is we expect be successful, and lunch, the final evidence numbers will increase over time to the extent that we have an impact on the survival on these populations.

What we have seen during the past quarters was basically a slowdown towards a low single digit market growth in the U.S. What we have seen during the past months or weeks was a shift in the mix between commercial and free that is impacting basically the commercial units performance. So I don't know if it's an overall market trend but this is what we have seen internally. What I can tell you is that TECFIDERA remains the #1 priority for the organization. We have a plan, as alluded last time, we are working based on the portfolio work that we are doing on [ph] GI, discontinuation that remains at an average of approximately 22%. And we have the good opportunity to make some inroad there because basically, this quote was from 5% to 35%. So there are [ph] centers, and messengers where they are able to manage with the right engagement and heard a different type of engagements that are being practiced in the different centers. There is no evidence yet. One can speculate that we can see a temporary association between the increase of the and the GI [ph] symptomology, but this was not confirmed by clinical trials because of many different confounding factors. So we work on peg GI. We see early sense if it's heading towards the right direction also in Europe, but it's too early to claim any big success here. We are working on the capture rates and one balance the other that's why we have a stable patient base. And the space of the market isn't in the lower than what we have estimated in our assumptions, but it's not an excuse for not increasing share. So we do not give up, we invest, we are committed. I can tell you the team in the U.S. is all up and running. They have diluted a new engagement model with critical MS centers. I'm very pleased to see the perception improvement. And now we have to continue execute the full rollout of this new plan will be towards the end of the year. By latest, by early January. So we are committed. We don't give up on the large Metro market, where the share of tech is relatively stable versus the latest launch markets where we make -- continue to make fast inroads like in Italy, Spain or the U.K. And the good news that we could turn to positive and we continue for Germany and we continue for the U.S. We are committed.

Happy to say, Biogen delivered another solid quarter, complete with strong financial performance and significant advancements in the pipeline. For the third quarter of 2016, Biogen generated a record $3 billion in revenues, 6% increase in the same period a year ago. Our GAAP earnings were $4.71 per share, a 13% increase versus Q3 last year, and non-GAAP earnings were $5.19 per share, a 16% increase. 
I'll come back to the financials in a minute, but first, I'd like to highlight some of the important third quarter pipeline progress. One of the most exciting milestones this quarter was the positive interim analysis of nusinersen in the ENDEAR study. Recognizing the tremendous need in the SMA community, we move quickly to establish the expanded access program and completed the NDA filing with the FDA in less than 2 months, the fastest time of filing time in Biogen's 38-year history. We continue to be grateful to the patients, families, investigators and employees who work tirelessly to bring this program to this point. We've also filed with the EMA where nusinersen has received Accelerated  Assessment status. If approved, nusinersen would be the first treatment for patients with spinal muscular atrophy, a leading genetic cause of death in infants. 
We were honored when one of our key pipeline programs was featured on the cover of Nature, specifically, the results of our preclinical research in Phase Ib study of aducanumab. This rare distinction was a first for Biogen research and one that I think further highlights the important work that we're doing in the area of Alzheimer's disease. We also announced that aducanumab was granted Fast Track designation by the FDA. 
Our commercial business continue to deliver solid results this quarter. We furthered our leadership in MS with the launch of ZINBRYTA in collaboration with AbbVie, and we continue to grow the number of patients benefiting from our full portfolio of MS products. 
Our third quarter hemophilia revenues grew to $217 million, and we made further progress with the spinoff of our hemophilia business into a separate, independent, publicly traded company, known as Bioverativ, with the initial filing of the Form 10 in August. We continue to expect to complete that transaction in early 2017. 
In Europe, we doubled our biosimilars revenues over the prior quarter as BENEPALI continues to launch in markets across the continent and pick up share at a rate previously unseen for a biosimilar anti-TNF, and we launched FLIXABI, our biosimilar of infliximab. We continue to believe that our work in biosimilars is an important growth opportunity for Biogen. 
So we've seen great progress in both our pipeline and our commercial portfolio during the quarter. As you'll hear shortly from Mike and Michel, our entire executive leadership team is focused on driving commercial performance, prioritizing our assets, advancing our clinical programs and reshaping our pipeline, and our 70,000 employees globally remain committed to delivering therapies that we believe can make a positive difference in the lives of patients. 
I'll now turn the call over to Mike so that he can give you a thorough update on our pipeline."

Let me provide some highlights from this quarter, starting with multiple sclerosis. Last month, at ECTRIMS, we presented clinical findings from our broad portfolio MS therapies as well as top line results for opicinumab, or anti-LINGO, a potential neuroreparative therapy for people with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. 
We presented real-world data and clinical evidence showing that TECFIDERA consistently demonstrates strong efficacy by reducing MS disease activity in patients who have had up to 9 years of treatment. These data also affirm TECFIDERA's well-characterized safety profile. Importantly, we believe these findings provide additional support for the early use of TECFIDERA to improve patient outcomes. 
Data were also presented for ZINBRYTA, our newly launched once-monthly, self-administered subcutaneous treatment option for relapsing forms of MS. A new post-hoc analysis from the pivotal DECIDE study show that a significantly greater number of people treated with ZINBRYTA showed no evidence of disease activity compared to those taking intramuscular interferon. Additional new interim data from the long-term extension study EXTEND show that treatment with ZINBRYTA had long-term benefits in the proportion of patients who remained relapse-free as well as those who did not experience 24-week confirmed disability progression. 
For opicinumab, we presented top line results from the Phase II SYNERGY study in MS, in which opicinumab missed the primary endpoint. However, we believe the robust design of the study has allowed us to identify an appropriate patient population and dose to move forward with development. Within the 10 mg per kg dosing arm of the study, we identified a treatment effect in patients who's MRI scans had specific features suggesting evidence that reduce myelination and intact axons at study entry. This subset represented approximately 1/4 of all patients in the SYNERGY study. Based on these data, we had hypothesized that patients with similar features may have the potential to benefit from treatment with opicinumab. We're in the final stages of designing the next study and look forward to providing an update in the coming months. 
Turning to another late-stage asset. We made significant progress advancing nusinersen this quarter. As George highlighted, in August, Biogen and Ionis announced that we met the prespecified primary endpoint upon interim analysis of ENDEAR. In the analysis, patients with infantile onset SMA or SMA consistent with Type 1 who were treated with nusinersen demonstrated a highly statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in the achievement of motor milestones, as measured by the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination. The responder analysis looked to the achievement of tangible milestones, like kicking, head control, rolling, sitting, crawling, standing and walking, and we believe the results provide a real demonstration of the value nusinersen could bring for patients and their families. Data from the other end points analyzed were also consistently in favor of the treated infants. 
The ENDEAR study remains ongoing and will be stopped once enrolled patients complete their next office visit, but it is anticipated to happen for all patients before the end of the year. Once this occurs, we'll be able to provide more detailed efficacy data, including an analysis on survival. 
During the quarter, we also successfully completed the rolling submission of a new drug application to the FDA for nusinersen. The U.S. filing was submitted less than 2 months after the positive interim analysis of the ENDEAR trial, a significant accomplishment for the company and recognition of the urgent need in this community. We have applied for Priority Review, which, if granted, will shorten the review period for nusinersen following the agency's acceptance of the filing. 
Earlier this month, we also filed the Marketing Authorization Application to the European Medicines Agency. The EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use has granted nusinersen Accelerated Assessment status, which can also reduce the standard review time, and we look forward to working with both agencies over the coming months to bring this treatment to patients as quickly as possible. 
For nusinersen, our regulatory submissions are comprised of results from from the prespecified interim analysis of ENDEAR as well as all other clinical and preclinical data currently available, including open-label data in both Types 2 and 3 SMA patients. We're seeking a broad label for the treatment of SMA and are current filing applications in the U.S. and the EU. 
Our other randomized, placebo-controlled Phase III study, CHERISH, in children with later-onset SMA consistent with Type 2 was fully enrolled in March this year and remains on track for completion in the first half of 2017. 
Earlier this month, we presented additional data for nusinersen at the 2016 World Muscle Society Congress in Granada, Spain. The presentations included safety results from the interim analysis of the Phase III ENDEAR study, which demonstrated a favorable safety profile. 
Analysis of the ongoing Phase II open-label study NURTURE demonstrated a positive effect in genetically diagnosed and presymptomatic SMA infants. In the NURTURE interim analysis, all 13 infants have demonstrated increases in mean Hammersmith Infant Neurological Exam scores over time, and no infants have discontinued, withdrawn from the study or reached the primary endpoint of death or respiratory intervention in patients who had been enrolled for a minimum of 64 days and up to 13 months. 
A recent analysis of data from the CS2 and CS12 open-label studies in patients with later-onset SMA, which included both Type 2 and Type 3 patients, was also presented at World Muscle. The data showed that children with SMA treated with nusinersen exhibited improvements on several measures of motor function for up to nearly 3 years. These results are in contrast to the stable or slow decline in scores typically observed in patients with later-onset SMA over time. We continue to be encouraged by the consistently positive results for nusinersen, which we believe support its benefit in SMA. 
Now turning to Alzheimer's disease. During the quarter, a number of exciting developments occurred for our lead candidate, aducanumab. As George mentioned, results from preclinical research in the Phase Ib study of aducanumab were published in Nature, a significant achievement for the program and recognition of Biogen's high-caliber science. Aducanumab was granted Fast Track designation by the FDA, an important step in bringing this potential therapy to patients as quickly as possible. 
And in a recently completed interim analysis from the Phase Ib study, which included the titration cohort, arms 8 and 9 and the portion of the long-term extension study, efficacy and safety were consistent with results previously reported and support the design of the ongoing Phase III ENGAGE and EMERGE studies. The data from both the titration  cohort and the portion of the long-term extension study of PRIME have been accepted to the 9th Clinical Trials on Alzheimer's Disease meeting in San Diego, and we look forward to sharing additional safety and efficacy data with you in December. 
We're also making important progress across our pipeline, and we continue to shape our R&D engine for the future. Last year, we announced an agreement to license amiselimod, an oral sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulator, for Mitsubishi Tanabe. Since announcing the license agreement, we assessed the compound for a number of autoimmune indications with a particular interest in inflammatory bowel disease. As we prioritize our strategic objectives and the IBD landscape continues to evolve, we've decided to discontinue our current development plan for amiselimod. 
As we mentioned last quarter, we generated encouraging Phase I data on BIIB059, or anti-BDCA2, for lupus. The anti-BDCA2 Phase I study included both healthy volunteers and a cohort of 12 lupus subjects. We anticipate presenting these data at ACR next month, including results from the lupus cohort. A Phase II study evaluating the efficacy and safety of BIIB059 is underway with the first subject dose this month. 
We're also working to advance BIIB074, a novel investigational state-dependent subtype selective sodium channel blocker for neuropathic pain. We have initiated and open to enrollment a Phase I -- Phase IIb trial for lumbosacral radiculopathy, also known as sciatica. We're also close to completing enrollment in a small exploratory Phase IIa study in erythromelalgia, and we are working toward initiating a Phase III study in trigeminal neuralgia in 2017. 
BG11, or STX-100, for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is enrolling its final cohort in a Phase IIa study, and we expect to present the data after the trial completes in the second half of next year. BG11 blocks alpha(v)beta(6) integrin, which is selectively up-regulated in epithelial cells in fibrotic conditions, such as IPF, and is known to be a key mediator of TGF-beta activations. We believe early safety and biomarker results from this study evaluating BG11 in IPF patients are encouraging. 
In summary, we continue to make strong progress across our pipeline, and we are working aggressively to optimize and reshape our R&D activities, focusing resources to rapidly advance assets that present the greatest opportunity and address unmet need.

Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, MS revenues increased 5% versus Q",1294,"Thank you, Mike. This is a solid quarter for MS business. Our portfolio of MS therapies delivered revenues of $2.3 billion, an increase of 3% versus Q3 last year and 2% versus Q2. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, MS revenues increased 5% versus Q3 last year and 2.5% versus Q2. Biogen maintained its global leading market share of 38% and remains the leader for both newly diagnosed and switch patients, representing the dynamic portion of the MS market. 
As I communicated during our last call, the commercial organization is now focusing on 4 key opportunities: portfolio strategy, commercial excellence, medical leadership, trust and value. Since the beginning of Q3, we are now in execution mode, especially for MS in the U.S. 
With portfolio strategy, we have progressed and now identified our prioritized growth opportunities for now and 2017. It is all about making hard choices, driving consistency in resource allocation and following through with tactical plans and execution. 
With commercial excellence, in the U.S., we have piloted and defined a specific engagement model with key MS centers. The rollout is expected to be completed by year-end. Additionally, we are currently enhancing our sophistication in multichannel marketing with a strong focus on digital execution capabilities. We need to meet our customers where they are, defined by the customer journey, to provide a seamless and differentiated Biogen engagement experience, whether through direct, digital or other media. These are important steps, not only to improve performance in the short term, but also towards the creation of a new go-to-market model that is more effective and at a lower cost. 
In terms of medical leadership, during the third quarter, our R&D colleagues have identified several key opportunities as to how to improve MS care today. We believe we have the opportunity to bring to use regular and quantitative measurement of disease progression, including cognition and imaging. In addition, we just launched our MS Path initiative that will be -- we believe will create a standardized, high-quality data repository from a very diverse real-world patient population in the U.S. and EU. We believe this will open new and differentiated engagement opportunities with major MS clinical centers in the U.S. and in Europe. 
And finally, trust and value. We are developing beyond-the-pill solutions that we believe will meet customers' day-to-day needs in living with or treating MS. We are working on establishing the leading ecosystem for patients and providers to improve patient outcomes. We believe that Biogen is the only company that has the position and commitment to MS to be able to provide this level of support in a trustworthy and valuable way. 
Across these 4 priority areas, we have well-defined plans, and as I said, since early Q3, we are now in execution mode. Delivering on those well means enhancing the fundamental capability of the commercial operation at Biogen. These priorities are intended to not only drive performance for our in-line products, but also to prepare the organization for current and future product launches. 
Turning to MS performance. In the U.S., overall MS market has experienced a 2% decline in commercial patients versus Q3 last year, while in Europe, the market continues to grow with a 7% increase in patients versus Q3 last year. For TECFIDERA, global market share has increased by approximately one point to 15% versus Q3 last year. 
In the U.S., we have a stable TECFIDERA performance. TECFIDERA continues to capture roughly half of all patients starting on an oral with the current oral share of 51%, and overall patient share remains relatively stable at 20% since the beginning of the year. This is a clear leadership position for all 3 metrics. 
In Europe, there are approximately 65,000 patients on TECFIDERA, an increase of approximately 30% versus Q3 last year and approximately 4% versus Q2. TECFIDERA is now the most prescribed MS therapy in Germany, France, the U.K. and Italy with more recently launched market continuing to drive patient growth. We do aspire to restore growth to the more mature markets, and we are very pleased to see early indicators that TECFIDERA gained share this quarter in France, following 2 quarters of flat performance. 
Over the past year, TYSABRI has seen steady incremental share gains globally as it continues to add patients, driven by increased share in the U.S. as well as in the emerging markets. As we continue to see a shift towards increased use of high efficacy therapies, we believe TYSABRI is benefiting from growing first-line use in the U.S. 
In Europe, we are also encouraged by the recent update, extending the indication for TYSABRI and allowing physician to better optimize risk management based on JC virus antibody index values. Following the EU label approval, we have also received similar label update in Japan, Canada and Switzerland. 
Our interferon therapies continue to play an important role amongst the injectable portion of the market. We believe PLEGRIDY is helping to slow the decline of our interferons, though it does not completely compensate for the loss of AVONEX patients. 
In collaboration with AbbVie, we launched ZINBRYTA in August in the U.S. and Germany, and we just recently obtained approval in Australia. We believe the launch of ZINBRYTA comes at the right time as we see a trend towards increased use of high-efficacy products with both current therapies and future entrants.
While early in the launch, we are encouraged by the level of physician and patient interest in the strong product profile. In the U.S., for example, over half of our target physician have completed enrollment on our REMS Program, enabling them to begin prescribing. These are early data that we see indications that we are capturing many switching patients who otherwise may not have chosen a Biogen product. So it appears that our positioning execution is working. Looking forward, we expect to receive reimbursement for ZINBRYTA in all the major European markets within the next 12 to 18 months. 
So overall, we had a solid performance this quarter across our MS business despite a recent slowdown in the overall MS commercial market in the U.S. 
We are also very excited about the continued progress of our biosimilar business. BENEPALI is now available in 13 countries, and in most markets, we are seeing a conversion rate superior to the first infliximab biosimilar launch in Europe with up to 60 to 80% conversion in markets such as Norway or Denmark. With BENEPALI, we believe we are able to compete beyond price. We are seeing a strong presence for the BENEPALI auto-injector versus that of the originator, with our research indicating that 86% of the nurse prefer our device. 
We recently also launched our infliximab biosimilar, FLIXABI, which is now available in Germany, the U.K. and the Netherlands with 3 additional countries anticipated in Q4. We believe our ability to potentially be the first company to offer all 3 major anti-TNFs in Europe could put us in a position of strength in the market. We believe biosimilars are an important growth opportunity for Biogen as we work to optimize our engagement with stakeholders across the health care system. 
In summary, we had a very productive quarter across our MS business in terms of performance. We are encouraged with our new product launches, and we see clear progress as we work hard to elevate our commercial execution capabilities to new levels and as we improve our go-to-market model. 
Also, we are particularly excited about the potential to soon launch nusinersen for SMA. With approximately 20,000 patients across the U.S., Europe and Japan and no available treatments today, we believe nusinersen represent a significant opportunity for both Biogen and, more importantly, for the patients who, today, have no treatment option. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Paul."

In the third quarter, our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $4.71, a 13% increase versus Q3 last year, while our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $5.19, an increase of 16%. Total revenue for Q3 grew 6% versus Q3 last year to approximately $3 billion. 
Global third quarter TECFIDERA revenues were $1,034,000,000, an increase of 10% versus Q3 last year. This included revenues of $845 million in the U.S., an increase of 12% versus Q3 last year, and $189 million outside the U.S., an increase of 3% versus Q3 last year. In the U.S., we believe TECFIDERA benefited by approximately $40 million to $50 million versus Q2 due to inventory build in the channel. Outside the U.S., Q3 TECFIDERA decreased by $17 million versus Q2, largely driven by parallel trade dynamics. Versus Q3 last year, foreign exchange and hedge impact weakened TECFIDERA revenues by approximately $17 million. 
Interferon revenues, including both AVONEX and PLEGRIDY, were $708 million during the third quarter, a decrease of 10% versus Q3 last year. This included $506 million in the U.S. and $203 million in sales outside the U.S. In the U.S., we believe there was a drawdown of AVONEX inventory in the wholesale channel, resulting approximately $10 million versus Q2. Outside the U.S., foreign exchange and hedge impact weakened interferon revenue by approximately $20 million versus Q3 last year. 
TYSABRI worldwide revenues were $515 million this quarter, an increase of 7% versus Q3 last year. This included $301 million in the U.S. and $214 million outside the U.S. Outside the U.S., TYSABRI revenue benefited by $20 million due to a favorable adjustment to our discounts and allowances. Foreign exchange and the hedge impact weakened TYSABRI revenue by approximately $16 million versus Q3 last year. 
Our hemophilia products continue to perform well this quarter. ELOCTATE revenues for the quarter were $132 million, an increase of 46% versus Q3 last year. This includes $110 million in the U.S. and $22 million outside the U.S. ALPROLIX revenues in Q3 were $85 million, an increase of 30% versus Q3 last year, including $67 million in the U.S. and $19 million outside the U.S.  
Our biosimilar business generated $31 million in revenues this quarter, driven primarily by BENEPALI. 
Turning to our anti-CD20 revenues, which include our profit share from RITUXAN and GAZYVA in the United States as well as our profit share in royalties on sales of rituximab outside the U.S. We recorded $318 million for Q3, a decrease from Q2 driven by a reduction in inventory from the second quarter. 
Total other revenues, which include revenues from collaboration relationships, royalties and contract manufacturing, were $99 million in the third quarter. The increase versus Q2 was related to contract manufacturing for a strategic partner, slightly offset by a $13 million loss in our AbbVie collaboration profit share. 
 
Now turning to the expense lines on the P&L. Q3 GAAP cost of goods sold was $417 million or 14% of revenue. Non-GAAP COGS was $396 million or 13% of revenue. The increase versus Q2 was primarily attributable to a mid-single-digit royalty on U.S. sales of both AVONEX and PLEGRIDY. 
Q3 GAAP and non-GAAP R&D expense was $529 million or 18% of revenue. Both GAAP and non-GAAP R&D expense included a $75 million payment to Ionis related to the exercise of our opt-in right to develop and commercialize nusinersen globally. I'd like to note that our collaboration partner, Eisai, has stated their goal to start a Phase III trial for E2609. A $50 million milestone payment is expected to be triggered once the first patient is dosed in the E2609 Phase III trial, and there's a potential chance they could dose the first patient by the end of this year. The $50 million milestone was not considered in our midyear 2016 R&D guidance. 
Q3 GAAP SG&A expense was $463 million. Q3 non-GAAP SG&A expense was $461 million or 16% of revenue. Other net expense was $58 million in Q3, which includes $66 million in interest expense, primarily related to our 2015 bond offering. In Q3, both our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were approximately 25%. 
Our weighted average diluted share count was approximately 219 million for Q3, which brings us to our diluted earnings per share which were $4.71 on a GAAP basis and $5.19 on a non-GAAP basis. We ended the quarter with $7.4 billion in cash and marketable securities with approximately 40% of this in the United States. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.1 million shares of the company's common stock for a total value of $349 million. So as often, we had a number of puts and takes in the quarter, nevertheless, a very solid financial quarter. 
I'll turn the call over to George for his closing comments."

We delivered solid commercial performance, strong financial results and important advances in the pipeline. I'm particularly excited about the direction we're heading as we finish 2016 and look forward to 2017 and beyond. 
As I've said, I believe we are at the beginning of a transformative era in neurodegeneration, which could result in a new era for Biogen as well. We're already starting to see the types of discoveries that can be expected, the science advances and the innovative trial designs yield previously unseen in results and insights. We believe the early data for aducanumab point to additional opportunities to invest in novel science to address Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases. The insights we've gained from the SYNERGY trial are teaching us more about remyelination, and we're enthusiastic about moving opicinumab forward. And the encouraging results we're seeing from nusinersen pointed a possibility that there can be entirely new mechanisms and modalities for treating the many daunting diseases of the central nervous system. 
I'm proud to have led Biogen for more than 6 years now, and it's gratifying to me to be in the position to turn a high-performing organization over to a successor. Our board search for a new CEO is progressing. We don't have a formal update on timing yet, but as you'd expect, the opportunity to lead Biogen is generating plenty of interest. And in the meantime, I'm working closely with our management team as we strive to realize our goals for 2016 and kick off a busy and productive 2017. We're fortunate to have a great leadership team and a passionate group of employees who come to work everyday to make a positive impact on patients' lives, and I thank all of them for their hard work and dedication.

So there's some timing dependence on regulator acceptance of this Priority Review and Accelerated Assessment. Then with that, I'm going to let Michel talk about the launch based on that, but let me address a couple of the other things you mentioned. Our extended access program is active. We've got patients who are receiving drug. This is obviously country-by-country specific in how they're administering it, and it's an ongoing work in progress. That program will really be relevant during this period in -- while were filed but before we've got approval. We anticipate that, that -- it's going to be a small number of patients that we can get in the relevant countries based on the criteria when we established our expanded access program. On the incidence and prevalence in the label, what we would say is this is 20,000 patients prevalence today in the U.S., Europe and Japan. SMA, as a whole, has an incidents, about -- of about 13,000 patients here across those roughly. The data that we've submitted from the interim analysis of ENDEAR, these were Type 1 patients. We've included data across all of our studies as well as preclinical data. We are going to seek a broad label for the treatment of SMA. That's obviously will be something under review. And based on that, that will determine the overall size of the patient population, which I'll also let Michel sort of comment when I turn over to him. My final comment on that would be that we expect that if successful and launched, that this prevalence numbers will increase over time to the extent that we have an impact on survival on these populations.

First of all, I mean, we're not -- I don't think we'll speculate on the potential results of Eli solanezumab trial based on that. I mean, their scenario is that one can envision, that we are certainly taking into consideration. We look -- we very much look forward to seeing their data. A couple of things I would point out on this is, is although both A beta antibodies, these are actually fundamentally quite different mechanisms of action. So whereas we think if there were positive results out of the solanezumab trial, this would give great credence to the amyloid hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease and, I think, bode well for the potential results of aducanumab. However, because these are fundamentally different mechanisms they're going at is that it is far more difficult to interpret a negative result if solanezumab were to find it as we would be able to see it. We believe it will be much more difficult to make a conclusion about a negative result on solanezumab vis-à-vis the potential results of aducanumab. On AveXis, I think what we would comment is, look, we welcome innovative therapies for SMA. We think it's a very serious, very important this disease area. We're highly committed to this disease area and to the patients and families. We think that gene therapy, as an overall approach, is a viable one in spinal muscular atrophy, and in fact, we're quite excited about our own internal program that we have and our collaboration with UPenn in that regard as well. So we look forward to seeing how the combination of nusinersen potentially being launched and the next-generation therapeutics that we're certainly working on will play out over time. We see great prospect for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy."

So I don't know if it's an overall market trend but this is what we have seen internally. What I can tell you is that TECFIDERA remains the #1 priority for the organization. We have a plan, as alluded last time, we are working based on the portfolio work that we are doing on Peg GI discontinuation that remains at an average of approximately 22%. We have the good opportunity to make some inroad there because, basically, the scope goes from 5% to 35%. So there are some centers, some MS centers where they're able to manage with the right engagement and hear the different type of engagements that are being practiced in the different centers, there is no evidence yet. One can speculate that we can see a temporal association between the increase of eosinophil and the GI symptomology, but this was not confirmed by clinical trials because of many different confounding factors. So we work on Peg GI. We see early signs if it's heading towards the right direction also in Europe, but it's too early to claim any big success here. We are working on the capture rates, and one balance the other. That's why we have a stable patient base. And the pace of the market is certainly lower than what we have estimated in our assumptions, but it's not an excuse for not increasing share. So we do not give up. We invest. We are committed. I can tell you the team in the U.S. is all up and running. They have piloted a new engagement model with critical MS centers. I'm very pleased to see the perception improvement. And now we have to continue to execute, and the full rollout of this new plan will be towards the end of the year or, by latest, early January. So we are committed. We don't give up on the large mature market, where the share of TEC is relatively stable, versus the latest launch markets where we make -- continue to make fast inroads, like in Italy, Spain or the U.K. And the good news is that we could turn to positive France. And we'll continue for Germany, and we'll continue for the U.S. We are committed. Thank you."

Happy to say, Biogen delivered another solid quarter, complete with strong financial performance and significant advancements in the pipeline. For the third quarter of 2016, Biogen generated a record $3 billion in revenues, 6% increase from the same period a year ago. Our GAAP earnings were $4.71 per share, a 13% increase versus Q3 last year, and non-GAAP earnings were $5.19 per share, a 16% increase. 
I'll come back to the financials in a minute, but first, I'd like to highlight some of the important third quarter pipeline progress. One of the most exciting milestones this quarter was the positive interim analysis of nusinersen in the ENDEAR study. Recognizing the tremendous need in the SMA community, we moved quickly to establish the expanded access program and completed the NDA filing with the FDA in less than 2 months, the fastest time of filing time in Biogen's 38-year history. We continue to be grateful to the patients, families, investigators and employees who work tirelessly to bring this program to this point. We've also filed with the EMA where nusinersen has received Accelerated  Assessment status. If approved, nusinersen would be the first treatment for patients with spinal muscular atrophy, a leading genetic cause of death in infants. 
We were honored when one of our key pipeline programs was featured on the cover of Nature, specifically, the results of our preclinical research in Phase Ib study of aducanumab. This rare distinction was a first for Biogen research and one that I think further highlights the important work that we're doing in the area of Alzheimer's disease. We also announced that aducanumab was granted Fast Track designation by the FDA. 
Our commercial business continue to deliver solid results this quarter. We furthered our leadership in MS with the launch of ZINBRYTA in collaboration with AbbVie, and we continue to grow the number of patients benefiting from our full portfolio of MS products. 
Our third quarter hemophilia revenues grew to $217 million, and we made further progress with the spinoff of our hemophilia business into a separate, independent, publicly traded company, known as Bioverativ, with the initial filing of the Form 10 in August. We continue to expect to complete that transaction in early 2017. 
In Europe, we doubled our biosimilars revenues over the prior quarter as BENEPALI continues to launch in markets across the continent and pick up share at a rate previously unseen for a biosimilar anti-TNF, and we launched FLIXABI, our biosimilar of infliximab. We continue to believe that our work in biosimilars is an important growth opportunity for Biogen. 
So we've seen great progress in both our pipeline and our commercial portfolio during the quarter. As you'll hear shortly from Mike and Michel, our entire executive leadership team is focused on driving commercial performance, prioritizing our assets, advancing our clinical programs and reshaping our pipeline, and our 7,000 employees globally remain committed to delivering therapies that we believe can make a positive difference in the lives of patients. 
I'll now turn the call over to Mike so that he can give you a thorough update on our pipeline."

Let me provide some highlights from this quarter, starting with multiple sclerosis. Last month, at ECTRIMS, we presented clinical findings from our broad portfolio of MS therapies as well as top line results",1483,"Thank you, George, and good morning, everyone. Let me provide some highlights from this quarter, starting with multiple sclerosis. Last month, at ECTRIMS, we presented clinical findings from our broad portfolio of MS therapies as well as top line results for opicinumab, or anti-LINGO, a potential neuroreparative therapy for people with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. 
We presented real-world data and clinical evidence showing that TECFIDERA consistently demonstrates strong efficacy by reducing MS disease activity in patients who have had up to 9 years of treatment. These data also affirm TECFIDERA's well-characterized safety profile. Importantly, we believe these findings provide additional support for the early use of TECFIDERA to improve patient outcomes. 
Data were also presented for ZINBRYTA, our newly launched once-monthly, self-administered subcutaneous treatment option for relapsing forms of MS. A new post-hoc analysis from the pivotal DECIDE study showed that a significantly greater number of people treated with ZINBRYTA showed no evidence of disease activity compared to those taking intramuscular interferon. Additional new interim data from the long-term extension study EXTEND show that treatment with ZINBRYTA had long-term benefits in the proportion of patients who remained relapse-free as well as those who did not experience 24-week confirmed disability progression. 
For opicinumab, we presented top line results from the Phase II SYNERGY study in MS, in which opicinumab missed the primary endpoint. However, we believe the robust design of the study has allowed us to identify an appropriate patient population and dose to move forward with development. Within the 10 mg per kg dosing arm of the study, we identified a treatment effect in patients who's MRI scans had specific features suggesting evidence that reduced myelination and intact axons at study entry. This subset represented approximately 1/4 of all patients in the SYNERGY study. Based on these data, we hypothesized that patients with similar features may have the potential to benefit from treatment with opicinumab. We're in the final stages of designing the next study and look forward to providing an update in the coming months. 
Turning to another late-stage asset. We made significant progress advancing nusinersen this quarter. As George highlighted, in August, Biogen and Ionis announced that we met the prespecified primary endpoint upon interim analysis of ENDEAR. In the analysis, patients with infantile onset SMA or SMA consistent with Type 1 who were treated with nusinersen demonstrated a highly statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in the achievement of motor milestones, as measured by the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination. The responder analysis looked to the achievement of tangible milestones, like kicking, head control, rolling, sitting, crawling, standing and walking, and we believe the results provide a real demonstration of the value nusinersen could bring for patients and their families. Data from the other end points analyzed were also consistently in favor of the treated infants. 
The ENDEAR study remains ongoing and will be stopped once enrolled patients complete their next office visit, but it is anticipated to happen for all patients before the end of the year. Once this occurs, we'll be able to provide more detailed efficacy data, including an analysis on survival. 
During the quarter, we also successfully completed the rolling submission of a new drug application to the FDA for nusinersen. The U.S. filing was submitted less than 2 months after the positive interim analysis of the ENDEAR trial, a significant accomplishment for the company and recognition of the urgent need in this community. We have applied for Priority Review, which, if granted, will shorten the review period for nusinersen following the agency's acceptance of the filing. 
Earlier this month, we also filed the Marketing Authorization Application to the European Medicines Agency. The EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use has granted nusinersen Accelerated Assessment status, which can also reduce the standard review time, and we look forward to working with both agencies over the coming months to bring this treatment to patients as quickly as possible. 
For nusinersen, our regulatory submissions are comprised of results from from the prespecified interim analysis of ENDEAR as well as all other clinical and preclinical data currently available, including open-label data in both Types 2 and 3 SMA patients. We're seeking a broad label for the treatment of SMA and our current filing applications in the U.S. and the EU. 
Our other randomized, placebo-controlled Phase III study, CHERISH, in children with later-onset SMA consistent with Type 2 was fully enrolled in March this year and remains on track for completion in the first half of 2017. 
Earlier this month, we presented additional data for nusinersen at the 2016 World Muscle Society Congress in Granada, Spain. The presentations included safety results from the interim analysis of the Phase III ENDEAR study, which demonstrated a favorable safety profile. 
Analysis of the ongoing Phase II open-label study NURTURE demonstrated a positive effect in genetically diagnosed and presymptomatic SMA infants. In the NURTURE interim analysis, all 13 infants have demonstrated increases in mean Hammersmith Infant Neurological Exam scores over time, and no infants have discontinued, withdrawn from the study or reached the primary endpoint of death or respiratory intervention in patients who had been enrolled for a minimum of 64 days and up to 13 months. 
A recent analysis of data from the CS2 and CS12 open-label studies in patients with later-onset SMA, which included both Type 2 and Type 3 patients, was also presented at World Muscle. The data showed that children with SMA treated with nusinersen exhibited improvements on several measures of motor function for up to nearly 3 years. These results are in contrast to the stable or slow decline in scores typically observed in patients with later-onset SMA over time. We continue to be encouraged by the consistently positive results for nusinersen, which we believe support its benefit in SMA. 
Now turning to Alzheimer's disease. During the quarter, a number of exciting developments occurred for our lead candidate, aducanumab. As George mentioned, results from preclinical research in the Phase Ib study of aducanumab were published in Nature, a significant achievement for the program and recognition of Biogen's high-caliber science. Aducanumab was granted Fast Track designation by the FDA, an important step in bringing this potential therapy to patients as quickly as possible. 
And in a recently completed interim analysis from the Phase Ib study, which included the titration cohort, arms 8 and 9 and the portion of the long-term extension study, efficacy and safety were consistent with results previously reported and support the design of the ongoing Phase III ENGAGE and EMERGE studies. The data from both the titration  cohort and the portion of the long-term extension study of PRIME have been accepted to the 9th Clinical Trials on Alzheimer's Disease meeting in San Diego, and we look forward to sharing additional safety and efficacy data with you in December. 
We're also making important progress across our pipeline, and we continue to shape our R&D engine for the future. Last year, we announced an agreement to license amiselimod, an oral sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulator, for Mitsubishi Tanabe. Since announcing the license agreement, we assessed the compound for a number of autoimmune indications with a particular interest in inflammatory bowel disease. As we prioritize our strategic objectives and the IBD landscape continues to evolve, we've decided to discontinue our current development plan for amiselimod. 
As we mentioned last quarter, we generated encouraging Phase I data on BIIB059, or anti-BDCA2, for lupus. The anti-BDCA2 Phase I study included both healthy volunteers and a cohort of 12 lupus subjects. We anticipate presenting these data at ACR next month, including results from the lupus cohort. A Phase II study evaluating the efficacy and safety of BIIB059 is underway with the first subject dose this month. 
We're also working to advance BIIB074, a novel investigational state-dependent subtype selective sodium channel blocker for neuropathic pain. We have initiated and opened to enrollment a Phase I -- Phase IIb trial for lumbosacral radiculopathy, also known as sciatica. We're also close to completing enrollment in a small exploratory Phase IIa study in erythromelalgia, and we are working toward initiating a Phase III study in trigeminal neuralgia in 2017. 
BG11, or STX-100, for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is enrolling its final cohort in a Phase IIa study, and we expect to present the data after the trial completes in the second half of next year. BG11 blocks alpha(v)beta(6) integrin, which is selectively up-regulated in epithelial cells in fibrotic conditions, such as IPF, and is known to be a key mediator of TGF-beta activations. We believe early safety and biomarker results from this study evaluating BG11 in IPF patients are encouraging. 
In summary, we continue to make strong progress across our pipeline, and we are working aggressively to optimize and reshape our R&D activities, focusing resources to rapidly advance assets that present the greatest opportunity and address unmet need. 
With that, I will now pass the call to Michel."

Our portfolio of MS therapies delivered revenues of $2.3 billion, an increase of 3% versus Q3 last year and 2% versus Q2. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, MS revenues increased 5% versus Q3 last year and 2.5% versus Q2. Biogen maintained its global leading market share of 38% and remains the leader for both newly diagnosed and switch patients, representing the dynamic portion of the MS market. 
As I communicated during our last call, the commercial organization is now focusing on 4 key opportunities: portfolio strategy, commercial excellence, medical leadership, trust and value. Since the beginning of Q3, we are now in execution mode, especially for MS in the U.S. 
With portfolio strategy, we have progressed and now identified our prioritized growth opportunities for now and 2017. It is all about making hard choices, driving consistency in resource allocation and following through with tactical plans and execution. 
With commercial excellence, in the U.S., we have piloted and defined a specific engagement model with key MS centers. The rollout is expected to be completed by year-end. Additionally, we are currently enhancing our sophistication in multichannel marketing with a strong focus on digital execution capabilities. We need to meet our customers where they are, defined by the customer journey, to provide a seamless and differentiated Biogen engagement experience, whether through direct, digital or other media. These are important steps, not only to improve performance in the short term, but also towards the creation of a new go-to-market model that is more effective and at a lower cost. 
In terms of medical leadership, during the third quarter, our R&D colleagues have identified several key opportunities as to how to improve MS care today. We believe we have the opportunity to bring to use regular and quantitative measurement of disease progression, including cognition and imaging. In addition, we just launched our MS Path initiative that will be -- we believe will create a standardized, high-quality data repository from a very diverse real-world patient population in the U.S. and EU. We believe this will open new and differentiated engagement opportunities with major MS clinical centers in the U.S. and in Europe. 
And finally, trust and value. We are developing beyond-the-pill solutions that we believe will meet customers' day-to-day needs in living with or treating MS. We are working on establishing the leading ecosystem for patients and providers to improve patient outcomes. We believe that Biogen is the only company that has the position and commitment to MS to be able to provide this level of support in a trustworthy and valuable way. 
Across these 4 priority areas, we have well-defined plans, and as I said, since early Q3, we are now in execution mode. Delivering on those well means enhancing the fundamental capability of the commercial operation at Biogen. These priorities are intended to not only drive performance for our in-line products, but also to prepare the organization for current and future product launches. 
Turning to MS performance. In the U.S., overall MS market has experienced a 2% decline in commercial patients versus Q3 last year, while in Europe, the market continues to grow with a 7% increase in patients versus Q3 last year. For TECFIDERA, global market share has increased by approximately one point to 15% versus Q3 last year. 
In the U.S., we have a stable TECFIDERA performance. TECFIDERA continues to capture roughly half of all patients starting on an oral with the current oral share of 51%, and overall patient share remains relatively stable at 20% since the beginning of the year. This is a clear leadership position for all 3 metrics. 
In Europe, there are approximately 65,000 patients on TECFIDERA, an increase of approximately 30% versus Q3 last year and approximately 4% versus Q2. TECFIDERA is now the most prescribed MS therapy in Germany, France, the U.K. and Italy with more recently launched market continuing to drive patient growth. We do aspire to restore growth to the more mature markets, and we are very pleased to see early indicators that TECFIDERA gained share this quarter in France, following 2 quarters of flat performance. 
Over the past year, TYSABRI has seen steady incremental share gains globally as it continues to add patients, driven by increased share in the U.S. as well as in the emerging markets. As we continue to see a shift towards increased use of high efficacy therapies, we believe TYSABRI is benefiting from growing first-line use in the U.S. 
In Europe, we are also encouraged by the recent update, extending the indication for TYSABRI and allowing physician to better optimize risk management based on JC virus antibody index values. Following the EU label approval, we have also received similar label update in Japan, Canada and Switzerland. 
Our interferon therapies continue to play an important role amongst the injectable portion of the market. We believe PLEGRIDY is helping to slow the decline of our interferons, though it does not completely compensate for the loss of AVONEX patients. 
In collaboration with AbbVie, we launched ZINBRYTA in August in the U.S. and Germany, and we just recently obtained approval in Australia. We believe the launch of ZINBRYTA comes at the right time as we see a trend towards increased use of high-efficacy products with both current therapies and future entrants.
While early in the launch, we are encouraged by the level of physician and patient interest in the strong product profile. In the U.S., for example, over half of our target physician have completed enrollment on our REMS Program, enabling them to begin prescribing. These are early data that we see indications that we are capturing many switching patients who otherwise may not have chosen a Biogen product. So it appears that our positioning and execution is working. Looking forward, we expect to receive reimbursement for ZINBRYTA in all the major European markets within the next 12 to 18 months. 
So overall, we had a solid performance this quarter across our MS business despite a recent slowdown in the overall MS commercial market in the U.S. 
We are also very excited about the continued progress of our biosimilar business. BENEPALI is now available in 13 countries, and in most markets, we are seeing a conversion rate superior to the first infliximab biosimilar launch in Europe with up to 60% to 80% conversion in markets such as Norway or Denmark. With BENEPALI, we believe we are able to compete beyond price. We are seeing a strong preference for the BENEPALI auto-injector versus that of the originator, with our research indicating that 86% of the nurse prefer our device. 
We recently also launched our infliximab biosimilar, FLIXABI, which is now available in Germany, the U.K. and the Netherlands with 3 additional countries anticipated in Q4. We believe our ability to potentially be the first company to offer all 3 major anti-TNFs in Europe could put us in a position of strength in the market. We believe biosimilars are an important growth opportunity for Biogen as we work to optimize our engagement with stakeholders across the health care system. 
In summary, we had a very productive quarter across our MS business in terms of performance. We are encouraged with our new product launches, and we see clear progress as we work hard to elevate our commercial execution capabilities to new levels and as we improve our go-to-market model. 
Also, we are particularly excited about the potential to soon launch nusinersen for SMA. With approximately 20,000 patients across the U.S., Europe and Japan and no available treatments today, we believe nusinersen represents a significant opportunity for both Biogen and, more importantly, for the patients who, today, have no treatment option. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Paul."

In the third quarter, our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $4.71, a 13% increase versus Q3 last year, while our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $5.19, an increase of 16%. Total revenue for Q3 grew 6% versus Q3 last year to approximately $3 billion. 
Global third quarter TECFIDERA revenues were $1,034,000,000, an increase of 10% versus Q3 of last year. This included revenues of $845 million in the U.S., an increase of 12% versus Q3 last year, and $189 million outside the U.S., an increase of 3% versus Q3 last year. In the U.S., we believe TECFIDERA benefited by approximately $40 million to $50 million versus Q2 due to inventory build in the channel. Outside the U.S., Q3 TECFIDERA decreased by $17 million versus Q2, largely driven by parallel trade dynamics. Versus Q3 last year, foreign exchange and hedge impact weakened TECFIDERA revenues by approximately $17 million. 
Interferon revenues, including both AVONEX and PLEGRIDY, were $708 million during the third quarter, a decrease of 10% versus Q3 last year. This included $506 million in the U.S. and $203 million in sales outside the U.S. In the U.S., we believe there was a drawdown of AVONEX inventory in the wholesale channel, resulting approximately $10 million versus Q2. Outside the U.S., foreign exchange and hedge impact weakened interferon revenue by approximately $20 million versus Q3 last year. 
TYSABRI worldwide revenues were $515 million this quarter, an increase of 7% versus Q3 last year. This included $301 million in the U.S. and $214 million outside the U.S. Outside the U.S., TYSABRI revenue benefited by $20 million due to a favorable adjustment to our discounts and allowances. Foreign exchange and the hedge impact weakened TYSABRI revenue by approximately $16 million versus Q3 last year. 
Our hemophilia products continued to perform well this quarter. ELOCTATE revenues for the quarter were $132 million, an increase of 46% versus Q3 last year. This includes $110 million in the U.S. and $22 million outside the U.S. ALPROLIX revenues in Q3 were $85 million, an increase of 30% versus Q3 last year, including $67 million in the U.S. and $19 million outside the U.S.  
Our biosimilar business generated $31 million in revenues this quarter, driven primarily by BENEPALI. 
Turning to our anti-CD20 revenues, which include our profit share for RITUXAN and GAZYVA in the United States as well as our profit share in royalties on sales of rituximab outside the U.S. We recorded $318 million for Q3, a decrease from Q2 driven by a reduction in inventory from the second quarter. 
Total other revenues, which include revenues from collaboration relationships, royalties and contract manufacturing, were $99 million in the third quarter. The increase versus Q2 was related to contract manufacturing for a strategic partner, slightly offset by a $13 million loss in our AbbVie collaboration profit share. 
 
Now turning to the expense lines on the P&L. Q3 GAAP cost of goods sold was $417 million or 14% of revenue. Non-GAAP COGS was $396 million or 13% of revenue. The increase versus Q2 was primarily attributable to a mid-single-digit royalty on U.S. sales of both AVONEX and PLEGRIDY. 
Q3 GAAP and non-GAAP R&D expense was $529 million or 18% of revenue. Both GAAP and non-GAAP R&D expense included a $75 million payment to Ionis related to the exercise of our opt-in right to develop and commercialize nusinersen globally. I'd like to note that our collaboration partner, Eisai, has stated their goal to start a Phase III trial for E2609. A $50 million milestone payment is expected to be triggered once the first patient is dosed in the E2609 Phase III trial, and there's a potential chance they could dose the first patient by the end of this year. The $50 million milestone was not considered in our midyear 2016 R&D guidance. 
Q3 GAAP SG&A expense was $463 million. Q3 non-GAAP SG&A expense was $461 million or 16% of revenue. Other net expense was $58 million in Q3, which includes $66 million in interest expense, primarily related to our 2015 bond offering. In Q3, both our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were approximately 25%. 
Our weighted average diluted share count was approximately 219 million for Q3, which brings us to our diluted earnings per share which were $4.71 on a GAAP basis and $5.19 on a non-GAAP basis. We ended the quarter with $7.4 billion in cash and marketable securities with approximately 40% of this in the United States. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.1 million shares of the company's common stock for a total value of $349 million. So as often, we had a number of puts and takes in the quarter, nevertheless, a very solid financial quarter. 
I'll turn the call over to George for his closing comments."

We delivered solid commercial performance, strong financial results and important advances in the pipeline. I'm particularly excited about the direction we're heading as we finish 2016 and look forward to 2017 and beyond. 
As I've said, I believe we are at the beginning of a transformative era in neurodegeneration, which could result in a new era for Biogen as well. We're already starting to see the types of discoveries that can be expected, the science advances and the innovative trial designs yield previously unseen in results and insights. We believe the early data for aducanumab point to additional opportunities to invest in novel science to address Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases. The insights we've gained from the SYNERGY trial are teaching us more about remyelination, and we're enthusiastic about moving opicinumab forward. And the encouraging results we're seeing from nusinersen pointed a possibility that there can be entirely new mechanisms and modalities for treating the many daunting diseases of the central nervous system. 
I'm proud to have led Biogen for more than 6 years now, and it's gratifying to me to be in the position to turn a high-performing organization over to a successor. Our board search for a new CEO is progressing. We don't have a formal update on timing yet, but as you'd expect, the opportunity to lead Biogen is generating plenty of interest. And in the meantime, I'm working closely with our management team as we strive to realize our goals for 2016 and kick off a busy and productive 2017. We're fortunate to have a great leadership team and a passionate group of employees who come to work every day to make a positive impact on patients' lives, and I thank all of them for their hard work and dedication.

So first of all, on the filing, I do want to emphasize that we've submitted the file, we've applied for Priority Review. We haven't heard back on the determination of that. That will obviously dictate when we will get approval for that in the U.S. Similarly, the Accelerated Assessment application we have in Europe, again, that would potentially reduce the review time but we're expecting that, finally, to be validated in the coming weeks. So there's some timing dependence on regulator acceptance of this Priority Review and Accelerated Assessment. Then with that, I'm going to let Michel talk about the launch based on that, but let me address a couple of the other things you mentioned. Our extended access program is active. We've got patients who are receiving drug. This is obviously country-by-country specific in how they're administering it, and it's an ongoing work in progress. That program will really be relevant during this period in -- while we're filed but before we've got approval. We anticipate that, that -- it's going to be a small number of patients that we can get in the relevant countries based on the criteria that we established in our expanded access program. On the incidence and prevalence in the label, what we would say is this is 20,000 patients prevalence today in the U.S., Europe and Japan. SMA, as a whole, has an incidence, about -- of about 13,000 patients a year across those, roughly. The data that we've submitted were from the interim analysis of ENDEAR, these were Type 1 patients. We've included data across all of our studies as well as preclinical data. We are going to seek a broad label for the treatment of SMA. That's obviously will be something under review. And based on that, that will determine the overall size of the patient population, which I'll also let Michel sort of comment on when I turn over to him. My final comment on that would be that we expect that if successful and launched, that these prevalence numbers will increase over time to the extent that we have an impact on survival in these populations. So the label, there's a lot of open questions. We'll have to wait and see, and that is going to determine what the ultimate upside is. So Michel, maybe I'll turn over to you on the..."

I mean, they're scenarios that one can envision, that we are certainly taking into consideration. We look -- we very much look forward to seeing their data. A couple of things I would point out on this is, is although both A beta antibodies, these are actually fundamentally quite different mechanisms of action. So whereas we think if there were positive results out of the solanezumab trial, this would give great credence to the amyloid hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease and, I think, bode well for the potential results of aducanumab. However, because these are fundamentally different mechanisms they're going at is that it is far more difficult to interpret a negative result if solanezumab were to find it as we would be able to see it. We believe it will be much more difficult to make a conclusion about a negative result on solanezumab vis-à-vis the potential results of aducanumab. On AveXis, I think what we would comment is, look, we welcome innovative therapies for SMA. We think it's a very serious, very important disease area. We're highly committed to this disease area and to the patients and families. We think that gene therapy, as an overall approach, is a viable one in spinal muscular atrophy, and in fact, we're quite excited about our own internal program that we have and our collaboration with UPenn in that regard as well. So we look forward to seeing how the combination of nusinersen potentially being launched and the next-generation therapeutics that we're certainly working on will play out over time.

So I don't know if it's an overall market trend but this is what we have seen internally. What I can tell you is that TECFIDERA remains the #1 priority for the organization. We have a plan, as alluded last time, we are working based on the portfolio work that we are doing on Peg GI discontinuation that remains at an average of approximately 22%. We have the good opportunity to make some inroad there because, basically, the scope goes from 5% to 35%. So there are some centers, some MS centers where they're able to manage with the right engagement and here the different type of engagements that are being practiced in the different centers, there is no evidence yet. One can speculate that we can see a temporal association between the increase of eosinophil and the GI symptomology, but this was not confirmed by clinical trials because of many different confounding factors. So we work on Peg GI. We see early signs if it's heading towards the right direction also in Europe, but it's too early to claim any big success here. We are working on the capture rates, and one balance the other. That's why we have a stable patient base. And the pace of the market is certainly lower than what we have estimated in our assumptions, but it's not an excuse for not increasing share. So we do not give up. We invest. We are committed. I can tell you the team in the U.S. is all up and running. They have piloted a new engagement model with critical MS centers. I'm very pleased to see the perception improvement. And now we have to continue to execute, and the full rollout of this new plan will be towards the end of the year or, by latest, early January. So we are committed. We don't give up on the large mature market, where the share of TEC is relatively stable, versus the latest launch markets where we make -- continue to make fast inroads, like in Italy, Spain or the U.K. And the good news is that we could turn to positive France. And we'll continue for Germany, and we'll continue for the U.S. We are committed. Thank you."

Happy to say, Biogen delivered another solid quarter, complete with strong financial performance and significant advancements in the pipeline. For the third quarter of 2016, Biogen generated a record $3 billion in revenues, 6% increase from the same period a year ago. Our GAAP earnings were $4.71 per share, a 13% increase versus Q3 last year, and non-GAAP earnings were $5.19 per share, a 16% increase. 
I'll come back to the financials in a minute, but first, I'd like to highlight some of the important third quarter pipeline progress. One of the most exciting milestones this quarter was the positive interim analysis of nusinersen in the ENDEAR study. Recognizing the tremendous need in the SMA community, we moved quickly to establish the expanded access program and completed the NDA filing with the FDA in less than 2 months, the fastest time of filing time in Biogen's 38-year history. We continue to be grateful to the patients, families, investigators and employees who work tirelessly to bring this program to this point. We've also filed with the EMA where nusinersen has received Accelerated  Assessment status. If approved, nusinersen would be the first treatment for patients with spinal muscular atrophy, a leading genetic cause of death in infants. 
We were honored when one of our key pipeline programs was featured on the cover of Nature, specifically, the results of our preclinical research in Phase Ib study of aducanumab. This rare distinction was a first for Biogen research and one that I think further highlights the important work that we're doing in the area of Alzheimer's disease. We also announced that aducanumab was granted Fast Track designation by the FDA. 
Our commercial business continue to deliver solid results this quarter. We furthered our leadership in MS with the launch of ZINBRYTA in collaboration with AbbVie, and we continue to grow the number of patients benefiting from our full portfolio of MS products. 
Our third quarter hemophilia revenues grew to $217 million, and we made further progress with the spinoff of our hemophilia business into a separate, independent, publicly traded company, known as Bioverativ, with the initial filing of the Form 10 in August. We continue to expect to complete that transaction in early 2017. 
In Europe, we doubled our biosimilars revenues over the prior quarter as BENEPALI continues to launch in markets across the continent and pick up share at a rate previously unseen for a biosimilar anti-TNF, and we launched FLIXABI, our biosimilar of infliximab. We continue to believe that our work in biosimilars is an important growth opportunity for Biogen. 
So we've seen great progress in both our pipeline and our commercial portfolio during the quarter. As you'll hear shortly from Mike and Michel, our entire executive leadership team is focused on driving commercial performance, prioritizing our assets, advancing our clinical programs and reshaping our pipeline, and our 7,000 employees globally remain committed to delivering therapies that we believe can make a positive difference in the lives of patients. 
I'll now turn the call over to Mike so that he can give you a thorough update on our pipeline."

Let me provide some highlights from this quarter, starting with multiple sclerosis. Last month, at ECTRIMS, we presented clinical findings from our broad portfolio of MS therapies as well as top line results",1482,"Thank you, George, and good morning, everyone. Let me provide some highlights from this quarter, starting with multiple sclerosis. Last month, at ECTRIMS, we presented clinical findings from our broad portfolio of MS therapies as well as top line results for opicinumab, or anti-LINGO, a potential neuroreparative therapy for people with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. 
We presented real-world data and clinical evidence showing that TECFIDERA consistently demonstrates strong efficacy by reducing MS disease activity in patients who have had up to 9 years of treatment. These data also affirm TECFIDERA's well-characterized safety profile. Importantly, we believe these findings provide additional support for the early use of TECFIDERA to improve patient outcomes. 
Data were also presented for ZINBRYTA, our newly launched once-monthly, self-administered subcutaneous treatment option for relapsing forms of MS. A new post-hoc analysis from the pivotal DECIDE study showed that a significantly greater number of people treated with ZINBRYTA showed no evidence of disease activity compared to those taking intramuscular interferon. Additional new interim data from the long-term extension study EXTEND show that treatment with ZINBRYTA had long-term benefits in the proportion of patients who remained relapse-free as well as those who did not experience 24-week confirmed disability progression. 
For opicinumab, we presented top line results from the Phase II SYNERGY study in MS, in which opicinumab missed the primary endpoint. However, we believe the robust design of the study has allowed us to identify an appropriate patient population and dose to move forward with development. Within the 10 mg per kg dosing arm of the study, we identified a treatment effect in patients whose MRI scans had specific features suggesting evidence that reduced myelination and intact axons at study entry. This subset represented approximately 1/4 of all patients in the SYNERGY study. Based on these data, we hypothesized that patients with similar features may have the potential to benefit from treatment with opicinumab. We're in the final stages of designing the next study and look forward to providing an update in the coming months. 
Turning to another late-stage asset. We made significant progress advancing nusinersen this quarter. As George highlighted, in August, Biogen and Ionis announced that we met the prespecified primary endpoint upon interim analysis of ENDEAR. In the analysis, patients with infantile onset SMA or SMA consistent with Type 1 who were treated with nusinersen demonstrated a highly statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in the achievement of motor milestones, as measured by the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination. The responder analysis looked to the achievement of tangible milestones, like kicking, head control, rolling, sitting, crawling, standing and walking, and we believe the results provide a real demonstration of the value nusinersen could bring for patients and their families. Data from the other end points analyzed were also consistently in favor of the treated infants. 
The ENDEAR study remains ongoing and will be stopped once enrolled patients complete their next office visit, but it is anticipated to happen for all patients before the end of the year. Once this occurs, we'll be able to provide more detailed efficacy data, including an analysis on survival. 
During the quarter, we also successfully completed the rolling submission of a new drug application to the FDA for nusinersen. The U.S. filing was submitted less than 2 months after the positive interim analysis of the ENDEAR trial, a significant accomplishment for the company and recognition of the urgent need in this community. We have applied for Priority Review, which, if granted, will shorten the review period for nusinersen following the agency's acceptance of the filing. 
Earlier this month, we also filed the Marketing Authorization Application to the European Medicines Agency. The EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use has granted nusinersen Accelerated Assessment status, which can also reduce the standard review time, and we look forward to working with both agencies over the coming months to bring this treatment to patients as quickly as possible. 
For nusinersen, our regulatory submissions are comprised of results from the prespecified interim analysis of ENDEAR as well as all other clinical and preclinical data currently available, including open-label data in both Types 2 and 3 SMA patients. We're seeking a broad label for the treatment of SMA and our current filing applications in the U.S. and the EU. 
Our other randomized, placebo-controlled Phase III study, CHERISH, in children with later-onset SMA consistent with Type 2 was fully enrolled in March this year and remains on track for completion in the first half of 2017. 
Earlier this month, we presented additional data for nusinersen at the 2016 World Muscle Society Congress in Granada, Spain. The presentations included safety results from the interim analysis of the Phase III ENDEAR study, which demonstrated a favorable safety profile. 
Analysis of the ongoing Phase II open-label study NURTURE demonstrated a positive effect in genetically diagnosed and presymptomatic SMA infants. In the NURTURE interim analysis, all 13 infants have demonstrated increases in mean Hammersmith Infant Neurological Exam scores over time, and no infants have discontinued, withdrawn from the study or reached the primary endpoint of death or respiratory intervention in patients who had been enrolled for a minimum of 64 days and up to 13 months. 
A recent analysis of data from the CS2 and CS12 open-label studies in patients with later-onset SMA, which included both Type 2 and Type 3 patients, was also presented at World Muscle. The data showed that children with SMA treated with nusinersen exhibited improvements on several measures of motor function for up to nearly 3 years. These results are in contrast to the stable or slow decline in scores typically observed in patients with later-onset SMA over time. We continue to be encouraged by the consistently positive results for nusinersen, which we believe support its benefit in SMA. 
Now turning to Alzheimer's disease. During the quarter, a number of exciting developments occurred for our lead candidate, aducanumab. As George mentioned, results from preclinical research in the Phase Ib study of aducanumab were published in Nature, a significant achievement for the program and recognition of Biogen's high-caliber science. Aducanumab was granted Fast Track designation by the FDA, an important step in bringing this potential therapy to patients as quickly as possible. 
And in a recently completed interim analysis from the Phase Ib study, which included the titration cohort, arms 8 and 9 and the portion of the long-term extension study, efficacy and safety were consistent with results previously reported and support the design of the ongoing Phase III ENGAGE and EMERGE studies. The data from both the titration  cohort and the portion of the long-term extension study of PRIME have been accepted to the 9th Clinical Trials on Alzheimer's Disease meeting in San Diego, and we look forward to sharing additional safety and efficacy data with you in December. 
We're also making important progress across our pipeline, and we continue to shape our R&D engine for the future. Last year, we announced an agreement to license amiselimod, an oral sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulator, for Mitsubishi Tanabe. Since announcing the license agreement, we assessed the compound for a number of autoimmune indications with a particular interest in inflammatory bowel disease. As we prioritize our strategic objectives and the IBD landscape continues to evolve, we've decided to discontinue our current development plan for amiselimod. 
As we mentioned last quarter, we generated encouraging Phase I data on BIIB059, or anti-BDCA2, for lupus. The anti-BDCA2 Phase I study included both healthy volunteers and a cohort of 12 lupus subjects. We anticipate presenting these data at ACR next month, including results from the lupus cohort. A Phase II study evaluating the efficacy and safety of BIIB059 is underway with the first subject dose this month. 
We're also working to advance BIIB074, a novel investigational state-dependent subtype selective sodium channel blocker for neuropathic pain. We have initiated and opened to enrollment a Phase I -- Phase IIb trial for lumbosacral radiculopathy, also known as sciatica. We're also close to completing enrollment in a small exploratory Phase IIa study in erythromelalgia, and we are working toward initiating a Phase III study in trigeminal neuralgia in 2017. 
BG11, or STX-100, for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is enrolling its final cohort in a Phase IIa study, and we expect to present the data after the trial completes in the second half of next year. BG11 blocks alpha(v)beta(6) integrin, which is selectively up-regulated in epithelial cells in fibrotic conditions, such as IPF, and is known to be a key mediator of TGF-beta activations. We believe early safety and biomarker results from this study evaluating BG11 in IPF patients are encouraging. 
In summary, we continue to make strong progress across our pipeline, and we are working aggressively to optimize and reshape our R&D activities, focusing resources to rapidly advance assets that present the greatest opportunity and address unmet need. 
With that, I will now pass the call to Michel."

Our portfolio of MS therapies delivered revenues of $2.3 billion, an increase of 3% versus Q3 last year and 2% versus Q2. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, MS revenues increased 5% versus Q3 last year and 2.5% versus Q2. Biogen maintained its global leading market share of 38% and remains the leader for both newly diagnosed and switch patients, representing the dynamic portion of the MS market. 
As I communicated during our last call, the commercial organization is now focusing on 4 key opportunities: portfolio strategy, commercial excellence, medical leadership, trust and value. Since the beginning of Q3, we are now in execution mode, especially for MS in the U.S. 
With portfolio strategy, we have progressed and now identified our prioritized growth opportunities for now and 2017. It is all about making hard choices, driving consistency in resource allocation and following through with tactical plans and execution. 
With commercial excellence, in the U.S., we have piloted and defined a specific engagement model with key MS centers. The rollout is expected to be completed by year-end. Additionally, we are currently enhancing our sophistication in multichannel marketing with a strong focus on digital execution capabilities. We need to meet our customers where they are, defined by the customer journey, to provide a seamless and differentiated Biogen engagement experience, whether through direct, digital or other media. These are important steps, not only to improve performance in the short term, but also towards the creation of a new go-to-market model that is more effective and at a lower cost. 
In terms of medical leadership, during the third quarter, our R&D colleagues have identified several key opportunities as to how to improve MS care today. We believe we have the opportunity to bring to use regular and quantitative measurement of disease progression, including cognition and imaging. In addition, we just launched our MS Path initiative that will be -- we believe will create a standardized, high-quality data repository from a very diverse real-world patient population in the U.S. and EU. We believe this will open new and differentiated engagement opportunities with major MS clinical centers in the U.S. and in Europe. 
And finally, trust and value. We are developing beyond-the-pill solutions that we believe will meet customers' day-to-day needs in living with or treating MS. We are working on establishing the leading ecosystem for patients and providers to improve patient outcomes. We believe that Biogen is the only company that has the position and commitment to MS to be able to provide this level of support in a trustworthy and valuable way. 
Across these 4 priority areas, we have well-defined plans, and as I said, since early Q3, we are now in execution mode. Delivering on those well means enhancing the fundamental capability of the commercial operation at Biogen. These priorities are intended to not only drive performance for our in-line products, but also to prepare the organization for current and future product launches. 
Turning to MS performance. In the U.S., overall MS market has experienced a 2% decline in commercial patients versus Q3 last year, while in Europe, the market continues to grow with a 7% increase in patients versus Q3 last year. For TECFIDERA, global market share has increased by approximately one point to 15% versus Q3 last year. 
In the U.S., we have a stable TECFIDERA performance. TECFIDERA continues to capture roughly half of all patients starting on an oral with the current oral share of 51%, and overall patient share remains relatively stable at 20% since the beginning of the year. This is a clear leadership position for all 3 metrics. 
In Europe, there are approximately 65,000 patients on TECFIDERA, an increase of approximately 30% versus Q3 last year and approximately 4% versus Q2. TECFIDERA is now the most prescribed MS therapy in Germany, France, the U.K. and Italy with more recently launched market continuing to drive patient growth. We do aspire to restore growth to the more mature markets, and we are very pleased to see early indicators that TECFIDERA gained share this quarter in France, following 2 quarters of flat performance. 
Over the past year, TYSABRI has seen steady incremental share gains globally as it continues to add patients, driven by increased share in the U.S. as well as in the emerging markets. As we continue to see a shift towards increased use of high efficacy therapies, we believe TYSABRI is benefiting from growing first-line use in the U.S. 
In Europe, we are also encouraged by the recent update, extending the indication for TYSABRI and allowing physician to better optimize risk management based on JC virus antibody index values. Following the EU label approval, we have also received similar label update in Japan, Canada and Switzerland. 
Our interferon therapies continue to play an important role amongst the injectable portion of the market. We believe PLEGRIDY is helping to slow the decline of our interferons, though it does not completely compensate for the loss of AVONEX patients. 
In collaboration with AbbVie, we launched ZINBRYTA in August in the U.S. and Germany, and we just recently obtained approval in Australia. We believe the launch of ZINBRYTA comes at the right time as we see a trend towards increased use of high-efficacy products with both current therapies and future entrants.
While early in the launch, we are encouraged by the level of physician and patient interest in the strong product profile. In the U.S., for example, over half of our target physician have completed enrollment on our REMS Program, enabling them to begin prescribing. These are early data that we see indications that we are capturing many switching patients who otherwise may not have chosen a Biogen product. So it appears that our positioning and execution is working. Looking forward, we expect to receive reimbursement for ZINBRYTA in all the major European markets within the next 12 to 18 months. 
So overall, we had a solid performance this quarter across our MS business despite a recent slowdown in the overall MS commercial market in the U.S. 
We are also very excited about the continued progress of our biosimilar business. BENEPALI is now available in 13 countries, and in most markets, we are seeing a conversion rate superior to the first infliximab biosimilar launch in Europe with up to 60% to 80% conversion in markets such as Norway or Denmark. With BENEPALI, we believe we are able to compete beyond price. We are seeing a strong preference for the BENEPALI auto-injector versus that of the originator, with our research indicating that 86% of the nurse prefer our device. 
We recently also launched our infliximab biosimilar, FLIXABI, which is now available in Germany, the U.K. and the Netherlands with 3 additional countries anticipated in Q4. We believe our ability to potentially be the first company to offer all 3 major anti-TNFs in Europe could put us in a position of strength in the market. We believe biosimilars are an important growth opportunity for Biogen as we work to optimize our engagement with stakeholders across the health care system. 
In summary, we had a very productive quarter across our MS business in terms of performance. We are encouraged with our new product launches, and we see clear progress as we work hard to elevate our commercial execution capabilities to new levels and as we improve our go-to-market model. 
Also, we are particularly excited about the potential to soon launch nusinersen for SMA. With approximately 20,000 patients across the U.S., Europe and Japan and no available treatments today, we believe nusinersen represents a significant opportunity for both Biogen and, more importantly, for the patients who, today, have no treatment option. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Paul."

Global third quarter TECFIDERA revenues were $1,034,000,000, an increase of 10% versus Q3 of last year. This included revenues of $845 million in the U.S., an increase of 12% versus Q3 last year, and $189 million outside the U.S., an increase of 3% versus Q3 last year. In the U.S., we believe TECFIDERA benefited by approximately $40 million to $50 million versus Q2 due to inventory build in the channel. Outside the U.S., Q3 TECFIDERA decreased by $17 million versus Q2, largely driven by parallel trade dynamics. Versus Q3 last year, foreign exchange and hedge impact weakened TECFIDERA revenues by approximately $17 million.

This includes $110 million in the U.S. and $22 million outside the U.S. ALPROLIX revenues in Q3 were $85 million, an increase of 30% versus Q3 last year, including $67 million in the U.S. and $19 million outside the U.S.  
Our biosimilar business generated $31 million in revenues this quarter, driven primarily by BENEPALI. 
Turning to our anti-CD20 revenues, which include our profit share for RITUXAN and GAZYVA in the United States as well as our profit share in royalties on sales of rituximab outside the U.S. We recorded $318 million for Q3, a decrease from Q2 driven by a reduction in inventory from the second quarter. 
Total other revenues, which include revenues from collaboration relationships, royalties and contract manufacturing, were $99 million in the third quarter. The increase versus Q2 was related to contract manufacturing for a strategic partner, slightly offset by a $13 million loss in our AbbVie collaboration profit share. 
 
Now turning to the expense lines on the P&L. Q3 GAAP cost of goods sold was $417 million or 14% of revenue. Non-GAAP COGS was $396 million or 13% of revenue. The increase versus Q2 was primarily attributable to a mid-single-digit royalty on U.S. sales of both AVONEX and PLEGRIDY. 
Q3 GAAP and non-GAAP R&D expense was $529 million or 18% of revenue. Both GAAP and non-GAAP R&D expense included a $75 million payment to Ionis related to the exercise of our opt-in right to develop and commercialize nusinersen globally. I'd like to note that our collaboration partner, Eisai, has stated their goal to start a Phase III trial for E2609. A $50 million milestone payment is expected to be triggered once the first patient is dosed in the E2609 Phase III trial, and there's a potential chance they could dose the first patient by the end of this year. The $50 million milestone was not considered in our midyear 2016 R&D guidance. 
Q3 GAAP SG&A expense was $463 million. Q3 non-GAAP SG&A expense was $461 million or 16% of revenue. Other net expense was $58 million in Q3, which includes $66 million in interest expense, primarily related to our 2015 bond offering. In Q3, both our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were approximately 25%. 
Our weighted average diluted share count was approximately 219 million for Q3, which brings us to our diluted earnings per share which were $4.71 on a GAAP basis and $5.19 on a non-GAAP basis. We ended the quarter with $7.4 billion in cash and marketable securities with approximately 40% of this in the United States. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.1 million shares of the company's common stock for a total value of $349 million. So as often, we had a number of puts and takes in the quarter, nevertheless, a very solid financial quarter. 
I'll turn the call over to George for his closing comments."

We delivered solid commercial performance, strong financial results and important advances in the pipeline. I'm particularly excited about the direction we're heading as we finish 2016 and look forward to 2017 and beyond. 
As I've said, I believe we are at the beginning of a transformative era in neurodegeneration, which could result in a new era for Biogen as well. We're already starting to see the types of discoveries that can be expected, the science advances and the innovative trial designs yield previously unseen in results and insights. We believe the early data for aducanumab point to additional opportunities to invest in novel science to address Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases. The insights we've gained from the SYNERGY trial are teaching us more about remyelination, and we're enthusiastic about moving opicinumab forward. And the encouraging results we're seeing from nusinersen pointed a possibility that there can be entirely new mechanisms and modalities for treating the many daunting diseases of the central nervous system. 
I'm proud to have led Biogen for more than 6 years now, and it's gratifying to me to be in the position to turn a high-performing organization over to a successor. Our board search for a new CEO is progressing. We don't have a formal update on timing yet, but as you'd expect, the opportunity to lead Biogen is generating plenty of interest. And in the meantime, I'm working closely with our management team as we strive to realize our goals for 2016 and kick off a busy and productive 2017. We're fortunate to have a great leadership team and a passionate group of employees who come to work every day to make a positive impact on patients' lives, and I thank all of them for their hard work and dedication.
 Thanks to all of you for joining us this morning, and we'll now open up the call for questions."

So first of all, on the filing, I do want to emphasize that we've submitted the file, we've applied for Priority Review. We haven't heard back on the determination of that. That will obviously dictate when we will get approval for that in the U.S. Similarly, the Accelerated Assessment application we have in Europe, again, that would potentially reduce the review time but we're expecting that, finally, to be validated in the coming weeks. So there's some timing dependence on regulator acceptance of this Priority Review and Accelerated Assessment. Then with that, I'm going to let Michel talk about the launch based on that, but let me address a couple of the other things you mentioned. Our extended access program is active. We've got patients who are receiving drug. This is obviously country-by-country specific in how they're administering it, and it's an ongoing work in progress. That program will really be relevant during this period in -- while we're filed but before we've got approval. We anticipate that, that -- it's going to be a small number of patients that we can get in the relevant countries based on the criteria that we established in our expanded access program. On the incidence and prevalence in the label, what we would say is this is 20,000 patients prevalence today in the U.S., Europe and Japan. SMA, as a whole, has an incidence, about -- of about 13,000 patients a year across those, roughly. The data that we've submitted were from the interim analysis of ENDEAR, these were Type 1 patients. We've included data across all of our studies as well as preclinical data. We are going to seek a broad label for the treatment of SMA. That's obviously will be something under review. And based on that, that will determine the overall size of the patient population, which I'll also let Michel sort of comment on when I turn over to him. My final comment on that would be that we expect that if successful and launched, that these prevalence numbers will increase over time to the extent that we have an impact on survival in these populations.

I mean, they're scenarios that one can envision, that we are certainly taking into consideration. We look -- we very much look forward to seeing their data. A couple of things I would point out on this is, is although both A beta antibodies, these are actually fundamentally quite different mechanisms of action. So whereas we think if there were positive results out of the solanezumab trial, this would give great credence to the amyloid hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease and, I think, bode well for the potential results of aducanumab. However, because these are fundamentally different mechanisms they're going at is that it is far more difficult to interpret a negative result if solanezumab were to find it as we would be able to see it. We believe it will be much more difficult to make a conclusion about a negative result on solanezumab vis-à-vis the potential results of aducanumab. On AveXis, I think what we would comment is, look, we welcome innovative therapies for SMA. We think it's a very serious, very important disease area. We're highly committed to this disease area and to the patients and families.

And then on the MS market, Michel, I had a quick question. So you said that in the U.S., the volumes are declining year-over-year. And do you see this trend continuing? And if so, is it fair to say that any growth from TEC, which -- stable patient share and I guess also, perhaps, the entire MS market as a whole, would come from price going forward?

So I don't know if it's an overall market trend but this is what we have seen internally. What I can tell you is that TECFIDERA remains the #1 priority for the organization. We have a plan, as alluded last time, we are working based on the portfolio work that we are doing on Peg GI discontinuation that remains at an average of approximately 22%. We have the good opportunity to make some inroad there because, basically, the scope goes from 5% to 35%. So there are some centers, some MS centers where they're able to manage with the right engagement and here the different type of engagements that are being practiced in the different centers, there is no evidence yet. One can speculate that we can see a temporal association between the increase of eosinophil and the GI symptomology, but this was not confirmed by clinical trials because of many different confounding factors. So we work on Peg GI. We see early signs if it's heading towards the right direction also in Europe, but it's too early to claim any big success here. We are working on the capture rates, and one balance the other. That's why we have a stable patient base. And the pace of the market is certainly lower than what we have estimated in our assumptions, but it's not an excuse for not increasing share. So we do not give up. We invest. We are committed. I can tell you the team in the U.S. is all up and running. They have piloted a new engagement model with critical MS centers. I'm very pleased to see the perception improvement. And now we have to continue to execute, and the full rollout of this new plan will be towards the end of the year or, by latest, early January. So we are committed. We don't give up on the large mature market, where the share of TEC is relatively stable, versus the latest launch markets where we make -- continue to make fast inroads, like in Italy, Spain or the U.K. And the good news is that we could turn to positive France. And we'll continue for Germany, and we'll continue for the U.S. We are committed. Thank you."

A lot of that is determined at the site in the country level. They determine that.
