This morning, I'll provide you with highlights of the quarter, share a few comments on industry dynamics and review progress on our 5-point strategy. Then Mark will provide more detail on the results and take you through guidance. 
While we continue to make progress on our path forward, delivering a strong year and positioning ourselves very well for 2016, before turning to the quarter, let me recap our performance for the year. Revenues grew by 2% on an equivalent basis, adjusted operating income as a percentage of revenues expanded by about 110 basis points, and adjusted EPS, excluding amortization, grew by 6%. 
During the fourth quarter, revenues were $1.85 billion, growing by 60 basis points on equivalent basis. The adjusted EPS, excluding amortization, was $1.19, and this represents our seventh consecutive quarter of year-on-year EPS growth. 
Before I get into our strategy update, I'd like to talk about our industry dynamics, starting with the recent CMS proposal related to the PAMA legislation, which, as you know, stands for Protecting Access to Medicare Act. As you have heard me say before, PAMA needs to be built on a representative view of the market. The current proposal limits the definition of an applicable lab to exclude a large portion of the market. We also believe that a 2017 effective date will be a significant challenge for all parties. With strong support from the American Hospital Association, American Medical Association and members of Congress, we remain optimistic that together, industry and government, can still achieve a reasonable outcome. Second, I would like to discuss the proposed FDA guidance on regulation of laboratory-developed tests. We understand that the FDA's concerns, but we continue to believe what the FDA has proposed would result in labs being subject to both CLEA and FDA regulations that may be overlapping, duplicative and sometimes contradictory in their requirements. This has the potential to raise health care costs for patients and potentially hinder medical innovation. The house draft legislation is a good first step in the legislative process. We share ACLA's goals of promoting and supporting diagnostic innovations that provide physicians with the insights necessary to advance patient care and save lives. We want to work with Congress to get the right balance in legislation, right for the industry, right for physicians and right for patients who depend upon our diagnostic insights to make informed health care decisions every day. 
Now let me shift to the progress we're making on our 5-point strategy, which is to restore growth, drive operational excellence, simplify the organization, refocus on our diagnostic information services business and deliver disciplined capital deployment. 
So starting with growth. Well, just 3 years ago, this business was shrinking by more than 4%. We slowed the organic decline to 2% in 2014 and have now grown organically on equivalent basis for the fifth consecutive quarter. We grew 2015 full year revenues by 2% on an equivalent basis, and we are well positioned for 2016. Our gene-based and esoteric testing business grew by approximately 4 -- 5% to $1.8 billion for the year. We continue to see strong growth in our infectious disease testing and Prescription Drug Monitoring. Additionally, in late 2015, we launched 2 companion diagnostic solutions for non-small cell lung cancer. This week, we announced another complementary diagnostic test which is for melanoma. Quest expertise, scale and collaborations with the top organizations such as ACO and Bristol-Myers Squibb position us to provide companion and complementary diagnostic test services for immunotherapies on a scale other providers can't match. We are encouraged by the progress of our clinical franchise teams and expect to continue to build more momentum going forward. 
Second, over the past few years, we have outlined our strategy to partner more effectively with hospital systems. We've shared our view that hospitals will look to partner with us to develop and execute their lab strategy. In November, we announced the acquisition of Harford Health Care's outreach business. We have been working on detailed integration plans and now expect the relationship to close later in the first quarter of 2016. In December, we announced a professional lab services relationship with Barnabas Health, New Jersey's #1 health system. Under this relationship, we will manage inpatient laboratory tests services for 7 of their locations throughout New Jersey. We are currently working through the transition plans. We expect clinical testing volumes to be fully transitioned by midyear 2016. These are 2 strong proof points of our evolving market where hospitals are looking for a high-value, world-class partners. We continue to be encouraged by the robust pipeline of opportunities we have developed. In addition, we're building our portfolio of health information technology solutions. Our capabilities help payers, providers and patients to improve patient care, lower cost and manage populations. We're rolling out our new suite of solutions called Quantum internally to our sales force this week. A good example of Quantum Solution is our recent partnership with Inovalon to deliver real-time insights at the point of care, which we call data diagnostics. We launched the solution in December, are seeing strong interest and have already begun to sign business. We're very encouraged by the opportunity. You'll hear more about the data diagnostics and our Quantum Solution later this quarter at HIMS. 
The second element of our strategy is driving operational excellence. At our Investor Day in November 2014, we outlined our goal to increase our cumulative run rate savings to $1.3 billion by the end of 2017. To achieve that, we need to deliver an additional $600 million in run rate savings by the end of 2017, and we've made progress on our major adjustments of our program, which include building e-enabling services; standardizing our processes, data and systems; improving cash collections. We delivered over $200 million in realized savings in 2015. This enabled us to deliver 10% growth in pretax earnings for the year as we continue to move closer to our bigger goal of $1.3 billion. And we're doing all this as we improve our customer experience at the same time that we lower cost by removing waste from the system. We continue to simplify and strengthen our position, which is the third element of our strategy. During the year, we launched our new brand promise. We call it Action from Insight. Our brand promise is more than a refreshed logo. It's really about recommitting to a superior customer experience. We recently launched Everyday Excellence, a new initiative that focuses on our customers. We've already rolled it out to more than 1/3 of our workforce, but it's not just about our frontline employees. Everyday Excellence is for all of us, all of our employees, and it starts with me. We've also invested and trained almost 150 senior leaders at our leading Quest Academy. And we've deployed a Quest Management System to create a standard framework for running our business. Our 44,000 employees are key to our success. Actually, in a recent company-wide survey, we experienced a record rate of engagement from employees. And the results put us on par or above performance of high-performing companies in several key areas. There is a clear link between employee engagement and performance at the most successful companies. Our employees are providing us with valuable feedback, and we are listening. 
On a recent visit to our facilities in California, as with so many visits with our operations, I came away both impressed and grateful for our employees' passion and commitment to our customers. 
The fourth element of our strategy is to refocus on our diagnostic information services business. During the year, we contributed our clinical trials testing business into the newly formed joint venture with Quintiles called Q2 Solutions. The JV's performance is on track with our expectations, and we're excited to be part of this growing business. 
And then finally, we remain committed to the fifth element of our strategy, delivering disciplined capital deployment. In 2015, we returned over $400 million to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share buybacks. We returned 80% of our free cash flow to shareholders in 2015, well in excess of our commitment to return the majority of our free cash flow to our shareholders. During the quarter, we increased the company's share repurchase authorization by $500 million. And then earlier today, we announced a 5% increase in our quarterly dividend. This is our fifth dividend increase since 2011. 
Along with all this, we continue to invest in our business. We announced the Hartford Health Care acquisition in the quarter and closed 2 acquisitions earlier in 2015. These acquisitions are aligned to our objective of growing revenues for strategically aligned M&A. 
Now Mark will provide an overview on our fourth quarter financial performance and walk you through the details of our 2016 outlook, which considers several of the recently announced relationships I noted earlier. Mark?"

On a reported basis, reve",759,"Thanks, Steve. Starting with revenues, consolidated fourth quarter revenues of $1.85 billion increased 0.6% versus the prior year on an equivalent revenue basis, that is, excluding the fourth quarter 2014 clinical trials revenue. On a reported basis, revenues were lower by 1.8%. Revenues for diagnostic information services grew by 40 basis points versus a year ago. Volume, measured by the number of requisitions, grew by 30 basis points versus the prior year. Volume grew on an organic basis by 20 basis points. Revenue per requisition was 10 basis points better than the prior year. Reimbursement pressure was moderate in the quarter and for the year, which is consistent with what we shared at our Investor Day in 2014. Both test and business mix continued to have net positive impact, reflecting our strategy to grow our esoteric testing and drive profitable growth. 
Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $288 million or 15.5% of revenues compared to $283 million or 15% of revenues a year ago. The improvement of 50 basis points can be primarily attributed to efficiencies from our Invigorate program and business mix. 
For the quarter, adjusted earnings per share, excluding amortization, was $1.19 or 80 basis points better than a year ago. Fourth quarter 2015 reported income from continuing operations includes a net benefit of $31 million or $0.21 per share related to deferred income tax benefits recognized during the quarter, partially offset by charges primarily related to restructuring and integration costs. 
In the fourth quarter of 2014, reported income from continuing operations included a net benefit of $27 million or $0.18 per share from the favorable resolution of tax contingencies, offset by charges related primarily to restructuring and integration costs. 
Bad debt expense, as a percentage of revenues, was 3.5%, 30 basis points better than last year and 40 basis points better than last quarter. This is primarily due to a onetime bad debt benefit in the fourth quarter. It remains a challenging collection environment, and we remain focused on improving our operational activities. Our DSOs were 47 days, 1 day lower than the prior year and 3 days higher than last quarter. 
Reported cash provided by operations was $271 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $303 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Cash provided by operations was lower than a year ago, largely due to an additional payroll cycle this year. Excluding the net cash charges related to the recent debt refinancing, adjusted cash provided by operations was $899 million for the full year 2015. Capital expenditures were $94 million in the quarter compared to $89 million a year ago. Total capital expenditures in 2015 were $263 million. 
Before moving to guidance, I'll share a few comments to help you think about our outlook. First, a few of you recently asked about the 8% to 10% earnings CAGR shared at our Investor Day in 2014. Reflecting on 2015, we delivered 6% adjusted earnings, excluding amortization. Keep in mind that the compare in 2015 was negatively impacted by amortization and a discrete tax benefit in 2014. These 2 items reduced our reported earnings growth by about 2%, mostly because we beat our 2014 estimate by $0.05. Taking these items into consideration, we feel we are on track compared to our objectives outlined at Investor Day in 2014. Second, because of a newly formed Q2 Solutions JV, we no longer consolidate the clinical trials revenue. Our clinical trials business reported revenues of $85 million in the first half of 2015 that you should consider as you update your model. Finally, as you think about our revenue projections, we have been on a favorable trajectory, but one that has been building over time. We expect that we will continue to show improvement as we progress through the year. Specifically, you should consider the Barnabas Health opportunity that we'll phase in over the first half of the year and the recently announced Outreach acquisition, which we expect to be completed late in the first quarter. 
Moving to guidance. We now expect full year 2016 results before special items as follows: revenues are expected to be between $7.52 billion and $7.59 billion, an increase of 1.5% to 2.5% on an equivalent basis; for comparative purposes, equivalent revenues will exclude the 2015 revenues associated with our Clinical Trials business; adjusted diluted EPS, excluding amortization, to be between $5.02 and $5.17; cash provided by operations to approach $1 billion; and capital expenditures to be between $250 million to $300 million.

On the PLS piece itself, which is focused on taking some of the inpatient and outpatient in the hospital testing and partnering with them on that lab work, which previously was unaddressable revenue. So it's a new source of growth for us. Those margins are lower than our overall book of business because we have to share the value creation with our partner. Obviously, when we go in, it's a supply arrangement. And therefore, we have to save enough for us each to make a return.

So We made that loud and clear. And then second is the timing. We think the ability for us to get the final guidance out this year, for us to submit the data and then also for them to go through that data to refresh the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule by 2017 is a very, very tight time table, as you can imagine. So those are 2 big issues that we've highlighted. We're hopeful that we'll see something in the first half of 2016. They never commit to what the data is, but we're hopeful that we'll see something after they've digested everything we provided to them in the last part of last year. So that's where that stands. As far as the FDA, as I just mentioned, we continue to work with Congress on a legislative action. We believe that's the best approach for this issue. We believe it is a good start.

Obviously, we're going to provide guidance that we think is prudent and deliverable. We have provided a range. That range certainly includes some numbers that would put us into 8% to 10%. I want to refresh people's memory that the 8% to 10% was a compound annual growth rate over 3 years. So it was not a commitment to do that every single year. And also, in my prepared remarks, I reminded people that, at that point, we're obviously looking at a 2014 number that was $0.05 lower than we actually delivered in 2014. And I certainly did not anticipate a reduction in our amortization, which was really driven by the fact that we did not have as much significant M&A activity in 2015. So we feel, in terms of what we committed to that we're on track. We're not behind. Certainly, depending on where we end 2016 within that guidance, we'll either be a little bit slightly below the CAGR or right in the CAGR. So really, what we want to do is provide guidance that we feel is prudent and deliverable. And as we progress through the year, obviously, we'll see where we might end up within that range. But we certainly don't think the guidance implies, given the framing I shared on 2015, that we're materially off of that 8% to 10%."

So Bill, I talked about 3 levers that would enable us to grow earnings significantly faster than revenue. One of them was the synergies that would be continued to be delivered to their kind of steady state from acquisitions we had done early in 2014. So you would imagine that probably a lot of that has been delivered. The second piece has been our Invigorate and it being large enough to offset price and wage inflation and deliver some margin expansion. And then the third element is the leverage we get from organic growth. And so we committed to improving our relative performance. As Steve talked about, minus 4% in 2013 and minus 2% in 2014 and then some revenue growth in the last 5 quarters. And certainly, since there's not as much M&A in our guidance this year as there was in the 2% we got last year, which benefited from some carryover on Solstice, we're implying continued strength in our organic performance. And as you know, organic volume growth has a high drop-through. And as we get closer and closer to market rates, which we had committed, we would do through the 3-year time frame, that's going to also enable us to lever our P&L. So you should expect accelerating organic growth, which will be a driver, and then continued progress to get to the $1.3 billion of Invigorate, which will also accelerate our earnings leverage."

I'll start and I'm sure Mark will add something to it. First of all, we continue to build our own market model. In 2014, when we had our Investor Day, we ran our model with a number of assumptions, and we say that the independent laboratory market is going to grow about 2% to 3% in value. And 2% to 3% in value, as you know, a lot of moving parts. We also made some assumptions about the ACA impact. We've always assumed that as we have more insured lives in the United States that, that would be net positive for this industry and positive for us. But we all know that has been muted. The same question about what will happen in 2016 around some of those lives. And then also, we assume in that, our advancement of technology. We're continuing to roll out new innovation in the marketplace, which helps with the growth rate assumptions, and that was implied in 2% to 3%. The aging population. For instance, hepatitis C is a good opportunity for us, which we're thinking advantage of with baby boomers needing to get tested. So all of that is going to be 2% to 3%. And also what we're seeing, Amanda, is we refer to as density. We're seeing continued improvement in the amount of tests we're getting through requisitions. And so this might also be enhanced with the delays that we've seen since the Great Recession over the last, let's say, 8 to 9 years. But people, eventually when they show up to the physician, they have more need for more testing for that episode. So you put that all together, and that's why we feel that 2% to 3%, and that's not in any specific year, but in the longer-term view is a good gauge of the market. And we believe that utilization or volumes, on a ramp basis, would be slightly less than that, but on a test basis would be slightly greater than the racks because you're getting an increase in a number of tests per requisition. So that's what we have right now. As I said in 2016, we saw utilization being somewhat stable. Like you, we look at all the different indications of marketplace to get engaged what's happening on, going on within the marketplace. But so far, it's feeling as it comes out of this year, somewhat stable expectations for utilization at '16."

We did commit to getting back to market levels of revenue growth and also then gaining share at some point. But in that 3-year time frame through 2017, we probably was incumbent upon us to get back at the market for growth, and that's what we're certainly striving to do. I think as everyone recognizes, we talked about utilization in the market is really a bunch of submarkets. So one of the drivers certainly that decides the fact that we have outstanding offerings of the 5% growth in esoteric is that some of those markets are growing. Certainly, BRCA is a growing market. Noninvasive prenatal testing is a growing market. Hepatitis C is a growing market. And then you got things that we mentioned that it's not quite behind us, such as PAS, which is a declining market. Certainly, the impact of some of the safety scares on testosterone has impacted that market in terms of utilization over the last couple of years. So there's a bunch of markets moving somewhat different directions. And depending on each labs and certainly Quest's share in those markets, it's going to impact us all differently. So it will be really difficult, even if we are willing to give you, a volume number. That's why when we really feel better about is giving your revenue numbers. And certainly, if you just look at volume, you miss some of the positive mix aspects that you've seen come through in our results over the last year plus in terms of mix, higher mix of these esoteric offerings, higher mix of better customer pricing, being more disciplined in those ways. So that's what our focus is on as opposed to figuring out volume. We think the demographics. We talked about the positives, certainly the aging population, growing population. We certainly, despite some the recent negative news, such as 40% fewer enrollees in the exchanges, some of the slower growth that we've talked about over the last 18 months in terms of enrollment, you've seen major payers talk about some of the struggles with the exchanges. And despite all that, we still think the Affordable Act is adding patients with insurance. And that's a good thing for us. So we do feel positive about volumes and trends and certainly expect to get a fair share of it, but it would be very difficult to give you some sort of a steady-state volume organic growth projection going forward."

Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include, but are not limited to, those described in Quest Diagnostics' 2014 annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. 
Our earnings press release is available, and the text of our prepared remarks will be available later today in the Investor Relations Quarterly Update section of our website at www.questdiagnostics.com. A PowerPoint presentation and spreadsheet with our results and supplemental analysis are also available on the website. 
Now here's Steve Rusckowski."

This morning, I'll provide you with highlights of the quarter, share a few comments on the industry dynamics and review progress on our 5-point strategy. Then Mark will provide more detail on the results and take you through guidance. 
Well, we continue to make progress on our path forward, delivering a strong year and positioning ourselves very well for 2016. Before turning to the quarter, let me recap our performance for the year. Revenues grew by 2% on an equivalent basis, adjusted operating income as a percentage of revenues expanded by about 110 basis points, and adjusted EPS, excluding amortization, grew by 6%. 
During the fourth quarter, revenues were $1.85 billion, growing by 60 basis points on an equivalent basis. The adjusted EPS, excluding amortization was $1.19 and this represents our seventh consecutive quarter of year-on-year EPS growth. 
Before I get into our strategy update, I'd like to talk about our industry dynamics, starting with the recent CMS proposal related to the PAMA legislation, which, as you know, stands for Protecting Access to Medicare Act. As you have heard me say before, PAMA needs to be built on a representative view of the market. The current proposal limits the definition of an applicable lab to exclude a large portion of the market. We also believe that a 2017 effective date will be a significant challenge for all parties. With strong support from the American Hospital Association, American Medical Association and members of Congress, we remain optimistic that together, industry and government, can still achieve a reasonable outcome. Second, I would like to discuss the proposed FDA guidance on regulation of laboratory-developed test. We understand that the FDA's concerns, but we continue to believe what the FDA has proposed would result in labs being subject to both CLIA and FDA regulations that may be overlapping, duplicative and sometimes contradictory in their requirements. This has the potential to raise health care costs for patients and potentially hinder medical innovation. The House draft legislation is a good first step in the legislative process. We share ACLA's goals of promoting and supporting diagnostic innovations that provide physicians with the insights necessary to advance patient care and save lives. We want to work with Congress to get the right balance in legislation, right for the industry, right for physicians and right for patients, who depend upon our diagnostic insights to make informed health care decisions every day. 
Now let me shift to the progress we're making on our 5-point strategy, which is to restore growth, drive operational excellence, simplify the organization, refocus on our diagnostic information services business and deliver disciplined capital deployment. 
So starting with growth. Well, just 3 years ago, this business was shrinking by more than 4%. We slowed the organic decline to 2% in 2014 and have now grown organically on equivalent basis for the fifth consecutive quarter. We grew 2015 full year revenues by 2% on an equivalent basis, and we are well positioned for 2016. Our gene-based and esoteric testing business grew by approximately 4 -- 5% to $1.8 billion for the year. We continue to see strong growth in our infectious disease testing and Prescription Drug Monitoring. Additionally, in late 2015, we launched 2 companion Diagnostic Solutions for non-small cell lung cancer. This week, we announced another complementary diagnostic test which is now for melanoma. Quest expertise, scale and collaborations with the top organizations such as Dako and Bristol-Myers Squibb position us to provide companion and complementary diagnostic test services for immunotherapies on a scale other providers can't match. We are encouraged by the progress of our clinical franchise teams and expect to continue to build more momentum going forward. 
Second, over the past few years, we have outlined our strategy to partner more effectively with hospital systems. We've shared our view that hospitals will look to partner with us to develop and execute their lab strategy. In November, we announced the acquisition of Hartford HealthCare outreach business. We have been working on detailed integration plans and now expect the relationship to close later in the first quarter of 2016. In December, we announced a professional lab services relationship with Barnabas Health, New Jersey's #1 health system. Under this relationship, we will manage inpatient laboratory tests, services for 7 of their locations throughout New Jersey. We are currently working through the transition plans. We expect clinical testing volumes to be fully transitioned by midyear 2016. These are 2 strong proof points of our evolving market, where hospitals are looking for a high-value, world-class partners. We continue to be encouraged by the robust pipeline of opportunities we have developed. In addition, we are building our portfolio of health information technology solutions. Our capabilities help payers, providers and patients to improve patient care, lowering costs and manage populations. We're rolling out our new suite of solutions called Quantum internally to our sales force this week. A good example of Quantum Solution is our recent partnership with Inovalon to deliver real-time insights at the point of care, which we call data diagnostics. We launched the solution in December, are seeing strong interest and have already begun to sign business. We're very encouraged by the opportunity. You'll hear more about the data diagnostics and our Quantum Solution later this quarter at HIMSS. 
The second element of our strategy is driving operational excellence. At our Investor Day in November 2014, we outlined our goal to increase our cumulative run rate savings to $1.3 billion by the end of 2017. To achieve that, we need to deliver an additional $600 million in run rate savings by the end of 2017, and we've made progress on our major objectives of our program, which include building e-enabling services; standardizing our processes, data and systems; improving cash collections. We delivered over $200 million in realized savings in 2015. This enabled us to deliver 10% growth in pretax earnings for the year as we continue to move closer to our bigger goal of $1.3 billion. And we're doing all this as we improve our customer experience at the same time that we lower costs by removing waste from the system. We continue to simplify and strengthen our organization, which is the third element of our strategy. During the year, we launched our new brand promise. We call it Action from Insight. Our brand promise is more than a refreshed logo. It's really about recommitting to a superior customer experience. We recently launched Everyday Excellence, a new initiative that focuses on our customers. We've already rolled it out to more than 1/3 of our workforce, but it's not just about our frontline employees. Everyday Excellence is for all of us, all of our employees, and it starts with me. We've also invested and trained over 150 senior leaders at our leading Quest Academy. And we've deployed our Quest Management System to create a standard framework for running our business. Our 44,000 employees are key to our success. Actually, in a recent company-wide survey, we experienced a record rate of engagement from employees. And the results put us on par or above performance of high-performing companies in several key areas. There is a clear link between employee engagement and performance at the most successful companies. Our employees are providing us with valuable feedback, and we are listening. 
On a recent visit to our facilities in California, as with so many visits with our operations, I came away both impressed and grateful for our employees' passion and commitment to our customers. 
The fourth element of our strategy is to refocus on our diagnostic information services business. During the year, we contributed our clinical trials testing business into the newly formed joint venture with Quintiles called Q2 Solutions. The JV's performance is on track with our expectations, and we're excited to be part of this growing business. 
And then finally, we remain committed to the fifth element of our strategy, delivering disciplined capital deployment. In 2015, we returned over $400 million to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share buybacks. We returned 80% of our free cash flow to shareholders in 2015, well in excess of our commitment to return the majority of our free cash flow to our shareholders. During the quarter, we increased the company's share repurchase authorization by $500 million. And then earlier today, we announced a 5% increase in our quarterly dividend. This is our fifth dividend increase since 2011. 
Along with all this, we continue to invest in our business. We announced the Hartford HealthCare outreach acquisition in the quarter and closed 2 acquisitions earlier in 2015. These acquisitions are aligned to our objective of growing revenues for strategically-aligned M&A. 
Now Mark will provide an overview on our fourth quarter financial performance and walk you through the details of our 2016 outlook, which considers several of the recently-announced relationships I noted earlier. Mark?"

On a reported basis, reven",759,"Thanks, Steve. Starting with revenues, consolidated fourth quarter revenues of $1.85 billion increased 0.6% versus the prior year on an equivalent revenue basis that is, excluding the fourth quarter 2014 Clinical Trials revenue. On a reported basis, revenues were lower by 1.8%. Revenues for diagnostic information services grew by 40 basis points versus a year ago. Volume, measured by the number of requisitions, grew by 30 basis points versus the prior year. Volume grew on an organic basis by 20 basis points. Revenue per requisition was 10 basis points better than the prior year. Reimbursement pressure was moderate in the quarter and for the year, which is consistent with what we shared at our Investor Day in 2014. Both test and business mix continued to have net positive impact, reflecting our strategy to grow our esoteric testing and drive profitable growth. 
Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $288 million or 15.5% of revenues compared to $283 million or 15% of revenues a year ago. The improvement of 50 basis points can be primarily attributed to efficiencies from our Invigorate program and business mix. 
For the quarter, adjusted earnings per share, excluding amortization, was $1.19 or 80 basis points better than a year ago. Fourth quarter 2015 reported income from continuing operations includes a net benefit of $31 million or $0.21 per share related to deferred income tax benefits recognized during the quarter, partially offset by charges primarily related to restructuring and integration costs. 
In the fourth quarter of 2014, reported income from continuing operations included a net benefit of $27 million or $0.18 per share from the favorable resolution of tax contingencies, offset by charges related primarily to restructuring and integration costs. 
Bad debt expense, as a percentage of revenues, was 3.5%, 30 basis points better than last year and 40 basis points better than last quarter. This is primarily due to a onetime bad debt benefit in the fourth quarter. It remains a challenging collection environment, and we remain focused on improving our operational activities. Our DSOs were 47 days, 1 day lower than the prior year and 3 days higher than last quarter. 
Reported cash provided by operations was $271 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $303 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Cash provided by operations was lower than a year ago, largely due to an additional payroll cycle this year. Excluding the net cash charges related to the recent debt refinancing, adjusted cash provided by operations was $899 million for the full year 2015. Capital expenditures were $94 million in the quarter compared to $89 million a year ago. Total capital expenditures in 2015 were $263 million. 
Before moving to guidance, I'll share a few comments to help you think about our outlook. First, a few of you recently asked about the 8% to 10% earnings CAGR shared at our Investor Day in 2014. Reflecting on 2015, we delivered 6% adjusted earnings, excluding amortization. Keep in mind that the compare in 2015 was negatively impacted by amortization and a discrete tax benefit in 2014. These 2 items reduced our reported earnings growth by about 2%, mostly because we beat our 2014 estimate by $0.05. Taking these items into consideration, we feel we are on track compared to our objectives outlined at Investor Day in 2014. Second, because of the newly formed Q2 Solutions JV, we no longer consolidate the Clinical Trials revenue. Our Clinical Trials business reported revenues of $85 million in the first half of 2015 that you should consider as you update your model. Finally, as you think about our revenue projections, we have been on a favorable trajectory, but one that has been building over time. We expect that we will continue to show improvement as we progress through the year. Specifically, you should consider the Barnabas Health opportunity that will phase in over the first half of the year and the recently announced Outreach acquisition, which we expect to be completed late in the first quarter. 
Moving to guidance. We now expect full year 2016 results, before special items, as follows: revenues are expected to be between $7.52 billion and $7.59 billion, an increase of 1.5% to 2.5% on an equivalent basis; for comparative purposes, equivalent revenues will exclude the 2015 revenues associated with our Clinical Trials business; adjusted diluted EPS, excluding amortization, to be between $5.02 and $5.17; cash provided by operations to approach $1 billion; and capital expenditures to be between $250 million to $300 million. 
Now let me turn it back to Steve."

Hospitals are looking for partners like us to help them with their lab strategy. A piece of this is helping them run their hospital business, but also think about how we can partner with them. The more sophisticated testing than what we refer to as reference work. So then when we engage with clients or customers like Barnabas, we expect that we're going to start working with them, and we're going to start to continue to build their book of business with us. As far as margins, what we'll say is this is we're driving growth in this company, and we're driving better ROIC. And included in our guidance around growth and included in our guidance around earnings growth, we do expect that our build of our professional lab services business will be accretive to our plan going forward."

On the PLS piece itself, which is focused on taking some of the inpatient and outpatient in the hospital testing and partnering with them on that lab work, which previously was unaddressable revenue. So it's a new source of growth for us. Those margins are lower than our overall book of business because we have to share the value creation with our partner. Obviously, when we go in, it's a supply arrangement. And therefore, we have to save enough for us each to make a return. However, as Steve also pointed out, since there's really no significant capital outlay at that point, the ROIC is very attractive.

And then mix, obviously, we didn't get to that specifically, but we wouldn't expect a materially different trend than what you saw for 2015. So we continue to grow our esoteric business. So we mentioned 5% growth in Q4. We continue to focus on our most profitable business opportunities. We have cleaned up our portfolio. We're certainly seeing some of that benefit in terms of our customers and as we engage with new customers, we're very focused on making sure that we get the value that we deliver through our pricing.

So we are working. We think the legislative action is the best action for us, and that will be much better than the current guidance that we've seen so far from the FDA."

So we've been engaged with CMS on this all last year, once we received their draft document. Two things, as I said in my introductory comments, we believe they did not get it right as far as the applicable labs, and these do include hospitals. We've been quite clear on that, and we've got a lot support now from the American Medical Association, the American Hospital Association and Congress to help us with that. So we made that loud and clear. And then second is the timing. We think the ability for us to get the final guidance out this year, for us to submit the data and then also for them to go through that data to refresh the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule by 2017 is a very, very tight time table, as you can imagine. So those are the 2 big issues that we've highlighted. We are hopeful that we'll see something in the first half of 2016. They never commit to what the date is, but we're hopeful that we'll see something after they've digested everything we provided to them in the last part of last year. So that's where that stands. As far as the FDA, as I just mentioned, we continue to work with Congress on a legislative action. We believe that's the best approach for this issue. We believe it is a good start. And again, as a trade association, we believe they do not have the statutory authority. The FDA does not have statutory authority to regulate laboratories. So we're going to work this in due course. We're hopeful that we can come up with something with the Congress. And we'll see where that leads us.

Obviously, we're going to provide guidance that we think is prudent and deliverable. We have provided a range. That range certainly includes some numbers that would put us into the 8% to 10%. I want to refresh people's memory that the 8% to 10% was a compound annual growth rate over 3 years. So it was not a commitment to do that every single year. And also, in my prepared remarks, I reminded people that, at that point, we're obviously looking at a 2014 number that was $0.05 lower than we actually delivered in 2014. And I certainly did not anticipate a reduction in our amortization, which was really driven by the fact that we did not have as much significant M&A activity in 2015. So we feel, in terms of what we committed to that we're on track. We're not behind. Certainly, depending on where we end 2016 within that guidance, we'll either be a little bit slightly below the CAGR or right in the CAGR. So really, what we want to do is provide guidance that we feel is prudent and deliverable. And as we progress through the year, obviously, we'll see where we might end up within that range. But we certainly don't think the guidance implies, given the framing I shared on 2015, that we're materially off of that 8% to 10%."

So Bill, I talked about 3 levers that would enable us to grow earnings significantly faster than revenue.

So Bill, I talked about 3 levers that would enable us to grow earnings significantly faster than revenue. One of them was the synergies that would be continued to be delivered to their kind of steady state from acquisitions we had done early in 2014. So you would imagine that probably a lot of that has been delivered. The second piece has been our Invigorate and it being large enough to offset price and wage inflation and deliver some margin expansion. And then the third element is the leverage we get from organic growth. And so we committed to improving our relative performance. As Steve talked about, minus 4% in 2013 and minus 2% in 2014 and then with some revenue growth in the last 5 quarters. And certainly, since there's not as much M&A in our guidance this year as there was in the 2% we got last year, which benefited from some carryover on Solstas, we're implying continued strengthening of our organic performance. And as you know, organic volume growth has a high drop-through. And as we get closer and closer to market rates, which we had committed, we would do through the 3-year time frame, that's going to also enable us to lever our P&L. So you should expect accelerating organic growth, which will be a driver, and then continued progress to get to the $1.3 billion of Invigorate, which will also accelerate our earnings leverage."

I'll start in and then I'm sure Mark will add something to it. First of all, we continue to build our own market model. In 2014, when we had our Investor Day, we ran our model with a number of assumptions, and we say that the independent laboratory market is going to grow about 2% to 3% in value. And 2% to 3% in value, as you know, a lot of moving parts. We also made some assumptions about the ACA impact. We've always assumed that as we have more insured lives in the United States that, that would be net positive for this industry, net positive for us. But we all know that has been muted. There's some question about what will happen in 2016 around some of those lives. And then also, we assume in that, our advancement of technology. We're continuing to rollout new innovation in the marketplace, which helps with the growth rate assumptions, and that was implied in 2% to 3%. The aging population. For instance, hepatitis C is a good opportunity for us, which we're taking advantage of with the baby boomers need to get tested, so all of that is the 2% to 3%. And also what we're seeing, Amanda, is we refer to as density. We're seeing a continued improvement in the amount of tests we're getting through requisitions. And some of this also might be enhanced with the delays that we've seen since the Great Recession over the last, let's say, 8 to 9 years. But people, eventually when they show up to the physician, they have more need for more testing for that episode. So you put that all together, and that's why we feel that 2% to 3%, and that's not in any specific year, but in the -- the longer-term view is a good gauge of the market. And we believe that utilization or volumes, on a rent basis, would be slightly less than that, but on a test basis would be slightly greater than the racks because you're getting an increase in the number of tests per requisition. So that's what we have right now. As I said in 2016, we saw utilization being somewhat stable. Like you, we look at all the different indications in the marketplace to get engage what's happening on, going on within the marketplace. But so far, it's feeling -- as it come out of this year, somewhat stable expectations for utilization in '16."

What we did commit to was getting back to market levels of revenue growth and also then gaining share at some point. But in the 3-year time frame through 2017, we probably was incumbent upon us to get back to market level growth, and that's what we're certainly striving to do. I think as everyone recognizes, we talk about utilization in a market that's really a bunch of submarkets. So one of the drivers certainly besides the fact that we have outstanding offerings of the 5% growth in esoteric is that some of those markets are growing. Certainly, BRCA is a growing market. Noninvasive prenatal testing is a growing market. Hepatitis C is a growing market. And then you've got things that we mentioned and it's not quite behind us, such as paps, which is a declining market. Certainly, the impact of some of the safety scares on testosterone has impacted that market in terms of utilization over the last couple of years. So there's really a bunch of markets moving in somewhat different directions. And depending on each labs and certainly Quest's share in those markets, it's going to impact us all differently. So it will be really difficult, even if we are willing to give you a volume number. That's why what we really feel better about is giving revenue numbers. And certainly, if you just look at volume, you miss some of the positive mix aspects that you've seen come through in our results over the last year plus in terms of mix, higher mix of these esoteric offerings, higher mix of better customer pricing, being more disciplined in those ways. So that's what our focus is on as opposed to figuring out volume. We think the demographics. We talked about the positives, some of the aging population, growing population. We certainly, despite some of the recent negative news, such as 40% fewer enrollees in the exchanges, some of the slower growth that we've talked about over the last 18 months in terms of enrollment, you've seen major payers talk about some of the struggles with the exchanges. And despite all that, we still think the Affordable Care Act is adding patients with insurance, and that's a good thing for us. So we do feel positive about volumes and trends, and certainly expect to get our fair share of it, but it would be very difficult to give you some sort of a steady-state volume organic growth projection going forward."

If you look at critical care and hospitals, if you're going to go into a critical care unit with blood gas testing, and that's sort of an example of good point-of-care testing value proposition. And then finally, emergency medicine, if you look at cardiac enzymes and the value of having those cardiac enzymes sooner when the patient is being transferred to the emergency room has a good value proposition. But in other areas where it's not quite clear, where it's not quite compelling, those promises have not really delivered -- been delivered. With all that said, we're the world's largest diagnostic information services company. We're always looking at ways we can improve our cost structure. We buy from all the in-vitro diagnostic companies.

Revenues grew by 2% on an equivalent basis, adjusted operating income as a percentage of revenues expanded by about 110 basis points, and adjusted EPS, excluding amortization, grew by 6%. 
During the fourth quarter, revenues were $1.85 billion, growing by 60 basis points on an equivalent basis. The adjusted EPS, excluding amortization was $1.19 and this represents our seventh consecutive quarter of year-on-year EPS growth. 
Before I get into our strategy update, I'd like to talk about our industry dynamics, starting with the recent CMS proposal related to the PAMA legislation, which, as you know, stands for Protecting Access to Medicare Act. As you have heard me say before, PAMA needs to be built on a representative view of the market. The current proposal limits the definition of an applicable lab to exclude a large portion of the market. We also believe that a 2017 effective date will be a significant challenge for all parties. With strong support from the American Hospital Association, American Medical Association and members of Congress, we remain optimistic that together, industry and government, can still achieve a reasonable outcome. Second, I would like to discuss the proposed FDA guidance on regulation of laboratory-developed test. We understand that the FDA's concerns, but we continue to believe what the FDA has proposed would result in labs being subject to both CLIA and FDA regulations that may be overlapping, duplicative and sometimes contradictory in their requirements. This has the potential to raise health care costs for patients and potentially hinder medical innovation. The House draft legislation is a good first step in the legislative process. We share ACLA's goals of promoting and supporting diagnostic innovations that provide physicians with the insights necessary to advance patient care and save lives. We want to work with Congress to get the right balance in legislation, right for the industry, right for physicians and right for patients, who depend upon our diagnostic insights to make informed health care decisions every day. 
Now let me shift to the progress we're making on our 5-point strategy, which is to restore growth, drive operational excellence, simplify the organization, refocus on our diagnostic information services business and deliver disciplined capital deployment. 
So starting with growth. Well, just 3 years ago, this business was shrinking by more than 4%. We slowed the organic decline to 2% in 2014 and have now grown organically on equivalent basis for the fifth consecutive quarter. We grew 2015 full year revenues by 2% on an equivalent basis, and we are well positioned for 2016. Our gene-based and esoteric testing business grew by approximately 4 -- 5% to $1.8 billion for the year. We continue to see strong growth in our infectious disease testing and Prescription Drug Monitoring. Additionally, in late 2015, we launched 2 companion Diagnostic Solutions for non-small cell lung cancer. This week, we announced another complementary diagnostic test which came out for melanoma. Quest expertise, scale and collaborations with the top organizations such as Dako and Bristol-Myers Squibb position us to provide companion and complementary diagnostic test services for immunotherapies on a scale other providers can't match. We are encouraged by the progress of our clinical franchise teams and expect to continue to build more momentum going forward. 
Second, over the past few years, we have outlined our strategy to partner more effectively with hospital systems. We've shared our view that hospitals will look to partner with us to develop and execute their lab strategy. In November, we announced the acquisition of Hartford HealthCare's outreach business. We have been working on detailed integration plans and now expect the relationship to close later in the first quarter of 2016. In December, we announced a professional lab services relationship with Barnabas Health, New Jersey's #1 health system. Under this relationship, we will manage inpatient laboratory tests services for 7 of their locations throughout New Jersey. We are currently working through the transition plans. We expect clinical testing volumes to be fully transitioned by midyear 2016. These are 2 strong proof points of our evolving market, where hospitals are looking for a high-value, world-class partners. We continue to be encouraged by the robust pipeline of opportunities we have developed. In addition, we are building our portfolio of health information technology solutions. Our capabilities help payers, providers and patients to improve patient care, lowering costs and manage populations. We're rolling out our new suite of solutions called Quantum internally to our sales force this week. A good example of Quantum Solution is our recent partnership with Inovalon to deliver real-time insights at the point of care, which we call data diagnostics. We launched the solution in December, are seeing strong interest and have already begun to sign business. We're very encouraged by the opportunity. You'll hear more about the data diagnostics and our Quantum Solution later this quarter at HIMSS. 
The second element of our strategy is driving operational excellence. At our Investor Day in November 2014, we outlined our goal to increase our cumulative run rate savings to $1.3 billion by the end of 2017. To achieve that, we need to deliver an additional $600 million in run rate savings by the end of 2017, and we've made progress on our major objectives of our program, which include building e-enabling services; standardizing our processes, data and systems; improving cash collections. We delivered over $200 million in realized savings in 2015. This enabled us to deliver 10% growth in pretax earnings for the year as we continue to move closer to our bigger end goal of $1.3 billion. And we're doing all this as we improve our customer experience at the same time that we lower costs by removing waste from the system. We continue to simplify and strengthen our organization, which is the third element of our strategy. During the year, we launched our new brand promise. We call it Action from Insight. Our brand promise is more than a refreshed logo. It's really about recommitting to a superior customer experience. We recently launched Everyday Excellence, a new initiative that focuses on our customers. We've already rolled it out to more than 1/3 of our workforce, but it's not just about our frontline employees. Everyday Excellence is for all of us, all of our employees, and it starts with me. We've also invested and trained over 150 senior leaders at our leading Quest Academy. And we've deployed our Quest Management System to create a standard framework for running our business. Our 44,000 employees are key to our success. Actually, in a recent company-wide survey, we experienced a record rate of engagement from employees. And the results put us on par or above performance of high-performing companies in several key areas. There is a clear link between employee engagement and performance at the most successful companies. Our employees are providing us with valuable feedback, and we are listening. 
On a recent visit to our facilities in California, as with so many visits with our operations, I came away both impressed and grateful for our employees' passion and commitment to our customers. 
The fourth element of our strategy is to refocus on our diagnostic information services business. During the year, we contributed our clinical trials testing business into the newly formed joint venture with Quintiles called Q2 Solutions. The JV's performance is on track with our expectations, and we're excited to be part of this growing business. 
And then finally, we remain committed to the fifth element of our strategy, delivering disciplined capital deployment. In 2015, we returned over $400 million to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share buybacks. We returned 80% of our free cash flow to shareholders in 2015, well in excess of our commitment to return the majority of our free cash flow to our shareholders. During the quarter, we increased the company's share repurchase authorization by $500 million. And then earlier today, we announced a 5% increase in our quarterly dividend. This is our fifth dividend increase since 2011. 
Along with all this, we continue to invest in our business. We announced the Hartford HealthCare outreach acquisition in the quarter and closed 2 acquisitions earlier in 2015. These acquisitions are aligned to our objective of growing revenues for strategically-aligned M&A. 
Now Mark will provide an overview on our fourth quarter financial performance and walk you through the details of our 2016 outlook, which considers several of the recently-announced relationships I noted earlier. Mark?"

On a reported basis, reven",759,"Thanks, Steve. Starting with revenues, consolidated fourth quarter revenues of $1.85 billion increased 0.6% versus the prior year on an equivalent revenue basis that is, excluding the fourth quarter 2014 Clinical Trials revenue. On a reported basis, revenues were lower by 1.8%. Revenues for diagnostic information services grew by 40 basis points versus a year ago. Volume, measured by the number of requisitions, grew by 30 basis points versus the prior year. Volume grew on an organic basis by 20 basis points. Revenue per requisition was 10 basis points better than the prior year. Reimbursement pressure was moderate in the quarter and for the year, which is consistent with what we shared at our Investor Day in 2014. Both test and business mix continued to have net positive impact, reflecting our strategy to grow our esoteric testing and drive profitable growth. 
Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $288 million or 15.5% of revenues compared to $283 million or 15% of revenues a year ago. The improvement of 50 basis points can be primarily attributed to efficiencies from our Invigorate program and business mix. 
For the quarter, adjusted earnings per share, excluding amortization, was $1.19 or 80 basis points better than a year ago. Fourth quarter 2015 reported income from continuing operations includes a net benefit of $31 million or $0.21 per share related to deferred income tax benefits recognized during the quarter, partially offset by charges primarily related to restructuring and integration costs. 
In the fourth quarter of 2014, reported income from continuing operations included a net benefit of $27 million or $0.18 per share from the favorable resolution of tax contingencies, offset by charges related primarily to restructuring and integration costs. 
Bad debt expense, as a percentage of revenues, was 3.5%, 30 basis points better than last year and 40 basis points better than last quarter. This is primarily due to a onetime bad debt benefit in the fourth quarter. It remains a challenging collection environment, and we remain focused on improving our operational activities. Our DSOs were 47 days, 1 day lower than the prior year and 3 days higher than last quarter. 
Reported cash provided by operations was $271 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $303 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Cash provided by operations was lower than a year ago, largely due to an additional payroll cycle this year. Excluding the net cash charges related to the recent debt refinancing, adjusted cash provided by operations was $899 million for the full year 2015. Capital expenditures were $94 million in the quarter compared to $89 million a year ago. Total capital expenditures in 2015 were $263 million. 
Before moving to guidance, I'll share a few comments to help you think about our outlook. First, a few of you recently asked about the 8% to 10% earnings CAGR shared at our Investor Day in 2014. Reflecting on 2015, we delivered 6% adjusted earnings, excluding amortization. Keep in mind that the compare in 2015 was negatively impacted by amortization and a discrete tax benefit in 2014. These 2 items reduced our reported earnings growth by about 2%, mostly because we beat our 2014 estimate by $0.05. Taking these items into consideration, we feel we are on track compared to our objectives outlined at Investor Day in 2014. Second, because of the newly formed Q2 Solutions JV, we no longer consolidate the Clinical Trials revenue. Our Clinical Trials business reported revenues of $85 million in the first half of 2015 that you should consider as you update your model. Finally, as you think about our revenue projections, we have been on a favorable trajectory, but one that has been building over time. We expect that we will continue to show improvement as we progress through the year. Specifically, you should consider the Barnabas Health opportunities that will phase in over the first half of the year and the recently announced Outreach acquisition, which we expect to be completed late in the first quarter. 
Moving to guidance. We now expect full year 2016 results, before special items, as follows: revenues are expected to be between $7.52 billion and $7.59 billion, an increase of 1.5% to 2.5% on an equivalent basis; for comparative purposes, equivalent revenues will exclude the 2015 revenues associated with our Clinical Trials business; adjusted diluted EPS, excluding amortization, to be between $5.02 and $5.17; cash provided by operations to approach $1 billion; and capital expenditures to be between $250 million to $300 million. 
Now let me turn it back to Steve."

Hospitals are looking for partners like us to help them with their lab strategy. A piece of this is helping them run their hospital business, but also think about how we can partner with them. They're more sophisticated testing. They're what we refer to as reference work. So then when we engage with clients or customers like Barnabas, we expect that we're going to start working with them, and we're going to start to continue to build their book of business with us. As far as margins, what we'll say is this is: we're driving growth in this company, and we're driving better ROIC. And included in our guidance around growth and included in our guidance around earnings growth, we do expect that our build of our professional lab services business will be accretive to our plan going forward."

I have shared in the past, these professional laboratory services agreement come with a couple of different components, as Steve just laid out. Certainly, the reference piece of those margins will be similar to our other reference business relationships. And then some of these cases, there's partnership involving Outreach as well. On the PLS piece itself, which is focused on taking some of the inpatient and outpatient in the hospital testing and partnering with them on that lab work, which previously was unaddressable revenue. So it's a new source of growth for us. Those margins are lower than our overall book of business because we have to share the value creation with our partner. Obviously, when we go in, it's a supply arrangement. And therefore, we have to save enough for us each to make a return. However, as Steve also pointed out, since there's really no significant capital outlay at that point, the ROIC is very attractive. And also I want to emphasize it's a somewhat previously unaddressable revenue. So a new source of growth."

And then mix, obviously, we didn't get to that specifically, but we wouldn't expect a materially different trend than what you saw for 2015. So we continue to grow our esoteric business. So we mentioned 5% growth in Q4. We continue to focus on our most profitable business opportunities. We have cleaned up our portfolio. We're certainly seeing some of that benefit in terms of our customers and as we engage with new customers, we're very focused on making sure that we get the value that we deliver through our pricing.

So we are working. We think the legislative action is the best action for us, and that will be much better than the current guidance that we've seen so far from the FDA."

So we've been engaged with CMS on this all last year, once we received their draft document. Two things, as I said in my introductory comments, we believe they did not get it right as far as the applicable labs. It needs to include hospitals. We've been quite clear on that, and we've got a lot support now from the American Medical Association, the American Hospital Association and Congress to help us with that. So we made that loud and clear. And then second is the timing. We think the ability for us to get the final guidance out this year, for us to submit the data and then also for them to go through that data to refresh the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule by 2017 is a very, very tight time table, as you can imagine. So those are the 2 big issues that we've highlighted. We are hopeful that we'll see something in the first half of 2016. They never commit to what the date is, but we're hopeful that we'll see something after they've digested everything we provided to them in the last part of last year. So that's where that stands. As far as the FDA, as I just mentioned, we continue to work with Congress on a legislative action. We believe that's the best approach for this issue. We believe it is a good start. And again, as a trade association, we believe they do not have the statutory authority. The FDA does not have statutory authority to regulate laboratories. So we're going to work this in due course. We're hopeful that we can come up with something with the Congress. And we'll see where that leads us.

And so we're training our sales force there, and we have over 1,200 people in our sales organization. And this is complementary to what Inovalon already does and calling on the health insurance organizations as well."

So Mark, you talked about that you felt you -- after puts and takes and adjustments, you were pretty much in line with your long-term guidance range for what you delivered in 2015. If I look at the 2016, the EPS guidance at the middle of the range it's sort of 7%, which I think is still below your long-term EPS guidance range. So I'm just trying to kind of reconcile why that would be and when you might expect to be in that 8% to 10% range? And then I have a follow-up."

Obviously, we're going to provide guidance that we think is prudent and deliverable. We have provided a range. That range certainly includes some numbers that would put us into the 8% to 10%. I want to refresh people's memory that the 8% to 10% was a compound annual growth rate over 3 years. So it was not a commitment to do that every single year. And also, in my prepared remarks, I reminded people that, at that point, we're obviously looking at a 2014 number that was $0.05 lower than we actually delivered in 2014. And I certainly did not anticipate a reduction in our amortization, which was really driven by the fact that we did not have as much significant M&A activity in 2015. So we feel, in terms of what we committed to that we're on track. We're not behind. Certainly, depending on where we end 2016 within that guidance, we'll either be a little bit slightly below the CAGR or right in the CAGR. So really, what we want to do is provide guidance that we feel is prudent and deliverable. And as we progress through the year, obviously, we'll see where we might end up within that range. But we certainly don't think the guidance implies, given the framing I shared on 2015, that we're materially off of that 8% to 10%."

So Bill, I talked about 3 levers that would enable us to grow earnings significantly faster than revenue. One of them was the synergies that would be continued to be delivered to their kind of steady state from acquisitions we had done early in 2014. So you would imagine that probably a lot of that has been delivered. The second piece has been our Invigorate and it being large enough to offset price, end wage inflation and deliver some margin expansion. And then the third element is the leverage we get from organic growth. And so we committed to improving our relative performance. As Steve talked about, minus 4% in 2013 and minus 2% in 2014 and then with some revenue growth in the last 5 quarters. And certainly, since there's not as much M&A in our guidance this year as there was in the 2% we got last year, which benefited from some carryover on Solstas, we're implying continued strengthening of our organic performance. And as you know, organic volume growth has a high drop-through. And as we get closer and closer to market rates, which we had committed, we would do through the 3-year time frame, that's going to also enable us to lever our P&L. So you should expect accelerating organic growth, which will be a driver, and then continued progress to get to the $1.3 billion of Invigorate, which will also accelerate our earnings leverage."

I'll start and then I'm sure Mark will add something to it. First of all, we continued to build our own market model. In 2014, when we had our Investor Day, we ran our model with a number of assumptions, and we say that the independent laboratory market is going to grow about 2% to 3% in value. And 2% to 3% in value, as you know, a lot of moving parts. We also made some assumptions about the ACA impact. We've always assumed that as we have more insured lives in the United States that, that would be net positive for this industry, net positive for us. But we all know that has been muted. There's some question about what will happen in 2016 around some of those lives. And then also, we assume in that, our advancement of technology. We're continuing to rollout new innovation in the marketplace, which helps with the growth rate assumptions, and that was implied in 2% to 3%. The aging population. For instance, hepatitis C is a good opportunity for us, which we're taking advantage of with the baby boomers need to get tested, so all of that is in the 2% to 3%. And also what we're seeing, Amanda, is we refer to as density. We're seeing a continued improvement in the amount of tests we're getting through our requisitions. And some of this also might be enhanced with the delays that we've seen since the Great Recession over the last, let's say, 8 to 9 years, that people, eventually when they show up to the physician, have more need for more testing per that episode. So you put that all together, and that's why we feel that 2% to 3%, and that's not in any specific year, but in the -- the longer-term view is a good gauge of the market. And we believe that utilization or volumes, on a req basis, would be slightly less than that, but on a test basis would be slightly greater than the req because you're getting an increase in the number of tests per requisition. So that's what we have right now. As I said in 2016, we saw utilization being somewhat stable. Like you, we look at all the different indications in the marketplace to get a gauge of what's happening on, going on within the marketplace. But so far, it's feeling, as we come out of this year, somewhat stable expectations for utilization in '16."

What we did commit to was getting back to market levels of revenue growth and also then gaining share at some point. But in the 3-year time frame through 2017, we felt it was incumbent upon us to get back to market level growth, and that's what we're certainly striving to do. I think as everyone recognizes, we talk about utilization in a market that's really a bunch of submarkets. So one of the drivers certainly besides the fact that we have outstanding offerings of the 5% growth in esoteric is that some of those markets are growing. Certainly, BRCA is a growing market. Noninvasive prenatal testing is a growing market. Hepatitis C is a growing market. And then you've got things that we mentioned and it's not quite behind us, such as paps, which is a declining market. Certainly, the impact of some of the safety scares on testosterone has impacted that market in terms of utilization over the last couple of years. So there's really a bunch of markets moving in somewhat different directions. And depending on each labs and certainly Quest's share in those markets, it's going to impact us all differently. So it will be really difficult, even if we are willing to give you a volume number. That's why what we really feel better about is giving revenue numbers. And certainly, if you just look at volume, you miss some of the positive mix aspects that you've seen come through in our results over the last year plus in terms of mix, higher mix of these esoteric offerings, higher mix of better customer pricing, being more disciplined in those ways. So that's what our focus is on as opposed to figuring out volume. We think the demographics we talked about are positives, certainly the aging population, growing population. We certainly, despite some of the recent negative news, such as 40% fewer enrollees in the exchanges, some of the slower growth that we've talked about over the last 18 months in terms of enrollment, you've seen a major payer who's talk about some of the struggles with the exchanges. And despite all that, we still think the Affordable Care Act is adding patients with insurance, and that's a good thing for us. So we do feel positive about volumes and trends, and certainly expect to get our fair share of it, but it would be very difficult to give you some sort of a steady-state volume organic growth projection going forward."

Keep in mind, we talked about revenue a lot because what shows up as volume versus growth in our esoteric business sometimes falls into the mix category. So revenue per requisition, this year, we saw some pressure but we were able to offset that for the last several quarters, more than offset that with favorable test mix that's coming through the gene-based and esoteric.

So chronic disease management, diabetes, that's done well. If you look at critical care and hospitals, if you're going to go into a critical care unit with blood gas testing, and that's sort of an example of good point-of-care testing value proposition. And then finally, emergency medicine, if you look at cardiac enzymes and the value of having those cardiac enzymes sooner when the patient is being transferred to the emergency room has a good value proposition. But in other areas where it's not quite clear, where it's not quite compelling, those promises have not really delivered -- been delivered. With all that said, we're the world's largest diagnostic information services company. We're always looking at ways we can improve our cost structure. We buy from all the in-vitro diagnostic companies.

This morning, I'll provide you with highlights of the quarter, share a few comments on the industry dynamics and review progress on our 5-point strategy. Then Mark will provide more detail on the results and take you through guidance. 
Well, we continue to make progress on our path forward, delivering a strong year and positioning ourselves very well for 2016. Before turning to the quarter, let me recap our performance for the year. Revenues grew by 2% on an equivalent basis, adjusted operating income as a percentage of revenues expanded by about 110 basis points, and adjusted EPS, excluding amortization, grew by 6%. 
During the fourth quarter, revenues were $1.85 billion, growing by 60 basis points on an equivalent basis. The adjusted EPS, excluding amortization was $1.19 and this represents our seventh consecutive quarter of year-on-year EPS growth. 
Before I get into our strategy update, I'd like to talk about our industry dynamics, starting with the recent CMS proposal related to the PAMA legislation, which, as you know, stands for Protecting Access to Medicare Act. As you have heard me say before, PAMA needs to be built on a representative view of the market. The current proposal limits the definition of an applicable lab to exclude a large portion of the market. We also believe that a 2017 effective date will be a significant challenge for all parties. With strong support from the American Hospital Association, American Medical Association and members of Congress, we remain optimistic that together, industry and government, can still achieve a reasonable outcome. Second, I would like to discuss the proposed FDA guidance on regulation of laboratory-developed test. We understand that the FDA's concerns, but we continue to believe what the FDA has proposed would result in labs being subject to both CLIA and FDA regulations that may be overlapping, duplicative and sometimes contradictory in their requirements. This has the potential to raise health care costs for patients and potentially hinder medical innovation. The House draft legislation is a good first step in the legislative process. We share ACLA's goals of promoting and supporting diagnostic innovations that provide physicians with the insights necessary to advance patient care and save lives. We want to work with Congress to get the right balance in legislation, right for the industry, right for physicians and right for patients, who depend upon our diagnostic insights to make informed health care decisions every day. 
Now let me shift to the progress we're making on our 5-point strategy, which is to restore growth, drive operational excellence, simplify the organization, refocus on our diagnostic information services business and deliver disciplined capital deployment. 
So starting with growth. Well, just 3 years ago, this business was shrinking by more than 4%. We slowed the organic decline to 2% in 2014 and have now grown organically on equivalent basis for the fifth consecutive quarter. We grew 2015 full year revenues by 2% on an equivalent basis, and we are well positioned for 2016. Our gene-based and esoteric testing business grew by approximately 4 -- 5% to $1.8 billion for the year. We continue to see strong growth in our infectious disease testing and Prescription Drug Monitoring. Additionally, in late 2015, we launched 2 companion Diagnostic Solutions for non-small cell lung cancer. This week, we announced another complementary diagnostic test which came out for melanoma. Quest expertise, scale and collaborations with the top organizations such as Dako and Bristol-Myers Squibb position us to provide companion and complementary diagnostic test services for immunotherapies on a scale other providers can't match. We are encouraged by the progress of our clinical franchise teams and expect to continue to build more momentum going forward. 
Second, over the past few years, we have outlined our strategy to partner more effectively with hospital systems. We've shared our view that hospitals will look to partner with us to develop and execute their lab strategy. In November, we announced the acquisition of Hartford HealthCare's outreach business. We have been working on detailed integration plans and now expect the relationship to close later in the first quarter of 2016. In December, we announced a professional lab services relationship with Barnabas Health, New Jersey's #1 health system. Under this relationship, we will manage inpatient laboratory tests services for 7 of their locations throughout New Jersey. We are currently working through the transition plans. We expect clinical testing volumes to be fully transitioned by midyear 2016. These are 2 strong proof points of our evolving market, where hospitals are looking for a high-value, world-class partners. We continue to be encouraged by the robust pipeline of opportunities we have developed. In addition, we are building our portfolio of health information technology solutions. Our capabilities help payers, providers and patients to improve patient care, lowering costs and manage populations. We're rolling out our new suite of solutions called Quantum internally to our sales force this week. A good example of Quantum Solution is our recent partnership with Inovalon to deliver real-time insights at the point of care, which we call data diagnostics. We launched the solution in December, are seeing strong interest and have already begun to sign business. We're very encouraged by the opportunity. You'll hear more about the data diagnostics and our Quantum Solution later this quarter at HIMSS. 
The second element of our strategy is driving operational excellence. At our Investor Day in November 2014, we outlined our goal to increase our cumulative run rate savings to $1.3 billion by the end of 2017. To achieve that, we need to deliver an additional $600 million in run rate savings by the end of 2017, and we've made progress on our major objectives of our program, which include building e-enabling services; standardizing our processes, data and systems; improving cash collections. We delivered over $200 million in realized savings in 2015. This enabled us to deliver 10% growth in pretax earnings for the year as we continue to move closer to our bigger end goal of $1.3 billion. And we're doing all this as we improve our customer experience at the same time that we lower costs by removing waste from the system. We continue to simplify and strengthen our organization, which is the third element of our strategy. During the year, we launched our new brand promise. We call it Action from Insight. Our brand promise is more than a refreshed logo. It's really about recommitting to a superior customer experience. We recently launched Everyday Excellence, a new initiative that focuses on our customers. We've already rolled it out to more than 1/3 of our workforce, but it's not just about our frontline employees. Everyday Excellence is for all of us, all of our employees, and it starts with me. We've also invested and trained over 150 senior leaders at our leading Quest Academy. And we've deployed our Quest Management System to create a standard framework for running our business. Our 44,000 employees are key to our success. Actually, in a recent company-wide survey, we experienced a record rate of engagement from employees. And the results put us on par or above performance of high-performing companies in several key areas. There is a clear link between employee engagement and performance at the most successful companies. Our employees are providing us with valuable feedback, and we are listening. 
On a recent visit to our facilities in California, as with so many visits with our operations, I came away both impressed and grateful for our employees' passion and commitment to our customers. 
The fourth element of our strategy is to refocus on our diagnostic information services business. During the year, we contributed our clinical trials testing business into the newly formed joint venture with Quintiles called Q2 Solutions. The JV's performance is on track with our expectations, and we're excited to be part of this growing business. 
And then finally, we remain committed to the fifth element of our strategy, delivering disciplined capital deployment. In 2015, we returned over $400 million to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share buybacks. We returned 80% of our free cash flow to shareholders in 2015, well in excess of our commitment to return the majority of our free cash flow to our shareholders. During the quarter, we increased the company's share repurchase authorization by $500 million. And then earlier today, we announced a 5% increase in our quarterly dividend. This is our fifth dividend increase since 2011. 
Along with all this, we continue to invest in our business. We announced the Hartford HealthCare outreach acquisition in the quarter and closed 2 acquisitions earlier in 2015. These acquisitions are aligned to our objective of growing revenues for strategically-aligned M&A. 
Now Mark will provide an overview on our fourth quarter financial performance and walk you through the details of our 2016 outlook, which considers several of the recently-announced relationships I noted earlier. Mark?"

Starting with revenues, consolidated fourth quarter revenues of $1.85 billion increased 0.6% versus the prior year on an equivalent revenue basis that is, excluding the fourth quarter 2014 Clinical Trials revenue. On a reported basis, reven",759,"Thanks, Steve. Starting with revenues, consolidated fourth quarter revenues of $1.85 billion increased 0.6% versus the prior year on an equivalent revenue basis that is, excluding the fourth quarter 2014 Clinical Trials revenue. On a reported basis, revenues were lower by 1.8%. Revenues for diagnostic information services grew by 40 basis points versus a year ago. Volume, measured by the number of requisitions, grew by 30 basis points versus the prior year. Volume grew on an organic basis by 20 basis points. Revenue per requisition was 10 basis points better than the prior year. Reimbursement pressure was moderate in the quarter and for the year, which is consistent with what we shared at our Investor Day in 2014. Both test and business mix continued to have net positive impact, reflecting our strategy to grow our esoteric testing and drive profitable growth. 
Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $288 million or 15.5% of revenues compared to $283 million or 15% of revenues a year ago. The improvement of 50 basis points can be primarily attributed to efficiencies from our Invigorate program and business mix. 
For the quarter, adjusted earnings per share, excluding amortization, was $1.19 or 80 basis points better than a year ago. Fourth quarter 2015 reported income from continuing operations includes a net benefit of $31 million or $0.21 per share related to deferred income tax benefits recognized during the quarter, partially offset by charges primarily related to restructuring and integration costs. 
In the fourth quarter of 2014, reported income from continuing operations included a net benefit of $27 million or $0.18 per share from the favorable resolution of tax contingencies, offset by charges related primarily to restructuring and integration costs. 
Bad debt expense, as a percentage of revenues, was 3.5%, 30 basis points better than last year and 40 basis points better than last quarter. This is primarily due to a onetime bad debt benefit in the fourth quarter. It remains a challenging collection environment, and we remain focused on improving our operational activities. Our DSOs were 47 days, 1 day lower than the prior year and 3 days higher than last quarter. 
Reported cash provided by operations was $271 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $303 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Cash provided by operations was lower than a year ago, largely due to an additional payroll cycle this year. Excluding the net cash charges related to the recent debt refinancing, adjusted cash provided by operations was $899 million for the full year 2015. Capital expenditures were $94 million in the quarter compared to $89 million a year ago. Total capital expenditures in 2015 were $263 million. 
Before moving to guidance, I'll share a few comments to help you think about our outlook. First, a few of you recently asked about the 8% to 10% earnings CAGR shared at our Investor Day in 2014. Reflecting on 2015, we delivered 6% adjusted earnings, excluding amortization. Keep in mind that the compare in 2015 was negatively impacted by amortization and a discrete tax benefit in 2014. These 2 items reduced our reported earnings growth by about 2%, mostly because we beat our 2014 estimate by $0.05. Taking these items into consideration, we feel we are on track compared to our objectives outlined at Investor Day in 2014. Second, because of the newly formed Q2 Solutions JV, we no longer consolidate the Clinical Trials revenue. Our Clinical Trials business reported revenues of $85 million in the first half of 2015 that you should consider as you update your model. Finally, as you think about our revenue projections, we have been on a favorable trajectory, but one that has been building over time. We expect that we will continue to show improvement as we progress through the year. Specifically, you should consider the Barnabas Health opportunities that will phase in over the first half of the year and the recently announced Outreach acquisition, which we expect to be completed late in the first quarter. 
Moving to guidance. We now expect full year 2016 results, before special items, as follows: revenues are expected to be between $7.52 billion and $7.59 billion, an increase of 1.5% to 2.5% on an equivalent basis; for comparative purposes, equivalent revenues will exclude the 2015 revenues associated with our Clinical Trials business; adjusted diluted EPS, excluding amortization, to be between $5.02 and $5.17; cash provided by operations to approach $1 billion; and capital expenditures to be between $250 million to $300 million. 
Now let me turn it back to Steve."

I have shared in the past, these professional laboratory services agreement come with a couple of different components, as Steve just laid out. Certainly, the reference piece of those margins will be similar to our other reference business relationships. And then some of these cases, there's partnership involving Outreach as well. On the PLS piece itself, which is focused on taking some of the inpatient and outpatient in the hospital testing and partnering with them on that lab work, which previously was unaddressable revenue. So it's a new source of growth for us. Those margins are lower than our overall book of business because we have to share the value creation with our partner. Obviously, when we go in, it's a supply arrangement. And therefore, we have to save enough for us each to make a return. However, as Steve also pointed out, since there's really no significant capital outlay at that point, the ROIC is very attractive. And also I want to emphasize it's a somewhat previously unaddressable revenue. So a new source of growth."

So we are working. We think the legislative action is the best action for us, and that will be much better than the current guidance that we've seen so far from the FDA."

So we've been engaged with CMS on this all last year, once we received their draft document.

We've been quite clear on that, and we've got a lot support now from the American Medical Association, the American Hospital Association and Congress to help us with that. So we made that loud and clear. And then second is the timing. We think the ability for us to get the final guidance out this year, for us to submit the data and then also for them to go through that data to refresh the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule by 2017 is a very, very tight time table, as you can imagine. So those are the 2 big issues that we've highlighted. We are hopeful that we'll see something in the first half of 2016. They never commit to what the date is, but we're hopeful that we'll see something after they've digested everything we provided to them in the last part of last year. So that's where that stands. As far as the FDA, as I just mentioned, we continue to work with Congress on a legislative action. We believe that's the best approach for this issue. We believe it is a good start. And again, as a trade association, we believe they do not have the statutory authority. The FDA does not have statutory authority to regulate laboratories. So we're going to work this in due course. We're hopeful that we can come up with something with the Congress. And we'll see where that leads us.

So I'm just trying to kind of reconcile why that would be and when you might expect to be in that 8% to 10% range? And then I have a follow-up."

Obviously, we're going to provide guidance that we think is prudent and deliverable. We have provided a range. That range certainly includes some numbers that would put us into the 8% to 10%. I want to refresh people's memory that the 8% to 10% was a compound annual growth rate over 3 years. So it was not a commitment to do that every single year. And also, in my prepared remarks, I reminded people that, at that point, we're obviously looking at a 2014 number that was $0.05 lower than we actually delivered in 2014. And I certainly did not anticipate a reduction in our amortization, which was really driven by the fact that we did not have as much significant M&A activity in 2015. So we feel, in terms of what we committed to that we're on track. We're not behind. Certainly, depending on where we end 2016 within that guidance, we'll either be a little bit slightly below the CAGR or right in the CAGR. So really, what we want to do is provide guidance that we feel is prudent and deliverable. And as we progress through the year, obviously, we'll see where we might end up within that range. But we certainly don't think the guidance implies, given the framing I shared on 2015, that we're materially off of that 8% to 10%."

So Bill, I talked about 3 levers that would enable us to grow earnings significantly faster than revenue. One of them was the synergies that would be continued to be delivered to their kind of steady state from acquisitions we had done early in 2014.",240,"Yes. So Bill, I talked about 3 levers that would enable us to grow earnings significantly faster than revenue. One of them was the synergies that would be continued to be delivered to their kind of steady state from acquisitions we had done early in 2014. So you would imagine that probably a lot of that has been delivered. The second piece has been our Invigorate and it being large enough to offset price, end wage inflation and deliver some margin expansion. And then the third element is the leverage we get from organic growth. And so we committed to improving our relative performance. As Steve talked about, minus 4% in 2013 and minus 2% in 2014 and then with some revenue growth in the last 5 quarters. And certainly, since there's not as much M&A in our guidance this year as there was in the 2% we got last year, which benefited from some carryover on Solstas, we're implying continued strengthening of our organic performance. And as you know, organic volume growth has a high drop-through. And as we get closer and closer to market rates, which we had committed, we would do through the 3-year time frame, that's going to also enable us to lever our P&L. So you should expect accelerating organic growth, which will be a driver, and then continued progress to get to the $1.3 billion of Invigorate, which will also accelerate our earnings leverage."

I'll start and then I'm sure Mark will add something to it. First of all, we continued to build our own market model. In 2014, when we had our Investor Day, we ran our model with a number of assumptions, and we say that the independent laboratory market is going to grow about 2% to 3% in value. And 2% to 3% in value, as you know, a lot of moving parts. We also made some assumptions about the ACA impact. We've always assumed that as we have more insured lives in the United States that, that would be net positive for this industry, net positive for us. But we all know that has been muted. There's some question about what will happen in 2016 around some of those lives. And then also, we assume in that, our advancement of technology. We're continuing to rollout new innovation in the marketplace, which helps with the growth rate assumptions, and that was implied in 2% to 3%. The aging population. For instance, hepatitis C is a good opportunity for us, which we're taking advantage of with the baby boomers need to get tested, so all of that is in the 2% to 3%. And also what we're seeing, Amanda, is we refer to as density. We're seeing a continued improvement in the amount of tests we're getting through our requisitions. And some of this also might be enhanced with the delays that we've seen since the Great Recession over the last, let's say, 8 to 9 years, that people, eventually when they show up to the physician, have more need for more testing per that episode. So you put that all together, and that's why we feel that 2% to 3%, and that's not in any specific year, but in the -- the longer-term view is a good gauge of the market. And we believe that utilization or volumes, on a req basis, would be slightly less than that, but on a test basis would be slightly greater than the req because you're getting an increase in the number of tests per requisition. So that's what we have right now. As I said in 2016, we saw utilization being somewhat stable. Like you, we look at all the different indications in the marketplace to get a gauge of what's happening on, going on within the marketplace. But so far, it's feeling, as we come out of this year, somewhat stable expectations for utilization in '16."

What we did commit to was getting back to market levels of revenue growth and also then gaining share at some point. But in the 3-year time frame through 2017, we felt it was incumbent upon us to get back to market level growth, and that's what we're certainly striving to do. I think as everyone recognizes, we talk about utilization in a market that's really a bunch of submarkets. So one of the drivers certainly besides the fact that we have outstanding offerings of the 5% growth in esoteric is that some of those markets are growing. Certainly, BRCA is a growing market. Noninvasive prenatal testing is a growing market. Hepatitis C is a growing market. And then you've got things that we mentioned and it's not quite behind us, such as paps, which is a declining market. Certainly, the impact of some of the safety scares on testosterone has impacted that market in terms of utilization over the last couple of years. So there's really a bunch of markets moving in somewhat different directions. And depending on each labs and certainly Quest's share in those markets, it's going to impact us all differently. So it will be really difficult, even if we are willing to give you a volume number. That's why what we really feel better about is giving revenue numbers. And certainly, if you just look at volume, you miss some of the positive mix aspects that you've seen come through in our results over the last year plus in terms of mix, higher mix of these esoteric offerings, higher mix of better customer pricing, being more disciplined in those ways. So that's what our focus is on as opposed to figuring out volume. We think the demographics we talked about are positives, certainly the aging population, growing population. We certainly, despite some of the recent negative news, such as 40% fewer enrollees in the exchanges, some of the slower growth that we've talked about over the last 18 months in terms of enrollment, you've seen a major payer who's talk about some of the struggles with the exchanges. And despite all that, we still think the Affordable Care Act is adding patients with insurance, and that's a good thing for us. So we do feel positive about volumes and trends, and certainly expect to get our fair share of it, but it would be very difficult to give you some sort of a steady-state volume organic growth projection going forward."

Keep in mind, we talked about revenue a lot because what shows up as volume versus growth in our esoteric business sometimes falls into the mix category. So revenue per requisition, this year, we saw some pressure but we were able to offset that for the last several quarters, more than offset that with favorable test mix that's coming through the gene-based and esoteric.

So the requisition volume counts don't necessarily get the credit, but you see the credit overall in the revenue line for some of that benefit and some of that strategy."

So chronic disease management, diabetes, that's done well. If you look at critical care and hospitals, if you're going to go into a critical care unit with blood gas testing, and that's sort of an example of good point-of-care testing value proposition. And then finally, emergency medicine, if you look at cardiac enzymes and the value of having those cardiac enzymes sooner when the patient is being transferred to the emergency room has a good value proposition. But in other areas where it's not quite clear, where it's not quite compelling, those promises have not really delivered -- been delivered. With all that said, we're the world's largest diagnostic information services company. We're always looking at ways we can improve our cost structure. We buy from all the in-vitro diagnostic companies. If in fact there is a better platform to do some portion of our routine testing on a much more efficient, effective platform than the current ones that we use from all the suppliers, we're all ears. And so we never not look at it innovation that could be helpful in us delivering on our promise of great quality at some of the best prices in the industry and our value proposition continues to be very, very strong. So point-of-care is a part of that, but you need to make sure that you really understand what it's going to do and where the value proposition is strong enough to get some traction.

This morning, I'll provide you with highlights of the quarter. We'll share a few comments on industry dynamics. We'll review the progress on our 5-point strategy, and then Mark will provide more detail on the results and take you through the guidance. 
But before I get started, I'd like to recognize the sad passing of Dr. John Baldwin, a Quest Diagnostics board member since 2004. John provided important, independent and thoughtful perspective as a director and was a responsible steward of shareholder interest. John's life pursuits transcended his work as a practicing physician. Our board will miss him. Our thoughts and prayers are with the Baldwin family. 
Well, during the first quarter, revenues grew by 3.6% on equivalent basis. Adjusted EPS, excluding amortization, grew by almost 7%. And this is our eighth consecutive quarter on year-on-year EPS growth. 
Before I get into our strategy update, I'd like to briefly update you on PAMA. Late last month, 27 members of Congress urged the administration to delay changes to the Medicare Clinical Fee Schedule under PAMA. Given delays on the rulemaking process, they are viewed that the January 2017 effective date were the updated fee schedule is not feasible and should be delayed. Our view that PAMA needs to be built on a representative view of the hospital is shared by the American Hospital Association, the American Medical Association and a number of members of Congress. So we remain optimistic that together, industry and government, can still achieve a reasonable outcome. But given all that remains to be done, we think that the implementation by January 2017 deadline is highly unlikely. 
Now I'd like to shift to the progress we're making on our 5-point strategy, which, as you know, is to restore growth, drive operational excellence, simplify the organization, refocus [ph] on our Diagnostic Information Services business and deliver disciplined capital deployment. 
So let's start with growth. We continue to see improvement in our Diagnostic Information Services revenues. Diagnostic Information Services revenues grew by 3.8% versus the prior year. We have now grown organically on an equivalent basis for the sixth consecutive quarter, and our organic growth rate continues to improve. Our performance reflects our continued focus on advanced gene esoteric testing for our clinical franchise team and expanding our hospital relationships. We delivered solid volume growth across a number of areas, but with particular strength in testing for Prescription Drug Monitoring. 
We continue to drive innovation in advanced testing, and what I'd like to do is share a few examples. Well, first, as you saw last week, we've been very active on hepatitis C testing. As many as 3.9 million Americans are chronically infected with HCV. We've recently expanded rates to the offering with the launch of a new test that meets the new FDA recommendation to help physicians determine the type, dose or duration of newly approved HCV drugs from Merck and Bristol-Myers Squibb. These new Quest services underscore as the central role of diagnostics in delivering precision medicine. 
A second good example is our new companion and complementary and diagnostic solutions for non-small cell lung cancer and melanoma. 
And then finally, Zika testing. We are prepared to address the growing Zika public health concern in the United States, which has been getting more attention and then funding recently. We're currently have 2 Zika tests awaiting FDA clearance. 
In addition to advanced testing, our hospital strategy also contributed to growth in the quarter. Our acquisition of Hartford HealthCare's Outreach business closed at the end of February. [indiscernible] is off to a good start, and we're excited to expand our service offerings in Connecticut. 
In addition to acquiring growth, our professional lab services strategy provides us with a strong growth of organic component of our hospital strategy. Our latest organic contractual professional lab services relationship with Barnabas Health, New Jersey's #1 health care system, is off to a great start. During the quarter, we began to manage laboratory operations at some of their hospital locations and are pleased that all planned locations are now operational. We can now focus on improving operational efficiencies with a great new partner in New Jersey. This hospital professional lab services pipeline remains strong, and we continue to be encouraged by the growth opportunities. 
We continue to make progress on the second element of our strategy, driving operational excellence. Our Invigorate program continues on track, and what I'd like to do additionally is to share some examples of how we're using technology to improve the customer experience and at the same time drive operational efficiency. So what we have done is installed kiosks on a select number of patient service centers that are benefiting patients with shorter wait times, but also freeing our professional phlebotomists to do what they're trained to do, provide great service to patients. 
In the area of logistics, our new finder software platform is helping customers and driving efficiencies. This platform integrates our dispatching, dynamic optimization and specimen tracking systems into one end-to-end logistics solution. 
And lastly, more clients are using our QuestConnect self-service portal to get results faster and more efficiently. As adoption has grown, we've seen a decrease in calls from clients for the test results. So as you can see, these initiatives that we're able to do make us more efficient while at the same time delivering a customer experience that's better and allow us to grow faster. 
We continue to simplify and strengthen our organization, which is the third element of our strategy. We're very proud to again be recognized as one of Fortune's Most Admired Companies.  
The fourth element of our strategy is to refocus our Diagnostic Information Services business. Since our first Investor Day in 2012, we've taken a number of actions, including the sale of our point-of-care products business, oral DNA, [indiscernible] royalty rights and the contribution of our clinical trials business to Q2 Squared Solutions joint venture. And most recently, we exited the [indiscernible] products business and announced the sale of our Focus Products business to DiaSorin. With these moves, we substantially completed our effort to refocus on our Diagnostic Information Services business, which has grown at a 3% CAGR rate since 2013. We expect the Focus sale to close in the second quarter. And what it does, it will generate approximately $300 million of pretax cash, which brings us to the fifth element of our strategy, delivering disciplined capital deployment. As you all know, we're committed to deploy our cash in a balanced way between investing in business, our business, M&A and returning cash to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. We will deploy the after-tax proceeds from the Focus sale in a manner consistent with our strategy. 
Now Mark will provide an overview of the first quarter results and provide you an update on our 2016 outlook. Mark?"

Consolidated revenues of $1.86 billion increased by 1.3% versus the prior year on a reported basis. Equivalent revenues grew 3.6% for the company. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services, or DIS for short, grew",718,"Thanks, Steve. Starting with revenues. Consolidated revenues of $1.86 billion increased by 1.3% versus the prior year on a reported basis. Equivalent revenues grew 3.6% for the company. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services, or DIS for short, grew by 3.8% compared to the prior year. 
Volume, measured by the number of requisitions, increased 2.6% versus the prior year. Recent acquisitions contributed approximately 20 basis points to volumes in the quarter. Revenue per requisition also improved 1.1% versus the year ago with the benefit of favorable test mix. The quarter had favorable compares related to both a milder winter and leap year, partially offset by an earlier Easter. Our Diagnostic Solutions revenues were lower, reflecting the actions taken to refocus on Diagnostic Information Services. 
Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $281 million or 15.1% of revenues compared to $269 million or 14.6% of revenues a year ago. Adjusted operating income benefited from stronger revenues in our Invigorate initiative. For the quarter, adjusted EPS, excluding amortization, was $1.12, 6.7% better than a year ago. The company recorded after-tax charges totaling $45 million in the quarter, $30 million of which is associated with the debt retirement in the first quarter. The balance of charges relates primarily to restructuring and integration costs. These reference charges reduced our reported EPS by $0.32. 
Bad debt expense, as a percentage of revenues, was 4.6%, compared to 4.3% a year ago. As a reminder, bad debt expense is typically highest in the first quarter due to increased patient responsibility associated with high deductible plans. The drivers of the increase were a continued shift to greater patient responsibility and in change in our business mix as our clinical trials and products businesses had lower bad debt rates. Our DSOs were 44 days, 1 day lower than a year ago and 3 days lower than the prior quarter. 
Reported cash provided by operations was $143 million in the quarter compared to $52 million a year ago. Excluding the debt retirement impact in both periods, operating cash flow would have been $190 million in 2016 and $130 million in 2015. 
Capital expenditures were $47 million in the quarter compared to $56 million a year ago. 
I want to mention a few factors I'd like you to keep in mind to help you understand our outlook for the rest of the year. First, after we close on the Focus Diagnostic sale, we expect to provide an update to our revenue outlook to reflect our exit from our products businesses, including both Focus and [indiscernible] products. This update will reflect a change to revenues. But at this time, we do not anticipate changing our earnings guidance. 
Second, I'd like to discuss the 2 recent hospital relationships we announced and the impact of each. In February, we completed the acquisition of Hartford HealthCare's Lab Outreach business. In this relationship, we will be paid on a fee-for-service basis by payers at our traditional rates. This is good for patients and payers as our commercial rates are typically more competitive than those of hospital labs. Like any M&A transaction, margins will improve as we integrate the business, eventually reaching our historical margins for that market. 
During the quarter, we began to manage Barnabas Health's hospital laboratory operations under a new professional lab services, or PLS agreement. Traditionally, these agreements, which represent organic revenue growth, cover management of inpatient and outpatient testing for the hospitals and do not require the same level of services such as phlebotomy or logistics. Here, we bill and collect directly from the hospital. Due to the nature of this business, Barnabas will pressure our revenue per requisition as we move through the year. In addition, keep in mind that PLS margins for any given relationship will improve over time as we implement our processes and protocols but will lag our company-wide average. 
We are very pleased with our first quarter performance, which was in line with our expectations. Given that, our guidance before special items continues to be the following: Revenues to be between $7.52 billion and $7.59 billion; adjusted diluted EPS, excluding amortization expense, to be between $5.02 and $5.17; adjusted cash provided by operations to approximately $1 billion; and capital expenditures to be between $250 million and $300 million. 
Now let me turn it back to Steve."

So it's something that we do use some different codes based on the methodologies that we're following and also working very closely with a number of payers on how these -- how they would like to see things coded. So there's constant dialogue. And it's not just coding, it's also about looking at other things that go along with the services, how we leverage information, how we share the information back with the providers as well as the payers, how we work through prior off processes when necessary, because many of the payers have different approaches to approvals and what types of information they require to get paid on these claims.

So we still feel overall that the underlying business grew at 1% in terms of organic revenue for the quarter. That is a continued improvement. We feel really good about it.

And we've made some adds there. We've continue to invest in that. We put some of that in the first quarter as well. So I would say that we are now as -- now more engaged than ever before, with this evolving marketplace. Obviously, we're very engaged with the national players. We feel very good about those relationships. We have relationships with all the national players. But as I said before in my comments, we can't lose sight because a large part of this country and this market that is also affected by all the other players, the regional players and the other Blues.

What I've talked about is we're going to grow earnings, not earnings per share, but earnings faster than our revenue growth. And really, we've been focused more revenue than volume because as we've also talked about, not all volume is created equal, and there's definitely fair amount of volume in this market is not really value creating. So we're focused on the volume that has a reasonable revenue, reasonable price. And as we do that, and we laid out a picture of 2% to 5% growth, which 1% to 2% would come from M&A, and I also pointed out that we're not counting on significant earnings from an executed M&A when we talked to the Investor Day in late 2014. So really, earnings were coming from the book of business largely that we had at the Investor Day, and we would grow that 8% to 10%. And we said there were 3 pieces to that. One was we did get some continued synergy value early in 2015 for some of the acquisitions we had done in '14, including Solstice. The second piece was our Invigorate program being large enough to offset price headwinds that we anticipated as well as our wage inflation. And then the third piece was we did improve our overall revenue momentum and turned to growth that we would get a drop-through and a reasonably high drop-through on that. It doesn't require 2%. As I've said a minute ago, any sort of revenue growth is going to have -- and especially the short term a reasonably high drop-through. Now in terms of the balance of the year, we've given the guidance. So either -- I'm not going to specifically do the math, but you can see what we're expecting in terms of overall revenue and our earnings. So I think you can see that we are projecting a consistent improvement in our margins but haven't talked about acceleration or decelerating or anything like that."

And Hartford Hospital's is another great example of that happening, and we start the iteration of Hartford. So that's off and running. So our hospital strategy is well underway. We feel good about the growth prospects. And then to your specific question is -- I would share that, over the last several years, we've health care becoming more and more consumer-oriented, we're becoming more consumer-oriented. And we have brought a lot to the marketplace in a variety of places. Let me comment on a few. First of all, we now serve up our results with an application called MyQuest. This came out about 3 years ago, and we're approaching 3 million registered -- registrations for that service, which is remarkable. Now people are quite interested in results, and we're serving that up. And for a small fee, we're going to look back at the history. Second is, as you know, we have a great and growing wellness business that we invested in over the years and then also augmented with the acquisition of Summit. We were deeply engaged with employers and health care insurance companies. Third is we have unparalleled access. To your specific question, we have over 2,200 patients service centers. We have over 3,500 to the phlebotomists physician offices, and so they're close to 6,000 access points for testing. And we're trying to understand how we can augment that with pilots that we're running. And we've done some work with Wal-Mart, where we have pilots off and running in some of their stores because they're looking at health care and how they can provide better access to health care in their stores. And I'd also share is we're exploring other possibilities with retail in general, because I'll say retail in general is very interesting -- interested in how they can assist with providing more access to health care. Because there's a fair percentage of order requisitions for laboratory testings that go unfulfilled. And We believe, if there's better, better access, it's an opportunity for us to fulfill those requisitions and provide better health care. So more to come on this, but we'll becoming more and more increasingly consumer-focused and oriented. When we have more, we'll shared with you, but work is in progress."

And we're actually encouraged -- you might not have seen it. But actually this week, the House Appropriations Committee just included some new language in the agriculture FTE spending bill. They just came out of committee, and what they're stating in this bill is that, in their view, the FDA should support what Congress is doing to try to put together a legislative solution for this FDA discussion that's going on and not issue their guidance. So that's just come out of committee. It also needs to go through the house, and it is a growth of the Senate, but we're encouraged by that. We think that's a good piece of work.

Brian, we wouldn't expect that trend to change within the core fee-for-service business. As we mentioned, as we increase our professional laboratory services book of business, just based on the mathematics, that's going to reduce our revenue per requisition. We've also talked about the fact that from quarter-to-quarter, it could change. So for instance, our wellness business is, has from seasonality, as you might imagine. It's very heavy towards the back end of the year as employers are getting ready for benefits enrollment plan, a lot of them sponsor that kind of testing late in the year. And that wellness business does have a lower revenue per req. But as we've also shared, the necessarily mean a lower margin. So other than some of the quarter-to-quarter variability and then the mathematics as we build a book of business in PLS that my grow faster than our core book, really, you should expect that the revenue per req trend is something that, as far as we're expecting, as far as will continue as we continue to come up with new innovative solutions which tend to have a higher price and a higher revenue per requisition."

Our professional lab services business, we think, it's a great business. It offers great growth opportunities, great return on invested capital. But on a revenue price basis, it would put some pressure on that calculation, but it does not in any way affect our optimism about the opportunity of that business."

And part of that is to refocus on our Diagnostic Information Services business. We think that the business is a good business. We think there's plenty of growth prospects in it, and we have our strategies to grow that business. And we're happy actually that -- you can go back and look back, and I've said this in my remarks, you can look at 2013. And with the CAGR since then, our Diagnostic Information Services business is up by 3%. Now included, Bill, in that 3% is our deliberate strategy to look for acquisitions that are strategically aligned with that strategy and that are accretive, that we can make can make money at. And we said we believe there's 1% to 2% top line growth for those type of acquisitions, and we continue to deliver on that. And Hartford Hospital continues to be a good example of that this year. And then finally, when it comes to our disciplined capital deployment, we've been, again, very consistent doing what we said we would do, returning the majority of our free cash flow to our shareholders. We have been consistent with that in regards to raising our dividend, our share buyback program. And finally, as we mentioned investing in the business, which is a big part of what we do every with the capital budget. And then our acquisition strategy is consistent with our growth strategy and at the same time, looking for those assets that we think could make some money at. So we're doing what we said what we would do, and we're tracking well against it. And we're very pleased that with the sale of Focus, hopefully, will close that in the second quarter, as I said in our remarks. Our refocusing strategy is largely complete and behind us.

As Steve said, hopefully, you'll look at what related in 2012, what we've been doing that we told people we will do. So therefore, what we always have fiduciary responsibility to look at any opportunities for cash deployment that seems like the best way for our shareholders to recognize the value and the return. At this point, we've been pretty consistent saying M&A of 1% to 2%; return majority of free cash flow to shareholders. And so therefore, when you do the math, you can see that we could fund a 1% to 2% top line growth within our operating cash flow. We've also said year-to-year, depending on what opportunities were there, we could always potentially spend a little more and drive a little more growth in one given year or we could potentially buy back more shares. So we're not going to be wed to any sort of formula because, as you might imagine, as we go through every deal, we want to make sure that any deployment of our cash and capital is the best opportunity in that window to create shareholder value. So I also want to point out that by increasing the dividend 5x in a period of several years, we've gotten into a significant portion of that coming from the dividend and so versus the uncertainty of how much we might buy in a given year, and so on and so forth. We've made a significant commitment to our ongoing shareholders to return the chunk of cash through the dividend. So that gets us most of the way to the 50%. And then anything beyond that in terms of share repurchases, are really going to be driven by, in a short period of time, a lack of M&A opportunities that we see more value-creative and buying back shares. So nothing that you should expect in terms of significant changes in our leverage in the near term. Certainly, nothing you should expect, and I think your question was around more significant share buybacks. I certainly wouldn't go to the balance sheet to do that. So whatever we do will be driven by our operating cash flow or by some strategic asset divestitures, such as we did with  [indiscernible] in the past. And while we haven't said specifically what we're doing in Focus, we can assure you we'll deploy that cash in a manner that's consistent with what I just said."

So first off, the acquisition. Yes, that there was a Hartford Health acquisition. In terms of multiples, as I'm sure you can appreciate, there's really no multiple that makes sense in terms of the [indiscernible] revenue and EBITDA. Because the business in our hands is completely different. So the revenue tends to be lower, as we've mentioned, as we move the reimbursement to our negotiated rates. But obviously, in all cases, when we do with acquisition, the EBITDA and the earnings are much better than what the seller had. So really, the best way to think about it is that, because we apply the financial metrics, which we do around a [indiscernible] MPV hurdle, and really driving the earnings accretion with the near term, the math would make it impossible for us to overpay. And so what I've said to people, on a pro forma basis, if you saw our models, you'd see that the multiple with what we're paying on EBITDA multiple is -- would not be above our overall market multiples. So it would be in the ballpark or lower. So you can feel good about, we're not going on buying companies or assets or businesses that is significantly high premium. And then on the bad debt question. We did have a onetime favorable adjustment in Q4. If you look back at what we've shared in the quarter, so the bad debt was not a run rate Q4 bad debt. It was favorable, given a onetime collection that we had that helps Q4 disproportionately. So the sequential -- historical sequential would be impacted by that. And that's why you're seeing a larger increase from Q1 -- Q4 to Q1. But also the other thing is that we do have this continued increase in high deductible plans. And while our Invigorate program is very focused and offsetting a lot of that mix shift through earlier collections -- upfront collections in our PACs and other initiatives that we have going on, the reality is that the bad debt rate on patient responsibility is in order of magnitude higher than the rest of our business. So we'll continue to work on that, and we expect to certainly to mitigate that impact, but it does have some impact."

This morning, I'll provide you with highlights of the quarter. We'll share a few comments on industry dynamics. We'll review the progress on our five-point strategy, and then Mark will provide more detail on the results and take you through guidance. 
But before I get started, I'd like to recognize the sad passing of Dr. John Baldwin, a Quest Diagnostics board member since 2004. John provided important, independent and thoughtful perspective as a director and was a responsible steward of shareholder interest. John's life pursuits transcended his work as a practicing physician. Our board will miss him. Our thoughts and prayers are with the Baldwin family.
Well, during the first quarter, revenues grew by 3.6% on equivalent basis. Adjusted EPS, excluding amortization, grew by almost 7%. And this is our eighth consecutive quarter on year-on-year EPS growth.
Before I get into our strategy update, I'd like to briefly update you on PAMA. Late last month, 27 members of Congress urged the administration to delay changes to the Medicare Clinical Lab Fee Schedule under PAMA. Given delays on the rule making process, they argue that the January 2017 effective date for the update of fee schedule is not feasible and should be delayed. Our view that PAMA needs to be built on a representative view of the hospital is shared by the American Hospital Association, the American Medical Association and a number of members of Congress. So we remain optimistic that together, industry and government, can still achieve a reasonable outcome. But given all that remains to be done, we think that the implementation by January 2017 deadline is highly unlikely.
Now I'd like to shift to the progress we're making on our five-point strategy, which, as you know, is to restore growth, drive operational excellence, simplify the organization, refocus on our Diagnostic Information Services business and deliver disciplined capital deployment.
So let's start with growth. We continue to see improvement in our Diagnostic Information Services revenues. Diagnostic Information Services revenues grew by 3.8% versus the prior year. We have now grown organically on an equivalent basis for the sixth consecutive quarter, and our organic growth rate continues to improve. Our performance reflects our continued focus on advanced gene-based and esoteric testing for our clinical franchise team and expanding our hospital relationships. We delivered solid volume growth across a number of areas, but with particular strength in testing for Prescription Drug Monitoring.
We continue to drive innovation in advanced testing, and what I'd like to do is to share a few examples. Well, first, as you saw last week, we've been very active on hepatitis C testing. As many as 3.9 million Americans are chronically infected with HCV. We've recently expanded HCV offering with the launch of a new test that meets the new FDA recommendation to help physicians determine the type, dose or duration of newly approved HCV drugs from Merck and Bristol-Myers Squibb. These new Quest services underscore as the central role of diagnostics in delivering precision medicine.
A second good example is our new companion and complementary diagnostic solutions for non-small cell lung cancer and melanoma.
And then finally, Zika testing. We are prepared to address the growing Zika public health concern in the United States, which has been getting more attention and then funding recently. We currently have 2 Zika tests awaiting FDA clearance.
In addition to advanced testing, our hospital strategy also contributed to growth in the quarter. Our acquisition of Hartford HealthCare's outreach business closed at the end of February. Integration is off to a good start, and we're excited to expand our service offerings in Connecticut.
In addition to acquiring growth, our professional lab services strategy provides us with a strong growth of organic component of our hospital strategy. Our latest organic, contractual professional lab services relationship with Barnabas Health, New Jersey's #1 health care system, is off to a great start.
During the quarter, we began to manage laboratory operations at some of their hospital locations. And I'm pleased that all planned locations are now operational. We can now focus on improving operational efficiencies with a great new partner in New Jersey. This hospital professional lab services pipeline remains strong, and we continue to be encouraged by the growth opportunities.
We continue to make progress on the second element of our strategy, driving operational excellence. Our Invigorate program continues on track. And what I'd like to do additionally is to share some examples of how we're using technology to improve the customer experience and at the same time drive operational efficiency. So what we have done is installed kiosks on a select number of Patient Service Centers that are benefiting patients with shorter wait times, but also freeing our professional phlebotomists to do what they're trained to do, provide great service to patients.
In the area of logistics, our new Pathfinder software platform is helping customers and driving efficiencies. This platform integrates our dispatching, dynamic route optimization and specimen tracking systems into one end-to-end logistics solution.
And lastly, more clients are using our QuestConnect, self-service portal, to get results faster and more efficiently. As adoption has grown, we've seen a decrease in calls from clients for the test results. So as you can see, these initiatives that we're able to do make us more efficient, while at the same time delivering a customer experience that's better that allow us to grow faster.
We continue to simplify and strengthen our organization, which is the third element of our strategy. We're very proud to again be recognized as one of Fortune's Most Admired Companies.
The fourth element of our strategy is to refocus our Diagnostic Information Services business. Since our first Investor Day in 2012, we've taken a number of actions, including the sale of our HemoCue, point-of-care products business, oral DNA, ibrutinib royalty rights and the contribution of our clinical trials business to Q2 Squared Solutions joint venture. And most recently, we exited the Celera products business and announced the sale of our Focus Products business to DiaSorin. With these moves, we have substantially completed our effort to refocus on our Diagnostic Information Services business, which has grown at a 3% CAGR rate since 2013. We expect the Focus sale to close in the second quarter. And what it does, it will generate approximately $300 million of pretax cash, which brings us to the fifth element of our strategy, delivering disciplined capital deployment. As you all know, we're committed to deploy our cash in a balanced way between investing in business, our business, M&A and returning cash to our shareholders through buybacks and dividends. We will deploy the after-tax proceeds from the Focus sale in a manner consistent with our strategy.
Now Mark will provide an overview on the first quarter results and provide you an update on our 2016 outlook. Mark?"

Consolidated revenues of $1.86 billion increased by 1.3% versus the prior year on a reported basis. Equivalent revenues grew 3.6% for the company. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services, or DIS for short, grew by 3.8% compared to the prior year.
Volume, measured by the number of requisitions, increased 2.6% versus the prior year. Recent acquisitions contributed approximately 20 basis points to volumes in the quarter. Revenue per requisition also improved 1.1% versus a year ago, with the benefit of favorable test mix. The quarter had favorable compares related to both a milder winter and leap year, partially offset by an earlier Easter. Our Diagnostic Solutions revenues were lower, reflecting the actions taken to refocus on Diagnostic Information Services.
Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $281 million or 15.1% of revenues compared to $269 million or 14.6% of revenues a year ago. Adjusted operating income benefited from stronger revenues in our Invigorate initiative. For the quarter, adjusted EPS, excluding amortization, was $1.12, 6.7% better than a year ago. The company recorded after-tax charges totaling $45 million in the quarter, $30 million of which is associated with the debt retirement in the first quarter. The balance of charges relates primarily to restructuring and integration costs. These reference charges reduced our reported EPS by $0.32.
Bad debt expense, as a percentage of revenues, was 4.6%, compared to 4.3% a year ago. As a reminder, bad debt expense is typically highest in the first quarter due to increased patient responsibility associated with high deductible plans. The drivers of the increase were a continued shift to greater patient responsibility and a change in our business mix, as our clinical trials and products businesses had lower bad debt rates. Our DSOs were 44 days, 1 day lower than a year ago and 3 days lower than the prior quarter.
Reported cash provided by operations was $143 million in the quarter compared to $52 million a year ago. Excluding the debt retirement impact in both periods, operating cash flow would have been $190 million in 2016 and $130 million in 2015.
Capital expenditures were $47 million in the quarter compared to $56 million a year ago.
I want to mention a few factors, I'd like you to keep in mind to help you understand our outlook for the rest of the year. First, after we close on the Focus Diagnostic sale, we expect to provide an update to our revenue outlook to reflect our exit from our products businesses, including both Focus and Celera products. This update will reflect a change to revenues. But at this time, we do not anticipate changing our earnings guidance.
Second, I'd like to discuss the 2 recent hospital relationships we announced and the impact of each. In February, we completed the acquisition of Hartford HealthCare's lab outreach business. In this relationship, we will be paid on a fee-for-service basis by payers at our traditional rates. This is good for patients and payers as our commercial rates are typically more competitive than those of hospital labs. Like any M&A transaction, margins will improve as we integrate the business, eventually reaching our historical margins for that market.
During the quarter, we began to manage Barnabas Health's hospital laboratory operations under a new professional lab services, or PLS agreement. Traditionally, these agreements, which represent organic revenue growth, cover management of inpatient and outpatient testing for the hospitals and do not require the same level of services such as phlebotomy or logistics. Here, we bill and collect directly from the hospital. Due to the nature of this business, Barnabas will pressure our revenue per requisition as we move through the year. In addition, keep in mind that PLS margins for any given relationship will improve over time as we implement our processes and protocols but will lag our company-wide average.
We are very pleased with our first quarter performance, which was in line with our expectations. Given that, our guidance before special items continues to be the following: Revenues to be between $7.52 billion and $7.59 billion; adjusted diluted EPS, excluding amortization expense, to be between $5.02 and $5.17; adjusted cash provided by operations to approximately $1 billion; and capital expenditures to be between $250 million and $300 million.
Now let me turn it back to Steve."

And I think the rationale is really that the older codes are based on [indiscernible] and with next-gen sequencing to gain some efficiencies. So I just had a question around that as you kind of move more into that type of testing when it becomes a bigger part of your business. What's your perspective on Medicare pricing and sort of your ability to service that market in a lower pricing environment, I guess? And then two, how are private payers looking at those type of tests and sort of are they recognizing the value adds from -- now looking at more genes in the same assay and sort of the difficulty around interpretation that comes along with that?"

So there's constant dialogue. And it's not just coding, it's also about looking at other things that go along with the services, how we leverage the information, how we share the information back with the providers as well as the payers, how we work through prior off processes when necessary, because many of the payers have different approaches to approvals, and what types of information they require to get paid on these claims.

So that's the only other consideration, but there's nothing else in that performance that you should be taking into account. In terms of the revenue per req, which is not priced, we did have continued price headwinds, but they were more than offset to the extent that we actually got 1.1% left in our revenue per req, really driven by test mix. So test mix not only offsets price but actually gave us 110 basis points lift on a revenue per req, and that's certainly an outcome of some of the innovation that we've been driving on the new test that we're introducing and are focused on higher-value offerings and really being price disciplined, as we continue to negotiate and operate in the market."

As Steve mentioned earlier, we made a conscious choice to make some investments. So as we put our plan together for the year, obviously, there's always an opportunity to deliver even more earnings, but we want to be long-term-focused as well. We have a couple of critical things going on in the company that we think will drive future growth that are important, such as the launch of Quantum, our Data Diagnostics initiative. We've talked about one of the major pieces in that being our partnership with Inovalon and getting us in a position to drive the growth that we aspire to, we think, is possible, we really needed to make some investments. We've also been investing in our what we call our everyday excellence initiative, which is critical around what people do every day in terms of customer excellence and focus on quality and those required some investments early in the year, just to cite a few examples. So it wasn't a question of how much operating leverage. As Steve said, this is a plan we put together. And it did involve some incremental investments in the first quarter that we made a conscious decision to do so in that quarter."

We offer great service at very, very affordable and good prices in the market. And we continue to work on our presence and our access with all the health care insurance companies. One of the things we invested in in the first quarter, along with what Mark mentioned, is improving our team and also our reach into the health care insurance portion of our sales force. And so we've made some adds there. We've continued to invest in that. We put some of that in the first quarter as well. So I would say that we are now as -- more engaged than ever before, with this evolving marketplace. Obviously, we're very engaged with the national players. We feel very good about those relationships. We have relationships with all the national players. But as I said before in my comments, we can't lose sight because a large part of this country and this market that is also affected by all the other players, the regional players and the other Blues and we're as equally engaged in that portion of the market as well. So we think, going back to where I started, conceptually, given where the market has headed that it plays very nicely into what we're all about, which is being the strongest in what we do and very focused on Diagnostic Information Services that offer incredible value to delivering great quality health care at affordable prices. So nicely positioned it for the short run, but also the long term."

So as a national lab, we can help to ensure that as this consolidation takes place, we're partnering with those payers. We can ensure that access remains or improves. And the second piece is, as you're aware, they already get excellent value from us. So we're part of the solution. And certainly, that doesn't require, in our minds, additional price concessions. We already can bring them tons of value by just further consolidation into Quest."

I don't believe I've ever made the statement that we need 2% volume growth in order to leverage margin. What I talked about was we're going to grow our earnings, not earnings per share, but earnings faster than our revenue growth. And really, we've been focused more on revenue than volume because as we've also talked about, not all volume is created equal, and there's definitely a fair amount of volume in this market that is not value creating. So we're focused on the volume that has a reasonable revenue, reasonable price. And as we do that, and we laid out a picture of 2% to 5% growth, which is 1% to 2%, we said would come from M&A, and I also pointed out that I was not counting on significant earnings from -- on executed M&A when we talked at the Investor Day in late 2014. So really, the earnings were coming from the book of business largely that we had at the Investor Day, and we would grow that 8% to 10%. And I said there were 3 pieces to that: One was, we did get some continued synergy value early in 2015 for some of the acquisitions we had done in '14, including Solstice. The second piece was our Invigorate program being large enough to offset price headwinds that we anticipated as well as our wage inflation. And then the third piece was as we did improve our overall revenue momentum and turned to growth that we would get a drop-through and a reasonably high drop-through on that. So it doesn't require 2%. As I said a minute ago, any sort of revenue growth is going to have -- and especially in the short term a reasonably high drop-through. Now in terms of the balance of the year, we've given the guidance. So I'm not going to specifically do the math, but you can see what we're expecting in terms of overall revenue and our earnings. So I think you can see that we are projecting a consistent improvement in our margin but haven't talked about accelerating or decelerating or anything like that."

It's a big part of our growth strategy, and we saw a portion of our growth coming from that in this quarter. I mentioned, there's 2 aspects of our hospital strategy: One is related to what we call professional lab services, and a great example of that is what we're doing now with Barnabas and that's off and running in a good way. And so a portion of our growth came from Barnabas ramping up and its just continuing to ramp up. Second is we do engage with hospital systems and typically in these conversations, some consider selling their business to us, their Outreach business. And Hartford Hospital is another great example of that happening, and we started the integration of Hartford. So that's off and running. So our hospital strategy is well underway. We feel good about the growth prospects. And then, your specific question is -- I will share that, and over the last several years, with healthcare becoming more and more consumer-oriented, we're becoming more consumer-oriented. And we have brought a lot to the marketplace in a variety of places. Let me comment on a few. First of all, we now serve up our results with an application called MyQuest. This came out about 2 years ago, and we're approaching 3 million registered -- registrations for that service, which is remarkable. People are quite interested in results, and we're serving that up. And for a small fee, we'll do a look back at their history. Second is, as you know, we have a great and growing wellness business that we invested in over the years and then also augmented with the acquisition of Summit where we're deeply engaged with employers and healthcare insurance companies. Third is, we have unparalleled access. To your specific question, we have over 2,200 patient service centers. We have over 3,500 phlebotomist and physician offices, and so we're close to 6,000 access points for testing. And we're trying to understand how we can augment that with pilots that we're running. And we've done some work with Wal-Mart, where we have pilots off and running in some of their stores because they're looking at healthcare and how they can provide better access to healthcare in their stores. And what I'd also share is we're exploring other possibilities with retail in general, because I'll say retail in general is very interesting -- interested in how they can assist with providing more access to healthcare. Because there's a fair percentage of ordered requisitions for laboratory testings that go unfulfilled. And we believe, if there's better, better access, it's an opportunity for us to fulfill those requisitions and provide better healthcare. So more to come on this, but we're becoming increasingly more and more consumer-focused and oriented and when we have more, we'll share with you, but work is in progress."

We do believe that a legislative solution is the best option for this country when it comes to the FDA potentially having some oversight and also rationalizing how they integrate that work with CMS and CLIA. And we're actually encouraged -- you might not have seen it. But actually this week, the House Appropriations Committee just included some new language in their Agriculture FTE Spending bill that just came out a committee, and what they're stating in this bill is that, in their view, the FDA should support what Congress is doing to try to put together a legislative solution for this FDA discussion that's going on and not issue their guidance. So that's just come out of committee, obviously needs to go through the house, and go through the Senate, but we're encouraged by that. We think that's a good piece of work. We're obviously supportive of that, and we're continuing to work on, making sure that this goes through the process in Washington. So more to come.

It's very heavy towards the back-end of the year as employers are getting ready for benefits enrollment plan, a lot of them sponsor that kind of testing later in the year. And that Wellness business does have a lower revenue per req. But as we've also shared, it doesn't necessarily mean a lower margin.

So hopefully, what you've seen from us, and we delivered on it quarter-upon-quarter, is we do what we say. So we've launched our 5-point strategy back in 2012. And part of that is to refocus on our Diagnostic Information Services business. We think the business is a good business. We think there's plenty of growth prospects in it, and we have our strategies to grow that business. And we're happy actually that -- if you go back and do a look back, and I've said this in my remarks, if you look at 2013. And with the CAGR since then, our Diagnostic Information Services business is up by 3%. Now included, Bill, in that 3% is our deliberate strategy to look for acquisitions that are strategically aligned with that strategy and that are accretive, that we can make money at. And we've said that we believe there's 1% to 2% top line growth from those type of acquisitions, and we continue to deliver on that. And Hartford Hospital continues to be a good example of that this year. And then finally, when it comes to our disciplined capital deployment, we've been, again, very consistent with doing what we said we would do, returning the majority of our free cash flow to our shareholders. We have been consistent with that in regards to raising our dividend, our share buyback program. And then finally, as we've been investing in the business, which is a big part of what we do every year with our capital budget. And then our acquisition strategy is consistent with our growth strategy and yet at the same time looking for those assets that we think we could make some money at. So we're doing what we said what we would do, and we're tracking well against it. And then we're very pleased that with the sale of Focus, hopefully, will close that in the second quarter, as I said in our remarks. Our refocusing strategy is largely complete and behind us. So that portion of our portfolio change is in good shape. So let me turn it to, Mark, to add more color to this."

As Steve said, hopefully, as people look at what you laid out in 2012 that we've been doing what we told people we would do. So therefore, we always have a fiduciary responsibility to look at any opportunities for cash deployment that seems like the best way for our shareholders to recognize value and a return. At this point, we've been pretty consistent saying M&A of 1% to 2%, return a majority of free cash flow to shareholders. And so therefore, when you do the math, you can see that we could fund a 1% to 2% top line growth within our operating cash flow. As we've also said year-to-year, depending on what opportunities were there, we could always potentially spend a little more and drive a little more growth in one given year or we could potentially buy back more shares. So we're not going to be wed to any sort of formula because, as you might imagine, as we go for every deal, we want to make sure that any deployment of our cash and our capital is the best opportunity in that window to create shareholder value. So I also want to point out that by increasing the dividend 5x in a period of several years, we've gotten to a significant portion of that coming from the dividend and so versus the uncertainty of how much we might buy in a given year, so on and so forth. We've made a significant commitment to our ongoing shareholders to return a chunk of cash through that dividend. So that gets us most of the way to the 50%. And then anything beyond that in terms of share repurchases, are really going to be driven by, in a short period of time, a lack of M&A opportunities that's more value-creating than buying back shares. So nothing that you should expect in terms of significant changes in our leverage in the near term. Certainly, nothing you should expect, and I think your question was around more significant share buybacks. I certainly wouldn't go to the balance sheet to do that. So whatever we do will be driven by our operating cash flow or by some strategic asset divestitures, such as we did with Ibrutinib in the past. And while we haven't said specifically what we're doing with Focus, we can assure you we'll deploy that cash in a manner that's consistent with what I just said."

So first off, on the acquisitions. Yes, that was a Hartford Health acquisition. In terms of multiples, as I'm sure you can appreciate, there's really no multiple that makes sense in terms of the sellers revenue and EBITDA. Because the business in our hands is completely different. So the revenue tends to be lower, as we've mentioned, as we move the reimbursement to our negotiated rates. But obviously, in all cases, when we do an acquisition, the EBITDA and the earnings are much better than what the seller had. So really, the best way to think about it is that, because we apply the financial metrics, which we do around a [indiscernible] hurdle, around an MPV hurdle, and really driving the earnings accretion in the near term, the math would make it impossible for us to overpay. And so what I've said to people, on a pro forma basis, if you saw our models, you'd see that the multiple what we're paying on an EBITDA multiple is -- would not be above our overall market multiple. So it would be in the ballpark or lower. So you can feel good about, we're not going on buying companies or assets or businesses that is significantly high premium. And then on the bad debt question. We did have a onetime favorable adjustment in Q4. If you look back at what we've shared in the quarter, so the bad debt was not a run rate Q4 bad debt. It was favorable, given a onetime collection that we had that helps Q4 disproportionately. So the sequential -- historical sequential would be impacted by that. And that's why you're seeing a larger increase from Q1 -- Q4 to Q1. But also the other thing is that we do have this continued increase in high deductible plans. And while our Invigorate program is very focused and offsetting a lot of that mix shift through earlier collections -- upfront collections in our PACs and other initiatives that we have going on, the reality is that the bad debt rate on patient responsibility is in order of magnitude higher than the rest of our business. So we'll continue to work on that, and we expect to certainly mitigate that impact, but it does have some impact."

This morning, I'll provide you with highlights of the quarter. We'll share a few comments on industry dynamics. We'll review the progress on our five-point strategy, and then Mark will provide more detail on the results and take you through guidance. 
But before I get started, I'd like to recognize the sad passing of Dr. John Baldwin, a Quest Diagnostics board member since 2004. John provided important, independent and thoughtful perspective as a director and was a responsible steward of shareholder interest. John's life pursuits transcended his work as a practicing physician. Our board will miss him. Our thoughts and prayers are with the Baldwin family.
Well, during the first quarter, revenues grew by 3.6% on equivalent basis. Adjusted EPS, excluding amortization, grew by almost 7%. And this is our eighth consecutive quarter on year-on-year EPS growth.
Before I get into our strategy update, I'd like to briefly update you on PAMA. Late last month, 27 members of Congress urged the administration to delay changes to the Medicare Clinical Lab Fee Schedule under PAMA. Given delays on the rule making process, they argue that the January 2017 effective date for the update of fee schedule is not feasible and should be delayed. Our view that PAMA needs to be built on a representative view of the hospital is shared by the American Hospital Association, the American Medical Association and a number of members of Congress. So we remain optimistic that together, industry and government can still achieve a reasonable outcome. But given all that remains to be done, we think that the implementation by January 2017 deadline is highly unlikely.
Now I'd like to shift to the progress we're making on our five-point strategy, which, as you know, is to restore growth, drive operational excellence, simplify the organization, refocus on our Diagnostic Information Services business and deliver disciplined capital deployment.
So let's start with growth. We continue to see improvement in our Diagnostic Information Services revenues. Diagnostic Information Services revenues grew by 3.8% versus the prior year. We have now grown organically on an equivalent basis for the sixth consecutive quarter, and our organic growth rate continues to improve. Our performance reflects our continued focus on advanced gene-based and esoteric testing for our clinical franchise team and expanding our hospital relationships. We delivered solid volume growth across a number of areas, but with particular strength in testing for Prescription Drug Monitoring.
We continue to drive innovation in advanced testing, and what I'd like to do is to share a few examples. Well, first, as you saw last week, we've been very active on hepatitis C testing. As many as 3.9 million Americans are chronically infected with HCV. We've recently expanded our HCV offering with the launch of a new test that meets the new FDA recommendation to help physicians determine the type, dose or duration of newly approved HCV drugs from Merck and Bristol-Myers Squibb. These new Quest services underscore as the central role of diagnostics in delivering precision medicine.
A second good example is our new companion and complementary diagnostic solutions for non-small cell lung cancer and melanoma.
And then finally, Zika testing. We are prepared to address the growing Zika public health concern in the United States, which has been getting more attention and then funding recently. We currently have 2 Zika tests awaiting FDA clearance.
In addition to advanced testing, our hospital strategy also contributed to growth in the quarter. Our acquisition of Hartford HealthCare's outreach business closed at the end of February. Integration is off to a good start, and we're excited to expand our service offerings in Connecticut.
In addition to acquiring growth, our professional lab services strategy provides us with a strong growth of organic component of our hospital strategy. Our latest organic, contractual professional lab services relationship with Barnabas Health, New Jersey's #1 health care system, is off to a great start.
During the quarter, we began to manage laboratory operations at some of their hospital locations. And I'm pleased that all planned locations are now operational. We can now focus on improving operational efficiencies with a great new partner in New Jersey. This hospital professional lab services pipeline remains strong, and we continue to be encouraged by the growth opportunities.
We continue to make progress on the second element of our strategy, driving operational excellence. Our Invigorate program continues on track. And what I'd like to do additionally is to share some examples of how we're using technology to improve the customer experience and at the same time drive operational efficiency. So what we have done is installed kiosks on a select number of Patient Service Centers that are benefiting patients with shorter wait times, but also freeing our professional phlebotomists to do what they're trained to do, provide great service to patients.
In the area of logistics, our new Pathfinder software platform is helping customers and driving efficiencies. This platform integrates our dispatching, dynamic route optimization and specimen tracking systems into one end-to-end logistics solution.
And lastly, more clients are using our QuestConnect self-service portal to get results faster and more efficiently. As adoption has grown, we've seen a decrease in calls from clients for the test results. So as you can see, these initiatives that we're able to do make us more efficient, while at the same time delivering a customer experience that's better that will allow us to grow faster.
We continue to simplify and strengthen our organization, which is the third element of our strategy. We're very proud to again be recognized as one of Fortune's Most Admired Companies.
The fourth element of our strategy is to refocus on our Diagnostic Information Services business. Since our first Investor Day in 2012, we've taken a number of actions, including the sale of our HemoCue point-of-care products business, oral DNA, ibrutinib royalty rights and the contribution of our clinical trials business to Q2 Squared Solutions joint venture. And most recently, we exited the Celera products business and announced the sale of our Focus Products business to DiaSorin. With these moves, we have substantially completed our effort to refocus on our Diagnostic Information Services business, which has grown at a 3% CAGR rate since 2013. We expect the Focus sale to close in the second quarter. And what it does, it will generate approximately $300 million of pretax cash, which brings us to the fifth element of our strategy, delivering disciplined capital deployment. As you all know, we're committed to deploy our cash in a balanced way between investing in business, our business, M&A and returning cash to our shareholders through buybacks and dividends. We will deploy the after-tax proceeds from the Focus sale in a manner consistent with our strategy.
Now Mark will provide an overview on the first quarter results and provide you an update on our 2016 outlook. Mark?"

Consolidated revenues of $1.86 billion increased by 1.3% versus the prior year on a reported basis. Equivalent revenues grew 3.6% for the company. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services, or DIS for short, grew by 3.8% compared to the prior year.
Volume, measured by the number of requisitions, increased 2.6% versus the prior year. Recent acquisitions contributed approximately 20 basis points to volumes in the quarter. Revenue per requisition also improved 1.1% versus a year ago, with the benefit of favorable test mix. The quarter had favorable compares related to both a milder winter and leap year, partially offset by an earlier Easter. Our Diagnostic Solutions revenues were lower, reflecting the actions taken to refocus on Diagnostic Information Services.
Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $281 million or 15.1% of revenues compared to $269 million or 14.6% of revenues a year ago. Adjusted operating income benefited from stronger revenues in our Invigorate initiative. For the quarter, adjusted EPS, excluding amortization, was $1.12, 6.7% better than a year ago. The company recorded after-tax charges totaling $45 million in the quarter, $30 million of which is associated with the debt retirement in the first quarter. The balance of charges relates primarily to restructuring and integration costs. These reference charges reduced our reported EPS by $0.32.
Bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues was 4.6% compared to 4.3% a year ago. As a reminder, bad debt expense is typically highest in the first quarter due to increased patient responsibility associated with high deductible plans. The drivers of the increase were a continued shift to greater patient responsibility and a change in our business mix, as our clinical trials and products businesses had lower bad debt rates. Our DSOs were 44 days, 1 day lower than a year ago and 3 days lower than the prior quarter.
Reported cash provided by operations was $143 million in the quarter compared to $52 million a year ago. Excluding the debt retirement impact in both periods, operating cash flow would have been $190 million in 2016 and $130 million in 2015.
Capital expenditures were $47 million in the quarter compared to $56 million a year ago.
I want to mention a few factors, I'd like you to keep in mind to help you understand our outlook for the rest of the year. First, after we close on the Focus Diagnostic sale, we expect to provide an update to our revenue outlook to reflect our exit from our products businesses, including both Focus and Celera products. This update will reflect a change to revenues. But at this time, we do not anticipate changing our earnings guidance.
Second, I'd like to discuss the 2 recent hospital relationships we announced and the impact of each. In February, we completed the acquisition of Hartford HealthCare's lab outreach business. In this relationship, we will be paid on a fee-for-service basis by payers at our traditional rates. This is good for patients and payers as our commercial rates are typically more competitive than those of hospital labs. Like any M&A transaction, margins will improve as we integrate the business, eventually reaching our historical margins for that market.
During the quarter, we began to manage Barnabas Health's hospital laboratory operations under a new professional lab services, or PLS, agreement. Traditionally, these agreements, which represent organic revenue growth, cover management of inpatient and outpatient testing for the hospital and do not require the same level of services such as phlebotomy or logistics. Here, we bill and collect directly from the hospital. Due to the nature of this business, Barnabas will pressure our revenue per requisition as we move through the year. In addition, keep in mind that PLS margins for any given relationship will improve over time as we implement our processes and protocols but will lag our company-wide average.
We are very pleased with our first quarter performance, which was in line with our expectations. Given that, our guidance before special items continues to be the following: Revenues to be between $7.52 billion and $7.59 billion; adjusted diluted EPS, excluding amortization expense, to be between $5.02 and $5.17; adjusted cash provided by operations to approximate $1 billion; and capital expenditures to be between $250 million and $300 million.
Now let me turn it back to Steve."

And it's not just coding, it's also about looking at other things that go along with the services, how we leverage the information, how we share the information back with the providers as well as the payers, how we work through prior off processes when necessary, because many of the payers have different approaches to approvals, and what types of information they require to get paid on these claims. So as Steve mentioned, it's an evolving marketplace that will continue to move. And as PAMA moves forward, many of these codes could -- we would expect to get refreshed as well as part of the whole PAMA data collection process."

And as we said, with our relationship, there's 2 other areas that we want to collaborate with Quintiles. One is around deeper engagement with direct discovery around companion diagnostics and complementary diagnostics. And what we're doing is trying to understand where they engage with pharma, and where we can engage -- where we have real, specific opportunities to work together. And I would say that's opportunity by opportunity. And then second is now we can more smartly use our data and their data and other data to accelerate drug discovery. And again, I would describe it this way, as we have the dialogue, we've put in place an outline of higher -- how we'll approach it. There's some work underway, and we're testing the logic with some potential customers. So work is in progress, more to come. But we still believe there's still an opportunity there.

So that's the only other consideration, but there's nothing else in that performance that you should be taking into account. In terms of the revenue per req, which is not priced, we did have continued price headwinds, but they were more than offset to the extent that we actually got 1.1% left in our revenue per req, really driven by test mix. So test mix not only offsets price but actually gave us 110 basis points lift on a revenue per req, and that's certainly an outcome of some of the innovation that we've been driving on the new tests that we're introducing and our focus on higher-value offerings and really being price disciplined, as we continue to negotiate and operate in the market."

But as I said before in my comments, we can't lose sight there’s a large part of this country and this market that is also affected by all the other players, the regional players and the other Blues and we're as equally engaged in that portion of the market as well. So we think, going back to where I started, conceptually, given where the market is headed that it plays very nicely into what we're all about, which is being the strongest in what we do and very focused on Diagnostic Information Services that offer incredible value to delivering great quality health care at affordable prices. So nicely positioned for the short run, but also the long term."

And the 2 areas I would point to are access and value. And I think we do really well in both of those. So as a national lab, we can help to ensure that as this consolidation takes place, we're partnering with those payers. We can ensure that access remains or improves. And the second piece is, as you're aware, they already get excellent value from us. So we're part of the solution. And certainly, that doesn't require, in our minds, additional price concessions. We already can bring them tons of value by just further consolidation into Quest."

I don't believe I've ever made the statement that we need 2% volume growth in order to leverage margin. What I talked about was we're going to grow our earnings, not earnings per share, but earnings faster than our revenue growth. And really, we've been focused more on revenue than volume because as we've also talked about, not all volume is created equal, and there's definitely a fair amount of volume in this market that is not value creating. So we're focused on the volume that has a reasonable revenue, reasonable price. And as we do that, and we laid out a picture of 2% to 5% growth, which is 1% to 2% we said would come from M&A, and I also pointed out that I was not counting on significant earnings from -- on executed M&A when we talked at the Investor Day in late 2014. So really, the earnings were coming from the book of business largely that we had at the Investor Day, and we would grow that 8% to 10%. And I said there were 3 pieces to that: One was, we did get some continued synergy value early in 2015 for some of the acquisitions we had done in '14, including Solstice. The second piece was our Invigorate program being large enough to offset price headwinds that we anticipated as well as our wage inflation. And then the third piece was as we did improve our overall revenue momentum and turned to growth that we would get a drop-through and a reasonably high drop-through on that. So it doesn't require 2%. As I said a minute ago, any sort of revenue growth is going to have -- and especially in the short term a reasonably high drop-through. Now in terms of the balance of the year, we've given the guidance. So I'm not going to specifically do the math, but you can see what we're expecting in terms of overall revenue and our earnings. So I think you can see that we are projecting a consistent improvement in our margin but haven't talked about accelerating or decelerating or anything like that."

It's a big part of our growth strategy, and we saw a portion of our growth coming from that in this quarter. I mentioned, there's 2 aspects of our hospital strategy: One is related to what we call professional lab services, and a great example of that is what we're doing now with Barnabas and that's off and running in a good way. And so a portion of our growth came from Barnabas ramping up, and it’s just continuing to ramp up. Second is we do engage with hospital systems and typically in these conversations, some consider selling their business to us, their Outreach business. And Hartford Hospital is another great example of that happening, and we started the integration of Hartford. So that's off and running. So our hospital strategy is well underway. We feel good about the growth prospects. And then, your specific question is -- I will share that, and over the last several years, with health care becoming more and more consumer-oriented, we're becoming more consumer-oriented. And we have brought a lot to the marketplace in a variety of places. Let me comment on a few. First of all, we now serve up our results with an application called MyQuest. This came out about 2 years ago, and we're approaching 3 million registered -- registrations for that service, which is remarkable. People are quite interested in results, and we're serving that up. And for a small fee, we'll do a look back at their history. Second is, as you know, we have a great and growing wellness business that we invested in over the years and then also augmented with our acquisition of Summit where we're deeply engaged with employers and healthcare insurance companies. Third is, we have unparalleled access. To your specific question, we have over 2,200 patient service centers. We have over 3,500 phlebotomist and physician offices. So we have close to 6,000 access points for testing. And we're trying to understand how we can augment that with pilots that we're running. And we've done some work with Wal-Mart, where we have pilots off and running in some of their stores because they're looking at health care and how they can provide better access to health care in their stores. And what I'd also share is we're exploring other possibilities with retail in general, because I'll say retail in general is very interested -- interested in how they can assist with providing more access to health care. Because there's a fair percentage of ordered requisitions for laboratory testings that go unfulfilled. And we believe, if there's better and better access, it's an opportunity for us to fulfill those requisitions and provide better health care. So more to come on this, but we're becoming increasingly more and more consumer-focused and oriented, and when we have more, we'll share with you, but work is in progress."

And we're actually encouraged -- you might not have seen it. But actually this week, the House Appropriations Committee just included some new language in their Agriculture FDA Spending bill that just came out a committee, and what they're stating in this bill is that, in their view, the FDA should support what Congress is doing to try to put together a legislative solution for this FDA discussion that's going on and not issue their guidance. So that's just come out of committee, obviously needs to go through the House, and go through the Senate, but we're encouraged by that. We think that's a good piece of work. We're obviously supportive of that, and we're continuing to work on making sure that this goes through the process in Washington. So more to come.

As we mentioned, as we increase our professional laboratory services book of business, just based on the mathematics, that's going to reduce our revenue per requisition.

It's very heavy towards the back-end of the year as employers are getting ready for benefits enrollment plan, a lot of them sponsor that kind of testing later in the year. And that Wellness business does have a lower revenue per req. But as we've also shared, it doesn't necessarily mean a lower margin. So other than some of the quarter-to-quarter variability and then the mathematics as we build a book of business in PLS that might grow faster than our core book, really, you should expect that the revenue per req trend is something that as far as we're expecting will continue as we continue to come out with new innovative solutions which tend to have a higher price and a higher revenue per requisition."

But on a revenue price basis, it would put some pressure on that calculation, but it does not in any way affect our optimism about the opportunity of that business."

And part of that is to refocus on our Diagnostic Information Services business. We think the business is a good business. We think there's plenty of growth prospects in it, and we have our strategies to grow that business. And we're happy actually that -- if you go back and do a look back, and I've said this in my remarks, if you look at 2013. And with the CAGR since then, our Diagnostic Information Services business is up by 3%. Now included, Bill, in that 3% is our deliberate strategy to look for acquisitions that are strategically aligned with that strategy and that are accretive, that we can make money at. And we've said that we believe there's 1% to 2% top line growth from those type of acquisitions, and we continue to deliver on that. And Hartford Hospital continues to be a good example of that this year. And then finally, when it comes to our disciplined capital deployment, we've been, again, very consistent with doing what we said we would do, returning the majority of our free cash flow to our shareholders. We have been consistent with that in regards to raising our dividend, our share buyback program. And then finally, as we've been investing in the business, which is a big part of what we do every year with our capital budget. And then our acquisition strategy is consistent with our growth strategy and yet at the same time looking for those assets that we think we could make some money at. So we're doing what we said what we would do, and we're tracking well against it.

As Steve said, hopefully, as people look at what we laid out in 2012 that we've been doing what we told people we would do. So therefore, we always have a fiduciary responsibility to look at any opportunities for cash deployment that seems like the best way for our shareholders to recognize value and a return. At this point, we've been pretty consistent saying M&A of 1% to 2%, return a majority of free cash flow to shareholders. And so therefore, when you do the math, you can see that we could fund a 1% to 2% top line growth within our operating cash flow. As we've also said year-to-year, depending on what opportunities were there, we could always potentially spend a little more and drive a little more growth in one given year or we could potentially buy back more shares. So we're not going to be wed to any sort of formula because, as you might imagine, as we go for every deal, we want to make sure that any deployment of our cash and our capital is the best opportunity in that window to create shareholder value. So I also want to point out that by increasing the dividend 5x in a period of several years, we've gotten to a significant portion of that coming from the dividend and so versus the uncertainty of how much we might buy in a given year, so on and so forth. We've made a significant commitment to our ongoing shareholders to return a chunk of cash through that dividend. So that gets us most of the way to the 50%. And then anything beyond that in terms of share repurchases, are really going to be driven by, in a short period of time, a lack of M&A opportunities that's more value-creating than buying back shares. So nothing that you should expect in terms of significant changes in our leverage in the near term. Certainly, nothing you should expect, and I think your question was around more significant share buybacks. I certainly wouldn't go to the balance sheet to do that. So whatever we do will be driven by our operating cash flow or by some strategic asset divestitures, such as we did with ibrutinib in the past. And while we haven't said specifically what we're doing with Focus, we can assure you we'll deploy that cash in a manner that's consistent with what I just said."

But sequentially, it was up about 110 basis points, and if I go back in my model the last few years, it's usually 50 to 60 basis points sequentially. So just trying to get a sense of was there anything kind of moving parts here that was a little bit higher or lower than you were expecting either this quarter or last quarter?"

So first off, on the acquisitions. Yes, that was a Hartford Health acquisition. In terms of multiples, as I'm sure you can appreciate, there's really no multiple that makes sense in terms of the seller’s revenue and EBITDA. Because the business in our hands is completely different. So the revenue tends to be lower, as we've mentioned, as we move the reimbursement to our negotiated rates. But obviously, in all cases, when we do an acquisition, the EBITDA and the earnings are much better than what the seller had. So really, the best way to think about it is that, because we apply the financial metrics, which we do around a ROIC hurdle, around an MPV hurdle, and really driving the earnings accretion in the near term, the math would make it impossible for us to overpay. And so what I've said to people, on a pro forma basis, if you saw our models, you'd see that the multiple what we're paying on an EBITDA multiple is -- would not be above our overall market multiple. So it would be in the ballpark or lower. So you can feel good about, we're not going out and buying companies or assets or businesses at a significantly high premium. And then on the bad debt question. We did have a onetime favorable adjustment in Q4. If you look back at what we've shared in the quarter, so the bad debt was not a run rate Q4 bad debt. It was favorable, given a onetime collection that we had that helps Q4 disproportionately. So the sequential -- historical sequential would be impacted by that. And that's why you're seeing a larger increase from Q1 -- Q4 to Q1. But also the other thing is that we do have this continued increase in high deductible plans. And while our Invigorate program is very focused on offsetting a lot of that mix shift through earlier collections -- upfront collections at our PSCs and other initiatives that we have going on, the reality is that the bad debt rate on patient responsibility is an order of magnitude higher than the rest of our business. So we'll continue to work on that, and we expect to certainly mitigate that impact, but it does have some impact."

This morning, we'll provide you with highlights of the quarter, share a few comments on the industry dynamics and review progress on our 5-point strategy, then Mark will provide more detail on the results and take you through guidance. 
During the second quarter, revenues declined 1% on a reported basis with -- related to our efforts to refocus the business, but grew 2.4% on an equivalent basis. Reported EPS grew more than 69% while adjusted EPS grew more than 7%. 
Before I get into our strategy update, I'd like to provide perspective on a few key aspects of the final rule implementing provisions of the Protecting Access to Medicare Act, referred to as PAMA, issued late last month by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, referred to as CMS. 
First, on the issue of timing. We are pleased with CMS's decision to delay the implementation of the new payment system until January 1, 2018, a position advocated by members of Congress, hospitals and hospital -- excuse me, and laboratory trade association. 
Second, CMS changed its approach to secure a better view of market pricing. By gathering the pricing data from labs in a different way, CMS will increase the number of labs that provide pricing data. 
Then finally, we continue to evaluate the impact of this final rule, but we won't have a clear view until we see the final pricing data. 
In the meantime, CMS is estimating a mid-single-digit rate reduction in 2018. As you know, the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule represents approximately 12% of our revenues. And as we shared in the past, our Invigorate savings have more than compensated for price headwinds in the market. So if there is a fee reduction in 2018, we would be able to manage it. 
Now let me shift to the progress we are making on our 5-point strategy, which, as you recall, is to restore growth, drive operational excellence, simplify the organization, refocus on our diagnostic information service business and deliver disciplined capital deployment. 
So starting with growth. We delivered solid volume growth across a number of areas, including Prescription Drug Monitoring, hepatitis C testing and Cardio IQ, which provides a more complete picture of patients' cardiovascular health than basic cholesterol testing. 
We also grew the second quarter with help from our new hospital service agreements. Our acquisition of the Outreach Laboratory Service business of Clinical Laboratory Partners, referred to as CLP, and professional lab services agreements from Barnabas Health, are helping us deliver the continued execution of our accelerated growth plan. 
Additionally, in this quarter, we announced an agreement to manage the inpatient laboratory operation for 6 Denver-area hospitals in HealthONE system of ACA Healthcare. We expect to see revenues from this engagement before the end of the year. 
Hospitals continue to talk to us about how we can help them execute their lab strategy. From advanced hospital reference testing, to lab management, to joint ventures and outreach lab purchases. Our pipeline remains strong, and we continue to be encouraged by the growth opportunities. 
In advanced testing, we strengthened our service offering, which includes gene-based and esoteric tests. During the quarter, we announced the ability to 3 new Quest Vantage cancer tests. These are designed to provide clinical actionable insight into an individual's risk of developing forms of cancer. These new offerings will better position us in this exciting and growing marketplace. 
We piloted a program this quarter for noninvasive prenatal screening to serve women of average risks in select regions. We're encouraged by the results. We're now offering the testing nationally. 
We continue to drive operational excellence, the second element of our strategy. We believe quality and efficiency go hand in hand. And we have strong evidence of demonstrated improvement in our customer experience as we make our business more efficient. As we deliver cost savings, we're also able to improve quality and service. This is a well-understood principle of total quality management approaches across all industries. Evidence of this can be seen in the recent independent blinded survey of more than 500 physicians. In the survey, Quest scored highest on customer experience, lab effectiveness and patient satisfaction among national, regional and hospital competitors. 
Our recent agreement with Safeway will make it easier for people to get tested by locating our patient service centers in high-traffic Safeway supermarkets. By expanding patient access to our relationships with retailers, we will optimize our real estate footprint and have an opportunity to reduce the number of unfulfilled test orders, which some suggest could be as high as 30%. 
We're also shrinking our real estate footprint by consolidating our corporate sites. In June, we announced the relocation of our corporate headquarters and support functions from Madison in Lyndhurst, New Jersey to a single location when our current 10-year lease expires in September of 2017. By consolidating our footprint, we'll be able to get greater collaboration and performance while realizing savings in operating expenses. Our Invigorate cost-savings program continues on track to realize $1.3 billion in run rate savings as we exit 2017. 
We continue to simplify and strengthen our residual capabilities, the third element of our strategy. Also this quarter, we are proud to be recognized as 1 of 100 companies named to Forbes 2016 America's Most Trustworthy Companies List. The only company from the diagnostic services industry to be included. 
The fourth element of our strategy, to refocus our diagnostic information services business, was completed in May, following the completion of the sale of the Focus Diagnostics products business. Proceeds from the sale of Focus Products were used to drive the fifth element of our strategy, delivering disciplined capital deployment. We launched a $250 million accelerated share repurchase program, the ASR, with the Focus proceeds. And since 2012, we have repurchased approximately $2 billion of company stock. Additionally, in May, we issued $500 million in debt to take advantage of favorable interest rates and refinance a portion of our debt. 
We actually look forward to sharing more detail on our market views and strategic outlook at our third Investor Day in New York City on November 11. So mark your calendars, and we'll be providing more data about this as time goes on. 
Now Mark will provide an overview on the second quarter financial performance and provide you with an update on our 2016 outlook. Mark?"

Consolidated revenues of $1.91 billion were lower by 1% versus the prior year on a reported basis. Equivalent revenues grew 2.4% for the company. Revenues for diagnostic information services, or DIS for short, grew by 2.2% compared to the prior year. Volume, measured by the number of requisitions, increased 1.9% versus the prior year. Of the 1.9%, approximately half came from organic growth and the other half from recent acquisitions, including both CLP and Memorial Care. Through the first half of 2016, organic volume is up nearly 2%, a solid increase compared to the slight decline reported in the first half of 2015. Revenue per requisition in the second quarter increased 0.2% versus a year ago. As a reminder, a number of different elements impact revenue per req, including unit price variation, business mix and tests per req. Price headwinds were in line with our expectations, down slightly less than 1%. As we noted last quarter, our professional lab services, or PLS engagements, such as Barnabas Health and HCA, carry lower revenue per requisition due to the nature of the work we are performing. In Q2 2016, the year-over-year impact of growth in PLS was approximately 120 basis points on our aggregate revenue per req. In the second quarter, PLS was a larger mix of our business. And as we move through the year, we expect PLS to grow at a faster rate than the balance of our business. 
Reported operating income for the quarter was $422 million or 22.1% of revenues compared to $301 million or 15.6% of revenues a year ago. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $324 million or 17% of revenues compared to $321 million or 16.7% of revenues last year. Adjusted operating income benefited from stronger revenues in our Invigorate initiative, slightly offset by lower margins related to recent acquisitions, our growing professional lab services business and our efforts to refocus the company. The impact of our clinical trials and products businesses in the second quarter of 2015 benefited adjusted operating margins by approximately $15 million. 
As a reminder, the Clinical Trials business now appears on the equity earnings line. Also we no longer have operating earnings associated with the Focus Products business. And recall that we use the proceeds to repurchase shares. In total, our portfolio divestitures represented $169 million of revenues that were excluded to get to our equivalent revenues for 2015. 
Reported EPS was $1.37 in the quarter compared to $0.81 a year ago. The significant year-over-year increase was driven in large part by the gain on the sale of our Focus Diagnostics products business in the second quarter and charges on retirement of debt in the prior year. Adjusted EPS was $1.34, up from $1.25 last year. 
The company recorded special items with an after-tax benefit totaling $17 million in the quarter, representing a $34 million gain on the sale of the Focus Products business, offset by approximately $17 million of primarily restructuring and integration charges. The net impact of these items increased our reported EPS by $0.12. 
Bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues was 4.2%, 40 basis points better than the previous quarter and 10 basis points higher than 2015. As a reminder, bad debt expense typically improves modestly throughout the year as patients hit their health insurance deductibles. Note that the year-over-year compare is negatively impacted by the fact that our clinical trials and products businesses had a lower associated bad debt rate. When taking this into consideration, our bad debt rate year-over-year improved slightly. 
Our DSOs were 47 days, 3 days higher than last year and the prior quarter. This is driven by the timing of certain cash receipts, and we expect our DSOs to come down to levels similar to the prior year of the end of Q3. Through the first half of 2016, reported cash provided by operations was $464 million versus $337 million last year. Excluding charges associated with early debt retirement in the first half of 2016 and debt refinancing in the first half of 2015, adjusted operating cash flow was $502 million through June 30, 2016, up from $464 million in 2015. 
Capital expenditures were $104 million in the first half compared to $117 million a year ago. 
Before moving to guidance, I'd like to mention a few items for you to keep in mind to help you understand our outlook for the remainder of the year. First, the year-over-year impact of the contribution of our Clinical Trials business to the Q2 JV on our reported revenues ended in the second quarter of 2016. Recall, this transaction commenced at the beginning of our third quarter 2015. Second, for the Celera products business that we wound down towards the end of last year, we recognize nearly half of the 2015 revenues and operating earnings for this business in the third quarter of 2015 as customers executed their last-time buys. This will set up a difficult compare in the third quarter this year. As you think about the split for the remainder of the year, last year, we had approximately $10 million on a reported basis and $12 million on adjusted basis of Celera products operating income in Q3 and nothing in Q4. 
Finally, there are 2 notable items on our full year reported operating cash flow projections. The first relates to after-tax cash charges of $29 million on the retirement of debt that will impact 2016 operating cash flow. Second, we will incur a cash tax outlay of $91 million associated with the Focus divestiture that will be recorded in our operating cash flow despite recognizing the associated $275 million from the sale in our investing cash flow. Therefore, our adjusted operating cash flow for 2016 will exclude both items. 
Having noted these items, our 2016 outlook is as follows: revenues to be between $7.47 billion and $7.54 billion, flat to an increase of approximately 1% versus the prior year on a reported basis and an increase of 2% to 3% on an equivalent basis. Reported diluted EPS to be between $4.18 and $4.33. Adjusted EPS to be between $5.02 and $5.17. Cash provided by operations to be approximately $880 million on a reported basis and roughly $1 billion on an adjusted basis. And finally, capital expenditures to be between $250 million and $300 million. 
Now let me turn it back to Steve."

The same continues to grow at Barnabas. We continue to feel good about the progress made there. It continues to expand. And then you asked a question about HCA. HCA is not a joint venture. It is a contract. It's an agreement that we're helping them run their inpatient laboratories. And we're hopeful that, that will go well.

So again, goes hand in hand with our strategy around improving quality of the patient experience, at the same time, becoming more efficient. Then on the efficiency side, we are looking at where the stores are, where we have patient service centers. And where possible, we will optimize that and take some costs out. But in some cases, we're also augmenting our unparalleled access to the marketplace with some of their locations. So it actually allows us to get greater access. And we think of this market, to the last point I made in my introductory remarks, it's quite important for us to continue to get more and more access of -- for patients where they are. And retail has a great opportunity for us to continue to get more and more access. Because the data we have is about 30% of laboratory requisitions in the marketplace go unfulfilled. And so our notion is, if you gain more access, make it more convenient, make it easy to people go and get their laboratory requisitions fulfilled, it's going to be better for health care, it's going to be better for this industry.

So we, at this point, we've only given guidance for Invigorate to the end of 2017. Obviously, at some point, we'll give an update beyond that. So work -- we've got multiyear leases, in many cases, for the patient service centers. We are not going to dilute our volume and add a lot of incremental sites. So really, this is really going to be largely replacing patient service centers. So it's not going to ever 100% of our footprint, for a couple of reasons. One is for that because we want to make sure we're located where we need to be. And it may not always be retail opportunity. The second thing is we've got some patient service centers where we might have 4, 5 phlebotomists at a time. And given the limited space in a retail site, we're never going to be able to move those kind of centers fully into retail. So we see those great opportunity, but it's not going to be a full replacement in terms of its impact of our cost savings on Invigorate, which also is a revenue enhancement. It's going to play out the next couple of years."

So we did share the mix impact for professional laboratory services was headwind of 120 basis points. So you could back into everything else was the positive mix, but offset price and offset the mix of PLS to give us a net 20 basis point improvement of revenue per req. Now with that said, the reason we're very careful, Ricky, about separating price from mix is that while price definitely -- directionally, is an indication of profitability, mix is not always representative of profitability. So if -- we caution people. And as we've said over time, don't take [indiscernible] which is mix-driven as a signal for increased or decreased profitability."

And they estimate that as mid-single digits. And also what we said is, if we go back and look at our history, the reason why we have Invigorate and the reason why we continue to drive quality and efficiencies is to be able to absorb some of the headwinds. And obviously, through price concessions, and I treat this as true price concessions, as Mark just said, as one of the offset. So what we said, and what we believe, is when get there, we'll have to absorb this. And we will absorb this. So with that said, we've only provided guidance and an outlook for Invigorate through 2017. What I've said in my remarks, it's going to continue to be on track for that. It's $1.3 billion. It's an additional $600 million of what we achieved a couple of years ago. So we feel good about the progress made on that. And then what we also have said is that in any business, in any industry, you need to continue to drive efficiency and quality going forward past 2017. And we're not prepared at this point to talk about that. But given what we said earlier, obviously, we're going to have some efficiency gains in '18 to be able to offset any kind of price erosion. And we feel confident that we'll have those, given what we have in our perspective on the future. So that's what I can share this point, but we're encouraged by what we've learned in the visibility around PAMA. We're encouraged by Invigorate and the progress we're making there. And we're not done with that. We'll continue to make progress. And we'll deal with that in due course."

And what we said for the last 4 years is that our growth strategy is multifaceted. This business, this industry, has a number of products, a number of different programs, a number of different services. And we have to work multiple fronts. To answer your direct question about where we are encouraged, we are encouraged on continuing prospects around advanced diagnostics. The genetic offerings that we introduced this quarter are very strong. We feel they're very competitive now with some of the incumbents in the marketplace, particularly around our BRCA offering. We expanded our panel. We have a now very nice comprehensive hereditary-based panel. And as you know, we continue to build on our relationship with Memorial Sloan-Kettering in that space. Yes, we offer some nice offerings around colorectal cancer as well as comprehensive hereditary cancer panel. So that is good and growing and a lot of promise in front of it. Second is we talked about the work around hepatitis C. Continues to be a great opportunity for us. Last quarter, we talked about the companion diagnostics associated with it --  it's promising. And third, is Prescription Drug Monitoring, continues to be a big opportunity for us. It's growing. We're pleased with our progress. And as you know, in this country, there's a lot of renewed interest around pain meds and opiates. And this [indiscernible] right in the middle of that whole debate. And we're part of the solution to that problem. And with that, we're coupling that with our hospital services business, which we've been working on for the past 4 years. You're starting to see the fruits of our efforts there. We're very pleased with our announcement of Barnabas. We're very pleased with the acquisition of our Hartford Hospital Outreach relationship, which again is a purchase. But at the same time, it builds a relationship with Hartford Hospital. We're very pleased with our first work with HCA. And as I said, there's many more prospects in our funnel that we continue to be happy about. Now with that said, the last question is, ""Where do you think there's more promise?"" I think this last piece, the strategy around hospitals, is something that I believe will continue to be a great growth driver for us. As I work the country and speak with our teams and speak with hospital CEOs and their management teams, they clearly can't do it all themselves. And they're looking for partnerships. And they realize that all we do every day is diagnostic information services. And where we have these relationships and those organizations, they realize that they best serve -- serving their population and doing best in their business by relying on us for their diagnostic information services business. So I think there's a lot more growth opportunities going forward than what we've seen so far. I'm optimistic about that. Thank you for the question."

It's another contributing factor. When we have conversations with hospital systems, they talk about changing nature of their business, to moving away from fee-for-service, to taking risk. When you move to risk, they need to have a low-cost provider. There's no question we're a lower-cost provider than typically their hospital lab is. And they have a lot of other priorities. And why would they put the next dollar of investments into laboratory when they have a good national leader nearby. And so that's typically the conversation we have. And they realize that there's going to be price pressure on the commercial rates in every place. And yes, their laboratory commercial rates will be under pressure, but also they understand Medicare is not going to also provide a lot of help as well. So there can be pressure there. So it's contributing, but it's not necessarily, I would say, an overall driver so far. But with all that said, I think people will realize that there will be -- with all this analysis for interest and going forward, it's hard to say beyond what the estimate was of mid-single digits in 2018, how that will affect specific labs. So that estimate is based upon the market basket the CMS sees with all their expenditures for the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule. And so when you specifically apply whatever cuts there might be to a specific business, it could be considerable for small operators. They're doing most of the routine testing in small geography. And they're not billing out all the quotes like we do for the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule for Medicare. So it's evolving, but still more to learn, but I think we've got a lot more clarity today than we did 6 months ago."

Every deal has got its own nuances, as you can appreciate. And you have to separate. When we buy an outreach business, that's [indiscernible] purchase of their existing commercial business. And in the case -- a good example of that is what we have in Hartford Hospital and CLP, which we closed and in the process of integrating. And I've characterized those deals as being similar to the other ones we've done. We take over the business. We reprice at lower rates. We've build a case around taking out cost. And we think returns for shareholders are quite good. But what they'll also say, and I said this in my introductory remarks, when we typically do that, we typically get gets us into a broader conversation about their lab strategy. So typically, you're saying, ""Well, we're tight with you. Let's talk about our advanced testing for hospitals or what's called reference testing. And let's talk about how you could potentially help us with our hospital inpatient laboratory to make it that more efficient."" So typically, it becomes a beachhead opportunity for us to build a stronger relationship. The second type of relationship, A.J., is we have an engagement, a professional services engagement like the one we have with Barnabas. And that's a services relationship. It's multiyear. We're providing service for a fee. We believe certain -- we agree on certain conditions of delivery and payment. And we run it as that. Again, when we get in those relationships, because this is all around their inpatient laboratory, we then typically get in a conversation around their outreach business, because it is that something they want to continue to stay in? Can they help them with it? And second is the advanced testing with a reference testing business. So we have that conversation as well. And I would say the third example is where -- there is a broader deeper relationship where we think it might be prudent for us to form a joint venture in some form. And the most recent example of us doing that is with University of Massachusetts medical Center, where we bought their outreach business, but we also helped them in many different ways in Central Massachusetts. And so they actually have a small minority stake in that joint venture. So we're deeply embedded together and making that work in Central Mass. So all different sizes and shapes in how we work with hospital systems, which reflects the marketplace. I think part of our strategy here as well is what we're showing to the marketplace is where a company and an organization that can manage in this very, very dynamic space. And you can work with Quest in whatever way makes sense. Obviously, we want a deal going to work with both sides. But we are flexible and prudent in how we put together those relationships. But again, you see one deal, you see one deal. So hopefully, that's helpful in providing you with more color [indiscernible]"

So I think it all fits, Isaac. And it's really has to do with the timing of some of the work that we're doing, where we consume our capital. And certainly, part of that is some equipment refresh, some of that is tied to our Invigorate program such as the lab standardization work. And it's really driven by we're executing some of those conversions. So there's really nothing unusual or atypical, I would say in our capital spend this year. But I think the good news is that we're expecting to spend less this year than we did last year.

And then in that regard, we have our normal cadence of how we work through that this year, next year and into '18. Generally, given our leadership position in this marketplace, we're fortunate to be included in most of the health care insurance contracts throughout the country. And I think, increasingly, I mean you got obvious -- it's good for patients, it's good for them attracting membership that they have Quest on contract. Now despite us maybe not having a preferred national relationship, in some cases, we still continue to have strong working relationships with some of those health care insurance companies that we don't enjoy those relationships. And also we continue to see other ways of working together with some of those systems. So won't speculate on or give more specifics on contract dates and timing of all that, but we imagine a new quarters.

An example of that we sell it to Aetna. We sell it to CIGNA and we also sell it United Optimum, as an example. We also are perpetually asked for data. We test about 50% of adult Americans in the year -- excuse me, in the course of 3 years. Having that data is quite important to health care insurance companies. So we're quite collaborative with in the industry of serving up our data to help them manage some of their managed Medicaid or managed Medicare business in a collaborative way. So 2 examples there. And the third example is within Inovalon, which is our data analytic products, which is part of our new product introduction that we made this year around Quantum. And we serve this up to all health care insurance companies, regardless of what we have for the laboratory contract. And so we're proactively working with all the companies taking risk. And so it puts us again in a different place with all health care insurance companies in a much different and broader way.

This morning, we'll provide you with highlights of the quarter, share a few comments on industry dynamics and review progress on our 5-point strategy, then Mark will provide more detail on the results and take you through guidance.
During the second quarter, revenues declined 1% on a reported basis related to our efforts to refocus the business, but grew 2.4% on an equivalent basis. Reported EPS grew more than 69% while adjusted EPS grew more than 7%.
Before I get into our strategy update, I'd like to provide perspective on a few key aspects of the final rule implementing provisions of the Protecting Access to Medicare Act, referred to as PAMA, issued late last month by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, referred to as CMS.
First, on the issue of timing. We are pleased with CMS' decision to delay the implementation of the new payment system until January 1, 2018, a position advocated by members of Congress, hospitals and hospital -- excuse me, and laboratory trade associations.
Second, CMS changed its approach to secure a better view of market pricing. By gathering the pricing data from labs in a different way, CMS will increase the number of labs that provide pricing data.
And then finally, we continue to evaluate the impact of this final rule, but we won't have a clearer view until we see the final pricing data.
In the meantime, CMS is estimating a mid-single-digit rate reduction in 2018. As you know, the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule represents approximately 12% of our revenues. As we've shared in the past, our Invigorate savings have more than compensated for price headwinds in the market. So if there is a fee reduction in 2018, we would be able to manage it.
Now let me shift to the progress we're making on our 5-point strategy, which, as you recall, is to restore growth, drive operational excellence, simplify the organization, refocus on our diagnostic information service business and deliver disciplined capital deployment.
So starting with growth. We delivered solid volume growth across a number of areas, including Prescription Drug Monitoring, hepatitis C testing and Cardio IQ, which provides a more complete picture of patients' cardiovascular health than basic cholesterol testing.
We also grew the second quarter with the help from our new hospital service agreements. Our acquisition of the Outreach Laboratory Service business of Clinical Laboratory Partners, referred to as CLP, and professional lab services agreements from Barnabas Health are helping us deliver the continued execution of our accelerated growth plan.
Additionally, in this quarter, we announced an agreement to manage the inpatient laboratory operations for 6 Denver area hospitals in HealthONE system of HCA Healthcare. We expect to see revenues from this engagement before the end of the year.
Hospitals continued to talk to us about how we can help them execute their lab strategy, from advanced hospital reference testing to lab management to joint ventures and outreach lab purchases. Our pipeline remains strong, and we continue to be encouraged by the growth opportunities.
In advanced testing, we strengthened our service offering, which includes gene-based and esoteric tests. During the quarter, we announced the availability [ph] of the 3 new Quest Vantage cancer tests. These are designed to provide clinical actionable insight into an individual's risk of developing hereditary [ph] forms of cancer. These new offerings will better position us in this exciting and growing marketplace.
We piloted a program this quarter for noninvasive prenatal screening to serve women of average risk in select regions. Encouraged by the results, we're now offering the testing nationally.
We continue to drive operational excellence, the second element of our strategy. We believe quality and efficiency go hand in hand. And we have strong evidence of demonstrated improvement in our customer experience as we make our business more efficient. As we deliver cost savings, we're also able to improve quality and service. This is a well-understood principle of total quality management approaches across all industries. Evidence of this can be seen in the recent independent blinded survey of more than 500 physicians. In the survey, Quest scored highest on customer experience, lab effectiveness and patient satisfaction among national, regional and hospital competitors.
Our recent agreement with Safeway will make it easier for people to get tested by locating our patient service centers in high-traffic Safeway supermarkets. By expanding patient access through our relationships with retailers, we will optimize our real estate footprint and have an opportunity to reduce the number of unfulfilled test orders, which some suggest could be as high as 30%.
We're also shrinking our real estate footprint by consolidating our corporate sites. In June, we announced the relocation of our corporate headquarters and support functions from Madison and Lyndhurst, New Jersey to a single location when our current 10-year lease expires in September of 2017. By consolidating our footprint, we'll be able to get greater collaboration and performance while realizing savings in operating expenses. Our Invigorate cost-savings program continues on track to realize $1.3 billion in run rate savings as we exit 2017.
We continue to simplify and strengthen our residual capabilities, the third element of our strategy. Also this quarter, we are proud to be recognized as 1 of 100 companies named to Forbes 2016 America's Most Trustworthy Companies list, the only company from the diagnostic services industry to be included.
The fourth element of our strategy, to refocus our diagnostic information services business, was completed in May, following the completion of the sale of the Focus Diagnostics products business. Proceeds from the sale of Focus Products were used to drive the fifth element of our strategy, delivering disciplined capital deployment. We launched a $250 million accelerated share repurchase program, ASR, with the Focus proceeds. And since 2012, we have repurchased approximately $2 billion of company stock. Additionally, in May, we issued $500 million in debt to take advantage of favorable interest rates and refinance a portion of our debt.
We actually look forward to sharing more detail on our market views and strategic outlook at our third Investor Day in New York City on November 11. So mark your calendars, and we'll be providing more data about this as time goes on.
Now Mark will provide an overview on the second quarter financial performance and provide you with an update on our 2016 outlook. Mark?"

Starting with revenues. Consolidated revenues of $1.91 billion were lower by 1% versus the prior year on a reported basis. Equivalent revenues grew 2.4% for the company. Revenues for diagnostic information services or DIS for short grew by",1067,"Thanks, Steve. Starting with revenues. Consolidated revenues of $1.91 billion were lower by 1% versus the prior year on a reported basis. Equivalent revenues grew 2.4% for the company. Revenues for diagnostic information services or DIS for short grew by 2.2% compared to the prior year. Volume, measured by the number of requisitions, increased 1.9% versus the prior year. Of the 1.9%, approximately half came from organic growth and the other half from recent acquisitions, including both CLP and Memorial Care.
Through the first half of 2016, organic volume is up nearly 2%, a solid increase compared to the slight decline reported in the first half of 2015. Revenue per requisition in the second quarter increased 0.2% versus a year ago. As a reminder, a number of different elements impact revenue per req, including unit price variation, business mix and tests per req.
Price headwinds were in line with our expectations, down slightly less than 1%. As we noted last quarter, our professional lab services or PLS engagements, such as Barnabas Health and HCA, carry lower revenue per requisition due to the nature of the work we are performing. In Q2 2016, the year-over-year impact of growth in PLS was approximately 120 basis points on our aggregate revenue per req. In the second quarter, PLS was a larger mix of our business. And as we move through the year, we expect PLS to grow at a faster rate than the balance of our business.
Reported operating income for the quarter was $422 million or 22.1% of revenues compared to $301 million or 15.6% of revenues a year ago. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $324 million or 17% of revenues compared to $321 million or 16.7% of revenues last year. Adjusted operating income benefited from stronger revenues and our Invigorate initiative, slightly offset by lower margins related to recent acquisitions, our growing professional lab services business and our efforts to refocus the company. The impact of our Clinical Trials and products businesses in the second quarter of 2015 benefited adjusted operating margins by approximately $15 million.
As a reminder, the Clinical Trials business now appears on the equity earnings line. Also, we no longer have operating earnings associated with the Focus Products business and recall that we use the proceeds to repurchase shares. In total, our portfolio divestitures represented $169 million of revenues that were excluded to get to our equivalent revenues for 2015.
Reported EPS was $1.37 in the quarter compared to $0.81 a year ago. The significant year-over-year increase was driven in large part by the gain on the sale of our Focus Diagnostics products business in the second quarter and charges on retirement of debt in the prior year. Adjusted EPS was $1.34, up from $1.25 last year.
The company recorded special items with an after-tax benefit totaling $17 million in the quarter, representing a $34 million gain on the sale of the Focus Products business, offset by approximately $17 million of primarily restructuring and integration charges. The net impact of these items increased our reported EPS by $0.12.
Bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues was 4.2%, 40 basis points better than the previous quarter and 10 basis points higher than 2015. As a reminder, bad debt expense typically improves modestly throughout the year as patients hit their health insurance deductibles. Note that the year-over-year compare is negatively impacted by the fact that our Clinical Trials and products businesses had a lower associated bad debt rate. When taking this into consideration, our bad debt rate year-over-year improved slightly.
Our DSOs were 47 days, 3 days higher than last year and the prior quarter. This is driven by the timing of certain cash receipts, and we expect our DSOs to come down to levels similar to the prior year by the end of Q3.
Through the first half of 2016, reported cash provided by operations was $464 million versus $337 million last year. Excluding charges associated with early debt retirement in the first half of 2016 and debt refinancing in the first half of 2015, adjusted operating cash flow was $502 million through June 30, 2016, up from $464 million in 2015. Capital expenditures were $104 million in the first half compared to $117 million a year ago.
Before moving to guidance, I'd like to mention a few items for you to keep in mind to help you understand our outlook for the remainder of the year. First, the year-over-year impact of the contribution of our Clinical Trials business to the Q2 JV on our reported revenues ended in the second quarter of 2016. Recall, this transaction commenced at the beginning of our third quarter 2015.
Second, for the Celera products business that we wound down toward the end of last year, we recognized nearly half of the 2015 revenues and operating earnings for this business in the third quarter of 2015 as customers executed their last-time buys. This will set up a difficult compare in the third quarter this year. As you think about the split for the remainder of the year, last year, we had approximately $10 million on a reported basis and $12 million on adjusted basis of Celera products operating income in Q3 and nothing in Q4. 
Finally, there are 2 notable items on our full year reported operating cash flow projections. The first relates to after-tax cash charges of $29 million on the retirement of debt that will impact 2016 operating cash flow. Second, we will incur a cash tax outlay of $91 million associated with the Focus divestiture that will be recorded in our operating cash flow despite recognizing the associated $275 million from the sale in our investing cash flow. Therefore, our adjusted operating cash flow for 2016 will exclude both items.
Having noted these items, our 2016 outlook is as follows: revenues to be between $7.47 billion and $7.54 billion, flat to an increase of approximately 1% versus the prior year on a reported basis and an increase of 2% to 3% on an equivalent basis; reported diluted EPS to be between $4.18 and $4.33; adjusted EPS to be between $5.02 and $5.17; cash provided by operations to be approximately $880 million on a reported basis and roughly $1 billion on an adjusted basis; and finally, capital expenditures to be between $250 million and $300 million.
Now let me turn it back to Steve."

First of all, as I say mentioned in my remarks, the interest of hospital CEOs, CFOs and their teams to work with us on their lab strategy is growing.

And once we engage and we have these [ph] steps on the relationship, I would say the relationship continues to grow. And we are their strategic partner for diagnostic information services. The same continues to grow at Barnabas. We couldn't feel [ph] good about the progress made there and it continues to expand. And then you asked a question about HCA. HCA is not a joint venture. It is a contract. It's an agreement that we're helping them run their inpatient laboratories. And we're hopeful that, that will go well. And it could potentially provide us with more opportunities going forward, but one step at a time. Our job right now to do a good job in the Denver area in this division. And we take it from there.

Well, first of all, there's 3 aspects of the work we've done with retailers, and Safeway is a good example. First of all is to improve the patient experience.

If you've seen any of the Safeway clinics or health care centers, they're very nice. And so it provides a really nice, fresh patient experience for our patients. So we're pleased with that. So again, it goes hand in hand with our strategy around improving quality of the patient experience, at the same time, becoming more efficient. Then on the efficiency side, we are looking at where the stores are, where we have patient service centers. And where possible, we will optimize that and take some costs out. But in some cases, there are some cases we're also augmenting our unparalleled access to the marketplace with some of their locations. So it actually allows us to get greater access. Then we think of this market, to the last point I made in my introductory remarks, it's quite important for us to continue to get more and more access of -- for patients where they. I mean, retail has a great opportunity for us to continue to get more and more access because the data that we have is -- about 30% of laboratory requisitions in the marketplace go unfulfilled. And so our notion is, if you gain more access, make it more convenient, make it easy for people to go and get their laboratory requisitions fulfilled, it's going to be better for health care, it's going to be better for this industry. So that's our strategy."

And certainly, we believe that it's an opportunity to grow our business faster by making our sites more accessible, making things more convenient, making it a more positive experience. But in terms of the other question around Invigorate, you can imagine that there's going to -- our retail strategy is going to work through over time. So we, at this point, we've only given guidance on Invigorate until the end of 2017. Obviously, at some point, we'll give an update beyond then. So we're -- we've got multiyear leases, in many cases, for our patient service centers. We are not going to dilute our volume and add a lot of incremental sites. So really, this is really largely going to be replacing patient service centers. So it's not going to be ever 100% of our footprint, for a couple of reasons. One is for that [ph] because we want to make sure we're located where we need to be, and it may not always be a retail opportunity. The second thing is we've got some patient service centers where we might have 4, 5 phlebotomists at a time. And given the limited space in a retail site, we're never going to be able to move those kind of centers fully into retail. So we see that as great opportunity, but it's not going to be a full replacement in terms of its impact of our cost savings on Invigorate, which also is revenue enhancement. It's going to play out over the next couple of years."

So what we did share is the mix impact for professional laboratory services was headwind of 120 basis points. So you could back into -- everything else was the positive mix, but offset price and offset the mix of PLS to give us a net 20 basis point improvement in revenue per req. Now with that said, the reason we're very careful, Ricky, about separating price from mix is that while price definitely -- directionally is an indication of profitability, mix is not always representative of profitability. So if -- we caution people. And as we've said over time, don't take math which is mix-driven as a signal for increased or decreased profitability."

And we'll see, when we get to 2018, if there is a price reduction and how much it is, and they estimate that as mid-single digits. And also, what we said is, if you go back and look at our history, the reason why we have Invigorate and the reason why we continue to drive quality and efficiency is to be able to absorb some of the headwinds. And obviously, true price concessions, and I treat this as true price concessions, as Mark just said, as one of the offsets. So what we said and what we believe is when get there, we'll have to absorb this and we will absorb this. So with that said, we've only provided guidance and an outlook for Invigorate through 2017. What I said in my remarks, it's going to continue to be on track for that. It's $1.3 billion. It's an additional $600 million of what we achieved a couple of years ago. So we feel good about the progress made on that. And then what we also have said is that in any business, in any industry, you need to continue to drive efficiency and quality going forward past 2017. And we're not prepared at this point to talk about that. But given what I said earlier, obviously, we're going to have to have some efficiency gains in '18 to be able to offset any kind of price erosion.

And what we said for the last 4 years is that our restore growth strategy is multifaceted. This business, this industry, has a number of products, a number of different programs, a number of different services and we have to work multiple fronts. To answer your direct question about where we are encouraged, we are encouraged about the continued prospects around advanced diagnostics, the genetic offerings that we introduce this quarter are very strong. We feel they're very competitive now with some of the incumbents in the marketplace, particularly around our BRCA offering. We expanded our panel. We have a now very nice comprehensive hereditary-based panel. And as you know, we continue to build on our relationship with Memorial Sloan Kettering in that space. Yes, we offer some nice offerings around colorectal cancer as well as a comprehensive hereditary cancer panel. So that is good and growing and a lot of promise in front of it.

And then third is Prescription Drug Monitoring, continues to be a big opportunity for us. It's growing. We're pleased with our progress. And as you know, in this country, there's a lot of renewed interest around pain meds and opiates and best use of those and -- right in the middle of that whole debate, and we're part of the solution to that problem. And with that, we're coupling that with our hospital services business, which we've been working on for the past 4 years. You're starting to see the fruits of our efforts there. We're very pleased with our announcement of Barnabas. We're very pleased with the acquisition of our Hartford Hospital Outreach relationship, which again is a purchase. But at the same time, it builds a relationship with Hartford Hospital. We're very pleased with our first work with HCA. And as I said, there's many more prospects in our funnel that we continue to be happy about. Now with that said, the last question is, ""Where do you think there's more promise?"" I think this last piece, the strategy around hospitals, is something that I believe will continue to be a great growth driver for us. As I work the country and speak with our teams and speak with hospital CEOs and their management teams, they clearly can't do it all themselves, and they're looking for partnerships. And they realize that all we do every day is diagnostic information services. And where we have these relationships are in those organizations that realize they best serve -- serving their population and doing best in their business by relying on us for their diagnostic information services business. So I think there's a lot more growth opportunities going forward than what we've seen so far, and I'm optimistic about that. Thank you for the question."

We believe that it looks promising for us and it provides more prospects for growth. And we continue to work the reimbursement side of this to demonstrate with good clinical evidence then the fact that it's actually delivering value that's actionable because only when you can defend that you have good clinical value and it is actionable, then you will get paid by health care insurance companies.

But there might be some correlation between PAMA and that. It's another contributing factor. When we have conversations with hospital systems, they talk about the changing nature of their business, they're moving away from fee-for-service to taking risk. When you move to risk, they need to have a low-cost provider. There's no question we're a lower-cost provider than typically their hospital lab is, and they have a lot of other priorities. And why would they put the next dollar of investments into laboratory when they have a good national leader nearby? And so that's typically the conversation we have. And they realize that there's going to be price pressure on the commercial rates in every place. And yes, their laboratory commercial rates will be under pressure. But also, they understand Medicare is not going to also provide a lot of help as well. So there can be pressure there. So it's contributing, but it's not necessarily, I would say, an overall driver so far. But with all that said, I think people will realize that there will be -- within all this analysis for interest in it going forward, it's hard to say, beyond what the estimate was of mid-single digits in 2018, how that will affect specific labs. So that estimate is based upon the market basket that CMS sees, where -- all their expenditures for the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule. And so when you specifically apply whatever cuts there might be to a specific business, it could be considerable for small operators. They're doing mostly routine testing in a small geography. And they're not billing out all the codes like we do for the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule for Medicare. So it's unfolding but still more to learn, but I think we've got a lot more clarity today than we did 6 months ago."

Because health care is complex, every deal has got its own nuances, as you can appreciate. And you have to separate. When we buy an outreach business, that's an outright purchase of their existing commercial business. And in the case -- a good example of that is what we do with Hartford Hospital and CLP, which we've closed and we're in the process of integrating. And I've characterized those deals as being similar to the other ones we've done. We take over the business. We reprice it at our rates. We build a business case around taking out cost, and we think the returns for shareholders are quite good. But what I'll also say, and I said this in my introductory remarks, when we typically do that, we typically -- it gets us into a broader conversation about their lab strategy. And so typically, they're saying, ""Well, okay, now we're tight with you. Let's talk about our advanced testing for hospitals or what's called reference testing, and let's talk about how you potentially could help us with our hospital inpatient laboratory in making that more efficient."" So typically, it becomes a beachhead opportunity for us to build a stronger relationship. The second type of relationship, A.J., is we have an engagement, a professional services engagement like the one we have with Barnabas. And that's a services relationship. It's multiyear. We're providing service for a fee. We believe at certain -- we agree on certain conditions of delivery and payment. And we run it as that. And again, when we get in those relationships, because this is all around their inpatient laboratory, we then typically get in a conversation around their outreach business because that's something they want to continue to stay in. Can we help them with it? And second is their advanced testing for their reference testing business. So we have that conversation as well. And I would say, the third example is where -- there is a broader, deeper relationship where we think it might be prudent for us to form a joint venture in some form. And the most recent example of us doing that is with University of Massachusetts Medical Center, where we bought their outreach business, but we also helped them in many different ways in Central Massachusetts. And so they actually have a small minority stake in that joint venture. So we're deeply embedded together in making that work in Central Mass. So all different sizes and shapes of how we work with hospital systems, those reflect the marketplace. I think part of our strategy here as well is what we're showing to the marketplace is where a company and an organization that can manage in this very, very dynamic space. And you can work with Quest in whatever way makes sense. Obviously, we want a deal that's going to work for both sides. But we are flexible and prudent in how we put together those relationships. But again, you see one deal, you see one deal. So hopefully, that's helpful in providing you with more color [indiscernible]."

Obviously, between the dividend, the share repurchases we've done through the first half of the year, we've met our commitment of guaranteeing a majority of our free cash flow to our shareholders. So we've met that threshold. So the back half, depending on the timing and probability of executing any sort of deals, the cash flow will be utilized for that. And if we don't have value-creating deals, then we close in that time frame, then we will -- as opposed to sitting on the cash, we would do some additional repurchases."

We are slightly lower this year versus last year by a little over $10 million for the first 2 -- 6 months of the year. We're guiding to a number that's similar to slightly less than we spent last year. So I think it all fits, Isaac. And it's really has to do with the timing of some of the work that we're doing, where we consume our capital. And certainly, a part of that is some equipment refresh, some of that is tied to our Invigorate program such as the lab standardization work. And it's really driven by when we're executing some of those conversions. So there's really nothing unusual or atypical, I would say, in our capital spend this year. But I think the good news is that we're expecting to spend less this year than we did last year. And as we move forward, as we've mentioned, we're looking to get some of this high level of capital for Invigorate behind us and really return to a little lower level than we have versus the last couple of years as a proportion of a total operating cash flow and as a proportion of revenue."

And I think, increasingly, I mean, you got obvious [ph] -- it's good for patients, it's good for them attracting membership that they have Quest on contract. Now despite us maybe not having a preferred national relationship, in some cases, we still continue to have strong working relationships with some of those health care insurance companies that we don't enjoy those relationships. And also, we continue to see other ways of working together with some of those systems. So won't speculate on or give specifics on contract dates and timing of all that, but we're imagining [ph] this in new quarters.

An example of that is we sell it to Aetna, we sell it to CIGNA, but we also sell it United Optum, as an example. We also are perpetually asked for data. We test about 50% of adult Americans every year -- excuse me, in the course of 3 years. Having that data is quite important to health care insurance companies. So we're quite collaborative with the industry of serving up our data to help them manage some of their managed Medicaid or managed Medicare business in a collaborative way. So 2 examples in that. And the third example is with Inovalon, which is our data analytics product, which is part of our new product introduction that we've made this year around Quantum. And we serve this up to all health care insurance companies, so regardless of what we have for the laboratory contract. And so we're proactively working with all the companies that are taking risk. And so it puts us again in a different place with all health care insurance companies in a much different and broader way. So we often think about our laboratory contract, but our relationship with these systems are much broader than that.

This morning we'll provide you with highlights of the quarter, share a few comments on industry dynamics and review progress on our 5-point strategy, then Mark will provide more detail on the results and take you through guidance.
During the second quarter, revenues declined 1% on a reported basis related to our efforts to refocus the business, but grew 2.4% on an equivalent basis. Reported EPS grew more than 69% while adjusted EPS grew more than 7%.
Before I get into our strategy update, I'd like to provide perspective on a few key aspects of the final rule implementing provisions of the Protecting Access to Medicare Act, referred to as PAMA, issued late last month by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, referred to as CMS.
First, on the issue of timing. We are pleased with CMS's decision to delay the implementation of the new payment system until January 1, 2018, a position advocated by members of Congress, hospitals and hospital -- excuse me, and laboratory trade associations.
Second, CMS changed its approach to secure a better view of market pricing. By gathering the pricing data from labs in a different way, CMS will increase the number of labs that provide pricing data.
Then finally, we continue to evaluate the impact of this final rule, but we won't have a clearer view until we see the final pricing data.
In the meantime, CMS is estimating a mid-single-digit rate reduction in 2018. As you know, the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule represents approximately 12% of our revenues. As we've shared in the past, our Invigorate savings have more than compensated for price headwinds in the market. So if there is a fee reduction in 2018, we would be able to manage it.
Now let me shift to the progress we're making on our 5-point strategy, which, as you recall, is to restore growth, drive operational excellence, simplify the organization, refocus on our diagnostic information service business and deliver disciplined capital deployment.
So starting with growth. We delivered solid volume growth across a number of areas, including Prescription Drug Monitoring, hepatitis C testing and Cardio IQ, which provides a more complete picture of patients' cardiovascular health than basic cholesterol testing.
We also grew the second quarter with the help from our new hospital service agreements. Our acquisition of the Outreach Laboratory Service business of Clinical Laboratory Partners, referred to as CLP, and professional lab services agreements from Barnabas Health are helping us deliver the continued execution of our accelerated growth plan.
Additionally, in this quarter, we announced an agreement to manage the inpatient laboratory operations for 6 Denver area hospitals in HealthONE system of HCA Healthcare. We expect to see revenues from this engagement before the end of the year.
Hospitals continue to talk to us about how we can help them execute their lab strategy, from advanced hospital reference testing to lab management to joint ventures and outreach lab purchases. Our pipeline remains strong, and we continue to be encouraged by the growth opportunities.
In advanced testing, we strengthened our service offering, which includes gene-based and esoteric tests. During the quarter, we announced availability [ph] of 3 new Quest Vantage cancer tests. These are designed to provide clinical actionable insight into an individual's risk of developing hereditary forms of cancer. These new offerings will better position us in this exciting and growing marketplace.
We piloted a program this quarter for noninvasive prenatal screening to serve women of average risk in select regions. Encouraged by the results, we're now offering the testing nationally.
We continue to drive operational excellence, the second element of our strategy. We believe quality and efficiency go hand in hand. And we have strong evidence of demonstrated improvement in our customer experience as we make our business more efficient. As we deliver cost savings, we're also able to improve quality and service. This is a well-understood principle of total quality management approaches across all industries. Evidence of this can be seen in the recent independent blinded survey of more than 500 physicians. In the survey, Quest scored highest on customer experience, lab effectiveness and patient satisfaction among national, regional and hospital competitors.
Our recent agreement with Safeway will make it easier for people to get tested by locating our patient service centers in high-traffic Safeway supermarkets. By expanding patient access through our relationships with retailers, we will optimize our real estate footprint and have an opportunity to reduce the number of unfulfilled test orders, which some suggest could be as high as 30%.
We're also shrinking our real estate footprint by consolidating our corporate sites. In June, we announced the relocation of our corporate headquarters and support functions from Madison and Lyndhurst, New Jersey to a single location when our current 10-year lease expires in September of 2017. By consolidating our footprint, we'll be able to get greater collaboration and performance while realizing savings in operating expenses. Our Invigorate cost-savings program continues on track to realize $1.3 billion in run rate savings as we exit 2017.
We continue to simplify and strengthen our residual capabilities, the third element of our strategy. Also this quarter, we are proud to be recognized as 1 of 100 companies named to Forbes 2016 America's Most Trustworthy Companies list, the only company from the diagnostic services industry to be included.
The fourth element of our strategy, to refocus our diagnostic information services business, was completed in May, following the completion of the sale of the Focus Diagnostics products business. Proceeds from the sale of Focus Products were used to drive the fifth element of our strategy, delivering disciplined capital deployment. We launched a $250 million accelerated share repurchase program, ASR, with the Focus proceeds. And since 2012, we have repurchased approximately $2 billion of company stock. Additionally, in May, we issued $500 million in debt to take advantage of favorable interest rates and refinance a portion of our debt.
We actually look forward to sharing more detail on our market views and strategic outlook at our third Investor Day in New York City on November 11. So mark your calendars, and we'll be providing more data about this as time goes on.
Now Mark will provide an overview on our second quarter financial performance and provide you with an update on our 2016 outlook. Mark?"
361335,370189762,1009888,"Quest Diagnostics Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2016",2016-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Quest Diagnostics Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Steve.

Consolidated revenues of $1.91 billion were lower by 1% versus the prior year on a reported basis. Equivalent revenues grew 2.4% for the company. Revenues for diagnostic information services, or DIS for short, grew by 2.2% compared to the prior year. Volume, measured by the number of requisitions, increased 1.9% versus the prior year. Of the 1.9%, approximately half came from organic growth and the other half from recent acquisitions, including both CLP and MemorialCare.
Through the first half of 2016, organic volume is up nearly 2%, a solid increase compared to the slight decline reported in the first half of 2015. Revenue per requisition in the second quarter increased 0.2% versus a year ago. As a reminder, a number of different elements impact revenue per req, including unit price variation, business mix and tests per req.
Price headwinds were in line with our expectations, down slightly less than 1%. As we noted last quarter, our professional lab services or PLS engagements, such as Barnabas Health and HCA, carry lower revenue per requisition due to the nature of the work we are performing. In Q2 2016, the year-over-year impact of growth in PLS was approximately 120 basis points on our aggregate revenue per req. In the second quarter, PLS was a larger mix of our business. And as we move through the year, we expect PLS to grow at a faster rate than the balance of our business.
Reported operating income for the quarter was $422 million or 22.1% of revenues compared to $301 million or 15.6% of revenues a year ago. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $324 million or 17% of revenues compared to $321 million or 16.7% of revenues last year. Adjusted operating income benefited from stronger revenues and our Invigorate initiative, slightly offset by lower margins related to recent acquisitions, our growing professional lab services business and our efforts to refocus the company. The impact of our Clinical Trials and products businesses in the second quarter of 2015 benefited adjusted operating margins by approximately $15 million.
As a reminder, the Clinical Trials business now appears on the equity earnings line. Also, we no longer have operating earnings associated with the Focus Products business and recall that we use the proceeds to repurchase shares. In total, our portfolio divestitures represented $169 million of revenues that were excluded to get to our equivalent revenues for 2015.
Reported EPS was $1.37 in the quarter compared to $0.81 a year ago. The significant year-over-year increase was driven in large part by the gain on the sale of our Focus Diagnostics products business in the second quarter and charges on retirement of debt in the prior year. Adjusted EPS was $1.34, up from $1.25 last year.
The company recorded special items with an after-tax benefit totaling $17 million in the quarter, representing a $34 million gain on the sale of the Focus Products business, offset by approximately $17 million of primarily restructuring and integration charges. The net impact of these items increased our reported EPS by $0.12.
Bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues was 4.2%, 40 basis points better than the previous quarter and 10 basis points higher than 2015. As a reminder, bad debt expense typically improves modestly throughout the year as patients hit their health insurance deductibles. Note that the year-over-year compare is negatively impacted by the fact that our Clinical Trials and products businesses had a lower associated bad debt rate. When taking this into consideration, our bad debt rate year-over-year improved slightly.
Our DSOs were 47 days, 3 days higher than last year and the prior quarter. This is driven by the timing of certain cash receipts, and we expect our DSOs to come down to levels similar to the prior year by the end of Q3.
Through the first half of 2016, reported cash provided by operations was $464 million versus $337 million last year. Excluding charges associated with early debt retirement in the first half of 2016 and debt refinancing in the first half of 2015, adjusted operating cash flow was $502 million through June 30 in 2016, up from $464 million in 2015. Capital expenditures were $104 million in the first half compared to $117 million a year ago.
Before moving to guidance, I'd like to mention a few items for you to keep in mind to help you understand our outlook for the remainder of the year. First, the year-over-year impact of the contribution of our Clinical Trials business to the Q2 JV on our reported revenues ended in the second quarter of 2016. Recall, this transaction commenced at the beginning of our third quarter 2015.
Second, for the Celera products business that we wound down toward the end of last year, we recognized nearly half of the 2015 revenues and operating earnings for this business in the third quarter of 2015 as customers executed their last-time buys. This will set up a difficult compare in the third quarter this year. As you think about the split for the remainder of the year, last year, we had approximately $10 million on a reported basis and $12 million on adjusted basis of Celera products operating income in Q3 and nothing in Q4. 
Finally, there are 2 notable items on our full year reported operating cash flow projections. The first relates to after-tax cash charges of $29 million on the retirement of debt that will impact 2016 operating cash flow. Second, we will incur a cash tax outlay of $91 million associated with the Focus divestiture that will be recorded in our operating cash flow despite recognizing the associated $275 million from the sale in our investing cash flow. Therefore, our adjusted operating cash flow for 2016 will exclude both items.
Having noted these items, our 2016 outlook is as follows: revenues to be between $7.47 billion and $7.54 billion, flat to an increase of approximately 1% versus the prior year on a reported basis and an increase of 2% to 3% on an equivalent basis; reported diluted EPS to be between $4.18 and $4.33; adjusted EPS to be between $5.02 and $5.17; cash provided by operations to be approximately $880 million on a reported basis and roughly $1 billion on an adjusted basis; and finally, capital expenditures to be between $250 million and $300 million.
Now let me turn it back to Steve."

It is a contract. It's an agreement that we're helping them run their inpatient laboratories. And we're hopeful that, that will go well. And it could potentially provide us with more opportunities going forward, but one step at a time. Our job right now is to do a good job at the Denver area in this division. And we take it from there. So this continues to be a growth prospect for us. We've been focused on it for a number of years, as you know, and we're starting to see that in our results."

Well, first of all, there's 3 aspects of the work we've done with retailers, and Safeway is a good example. First of all is to improve the patient experience. If you've seen any of the Safeway clinics or health care centers, they're very nice. And so",266,"Yes. Well, first of all, there's 3 aspects of the work we've done with retailers, and Safeway is a good example. First of all is to improve the patient experience. If you've seen any of the Safeway clinics or health care centers, they're very nice. And so it provides a really nice, fresh patient experience for our patients. So we're pleased with that. So again, it goes hand in hand with our strategy around improving quality of the patient experience, at the same time, becoming more efficient. Then on the efficiency side, we are looking at where these stores are, where we have patient service centers. And where possible, we will optimize that and take some cost out. But in some cases, there are some cases we're also augmenting our unparalleled access to the marketplace with some of their locations. So it actually allows us to get greater access. Then we think of this market, to the last point I made in my introductory remarks, it's quite important for us to continue to get more and more access of -- for patients where they. I mean, retail has a great opportunity for us to continue to get more and more access because the data we have is, about 30% of laboratory requisitions in the marketplace go unfulfilled. And so our notion is, if you can have more access, make it more convenient, make it easy for people to go and get their laboratory requisitions fulfilled, it's going to be better for health care and it's going to be better for this industry. So that's our strategy."

But in terms of your other question around Invigorate, you can imagine that there's going to -- our retail strategy is going to work through over time. So we, at this point, we've only given guidance on Invigorate until the end of 2017. Obviously, at some point, we'll give an update beyond then. So we're -- we've got multiyear leases, in many cases, for our patient service centers. We are not going to dilute our volume and add a lot of incremental sites. So really, this is largely going to be replacing patient service centers. So it's not going to be ever 100% of our footprint, for a couple of reasons. One is for that because we want to make sure we're located where we need to be, and it may not always be a retail opportunity. The second thing is we've got some patient service centers where we might have 4, 5 phlebotomists at a time. And given the limited space in a retail site, we're never going to be able to move those kind of centers fully into retail. So we see it as a great opportunity, but it's not going to be a full replacement and in terms of its impact on our cost savings on Invigorate, which also is revenue enhancement. It's going to play out over the next couple of years."

So you could back into -- everything else was the positive mix, but offset price and offset the mix of PLS to give us a net 20 basis point improvement in revenue per req. Now with that said, the reason we're very careful, Ricky, about separating price from mix is that while price definitely -- directionally is an indication of profitability, mix is not always representative of profitability. So if -- we caution people. And as we've said over time, don't take math which is mix-driven as a signal for increased or decreased profitability."

And we'll see, when we get to 2018, if there is a price reduction and how much it is, and they estimate that as mid-single digits. And also what we said is, if you go back and look at our history, the reason why we have Invigorate and the reason why we continue to drive quality and efficiency is to be able to absorb some of the headwinds. And obviously, true price concessions, and I treat this as true price concessions, as Mark just said, as one of the offsets. So what we said and what we believe is when we get there, we'll have to absorb this and we will absorb this. So with that said, we've only provided guidance and an outlook for Invigorate through 2017. What I said in my remarks is we continue to be on track for that. It's $1.3 billion. It's an additional $600 million of what we achieved a couple of years ago. So we feel good about the progress made on that. And then what we also have said is that in any business, in any industry, you need to continue to drive efficiency and quality going forward past 2017. And we're not prepared at this point to talk about that. But given what I said earlier, obviously, we're going to have to have some efficiency gains in '18 to be able to offset any kind of price erosion. And we feel confident that we'll have those, given what we have in our perspective on the future. So that's what I can share at this point, but we're encouraged by what we've learned in the visibility around PAMA.

And what we said for the last 4 years is that our restore growth strategy is multifaceted. This business, this industry, has a number of products, a number of different programs, a number of different services and we have to work multiple fronts. To answer your direct question about where we are encouraged, we are encouraged about the continued prospects around advanced diagnostics, the genetic offerings that we introduce this quarter are very strong. We feel they're very competitive now with some of the incumbents in the marketplace, particularly around our BRCA offering. We expanded our panel. We have a now very nice comprehensive hereditary-based panel. And as you know, we continue to build on our relationship with Memorial Sloan Kettering in that space. Yes, we offer some nice offerings around colorectal cancer as well as a comprehensive hereditary cancer panel. So that is good and growing and a lot of promise in front of it. Second is, we talked about the work around hepatitis C. It continues to be a great opportunity for us. Last quarter, we talked about the companion diagnostics associated with it that is promising. And then third is Prescription Drug Monitoring, continues to be a big opportunity for us. It's growing. We're pleased with our progress. And as you know, in this country, there's a lot of renewed interest around pain meds and opiates and misuse of those and we're right in the middle of that whole debate, and we're part of the solution to that problem. And with that, we're coupling that with our hospital services business, which we've been working on for the past 4 years. You're starting to see the fruits of our efforts there. We're very pleased with our announcement of Barnabas. We're very pleased with the acquisition of our Hartford Hospital Outreach relationship, which again is a purchase. But at the same time, it builds a relationship with Hartford Hospital. We're very pleased with our first work with HCA. And as I said, there's many more prospects in our funnel that we continue to be happy about. Now with that said, the last question is, ""Where do you think there's more promise?"" I think this last piece, the strategy around hospitals, is something that I believe will continue to be a great growth driver for us. As I work the country and speak with our teams and speak with hospital CEOs and their management teams, they clearly can't do it all themselves, and they're looking for partnerships. And they realize that all we do every day is diagnostic information services. And where we have these relationships are those organizations that realize they're best served serving their population and doing best in their business by relying on us for their diagnostic information services business. So I think there's a lot more growth opportunities going forward than what we've seen so far, and I'm optimistic about that. Thank you for the question."

But there might be some correlation between PAMA and that. It's another contributing factor. When we have conversations with hospital systems, they talk about the changing nature of their business, they're moving away from fee-for-service to taking risk. When you move to risk, they need to have a low-cost provider. There's no question we're a lower-cost provider than typically their hospital lab is, and they have a lot of other priorities. And why would they put their next dollar of investments into laboratory when they have a good national leader nearby? And so that's typically the conversation we have. And they realize that there's going to be price pressure on their commercial rates in every place. And yes, their laboratory commercial rates will be under pressure. But also, they understand Medicare is not going to also provide a lot of help as well. So there can be pressure there. So it's contributing, but it's not necessarily, I would say, an overall driver so far. But with all that said, I think people will realize that there will be -- within all this analysis for interest in it going forward, it's hard to say, beyond what the estimate was of mid-single digits in 2018, how that will affect specific labs. So that estimate is based upon the market basket that CMS sees through all their expenditures from the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule. And so when you specifically apply whatever cuts there might be to a specific business, it could be considerable for small operators. They're doing mostly routine testing in a small geography. And they're not billing out all the codes like we do for the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule for Medicare. So it's been evolving but still more to learn, but I think we've got a lot more clarity today than we did 6 months ago."

And so -- and the partnership in Safeway is really important. And they're kind of -- since they're on the lead here, they're going to be one of the first people to decide, in partnership with us, where we're going to put some of these locations. And so I wanted to stress that while it doesn't preclude us and we certainly are in discussion with other retailers, we highly value the Safeway agreement.

Because health care is complex, every deal has got its own nuances, as you can appreciate. And you have to separate. When we buy an outreach business, that's an outright purchase of their existing commercial business. And in the case -- a good example of that is what we do with Hartford Hospital and CLP, which we've closed and we're in the process of integrating. And I've characterized those deals as being similar to the other ones we've done. We take over the business. We reprice it at our rates. We build a business case around taking out cost, and we think the returns for our shareholders are quite good. But what I'll also say, and I said this in my introductory remarks, when we typically do that, we typically -- it gets us into a broader conversation about their lab strategy. And so typically, they're saying, ""Well, okay, now we're tight with you. Let's talk about our advanced testing for our hospitals or what's called reference testing, and let's talk about how you potentially could help us with our hospital inpatient laboratory in making that more efficient."" So typically, it becomes a beachhead opportunity for us to build a stronger relationship. The second type of relationship, A.J., is we have an engagement, a professional services engagement like the one we have with Barnabas. And that's a services relationship. It's multiyear. We're providing service for a fee. We believe at certain -- we agree on certain conditions of delivery and payment. And we run it as that. And again, when we get in those relationships, because this is all around their inpatient laboratory, we then typically get in a conversation around their outreach business because that's something they want to continue to stay in. Can we help them with it? And second is their advanced testing for their reference testing business. So we have that conversation as well. And I would say, the third example is where there is a broader, deeper relationship where we think it might be prudent for us to form a joint venture in some form. And the most recent example of us doing that is with University of Massachusetts Medical Center, where we bought their outreach business, but we also helped them in many different ways in Central Massachusetts. And so they actually have a small minority stake in that joint venture. So we're deeply embedded together in making that work in Central Mass. So all different sizes and shapes of how we work with hospital systems, which reflects the marketplace. I think part of our strategy here as well is what we're showing to the marketplace is where a company and an organization that can manage in this very, very dynamic space. And you can work with Quest in whatever way makes sense. Obviously, we want a deal that's going to work for both sides. But we are flexible and prudent in how we put together those relationships. But again, you see one deal, you see one deal. So hopefully, that's helpful in providing you with more color and how it works."

And it's really has to do with the timing of some of the work that we're doing, where we consume our capital. And certainly, a part of that is some equipment refresh, some of that is tied to our Invigorate program such as the lab standardization work. And it's really driven by when we're executing some of those conversions. So there's really nothing unusual or atypical, I would say, in our capital spend this year. But I think the good news is that we're expecting to spend less this year than we did last year. And as we move forward, as we've mentioned, we're looking to get some of this high level of capital for Invigorate behind us and really return to a little lower level than we have versus the last couple of years as a proportion of our total operating cash flow and as a proportion of revenue."

And I think, increasingly, I'm making it obvious, it's good for patients, it's good for them attracting membership that they have Quest on contract. Now despite us maybe not having a preferred national relationship, in some cases, we still continue to have strong working relationships with some of those health care insurance companies that we don't enjoy those relationships. And also, we continue to see other ways of working together with some of those systems. So I won't speculate on or give specifics on contract dates and timing of all that, but we're managing this in new quarters.

An example of that is we sell it to Aetna, we sell it to CIGNA, but we also sell it to United Optum, as an example. We also are perpetually asked for data. We test about 50% of adult Americans every year -- excuse me, in the course of 3 years. Having that data is quite important to health care insurance companies. So we're quite collaborative with the industry of serving up our data to help them manage some of their managed Medicaid or managed Medicare business in a collaborative way. So 2 examples in that. And the third example is with Inovalon, which is our data analytics product, which is part of our new product introduction that we've made this year around Quantum. We serve this up to all health care insurance companies regardless of what we have for a laboratory contract. And so we're proactively working with all the companies that are taking risk.

This morning we'll provide you with highlights of the quarter, share a few comments on industry dynamics and review progress on our 5-point strategy, then Mark will provide more detail on the results and take you through guidance.
During the second quarter, revenues declined 1% on a reported basis related to our efforts to refocus the business, but grew 2.4% on an equivalent basis. Reported EPS grew more than 69% while adjusted EPS grew more than 7%.
Before I get into our strategy update, I'd like to provide perspective on a few key aspects of the final rule implementing provisions of the Protecting Access to Medicare Act, referred to as PAMA, issued late last month by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, referred to as CMS.
First, on the issue of timing. We are pleased with CMS's decision to delay the implementation of the new payment system until January 1, 2018, a position advocated by members of Congress, hospitals and hospital -- excuse me, and laboratory trade associations.
Second, CMS changed its approach to secure a better view of market pricing. By gathering the pricing data from labs in a different way, CMS will increase the number of labs that provide pricing data.
Then finally, we continue to evaluate the impact of this final rule, but we won't have a clearer view until we see the final pricing data.
In the meantime, CMS is estimating a mid-single-digit rate reduction in 2018. As you know, the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule represents approximately 12% of our revenues. As we've shared in the past, our Invigorate savings have more than compensated for price headwinds in the market. So if there is a fee reduction in 2018, we would be able to manage it.
Now let me shift to the progress we're making on our 5-point strategy, which, as you recall, is to restore growth, drive operational excellence, simplify the organization, refocus on our diagnostic information service business and deliver disciplined capital deployment.
So starting with growth. We delivered solid volume growth across a number of areas, including Prescription Drug Monitoring, hepatitis C testing and Cardio IQ, which provides a more complete picture of patients' cardiovascular health than basic cholesterol testing.
We also grew the second quarter with the help from our new hospital service agreements. Our acquisition of the Outreach Laboratory Service business of Clinical Laboratory Partners, referred to as CLP, and professional lab services agreements from Barnabas Health are helping us deliver the continued execution of our accelerated growth plan.
Additionally, in this quarter, we announced an agreement to manage the inpatient laboratory operations for 6 Denver area hospitals in HealthONE system of HCA Healthcare. We expect to see revenues from this engagement before the end of the year.
Hospitals continue to talk to us about how we can help them execute their lab strategy, from advanced hospital reference testing to lab management to joint ventures and outreach lab purchases. Our pipeline remains strong, and we continue to be encouraged by the growth opportunities.
In advanced testing, we strengthened our service offering, which includes gene-based and esoteric tests. During the quarter, we announced availability [ph] of 3 new Quest Vantage cancer tests. These are designed to provide clinical actionable insight into an individual's risk of developing hereditary forms of cancer. These new offerings will better position us in this exciting and growing marketplace.
We piloted a program this quarter for noninvasive prenatal screening to serve women of average risk in select regions. Encouraged by the results, we're now offering the testing nationally.
We continue to drive operational excellence, the second element of our strategy. We believe quality and efficiency go hand in hand. And we have strong evidence of demonstrated improvement in our customer experience as we make our business more efficient. As we deliver cost savings, we're also able to improve quality and service. This is a well-understood principle of total quality management approaches across all industries. Evidence of this can be seen in the recent independent blinded survey of more than 500 physicians. In the survey, Quest scored highest on customer experience, lab effectiveness and patient satisfaction among national, regional and hospital competitors.
Our recent agreement with Safeway will make it easier for people to get tested by locating our patient service centers in high-traffic Safeway supermarkets. By expanding patient access through our relationships with retailers, we will optimize our real estate footprint and have an opportunity to reduce the number of unfulfilled test orders, which some suggest could be as high as 30%.
We're also shrinking our real estate footprint by consolidating our corporate sites. In June, we announced the relocation of our corporate headquarters and support functions from Madison and Lyndhurst, New Jersey to a single location when our current 10-year lease expires in September of 2017. By consolidating our footprint, we'll be able to get greater collaboration and performance while realizing savings in operating expenses. Our Invigorate cost-savings program continues on track to realize $1.3 billion in run rate savings as we exit 2017.
We continue to simplify and strengthen our residual capabilities, the third element of our strategy. Also this quarter, we are proud to be recognized as 1 of 100 companies named to Forbes 2016 America's Most Trustworthy Companies list, the only company from the diagnostic services industry to be included.
The fourth element of our strategy, to refocus our diagnostic information services business, was completed in May, following the completion of the sale of the Focus Diagnostics products business. Proceeds from the sale of Focus Products were used to drive the fifth element of our strategy, delivering disciplined capital deployment. We launched a $250 million accelerated share repurchase program, ASR, with the Focus proceeds. And since 2012, we have repurchased approximately $2 billion of company stock. Additionally, in May, we issued $500 million in debt to take advantage of favorable interest rates and refinance a portion of our debt.
We actually look forward to sharing more detail on our market views and strategic outlook at our third Investor Day in New York City on November 11. So mark your calendars, and we'll be providing more data about this as time goes on.
Now Mark will provide an overview on our second quarter financial performance and provide you with an update on our 2016 outlook. Mark?"

Consolidated revenues of $1.91 billion were lower by 1% versus the prior year on a reported basis. Equivalent revenues grew 2.4% for the company. Revenues for diagnostic information services, or DIS for short, grew by 2.2% compared to the prior year. Volume, measured by the number of requisitions, increased 1.9% versus the prior year. Of the 1.9%, approximately half came from organic growth and the other half from recent acquisitions, including both CLP and MemorialCare.
Through the first half of 2016, organic volume is up nearly 2%, a solid increase compared to the slight decline reported in the first half of 2015. Revenue per requisition in the second quarter increased 0.2% versus a year ago. As a reminder, a number of different elements impact revenue per req, including unit price variation, business mix and tests per req.
Price headwinds were in line with our expectations, down slightly less than 1%. As we noted last quarter, our professional lab services or PLS engagements, such as Barnabas Health and HCA, carry lower revenue per requisition due to the nature of the work we are performing. In Q2 2016, the year-over-year impact of growth in PLS was approximately 120 basis points on our aggregate revenue per req. In the second quarter, PLS was a larger mix of our business. And as we move through the year, we expect PLS to grow at a faster rate than the balance of our business.
Reported operating income for the quarter was $422 million or 22.1% of revenues compared to $301 million or 15.6% of revenues a year ago. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $324 million or 17% of revenues compared to $321 million or 16.7% of revenues last year. Adjusted operating income benefited from stronger revenues and our Invigorate initiative, slightly offset by lower margins related to recent acquisitions, our growing professional lab services business and our efforts to refocus the company. The impact of our Clinical Trials and products businesses in the second quarter of 2015 benefited adjusted operating margins by approximately $15 million.
As a reminder, the Clinical Trials business now appears on the equity earnings line. Also, we no longer have operating earnings associated with the Focus Products business and recall that we use the proceeds to repurchase shares. In total, our portfolio divestitures represented $169 million of revenues that were excluded to get to our equivalent revenues for 2015.
Reported EPS was $1.37 in the quarter compared to $0.81 a year ago. The significant year-over-year increase was driven in large part by the gain on the sale of our Focus Diagnostics products business in the second quarter and charges on retirement of debt in the prior year. Adjusted EPS was $1.34, up from $1.25 last year.
The company recorded special items with an after-tax benefit totaling $17 million in the quarter, representing a $34 million gain on the sale of the Focus Products business, offset by approximately $17 million of primarily restructuring and integration charges. The net impact of these items increased our reported EPS by $0.12.
Bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues was 4.2%, 40 basis points better than the previous quarter and 10 basis points higher than 2015. As a reminder, bad debt expense typically improves modestly throughout the year as patients hit their health insurance deductibles. Note that the year-over-year compare is negatively impacted by the fact that our Clinical Trials and products businesses had a lower associated bad debt rate. When taking this into consideration, our bad debt rate year-over-year improved slightly.
Our DSOs were 47 days, 3 days higher than last year and the prior quarter. This is driven by the timing of certain cash receipts, and we expect our DSOs to come down to levels similar to the prior year by the end of Q3.
Through the first half of 2016, reported cash provided by operations was $464 million versus $337 million last year. Excluding charges associated with early debt retirement in the first half of 2016 and debt refinancing in the first half of 2015, adjusted operating cash flow was $502 million through June 30 in 2016, up from $464 million in 2015. Capital expenditures were $104 million in the first half compared to $117 million a year ago.
Before moving to guidance, I'd like to mention a few items for you to keep in mind to help you understand our outlook for the remainder of the year. First, the year-over-year impact of the contribution of our Clinical Trials business to the Q2 JV on our reported revenues ended in the second quarter of 2016. Recall, this transaction commenced at the beginning of our third quarter 2015.
Second, for the Celera products business that we wound down toward the end of last year, we recognized nearly half of the 2015 revenues and operating earnings for this business in the third quarter of 2015 as customers executed their last-time buys. This will set up a difficult compare in the third quarter this year. As you think about the split for the remainder of the year, last year, we had approximately $10 million on a reported basis and $12 million on adjusted basis of Celera products operating income in Q3 and nothing in Q4. 
Finally, there are 2 notable items on our full year reported operating cash flow projections. The first relates to after-tax cash charges of $29 million on the retirement of debt that will impact 2016 operating cash flow. Second, we will incur a cash tax outlay of $91 million associated with the Focus divestiture that will be recorded in our operating cash flow despite recognizing the associated $275 million from the sale in our investing cash flow. Therefore, our adjusted operating cash flow for 2016 will exclude both items.
Having noted these items, our 2016 outlook is as follows: revenues to be between $7.47 billion and $7.54 billion, flat to an increase of approximately 1% versus the prior year on a reported basis and an increase of 2% to 3% on an equivalent basis; reported diluted EPS to be between $4.18 and $4.33; adjusted EPS to be between $5.02 and $5.17; cash provided by operations to be approximately $880 million on a reported basis and roughly $1 billion on an adjusted basis; and finally, capital expenditures to be between $250 million and $300 million.
Now let me turn it back to Steve."

First of all, as I say mentioned in my remarks, the interest of hospital CEOs, CFOs and their teams to work with us on their lab strategy is growing. It's evidenced with what we did with Hartford Hospital and their CLP laboratory. In fact, I was just up there last week, meeting with the CEO and then continuing with my team. And once we engage and we have these types of relationship, I would say the relationship continues to grow. And we are their strategic partner for diagnostic information services. The same continues to grow at Barnabas. We could feel good about the progress made there and it continues to expand. And then you asked a question about HCA. HCA is not a joint venture. It is a contract. It's an agreement that we're helping them run their inpatient laboratories. And we're hopeful that, that will go well. And it could potentially provide us with more opportunities going forward, but one step at a time. Our job right now is to do a good job at the Denver area in this division. And we take it from there. So this continues to be a growth prospect for us. We've been focused on it for a number of years, as you know, and we're starting to see that in our results."

Well, first of all, there's 3 aspects of the work we've done with retailers, and Safeway is a good example. First of all is to improve the patient experience.

If you've seen any of the Safeway clinics or health care centers, they're very nice. And so it provides a really nice, fresh patient experience for our patients. So we're pleased with that. So again, it goes hand in hand with our strategy around improving quality of the patient experience, at the same time, becoming more efficient. Then on the efficiency side, we are looking at where these stores are, where we have patient service centers. And where possible, we will optimize that and take some cost out. But in some cases, there are some cases we're also augmenting our unparalleled access to the marketplace with some of their locations. So it actually allows us to get greater access. Then we think of this market, to the last point I made in my introductory remarks, it's quite important for us to continue to get more and more access of -- for patients where they. I mean, retail has a great opportunity for us to continue to get more and more access because the data we have is, about 30% of laboratory requisitions in the marketplace go unfulfilled. And so our notion is, if you can have more access, make it more convenient, make it easy for people to go and get their laboratory requisitions fulfilled, it's going to be better for health care and it's going to be better for this industry. So that's our strategy."

But in terms of your other question around Invigorate, you can imagine that there's going to -- our retail strategy is going to work through over time. So we, at this point, we've only given guidance on Invigorate until the end of 2017. Obviously, at some point, we'll give an update beyond then. So we're -- we've got multiyear leases, in many cases, for our patient service centers. We are not going to dilute our volume and add a lot of incremental sites. So really, this is largely going to be replacing patient service centers. So it's not going to be ever 100% of our footprint, for a couple of reasons. One is for that because we want to make sure we're located where we need to be, and it may not always be a retail opportunity. The second thing is we've got some patient service centers where we might have 4, 5 phlebotomists at a time. And given the limited space in a retail site, we're never going to be able to move those kind of centers fully into retail. So we see it as a great opportunity, but it's not going to be a full replacement and in terms of its impact on our cost savings on Invigorate, which also is revenue enhancement. It's going to play out over the next couple of years."

So what we did share is the mix impact for professional laboratory services was headwind of 120 basis points. So you could back into -- everything else was the positive mix, but offset price and offset the mix of PLS to give us a net 20 basis point improvement in revenue per req. Now with that said, the reason we're very careful, Ricky, about separating price from mix is that while price definitely -- directionally is an indication of profitability, mix is not always representative of profitability. So if -- we caution people. And as we've said over time, don't take math which is mix-driven as a signal for increased or decreased profitability."

And also what we said is, if you go back and look at our history, the reason why we have Invigorate and the reason why we continue to drive quality and efficiency is to be able to absorb some of the headwinds. And obviously, true price concessions, and I treat this as true price concessions, as Mark just said, as one of the offsets. So what we said and what we believe is when we get there, we'll have to absorb this and we will absorb this. So with that said, we've only provided guidance and an outlook for Invigorate through 2017. What I said in my remarks is we continue to be on track for that. It's $1.3 billion. It's an additional $600 million of what we achieved a couple of years ago. So we feel good about the progress made on that. And then what we also have said is that in any business, in any industry, you need to continue to drive efficiency and quality going forward past 2017. And we're not prepared at this point to talk about that. But given what I said earlier, obviously, we're going to have to have some efficiency gains in '18 to be able to offset any kind of price erosion. And we feel confident that we'll have those, given what we have in our perspective on the future. So that's what I can share at this point, but we're encouraged by what we've learned in the visibility around PAMA. We're encouraged by Invigorate and the progress we're making there, and we're not done with that. We'll continue to make progress, and we'll deal with that in due course."

And what we said for the last 4 years is that our restore growth strategy is multifaceted. This business, this industry, has a number of products, a number of different programs, a number of different services and we have to work multiple fronts. To answer your direct question about where we are encouraged, we are encouraged about the continued prospects around advanced diagnostics, the genetic offerings that we introduce this quarter are very strong. We feel they're very competitive now with some of the incumbents in the marketplace, particularly around our BRCA offering. We expanded our panel. We have a now very nice comprehensive hereditary-based panel. And as you know, we continue to build on our relationship with Memorial Sloan Kettering in that space. Yes, we offer some nice offerings around colorectal cancer as well as a comprehensive hereditary cancer panel. So that is good and growing and a lot of promise in front of it. Second is, we talked about the work around hepatitis C. It continues to be a great opportunity for us. Last quarter, we talked about the companion diagnostics associated with it that is promising. And then third is Prescription Drug Monitoring, continues to be a big opportunity for us. It's growing. We're pleased with our progress. And as you know, in this country, there's a lot of renewed interest around pain meds and opiates and misuse of those and we're right in the middle of that whole debate, and we're part of the solution to that problem. And with that, we're coupling that with our hospital services business, which we've been working on for the past 4 years. You're starting to see the fruits of our efforts there. We're very pleased with our announcement of Barnabas. We're very pleased with the acquisition of our Hartford Hospital Outreach relationship, which again is a purchase. But at the same time, it builds a relationship with Hartford Hospital. We're very pleased with our first work with HCA. And as I said, there's many more prospects in our funnel that we continue to be happy about. Now with that said, the last question is, ""Where do you think there's more promise?"" I think this last piece, the strategy around hospitals, is something that I believe will continue to be a great growth driver for us. As I work the country and speak with our teams and speak with hospital CEOs and their management teams, they clearly can't do it all themselves, and they're looking for partnerships. And they realize that all we do every day is diagnostic information services. And where we have these relationships are those organizations that realize they're best served serving their population and doing best in their business by relying on us for their diagnostic information services business. So I think there's a lot more growth opportunities going forward than what we've seen so far, and I'm optimistic about that. Thank you for the question."

But there might be some correlation between PAMA and that. It's another contributing factor. When we have conversations with hospital systems, they talk about the changing nature of their business, they're moving away from fee-for-service to taking risk. When you move to risk, they need to have a low-cost provider. There's no question we're a lower-cost provider than typically their hospital lab is, and they have a lot of other priorities. And why would they put their next dollar of investments into laboratory when they have a good national leader nearby? And so that's typically the conversation we have. And they realize that there's going to be price pressure on their commercial rates in every place. And yes, their laboratory commercial rates will be under pressure. But also, they understand Medicare is not going to also provide a lot of help as well. So there can be pressure there. So it's contributing, but it's not necessarily, I would say, an overall driver so far. But with all that said, I think people will realize that there will be -- within all this analysis for interest in it going forward, it's hard to say, beyond what the estimate was of mid-single digits in 2018, how that will affect specific labs. So that estimate is based upon the market basket that CMS sees through all their expenditures from the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule. And so when you specifically apply whatever cuts there might be to a specific business, it could be considerable for small operators. They're doing mostly routine testing in a small geography. And they're not billing out all the codes like we do for the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule for Medicare. So it's been evolving but still more to learn, but I think we've got a lot more clarity today than we did 6 months ago."

Is the hospital asking for any kind of different structure? Just give us some flavor on that."

When we buy an outreach business, that's an outright",535,"Yes. Well, first of all, you see one deal, you see one deal. We've said this before. Because health care is complex, every deal has got its own nuances, as you can appreciate. And you have to separate. When we buy an outreach business, that's an outright purchase of their existing commercial business. And in the case -- a good example of that is what we do with Hartford Hospital and CLP, which we've closed and we're in the process of integrating. And I've characterized those deals as being similar to the other ones we've done. We take over the business. We reprice it at our rates. We build a business case around taking out cost, and we think the returns for our shareholders are quite good. But what I'll also say, and I said this in my introductory remarks, when we typically do that, we typically -- it gets us into a broader conversation about their lab strategy. And so typically, they're saying, ""Well, okay, now we're tight with you. Let's talk about our advanced testing for our hospitals or what's called reference testing, and let's talk about how you potentially could help us with our hospital inpatient laboratory in making that more efficient."" So typically, it becomes a beachhead opportunity for us to build a stronger relationship. The second type of relationship, A.J., is we have an engagement, a professional services engagement like the one we have with Barnabas. And that's a services relationship. It's multiyear. We're providing service for a fee. We believe at certain -- we agree on certain conditions of delivery and payment. And we run it as that. And again, when we get in those relationships, because this is all around their inpatient laboratory, we then typically get in a conversation around their outreach business because that's something they want to continue to stay in. Can we help them with it? And second is their advanced testing for their reference testing business. So we have that conversation as well. And I would say, the third example is where there is a broader, deeper relationship where we think it might be prudent for us to form a joint venture in some form. And the most recent example of us doing that is with University of Massachusetts Medical Center, where we bought their outreach business, but we also helped them in many different ways in Central Massachusetts. And so they actually have a small minority stake in that joint venture. So we're deeply embedded together in making that work in Central Mass. So all different sizes and shapes of how we work with hospital systems, which reflects the marketplace. I think part of our strategy here as well is what we're showing to the marketplace is where a company and an organization that can manage in this very, very dynamic space. And you can work with Quest in whatever way makes sense. Obviously, we want a deal that's going to work for both sides. But we are flexible and prudent in how we put together those relationships. But again, you see one deal, you see one deal. So hopefully, that's helpful in providing you with more color and how it works."

So we've met that threshold. So the back half, depending on the timing and probability of executing any sort of deals, the cash flow will either be utilized for that.

We are slightly lower this year versus last year by a little over $10 million for the first 2 -- 6 months of the year. We're guiding to a number that's similar to slightly less than we spent last year. So I think it all fits, Isaac. And it's really has to do with the timing of some of the work that we're doing, where we consume our capital. And certainly, a part of that is some equipment refresh, some of that is tied to our Invigorate program such as the lab standardization work. And it's really driven by when we're executing some of those conversions. So there's really nothing unusual or atypical, I would say, in our capital spend this year. But I think the good news is that we're expecting to spend less this year than we did last year. And as we move forward, as we've mentioned, we're looking to get some of this high level of capital for Invigorate behind us and really return to a little lower level than we have versus the last couple of years as a proportion of our total operating cash flow and as a proportion of revenue."

And in that regard, we have our normal cadence of how we'll work through that this year, next year and into '18. Generally, given our leadership position in this marketplace, we're fortunate to be included in most of the health care insurance contracts throughout this country. And I think, increasingly, I'm making it obvious, it's good for patients, it's good for them attracting membership that they have Quest on contract. Now despite us maybe not having a preferred national relationship, in some cases, we still continue to have strong working relationships with some of those health care insurance companies that we don't enjoy those relationships. And also, we continue to see other ways of working together with some of those systems. So I won't speculate on or give specifics on contract dates and timing of all that, but we're managing this in new quarters. And fortunately for us, we have a very strong position given our strength and position in this marketplace that collectively and collaboratively, we're part of the network of what's required in health care delivery throughout the country in a big way, and we have a good, strong seat at the table."

An example of that is we sell it to Aetna, we sell it to CIGNA, but we also sell it to United Optum, as an example. We also are perpetually asked for data. We test about 50% of adult Americans every year -- excuse me, in the course of 3 years. Having that data is quite important to health care insurance companies. So we're quite collaborative with the industry of serving up our data to help them manage some of their managed Medicaid or managed Medicare business in a collaborative way. So 2 examples in that. And the third example is with Inovalon, which is our data analytics product, which is part of our new product introduction that we've made this year around Quantum. We serve this up to all health care insurance companies regardless of what we have for a laboratory contract. And so we're proactively working with all the companies that are taking risk. And so it puts us again in a different place with all health care insurance companies in a much different and broader way. So we often think about our laboratory contract, but our relationship with these systems are much broader than that.

This morning, I will provide you with the highlights of the quarter and review progress on our strategy, and then Mark will provide more detail on the results and take you through our updated guidance. 
During the third quarter, revenues were up on a reported basis and grew 2.1% on an equivalent basis. Reported EPS decreased 43% primarily due to the gain from our 2015 contribution to the Q2 Solutions joint venture. On an adjusted basis, EPS grew 7%. Cash from operations were $301 million, up 42%. 
Now let me discuss highlights of the progress we're making in several areas of our 5-point strategy, which, as you all know, is to restore growth, drive operational excellence, simplify the organization, refocus on our Diagnostic Information Services business and deliver disciplined capital deployment. 
So let's start with growth. We continue to make progress with our expanded hospital systems relationships. In professional lab services, HCA began to contribute to growth in the third quarter. As we announced earlier this year, we're managing an inpatient laboratory operation for 6 Denver-area [ph] hospitals in the HealthONE system of HCA Healthcare. Revenues from this engagement will continue to increase throughout the end of the year. Our professional lab services agreement with RWJBarnabas Health in New Jersey and Clinical Laboratory Partners, the outreach lab business we acquired from Hartford HealthCare in Connecticut, both contributed to perform well and grew revenue this quarter. 
Beyond our hospital systems relationships, we also continue to deliver solid growth in Prescription Drug Monitoring and [ph] infectious disease testing, including Zika. In Prescription Drug Monitoring, we remain an industry leader, with strong growth in the quarter. Providers and payers appreciate our unique ability to help manage the epidemic of prescription drug abuse with appropriate test utilization. 
In infectious disease, we continue to see solid growth in the fourth-generation HIV testing as well as hepatitis C testing for screening and genotyping to help doctors determine the type, dose or duration of treatment. 
Turning to Zika. We complemented our proprietary PCR test with a new antibody test license from the Center for Disease Control. Quest Diagnostics is proud to be among a group of select national reference laboratories selected by the Center for Disease Control to aid the response to the Zika emergency in the United States. 
Looking forward, we're excited about our new agreement with Ancestry. Quest will become Ancestry's first CLIA-approved lab partner to provide DNA testing, enabling AncestryDNA subscribers to build their family tree based on ethnic origins. Over time, we intend to explore additional opportunities with Ancestry to guide people on building and understanding their family health history. 
We're also very excited about the recent launch of the IBM Watson Genomics from Quest Diagnostics, a new service that helps advance precision medicine by combining cognitive computing with genomic tumor sequencing. The service helps oncologists match patients with cancer therapies and clinical trials based on the tumor's unique DNA. Quest's expertise of genomics and cancer as well as our broad market penetration to half the country's physicians and hospitals means Watson-powered tumor sequencing is accessible for the first time to the community of [ph] oncologists who provide 70% of the nation's cancer care. Memorial Sloan Kettering and the Broad Institute will contribute their data and research expertise to further augment the offering. 
The next element of our strategy I will highlight is driving operational excellence. Our collaboration with Optum will help Quest reduce cost and complexity of our billing processes and also increase transparency of health care costs for patients, physicians and employers. Employee engagement in our Optum alliance has been positive, and the integration is on track. Quest employees will transition to Optum team in mid-November. We expect to begin realizing savings from this relationship next year. We view this agreement with Optum as the start of a long-term relationship, and it builds on our long-standing relationship with Optum's parent, UnitedHealth Group. For decades, Quest has served United health care plan participants to help them take action to improve their health based on insights from diagnostic testing and information services. 
Also in the third quarter, we opened 12 patient service centers in 5 states in Safeway supermarkets. In just the first months, patients are finding it easier to access testing in a more convenient location, and we've seen volume increases in these retail settings. We remain excited about expanding patient access through retail partnerships. 
We continue to execute on our last element of our strategy, which is to deliver disciplined capital deployment. We completed our $250 million accelerated share repurchase program announced in May, using the proceeds of the sale of Focus Diagnostics business. Through this ASR, we repurchased approximately 3.1 million shares, additionally bought back another $50 million of company stock, bringing the total repurchases in 2016 to $440 million through the end of the third quarter. 
We look forward to sharing more detail on our market views and strategic outlook at our third Investor Day at the Intercontinental New York Barclay Hotel in Midtown on November 11. Registration information is available on our Investor Relations web page. 
Now Mark will provide an overview of the third quarter financial performance and provide you with an update on our 2016 outlook. Mark?"

Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services, or DIS for short, grew by 2.",1056,"Thanks, Steve. Starting with revenues, consolidated revenues of $1.89 billion were up 0.3% versus the prior year on a reported basis. Equivalent revenues grew 2.1% for the company. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services, or DIS for short, grew by 2.1% compared to the prior year. Of this growth, approximately 1% was organic. 
Volume, measured by the number of requisitions, increased 2% versus the prior year. Approximately half came from organic growth, including our professional lab services, or PLS, engagements and the other half from recent acquisitions. 
Revenue per requisition in the third quarter was flat versus a year ago. As a reminder, revenue per req is not a proxy for price and includes a number of variables such as unit price variation, business mix, test mix and test per requisition. Unit price headwinds moderated in the third quarter, down roughly 50 basis points compared to the 100 basis point headwinds we observed in the first half. 
Consistent with previous quarters, our PLS engagements, such as RWJBarnabas Health [ph] and HCA, carry lower revenue per requisition due to the nature of the work we are performing and the lower the revenue per req calculation. In the third quarter, impact of our PLS engagements was slightly larger than the 120 basis points we highlighted in the second quarter, which is representative of the strong growth we are seeing in this business. With HCA coming online in the third quarter and ramping up through the end of the year, we expect PLS to continue to grow at a faster rate than the balance of our business in Q4. 
After considering the impacts of unit price in [ph] PLS, other mix elements, including test and payer mix, contributed nearly 2% to revenue per req in the quarter. 
Reported operating income for the quarter was $322 million or 17.1% of revenues compared to $631 million or 33.6% of revenues a year ago. Our reported third quarter 2015 results included a $334 million pretax gain on the contribution to our Q2 joint venture with Quintiles. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $320 million or 17% of revenues compared to $325 million or 17.3% of revenues last year. The impact of our former Focus Diagnostics and Celera products businesses in the third quarter of 2015 benefited adjusted operating income by approximately $16 million or 50 basis points. Excluding this impact, margins would have grown by 20 basis points year-over-year. 
Reported EPS was $1.34 in the quarter compared to $2.35 a year ago. The year-over-year decline was driven primarily by the net gain on our Q2 contribution mentioned previously. 
Adjusted EPS was $1.37, up from $1.28 last year. The company recorded special items with an after-tax benefit totaling $10 million in the quarter, representing an escrow recovery associated with an acquisition, which was partially offset by restructuring and integration charges. The net impact of these items benefited our reported EPS by $0.07. 
Bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues was 4%, 20 basis points better than the previous quarter and 10 basis points higher than 2015. As a reminder, bad debt expense typically improves modestly throughout the year as patients hit their health insurance deductibles. Note that the year-over-year compare is negatively impacted by the fact that our products businesses had a lower associated bad debt rate. When taking this into consideration, our bad debt rate was flat year-over-year. 
Quick comment on our new billing relationship with Optum. To reiterate, expense savings from this relationship will not begin until 2017. We expect modest savings on our billing support costs during each year of the 10-year agreement, and Optum will work with us to help lower our bad debt rate as well as reduce our denials over time. 
Income tax expense in the quarter benefited from the adoption of the new accounting standard related to stock-based compensation. The impact amounted to an EPS benefit of roughly $0.02 in Q3. The new standard also results in a change in weighted shares outstanding by increasing the effect of diluted securities, which slightly offsets the EPS benefit. 
Our DSOs were 46 days, 2 days higher than last year but 1 day better than the prior quarter. The year-over-year increase is primarily attributable to higher levels of patient responsibility. 
Through [ph] the first 9 months of 2016, cash provided by operations was $765 million versus $549 million last year. Capital expenditures were $165 million through the third quarter, compared to $169 million a year ago. 
Before moving to guidance, I'd like to highlight that operations in our Southeast region were impacted by Hurricane Matthew earlier this month. Our updated guidance reflects the impact we currently know. Additionally, I want to provide some color on a few notable items which will impact our full year operating cash flows. 
The first relates to after-tax charges for the full year 2016 of $29 million from the retirement of debt. Second, we will incur a full year cash tax outlay of $91 million associated with the Focus divestiture that will be recorded in our operating cash flow, while the associated $275 million from the sale is reported in our investing cash flow. We paid $68 million of this liability in Q3, with the remainder to be paid in the fourth quarter. Third, in Q3, we realized $54 million of proceeds from the termination of interest rate swap agreements. In aggregate, these 3 items are adversely impacting our full year operating cash flow by a net of $66 million. 
Now turning to guidance. Based on our year-to-date results, we are narrowing our 2016 outlook as follows: revenues to be approximately $7.51 billion, an increase of about 0.5% versus the prior year on a reported basis and an increase of about 2.5% on an equivalent basis. This compares to previous revenue guidance of between $7.47 billion and $7.54 billion. Reported diluted EPS to be between $4.47 and $4.52, and adjusted EPS to be between $5.07 and $5.12. This compares to previous EPS guidance of $4.18 and $4.33 on a reported basis and $5.02 and $5.17 on an adjusted basis. Cash provided by operations to be approximately $1 billion, which compares to previous guidance of approximately $880 million. And finally, capital expenditures to be approximately $250 million, compared to between $250 million and $300 million previously. 
Now let me turn it back to Steve."

Well, first of all, we're encouraged with our continuing [ph] growth that we're seeing in our professional lab services business. We've highlighted 2 in my opening remarks. One is the relationship with HCA. The second is related to our relationship with Barnabas here in New Jersey. They're up and running. They contributed to growth in the third quarter. We're optimistic about their prospects, and also, we have a good funnel with us. You made one comment that I would like to react to. We've been very, very careful to make sure that we describe how this business affects the calculation of revenue per requisition. And what we've done carefully is to talk about in the script -- and I'm sure Mark will provide some color, is that we actually provided in the script the unit price impact this quarter to our performance. And that is when you freeze all other characteristics of our business, what the true pricing impact is on our business, where [ph] there's other characteristics of our business like business mix and payer mix that affect the calculation of revenue per req. So we feel very positive about the growth prospects for [ph] professional lab services business. It's a great growth opportunity. It's great return on invested capital. Therefore, it's great for shareholder value creation. But it does affect the calculation because it's at a lower price point. That is not to be confused with price reductions. So I want to make sure that's clear. I'm sure one of them here, [ph] that Mark will comment on that as well to make sure it's absolutely clear. As far as partnerships, we believe that being a company that work with others in health care is an important part of what we do. We obviously are demonstrating we know how to do that. A number of things we talked about already have to do with us forming relationships. So we talked about professional lab services. I'll also mention that when we buy outreach businesses like I referred to with the Hartford Hospital outreach business that we bought, we're working on building on that to have a strong relationship. Couple that with what we announced this fall with Optum. Optum will allow us to work with one of the leaders in health care analytics, leaders in health care services, to work on understanding what we can do to improve the billing process and thereby helping us with our bad debt exposure as well as making sure we get paid for a lot of the more sophisticated testing that we do. We think them working with us is better than us working independent, and that's a good opportunity for our shareholders going forward. So we're optimistic about that opportunity. But what also see [ph] in my introductory remarks, we believe this continues to [ph] build on a strong working relationship we have with UnitedHealth Group. And this new working relationship with [ph] revenue cycle management will only enhance that relationship. We actually do the [ph] -- we have a strong collaboration and do their [ph] wellness work within Optum. We have an existing relationship with some of their physician groups that they're buying in terms of laboratory professional services. And then finally, as [ph] we continue to be a big supplier of laboratory and professional services for United HealthCare [ph] membership today, and we believe that will continue to grow. So we're optimistic about the prospects there. We also announced recently the relationship with IBM. This builds on our relationship and our product that we introduced a couple of years ago with Memorial Sloan Kettering. It's in the growing new field of precision medicine, as you know, and we provide in this relationship a product called OncoVantage, which basically provides visibility to a community of [ph] oncologists, what can be known with 34 actionable genes. From that data, we'll say what drugs will work and what drugs will not work, but as importantly, what clinical trials they could potentially enroll their patients in. This work will [ph] expand with the relationship with IBM and also Memorial Sloan. We also mentioned that this is collaborative work once again, and the Broad Institute is involved as well, which we're optimistic about, because as I said at the beginning, health care is really a much more collaborative game going forward. And at Quest, we're all about working with others, and it comes [ph] through quite clearly [ph] the work we've done and how it's helping our business. So let me just stop there. Let me turn it to Mark to make sure I properly address the question about the PLS business and how we think about revenue per requisition as a calculation. Mark?"

When you think about the work we do, we do tests. Now we use requisitions as a surrogate for volume. But in fact, we do tests. So if a patient comes forward with a single test and, let's say, a standard routine test, and another patient comes forward and has 2 of those, there's going to be different value to the [ph] requisition, but it has nothing to do with price. So the reason that people have, and we have shared requisitions, is there is a margin implication to some extent because the front end and the back end is somewhat of a fixed cost per patient engagement or [ph] requisition. So specimen acquisition and billing, you say, [ph] the more tests you can get on a requisition, the more efficient you can be. But again, that's on the cost side, not the price side. However, with PLS, as we've explained, the specimen acquisition is incredibly efficient. We don't do the draws. And from a logistics perspective, we're picking up dozens and dozens of tests at a single point in time instead of a handful as we [ph] do in office physician park. [ph] So the logistics is very efficient. We don't incur the draw cost. And then the billing is incredibly efficient because there's no third-party billing, there's no patient responsibility. It's a single bill for a large volume to a client. So I just want to make sure we continue to do what we need to do, that people are clear that the mix calculation is a calculation and it's not price. We actually call out price very specifically so you understand apples-and-apples if there are any headwinds, and we're actually getting paid less per test."

And maybe help us, is it in the run rate at this point? Is there some sort of ramp we should consider in the -- sort of the fourth quarter and 2017? Any help there? And then just on the pricing side, as you just explained, I guess, what I'm still grappling with is just understanding, so on a test-by-test basis, is the price the same? Or is it lower in PLS, right? Because I would think you'd have more tests per requisition on sort of the hospital testing you would in sort of a normal business. So I guess I'm just trying to reconcile the absolute dollar per test and if that's lower because of a willingness to give up on that because of the benefits on the cost side that you explained."

Let me try to address them all. First off, Barnabas is pretty much largely implemented. We may expand that relationship beyond the current set of hospitals, but at this point, the initial phase of Barnabas is in a run rate. And HCA is the relationship that we said is ramping up. We mentioned about half [ph] of the volume growth in the quarter was attributable to PLS, and we don't call out specific relationships, so we're not going to share Barnabas per se or HCA, but we are sharing what PLS is contributing in total. And then contrary to what you may have thought, the test per req per PLS actually tend to be fewer, not greater. When you imagine something going in for their annual physical, which is quite a bit of our volume, obviously, some of it is acute conditions and people going to the primary care physician for, but you're doing a battery of tests in your annual physical much more than you might for an acute situation going in as an inpatient or outpatient hospital. So there's actually fewer tests. And finally, on price, it is priced differently because it's not the commercial rights that we have for the core business. And so negotiated, direct rate with the hospital where we price it in a way that we can save the money and we can make a margin ourselves. So it is different pricing, but not necessarily lower or higher because we have pricing relationships all over the board for any given test, depending on the situation. So it gets a little bit complicated. But in general, fewer tests per req. We have definitely future momentum we expect from our PLS in terms of its volume contribution, definitely from HCA. And so you should expect more of our growth coming from PLS certainly in the immediate future."

So again, first of all, what we've committed is continued march of making our business better. And when we say better, we want to improve our quality, service and at the same time making it more efficient. And the goal, as you know for that, is the Invigorate program, which we have committed to an improvement of $1.3 billion by the end of 2017. And that's run rate savings at your [indiscernible] versus a benchmark of 2011. As you know, we've been in a great march of showing progress on that. And what we have shown with this relationship is we're far from done. We have a lot more opportunities to improve [indiscernible] and we think this relationship with Optum again underscores our commitment to continue to make bold changes in this business to become better, okay? So we keep on saying better because it's both quality and cost. So this relationship with Optum will allow us a couple of things. One is we're going to become more efficient. So how do we can become more efficient? One is that by working together with, our billing operation, which is part of our expense structure, our SG&A cost will become more efficient over time. And we do have commitments towards improving that together going forward. That is all part of our commitment for Invigorate. So that allows us to achieve our goal and also extends beyond 2017. Obviously, since it's a 10-year relationship. Second is, as I said in my introductory remarks, part of the opportunities we have is to provide better transparency to patients, better transparency to patients as far as what prices are and also what is covered. And so they can pay us more often and more quickly. And we believe by providing that with the help of Optum will [indiscernible] bad debt, our denial rate and just generally our cash flow. So that this part of the relationship as well. We don't disclose the specifics of the agreement. You wouldn't expect that we would. But it's part and parcel of what we believe we need to continue to do to continue to drive progress in this business. The last part of your question is, how does this affect our relationship with United Health? What I said when we announced this relationship, and I know United health will say the same, is it can't hurt. And again, that builds on our existing relationship. We currently do a lot of work for United already. This is substantial piece of building on that. They are very committed to it. It's a big opportunity for them. It provides visibility of us to them in a much broader, more significant way than ever. We're obviously going to use this to build on that relationship in wellness. I talked about earlier what we can do around their health care businesses that they're building with Optum Care. We believe we can do more than help them with their analytics services. So there's a lot more that we can do with them and will do with them as we go forward. Because as you know, they're a big player in health care, and we need to work with all the big players in health care. So we're encouraged about what we're doing so far. We're off to a good start. As we said, we're going to move the employees over in November, and we'll start to see savings from this next year. So Mark, anything you'd like to add to that?"

So we have a nice bird's eye view what's happening in the American population. And I'm trying to use that in the most responsible and also the best way for our shareholders. We have talked about the past of actually providing that data to a variety of third parties, including the Center for Disease Control. We've talked about them using that, understanding how they can manage or monitor the performance of what's happening with hepatitis C, by way of an example. We also have sold that data to pharma companies. We're building them out relationship. We've talked about -- we're trying to bring to the market and possibly with our collaboration with Quintiles, now Quintiles has merged with IMS, we continue to have a dialogue with how we could use that data to help with their recruitment of patients for clinical trials. And that's something that we'll talk about once again as we get into our Investor Day in November. Because there's a lot of opportunities for it, takes longer to get some traction with it, but the prospects are good. And specifically with Optum, as you know, Optum has a broad perspective of the market, and they're helping many integrated delivery systems. One of the products we provide today for integrated delivery systems is around population health and how you can use this data to help manage that population metric managing and how do we try to identify those patients that are costing the risk taker the most amount of -- each year. And by looking at performance versus laboratory results, what we can do about that to help those gaps in cure, if you will, that they have. A lot of opportunities. Again, come November, we'll share more with you."

But typically, what we said is, in Outreach purchase, it takes 12 to 18 months to get to its going rate on profitability and when we can get all the synergies achieved. And the Outreach businesses are typically at our corporate margin percentage. So we usually get some margin dollars pretty quickly on Outreach, but get to our going percentage and ratio profitability, it takes 12 to 18 months. For PLS, it's somewhat similar to an Outreach that there's a transition period of time. A lot of the savings is driven around moving the test menu partially off the hospital site to ours. That doesn't happen the first day. The second piece is really the procurement savings. So it's either changing out the platform or burning through their regions, which typically are higher cost than ours. It takes a little while before we get to that going profitability. But I'd say the same thing, probably a little closer to 12 than the 18, but we get to the going rate of profitability for PLS within the first year, 1.5 years. Those margins are going to be lower than the corporate average slightly. But as I said before, still an excellent return in invested capital, and they're still double-digit margins."

So there's a pretty sizable delta between that operating income and that kind of operational EPS aspiration. So I just wanted to kind of flush out how do we think about -- I know there's no chance for '17 guidance yet, but what are some of the drivers that might help accelerate that organic operating income growth as we think about the next 6 to 8 quarters?"

So the things that are going to contribute to growing earnings faster than our revenue are unchanged. So it's really going to be as we return to the growth that has a high drop-through and then we have the Invigorate program, which certainly is large enough in this period of time to offset price and our cost pay for us, which is our annual merit inflation and things like that and still have enough to expand margin. As you look at some of the PLS relationships that we've talked about, those have really started up this year. And as I've mentioned earlier to the question that while [indiscernible] again PLS up and going up profitability, it's generally 12 to 18 months. So you would expect those deals to be contributing more to the bottom line and helping to expand our margin more than they did this year. So it's really -- gets down to the fundamentals, which is the growth and the high drop-through we get there, Invigorate program which continues to drive efficiency and then all of those things more on an annual or a CAGR basis as opposed to any given quarter.

And we don't execute a deal if we don't see a path towards value creation importantly.

First, as I said, we're excited about the opportunity. It's an embryonic field. It's building. It's evolving. The field of precision medicine or personalized health care is just -- is very new, and it continues to provide opportunities, but also it takes time to develop. So we believe, once again, that we, in this field, we need to work together with others. Two years ago, we announced a relationship with Memorial Sloan-Kettering. We've brought a product to the market called OncoVantage. The opportunity we're going after, Bill, is to get that those community oncologists, which, as I said in my remarks, about 70% of cancer care is there. And what we realized is that Memorial Sloan is very strong, and we have a strong presence in the United States. But by working together with some others once again, we can even enhance what we've done already. And so the IBM opportunity allows us to use their platform and also their data capabilities in a much broader way. Second is, as you know, IBM is building out their go-to-market plans for IBM-Watson in general, IBM Watson Health and IBM Watson Genomics. And we're hopeful that that sales force, coupled with our sales force, will drive some additional demand as people become more aware of this. And the other part of this, Bill, we believe there's an opportunity for patients to become more aware of what they should gain access to in assessing what they need to do with their cancer care. And IBM is a very powerful marketing machine, and we're hopeful that their work and their visibility around cognitive computing, and specifically in health care, will help us with this effort. Now as far as future products, we have the existing products today. We're offering that through risk plans for us to expand that capability with a number of actionable genes and then also an expanded panel, which will touch close to 400 genes that we'll look at. Yes, we do believe that this will help us in terms of companion diagnostics with those cancer drugs to rule and rule out patients that they can affect and also making sure that we can support the right way, connecting patients to the right clinical trials through their oncologists with this information. So this is works in progress. A lot will be introduced in time. And it is, I think, a good example of the evolving nature of this effort across the world. But we're aligning up with some of the best, Memorial Sloan-Kettering, IBM, [indiscernible] Institute and obviously the relationship we have with MIT and Harvard. So we have a good team working on this, and we feel very, very encouraged about the prospects here."

But first piece of business right now is to do what we said we're going to do in Denver and do that well. And then we'll grow the account as you grow any account moving forward. I would also say that this discussion around hospital interest in what we're doing is building, what we find is at the C suite of integrated delivery systems, hospital CEOs and CFOs are quite interested in anything anyone can do to make them more efficient. I personally get engaged in this in a very active way, and I can tell you that when we go in and have a conversation with a CEO and a CFO, we share with them that we can save them 15% to 20% of their hospital inpatient laboratory costs, our batting average, if you will, of getting to the next conversation to start sharing some data is quite good. Very few times do they say, ""We're not interested."" Most of the times, they say, ""Interesting. We should take a look at this, and we understand how you can help us, and let's see if the numbers work."" When we go in there, we also talk about the lab strategy. And usually, we have a discussion around their inpatient laboratory cost, we then have a conversation around their reference testing, their most advanced testing that we provide to about 15% [ph] of hospitals. We talk about us being able to provide more of that for them. And then the third leg of the stool is they then start to question if they're in an Outreach business, essentially competing with us, do they want to remain in that business? And the best end state for us is to become their lab partner, where it's Quest inside. So we do all 3. We're helping them with their inpatient labs, making them more efficient. We're providing the most advanced testing for their hospital operations. And then third is where their laboratory for their nonhospital portion of the care they're providing within their geographic area. And we have a number of examples of that, and probably some the best examples is where we've actually formed joint ventures. And we have a number of outstanding joint ventures, Pittsburgh Medical Center. Probably most recent large one is University of Massachusetts. We have a joint venture up in Massachusetts around that, and there's others, too, that we built. So I would argue that this is a growing trend. It's a trend that we're ahead on. It takes a while to build a set of services businesses. We built the capabilities. We're now executing and now we're starting to see the results of our growth."

We don't share specifics on what's happening with commercial contracts and what's happening for tests. But it's implied in 50 basis points. It's very manageable that we believe that's always going to be some ups and downs in our portfolio tests. And we're bringing new products to the marketplace as well, which have been price points. So it's in that overall average that we provide."

Because it's hard to separate hospital business from physician business given where health care is today and how it's organized. At the same time, we all know that health care is very specialized. And so we also, in addition to the geographic orientation to our sales force, have dedicated specialized sales forces. So we have a specialized sales force for our neurology business. We have a specialized sales force for anatomic pathology business. Specialized sales force for our women's health business. And we believe we appropriately staffed that for the opportunities in the marketplace. And we're always going to optimize our investment and our go-to-market plan with the opportunities we see the marketplace.

This morning, I will provide you with the highlights of the quarter and review progress on our strategy, and then Mark will provide more detail on the results and take you through our updated guidance. 
During the third quarter, revenues were up on a reported basis and grew 2.1% on an equivalent basis. Reported EPS decreased 43% primarily due to the gain from our 2015 contribution to the Q2 Solutions joint venture. On an adjusted basis, EPS grew 7%. Cash from operations were $301 million, up 42%. 
Now let me discuss highlights of the progress we're making in several areas of our 5-point strategy, which, as you all know, is to restore growth, drive operational excellence, simplify the organization, refocus on our Diagnostic Information Services business and deliver disciplined capital deployment. 
So let's start with growth. We continue to make progress with our expanded hospital systems relationships. In professional lab services, HCA began to contribute to growth in the third quarter. As we announced earlier this year, we're managing an inpatient laboratory operation for 6 Denver-area hospitals in the HealthONE system of HCA Healthcare. Revenues from this engagement will continue to increase throughout the end of the year. Our professional lab services agreement with RWJBarnabas Health in New Jersey and Clinical Laboratory Partners, the outreach lab business we acquired from Hartford HealthCare in Connecticut, both contributed to perform well and grew revenue this quarter. 
Beyond our hospital systems relationships, we also continue to deliver solid growth in prescription drug monitoring and infectious disease testing, including Zika. In Prescription Drug Monitoring, we remain an industry leader, with strong growth in the quarter. Providers and payers appreciate our unique ability to help manage the epidemic of prescription drug abuse with appropriate test utilization. 
In infectious disease, we continue to see solid growth in the fourth-generation HIV testing as well as hepatitis C testing for screening and genotyping to help doctors determine the type, dose or duration of treatment. 
Turning to Zika. We complemented our proprietary PCR test with a new antibody test license from the Center for Disease Control. Quest Diagnostics is proud to be among a group of select national reference laboratories selected by the Center for Disease Control to aid the response to the Zika emergency in the United States. 
Looking forward, we're excited about our new agreement with Ancestry. Quest will become Ancestry's first CLIA-approved lab partner to provide DNA testing, enabling AncestryDNA subscribers to build their family tree based on ethnic origins. Over time, we intend to explore additional opportunities with Ancestry to guide people on building and understanding their family health history. 
We're also very excited about the recent launch of the IBM Watson Genomics from Quest Diagnostics, a new service that helps advance precision medicine by combining cognitive computing with genomic tumor sequencing. The service helps oncologists match patients with cancer therapies and clinical trials based on the tumor's unique DNA. Quest's expertise of genomics and cancer as well as our broad market penetration to half the country's physicians and hospitals means Watson-powered tumor sequencing is accessible for the first time to the community oncologists who provide 70% of the nation's cancer care. Memorial Sloan Kettering and the Broad Institute will contribute their data and research expertise to further augment the offering. 
The next element of our strategy I will highlight is driving operational excellence. Our collaboration with Optum will help Quest reduce cost and complexity of our billing processes and also increase transparency of health care costs for patients, physicians and employers. Employee engagement in our Optum alliance has been positive, and the integration is on track. Quest employees will transition to Optum team in mid-November. We expect to begin realizing savings from this relationship next year. We view this agreement with Optum as the start of a long-term relationship, and it builds on our long-standing relationship with Optum's parent, UnitedHealth Group. For decades, Quest has served UnitedHealthcare plan participants to help them take action to improve their health based on insights from diagnostic testing and information services. 
Also in the third quarter, we opened 12 patient service centers in 5 states in Safeway supermarkets. In just the first months, patients are finding it easier to access testing in a more convenient location, and we've seen volume increases in these retail settings. We remain excited about expanding patient access through retail partnerships. 
We continue to execute on our last element of our strategy, which is to deliver disciplined capital deployment. We completed our $250 million accelerated share repurchase program announced in May, using the proceeds of the sale of Focus Diagnostics business. Through this ASR, we repurchased approximately 3.1 million shares, additionally bought back another $50 million of company stock, bringing the total repurchases in 2016 to $440 million through the end of the third quarter. 
We look forward to sharing more detail on our market views and strategic outlook at our third Investor Day at the Intercontinental New York Barclay Hotel in Midtown on November 11. Registration information is available on our Investor Relations web page. 
Now Mark will provide an overview of the third quarter financial performance and provide you with an update on our 2016 outlook. Mark?"

Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services, or DIS for short, grew by 2.",1053,"Thanks, Steve. Starting with revenues, consolidated revenues of $1.89 billion were up 0.3% versus the prior year on a reported basis. Equivalent revenues grew 2.1% for the company. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services, or DIS for short, grew by 2.1% compared to the prior year. Of this growth, approximately 1% was organic. 
Volume, measured by the number of requisitions, increased 2% versus the prior year. Approximately half came from organic growth, including our professional lab services, or PLS, engagements and the other half from recent acquisitions. 
Revenue per requisition in the third quarter was flat versus a year ago. As a reminder, revenue per req is not a proxy for price and includes a number of variables such as unit price variation, business mix, test mix and test per requisition. Unit price headwinds moderated in the third quarter, down roughly 50 basis points compared to the 100 basis point headwinds we observed in the first half. 
Consistent with previous quarters, our PLS engagements, such as RWJBarnabas Health and HCA, carry lower revenue per requisition due to the nature of the work we are performing and the lower the revenue per req calculation. In the third quarter, impact of our PLS engagements was slightly larger than the 120 basis points we highlighted in the second quarter, which is representative of the strong growth we are seeing in this business. With HCA coming online in the third quarter and ramping up through the end of the year, we expect PLS to continue to grow at a faster rate than the balance of our business in Q4. 
After considering the impacts of unit price and PLS, other mix elements, including test and payer mix, contributed nearly 2% to revenue per req in the quarter. 
Reported operating income for the quarter was $322 million or 17.1% of revenues compared to $631 million or 33.6% of revenues a year ago. Our reported third quarter 2015 results included a $334 million pretax gain on the contribution to our Q2 joint venture with Quintiles. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $320 million or 17% of revenues compared to $325 million or 17.3% of revenues last year. The impact of our former Focus Diagnostics and Celera products businesses in the third quarter of 2015 benefited adjusted operating income by approximately $16 million or 50 basis points. Excluding this impact, margins would have grown by 20 basis points year-over-year. 
Reported EPS was $1.34 in the quarter compared to $2.35 a year ago. The year-over-year decline was driven primarily by the net gain on our Q2 contribution mentioned previously. 
Adjusted EPS was $1.37, up from $1.28 last year. The company recorded special items with an after-tax benefit totaling $10 million in the quarter, representing an escrow recovery associated with an acquisition, which was partially offset by restructuring and integration charges. The net impact of these items benefited our reported EPS by $0.07. 
Bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues was 4%, 20 basis points better than the previous quarter and 10 basis points higher than 2015. As a reminder, bad debt expense typically improves modestly throughout the year as patients hit their health insurance deductibles. Note that the year-over-year compare is negatively impacted by the fact that our products businesses had a lower associated bad debt rate. When taking this into consideration, our bad debt rate was flat year-over-year. 
Quick comment on our new billing relationship with Optum. To reiterate, expense savings from this relationship will not begin until 2017. We expect modest savings on our billing support costs during each year of the 10-year agreement, and Optum will work with us to help lower our bad debt rate as well as reduce our denials over time. 
Income tax expense in the quarter benefited from the adoption of the new accounting standard related to stock-based compensation. The impact amounted to an EPS benefit of roughly $0.02 in Q3. The new standard also results in a change in weighted shares outstanding by increasing the effect of diluted securities, which slightly offsets the EPS benefit. 
Our DSOs were 46 days, 2 days higher than last year but 1 day better than the prior quarter. The year-over-year increase is primarily attributable to higher levels of patient responsibility. 
Through the first 9 months of 2016, cash provided by operations was $765 million versus $549 million last year. Capital expenditures were $165 million through the third quarter, compared to $169 million a year ago. 
Before moving to guidance, I'd like to highlight that operations in our Southeast region were impacted by Hurricane Matthew earlier this month. Our updated guidance reflects the impact we currently know. Additionally, I want to provide some color on a few notable items which will impact our full year operating cash flows. 
The first relates to after-tax charges for the full year 2016 of $29 million from the retirement of debt. Second, we will incur a full year cash tax outlay of $91 million associated with the Focus divestiture that will be recorded in our operating cash flow, while the associated $275 million from the sale is reported in our investing cash flow. We paid $68 million of this liability in Q3, with the remainder to be paid in the fourth quarter. Third, in Q3, we realized $54 million of proceeds from the termination of interest rate swap agreements. In aggregate, these 3 items are adversely impacting our full year operating cash flow by a net of $66 million. 
Now turning to guidance. Based on our year-to-date results, we are narrowing our 2016 outlook as follows: revenues to be approximately $7.51 billion, an increase of about 0.5% versus the prior year on a reported basis and an increase of about 2.5% on an equivalent basis. This compares to previous revenue guidance of between $7.47 billion and $7.54 billion. Reported diluted EPS to be between $4.47 and $4.52, and adjusted EPS to be between $5.07 and $5.12. This compares to previous EPS guidance of $4.18 and $4.33 on a reported basis and $5.02 and $5.17 on an adjusted basis. Cash provided by operations to be approximately $1 billion, which compares to previous guidance of approximately $880 million. And finally, capital expenditures to be approximately $250 million, compared to between $250 million and $300 million previously. 
Now let me turn it back to Steve."

Well, first of all, we're encouraged with our continuing growth that we're seeing in our professional lab services business. We've highlighted 2 in my opening remarks. One is the relationship with HCA. The second is related to our relationship with Barnabas here in New Jersey. They're up and running. They contributed to growth in the third quarter. We're optimistic about their prospects, and also, we have a good funnel with us. You made one comment that I would like to react to. We've been very, very careful to make sure that we describe how this business affects the calculation of revenue per requisition. And what we've done carefully is to talk about in the script -- and I'm sure Mark will provide some color, is that we actually provided in the script the unit price impact this quarter to our performance. And that is when you freeze all other characteristics of our business, what the true pricing impact is on our business, where there's other characteristics of our business like business mix and payer mix that affect the calculation of revenue per req. So we feel very positive about the growth prospects of our professional lab services business. It's a great growth opportunity. It's great return on invested capital. Therefore, it's great for shareholder value creation. But it does affect the calculation because it's at a lower price point. That is not to be confused with price reductions. So I want to make sure that's clear. And I'm sure one of them here -- that Mark will comment on that as well to make sure it's absolutely clear. As far as partnerships, we believe that being a company that work with others in health care is an important part of what we do. We obviously are demonstrating we know how to do that. A number of things we talked about already have to do with us forming relationships. So we talked about professional lab services. I'll also mention that when we buy outreach businesses like I referred to with the Hartford Hospital outreach business that we bought, we're working on building on that to have a strong relationship. Couple that with what we announced this fall with Optum. Optum will allow us to work with one of the leaders in health care analytics, leaders in health care services, to work on understanding what we can do to improve the billing process and thereby helping us with our bad debt exposure as well as making sure we get paid for a lot of the more sophisticated testing that we do. We think them working with us is better than us working independent, and that's a good opportunity for our shareholders going forward. So we're optimistic about that opportunity. But what I also see in my introductory remarks, we believe this continues to build on a strong working relationship we have with UnitedHealth Group. And this new working relationship with revenue cycle management will only enhance that relationship. We actually do the -- we have a strong collaboration and do their wellness work within Optum. We have an existing relationship with some of their physician groups that they're buying in terms of laboratory professional services. And then finally is we continue to be a big supplier of laboratory and professional services for UnitedHealthcare membership today, and we believe that will continue to grow. So we're optimistic about the prospects there. We also announced recently the relationship with IBM. This builds on our relationship and our product that we introduced a couple of years ago with Memorial Sloan Kettering. It's in the growing new field of precision medicine, as you know, and we provide in this relationship a product called OncoVantage, which basically provides visibility to community oncologists, what can be known with 34 actionable genes. From that data, we'll say what drugs will work and what drugs will not work, but as importantly, what clinical trials they could potentially enroll their patients in. This work will expand with the relationship with IBM and also Memorial Sloan. We also mentioned that this is collaborative work once again, and the Broad Institute is involved as well, which we're optimistic about, because as I said at the beginning, health care is really a much more collaborative game going forward. And at Quest, we're all about working with others, and it comes through quite clearly with the work we've done and how it's helping our business. So let me just stop there. Let me turn it to Mark to make sure I properly address the question about the PLS business and how we think about revenue per requisition as a calculation. Mark?"

When you think about the work we do, we do tests. Now we use requisitions as a surrogate for volume. But in fact, we do tests. So if a patient comes forward with a single test and, let's say, a standard routine test, and another patient comes forward and has 2 of those, there's going to be different value to the requisition, but it has nothing to do with price. So the reason that people have, and we have shared requisitions, is there is a margin implication to some extent because the front end and the back end is somewhat of a fixed cost per patient engagement or requisition. So specimen acquisition and billing, you say, the more tests you can get on a requisition, the more efficient you can be. But again, that's on the cost side, not the price side. However, with PLS, as we've explained, the specimen acquisition is incredibly efficient. We don't do the draws. And from a logistics perspective, we're picking up dozens and dozens of tests at a single point in time instead of a handful as we want to do at office physician park. So the logistics is very efficient. We don't incur the draw cost. And then the billing is incredibly efficient because there's no third-party billing, there's no patient responsibility. It's a single bill for a large volume to a client. So I just want to make sure we continue to do what we need to do, that people are clear that the mix calculation is a calculation and it's not price. We actually call out price very specifically so you understand apples-and-apples if there are any headwinds, and we're actually getting paid less per test."

Just hoping maybe you could give a little bit of sense of what it maybe contributed, specifically HealthONE and Barnabas, to volume growth this quarter. And maybe help us, is it in the run rate at this point? Is there some sort of ramp we should consider in the -- sort of the fourth quarter and 2017? Any help there? And then just on the pricing side, as you just explained, I guess, what I'm still grappling with is just understanding, so on a test-by-test basis, is the price the same? Or is it lower in PLS, right? Because I would think you'd have more tests per requisition on sort of the hospital testing you would in sort of a normal business. So I guess I'm just trying to reconcile the absolute dollar per test and if that's lower because of a willingness to give up on that because of the benefits on the cost side that you explained."

Let me try to address them all. First off, Barnabas is pretty much largely implemented. We may expand that relationship beyond the current set of hospitals, but at this point, the initial phase of Barnabas is in a run rate. And HCA is the relationship that we said is ramping up. We mentioned about half of the volume growth in the quarter was attributable to PLS, and we don't call out specific relationships, so we're not going to share Barnabas per se or HCA, but we are sharing what PLS is contributing in total. And then contrary to what you may have thought, the test per req per PLS actually tend to be fewer, not greater. When you imagine someone going in for their annual physical, which is quite a bit of our volume -- obviously, some of it is acute conditions that people go into their primary care physician for, but you're doing a battery of tests in your annual physical much more than you might for an acute situation going in as an inpatient or an outpatient at a hospital. So there's actually fewer tests. And then finally, on price, it is priced differently because it's not the commercial rates that we have for the core business and for negotiated direct rate with the hospital where we price it in a way that we can save the money and we can make a margin ourselves. So it is different pricing but not necessarily lower or higher because we have pricing relationships all over the board for any given test, depending on the situation. So it gets a little bit complicated. But in general, fewer tests per req, we have definitely future momentum we expect from our PLS in terms of its volume contribution, definitely from HCA. And so you should expect more of our growth coming from PLS certainly in the immediate future."

So first of all, what we've committed is a continued march of making our business better. And when we say better, we want to improve our quality, service and at the same time making it more efficient. And the goal, as you know, for that is what we call our Invigorate program, which we have committed to an improvement of $1.3 billion by the end of 2017. And that's run rate savings at your ballpark [ph] versus a benchmark of 2011. And as you know, we've been on a great march of showing progress on that. And what we have shown with this relationship is we're far from done. We have a lot more opportunities to improve this business, and we think this relationship with Optum, again, underscores our commitment to continue to make bold changes in this business to become better, okay? And so I keep on saying better because it's both quality and cost. So this relationship with Optum will allow us a couple of things. One is we're going to become more efficient. So how do we become more efficient? One is that by working together with them, our billing operation, which is part of our expense structure, our SG&A cost will become more efficient over time. And we do have commitments around improving that together going forward. That is all part of our commitment for Invigorate. So it allows us to achieve our goal, and also, it extends beyond 2017 obviously since this is a 10-year relationship. Second is, as I said in my introductory remarks, part of the opportunities we have is to provide better transparency to patients, better transparency to patients as far as what prices are and also what is covered. And so they can pay us more often and more quickly. And we believe by providing that, with the help of Optum, will serve both bad debt, our denial rate and just generally our cash flow. So that is part of the relationship as well. We don't disclose the specifics of the agreement. You wouldn't expect that we would. But it's part and parcel of what we -- part of what we believe we need to continue to do to continue to drive progress in this business. The last part of your question is, how does this affect our relationship with UnitedHealth? What I said when we announced this relationship, and I know UnitedHealth will say the same, is it can't hurt. And again, that builds on our existing relationship. We currently do a lot of work for United already. This is a substantial piece of building on that. They are very committed to it. It's a big opportunity for them. It provides visibility of us to them in a much broader, more significant way than ever. We're obviously going to use this to build on that relationship in wellness. I talked about earlier what we could do around their health care businesses that they're building with OptumCare. We believe we can do more that help them with their analytics services. So there's a lot more that we can do with them and will do with them as we go forward because as you know, they're a big player in health care, and we need to work with all the big players in health care. So we're encouraged about what we're doing so far. We're off to a good start. As we said, we're going to move the employees over in mid-November, and we'll start to see savings from this next year. So Mark, anything you'd like to add to that?"

So there are a number of initiatives we had already planned to work on that we think are going to improve bad debt and reduce denials that was part of our Invigorate program. And what's really generating the incremental value here is that Optum is going to bring incremental activities and supplement what we're doing to get us to even a better place we could have gotten on our own or certainly faster than we could have gotten on our own. So it's not as if we're just throwing it over the wall and having Optum pick up what we have been working on, what we had planned to do. We're actually going to continue to do that. A lot of that's involving our IT organization, our commercial organization, et cetera. And we're going to partner with Optum to make that even better."

We have talked about in the past of actually providing that data to a variety of third parties, including the Center for Disease Control. We've talked about them using that to understand how they can manage or monitor the performance of what's happening with hepatitis C, by way of an example. We also have sold that data to pharma companies. We're building on that relationship. We've talked about how we're trying to bring it to the market and possibly with our collaboration with Quintiles. And now that Quintiles has merged with IMS, we continue to have a dialogue of how we can use that data to help with their recruitment of patients for clinical trials. And that's something that we'll talk about once again as we get into our Investor Day in November. Because there's a lot of opportunities for it, it takes longer to get some traction with it, but the prospects are good. And specifically with Optum, as you know, Optum has a broad perspective on the market, and they're helping many integrated delivery systems. One of the products we do provide today for integrated delivery systems is around population health and how they can use this data to help manage that population metric managing and how do we try to identify those patients that are costing the risk taker the most amount of -- each year and by looking at performance versus laboratory results, what we can do about that to help with those gaps in cure, if you will, that they have.

But typically, what we said is, an outreach purchase, it takes 12 to 18 months to get to its going rate on profitability and when we can get all the synergies achieved, and the outreach businesses are typically at our corporate margin percentage. So we usually get some margin dollars pretty quickly on those outreach, but get to our going percentage and ratio profitability, it takes 12 to 18 months. For PLS, it's somewhat similar to an outreach in that there's a transition period of time. A lot of the savings is driven around moving the test menu partially off the hospital site to ours. That doesn't happen the first day. The second piece is really the procurement savings. So it's either changing of the platform or burning through their reagents, which typically are higher cost than ours. It takes a little while before we get to that going profitability. But I'd say the same thing, probably a little closer to 12 than the 18, but we get to the going rate of profitability for PLS within the first year and 1.5 years. Those margins are going to be lower than the corporate average slightly. But as I said before, still an excellent return on invested capital, and there's still double-digit margins."

So it's really going to be as we return to growth that has a high drop-through, and then we have the Invigorate program, which certainly is large enough in this period of time to offset price and our cost pay for us, which is our annual merit inflation and things like that and still have enough to expand margin. As you look at some of the PLS relationships that we've talked about, those have really started up this year. And as I mentioned earlier to the question that while we want us to take PLS again up and going on its profitability, it generally is 12 to 18 months. So you would expect those deals to be contributing more to the bottom line and helping to expand our margin more than they did this year. So it's really -- gets down to the fundamentals, which is the growth and the high drop-through we get there, our Invigorate program, which continues to drive efficiency, and then all of those things more are on an annual or a CAGR basis as opposed to any given quarter.

Well, first of all, as I said, we're excited about the opportunity, and it's an embryonic field. It's building. It's evolving. The field of precision medicine or personalized health care is just -- is very new, and it continues to provide opportunities, but also, it takes time to develop. So we believe, once again, that we, in this field, need to work together with others. 2 years ago, we announced a relationship with Memorial Sloan Kettering. We've brought a product to the market called OncoVantage. The opportunity we're going after, Bill, is to get to those community oncologists, which, as I said in my remarks, about 70% of cancer care is there. And what we realized is that Memorial Sloan is very strong, and we have a strong presence in the United States. But by working together with some others, once again, we can even enhance what we've done already. And so the IBM opportunity allows us to use their platform and also their data capabilities in a much broader way. Second is, as you know, IBM is building out their go-to-market plans for IBM Watson in general, IBM Watson Health and IBM Watson Genomics. And we're hopeful that, that sales force, coupled with our sales force, will drive some additional demand as people become more aware of this. And the other part of this, Bill, is we believe there's an opportunity for patients to become more aware of what they should gain access to and assessing what they need to do with their cancer care. And IBM is a very powerful marketing machine, and we're hopeful that their work and their visibility around cognitive computing and particularly in health care will help us with this effort. Now as far as future products, we have the existing products today. We're offering that. There's plans for us to expand that capability with a number of actionable genes and then also in an expanded panel, which will touch close to 400 genes that we'll look at. Yes, we do believe that this will help us in terms of companion diagnostics with those cancer drugs to rule and rule out patients they can affect and also making sure that we can support in the right way, connecting patients to the right clinical trials through their oncologist with this information. So this is works in progress. A lot will be introduced in time. And it is, I think, a good example of the evolving nature of this whole effort across the world. But we're lining up with some of the best, Memorial Sloan Kettering, IBM, we talked about the Broad Institute, and obviously the relationship we have with MIT and Harvard. So we have a good team working on this, and we feel very, very encouraged about the prospects here."

They have 6 inpatient laboratories that we will manage for them. When we do this, we make them more efficient. If you understand how they work, and I would argue a lot of hospital systems work or for-profit corporations, they're going to see how it goes, and we expect to deliver. And so we're hopeful when we deliver that we can then expand that discussion to say, ""Can we help you in some other areas?"" But the first piece of business right now is to do what we said we're going to do in Denver and do that well. And then we'll grow the account as you grow any account going forward. I would also say that this discussion around hospital interest in what we're doing is building. What we find is that the C suite of integrated delivery systems and hospital CEOs and CFOs are quite interested in anything anyone can do to make them more efficient. I personally get engaged in this in a very active way, and I can tell you that when we go in and have a conversation with a CEO and a CFO and share with them that we can save them 15% to 20% of their hospital inpatient laboratory costs, our batting average, if you will, of getting to the next conversation to start sharing some data is quite good. Very few times do they say, ""We're not interested."" Most times they say, ""Interesting. We should take a look at this, and we understand how you can help us. And let's see if the numbers work."" When we go in there, we also talk about their lab strategy. And usually, when we have a discussion around their inpatient laboratory costs, we then have a conversation around their reference testing, their most advanced testing that we provide to about 15% of hospitals. We talk about us being able to provide more of that for them. And then the third leg of the stool is they then start to question, if they're in an outreach business, essentially competing with us, do they want to remain in that business? And the best end state for us is to become their lab partner, where it's Quest inside. So we do all 3. We're helping them with their inpatient labs, making them more efficient. We're providing the most advanced testing for their hospital operations. And then third is we're their laboratory for their nonhospital portion of the care they're providing within their geographic area. And we have a number of examples of that, and then probably some of the best examples is where we've actually formed joint ventures. And we have a number of outstanding joint ventures, the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. Probably the most recent large one is University of Massachusetts. We have a joint venture up in Massachusetts around that. And there's others, too, that we've built. So I would argue that this is a growing trend. It's a trend that we're ahead on. And it takes a while to build a services business. We've built the capabilities. We're now executing, and now we're starting to see the results of our growth."

At the same time, we all know that health care is very specialized. And so we also, in addition to the geographic orientation to our sales force, have dedicated specialized sales forces. So we have a specialized sales force for our neurology business. We have a specialized sales force for our anatomic pathology business and specialized sales force for our women's health business.

This morning, I will provide you with the highlights of the quarter and review progress on our strategy, and then Mark will provide more detail on the results and take you through our updated guidance. 
During the third quarter, revenues were up on a reported basis and grew 2.1% on an equivalent basis. Reported EPS decreased 43%, primarily due to the gain from our 2015 contribution to the Q2 Solutions joint venture. On an adjusted basis, EPS grew 7%. Cash from operations were $301 million, up 42%. 
Now let me discuss highlights of the progress we're making in several areas of our 5-point strategy, which, as you well know, is to restore growth, drive operational excellence, simplify the organization, refocus on our Diagnostic Information Services business and deliver disciplined capital deployment. 
So let's start with growth. We continue to make progress with our expanded hospital systems relationships. In professional lab services, HCA began to contribute to growth in the third quarter. As we announced earlier this year, we're managing an inpatient laboratory operation for 6 Denver-area hospitals in the HealthONE system of HCA Healthcare. Revenues from this engagement will continue to increase throughout the end of the year. Our professional lab services agreement with RWJBarnabas Health in New Jersey and Clinical Laboratory Partners, the outreach lab business we acquired from Hartford HealthCare in Connecticut, both contributed to perform well and grew revenue this quarter. 
Beyond our hospital systems relationships, we also continue to deliver solid growth in prescription drug monitoring and infectious disease testing, including Zika. In prescription drug monitoring, we remain an industry leader, with strong growth in the quarter. Providers and payers appreciate our unique ability to help manage the epidemic of prescription drug abuse with appropriate test utilization. 
In infectious disease, we continue to see solid growth in the fourth-generation HIV testing as well as hepatitis C testing for screening and genotyping to help doctors determine the type, dose or duration of treatment. 
Turning to Zika. We complemented our proprietary PCR test with a new antibody test license from the Center for Disease Control. Quest Diagnostics is proud to be among a group of select national reference laboratories selected by the Center for Disease Control to aid the response to the Zika emergency in the United States. 
Looking forward, we're excited about our new agreement with Ancestry. Quest will become Ancestry's first CLIA-approved lab partner to provide DNA testing, enabling AncestryDNA subscribers to build their family tree based on ethnic origins. Over time, we intend to explore additional opportunities with Ancestry to guide people on building and understanding their family health tree. 
We're also very excited about the recent launch of the IBM Watson Genomics from Quest Diagnostics, a new service that helps advance precision medicine by combining cognitive computing with genomic tumor sequencing. The service helps oncologists match patients with cancer therapies and clinical trials based on the tumor's unique DNA. Quest's expertise of genomics and cancer as well as our broad market penetration to half the country's physicians and hospitals means Watson-powered tumor sequencing is accessible for the first time to the community of oncologists who provide 70% of the nation's cancer care. Memorial Sloan Kettering and the Broad Institute will contribute their data and research expertise to further augment the offering. 
The next element of our strategy I will highlight is driving operational excellence. Our collaboration with Optum will help Quest reduce cost and complexity of our billing processes and also increase transparency of health care costs for patients, physicians and employers. Employee engagement in our Optum alliance has been positive, and the integration is on track. Quest employees will transition to Optum team in mid-November. We expect to begin realizing savings from this relationship next year. We view this agreement with Optum as the start of a long-term relationship, and it builds on our long-standing relationship with Optum's parent, UnitedHealth Group. For decades, Quest has served UnitedHealthcare plan participants to help them take action to improve their health based on insights from diagnostic testing and information services. 
Also in the third quarter, we opened 12 patient service centers in 5 states in Safeway supermarkets. In just the first months, patients are finding it easier to access testing in a more convenient location, and we've seen volume increases in these retail settings. We remain excited about expanding patient access through retail partnerships. 
We continue to execute on our last element of our strategy, which is to deliver disciplined capital deployment. We completed our $250 million accelerated share repurchase program announced in May, using the proceeds of the sale of Focus Diagnostics business. Through this ASR, we repurchased approximately 3.1 million shares, additionally bought back another $50 million of company stock, bringing the total repurchases in 2016 to $440 million through the end of the third quarter. 
We look forward to sharing more detail on our market views and strategic outlook at our third Investor Day at the Intercontinental New York Barclay Hotel in Midtown on November 11. Registration information is available on our Investor Relations web page. 
Now Mark will provide an overview on our third quarter financial performance and provide you with an update on our 2016 outlook. Mark?"

Starting with revenues, consolidated revenues of $1.89 billion were up 0.3% versus the prior year on a reported basis. Equivalent revenues grew 2.1% for the company. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services, or DIS for short, grew by 2.1% compared to the prior year. Of this growth, approximately 1% was organic. 
Volume, measured by the number of requisitions, increased 2% versus the prior year. Approximately half came from organic growth, including our professional lab services, or PLS, engagements and the other half from recent acquisitions. 
Revenue per requisition in the third quarter was flat versus a year ago. As a reminder, revenue per req is not a proxy for price. It includes a number of variables such as unit price variation, business mix, test mix and test per requisition. Unit price headwinds moderated in the third quarter, down roughly 50 basis points compared to the 100 basis point headwinds we observed in the first half. 
Consistent with previous quarters, our PLS engagements, such as RWJBarnabas Health and HCA, carry lower revenue per requisition due to the nature of the work we are performing and the lower the revenue per req calculation. In the third quarter, impact of our PLS engagements was slightly larger than the 120 basis points we highlighted in the second quarter, which is representative of the strong growth we are seeing in this business. With HCA coming online in the third quarter and ramping up through the end of the year, we expect PLS to continue to grow at a faster rate than the balance of our business in Q4. 
After considering the impacts of unit price and PLS, other mix elements, including test and payer mix, contributed nearly 2% to revenue per req in the quarter. 
Reported operating income for the quarter was $322 million or 17.1% of revenues compared to $631 million or 33.6% of revenues a year ago. Our reported third quarter 2015 results included a $334 million pretax gain on the contribution to our Q2 joint venture with Quintiles. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $320 million or 17% of revenues compared to $325 million or 17.3% of revenues last year. The impact of our former Focus Diagnostics and Celera products businesses in the third quarter of 2015 benefited adjusted operating income by approximately $16 million or 50 basis points. Excluding this impact, margins would have grown by 20 basis points year-over-year. 
Reported EPS was $1.34 in the quarter compared to $2.35 a year ago. The year-over-year decline was driven primarily by the net gain on our Q2 contribution mentioned previously. Adjusted EPS was $1.37, up from $1.28 last year. The company recorded special items with an after-tax benefit totaling $10 million in the quarter, representing an escrow recovery associated with an acquisition, which was partially offset by restructuring and integration charges. The net impact of these items benefited our reported EPS by $0.07. 
Bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues was 4%, 20 basis points better than the previous quarter and 10 basis points higher than 2015. As a reminder, bad debt expense typically improves modestly throughout the year as patients hit their health insurance deductibles. Note that the year-over-year compare is negatively impacted by the fact that our products businesses had a lower associated bad debt rate. When taking this into consideration, our bad debt rate was flat year-over-year. 
Quick comment on our new billing relationship with Optum. To reiterate, expense savings from this relationship will not begin until 2017. We expect modest savings on our billing support costs during each year of the 10-year agreement, and Optum will work with us to help lower our bad debt rate as well as reduce our denials over time. 
Income tax expense in the quarter benefited from the adoption of the new accounting standard related to stock-based compensation. The impact amounted to an EPS benefit of roughly $0.02 in Q3. The new standard also results in a change in weighted shares outstanding by increasing the effect of diluted securities, which slightly offsets the EPS benefit. 
Our DSOs were 46 days, 2 days higher than last year but 1 day better than the prior quarter. The year-over-year increase is primarily attributable to higher levels of patient responsibility. 
Through the first 9 months of 2016, cash provided by operations was $765 million versus $549 million last year. Capital expenditures were $165 million through the third quarter, compared to $169 million a year ago. 
Before moving to guidance, I'd like to highlight that operations in our Southeast region were impacted by Hurricane Matthew earlier this month. Our updated guidance reflects the impact we currently know. Additionally, I want to provide some color on a few notable items which will impact our full year operating cash flows. 
The first relates to after-tax charges for the full year 2016 of $29 million from the retirement of debt. Second, we will incur a full year cash tax outlay of $91 million associated with the Focus divestiture that will be recorded in our operating cash flow, while the associated $275 million from the sale is reported in our investing cash flow. We paid $68 million of this liability in Q3, with the remainder to be paid in the fourth quarter. Third, in Q3, we realized $54 million of proceeds from the termination of interest rate swap agreements. In aggregate, these 3 items are adversely impacting our full year operating cash flow by a net of $66 million. 
Now turning to guidance. Based on our year-to-date results, we are narrowing our 2016 outlook as follows. Revenues to be approximately $7.51 billion, an increase of about 0.5% versus the prior year on a reported basis and an increase of about 2.5% on an equivalent basis. This compares to previous revenue guidance of between $7.47 billion and $7.54 billion. 
Reported diluted EPS to be between $4.47 and $4.52, and adjusted EPS to be between $5.07 and $5.12. This compares to previous EPS guidance of $4.18 and $4.33 on a reported basis and $5.02 and $5.17 on an adjusted basis. 
Cash provided by operations to be approximately $1 billion, which compares to previous guidance of approximately $880 million. 
And finally, capital expenditures to be approximately $250 million, compared to between $250 million and $300 million previously. 
Now let me turn it back to Steve."

Well, first of all, we're encouraged with our continuing to growth that we're seeing in our professional lab services business. We've highlighted 2 in my opening remarks. One is the relationship with HCA. The second is related to our relationship with Barnabas here in New Jersey. They're off and running. They contributed to growth in the third quarter. We're optimistic about their prospects, and also, we have a good funnel with us. You made one comment that I would like to react to. We've been very, very careful to make sure that we describe how this business affects the calculation of revenue per requisition. And what we've done carefully is to talk about in the script, and I'm sure Mark will provide some color, is that we actually provided in the script the unit price impact this quarter to our performance. And that is when you freeze all other characteristics of our business, what the true pricing impact is on our business, where there's other characteristics of our business like business mix and payer mix that affect the calculation of revenue per req. So we feel very positive about the growth prospects of our professional lab services business. It's a great growth opportunity. It's great return on invested capital. Therefore, it's great for shareholder value creation. But it does affect the calculation because it's at a lower price point. That is not to be confused with price reductions. So I want to make sure that's clear because I'm sure when I'm done here that Mark will comment on that as well to make sure it's absolutely clear. As far as partnerships, we believe that being a company that work with others in health care is an important part of what we do. We obviously are demonstrating we know how to do that. A number of things we talked about already have to do with us forming relationships. We talked about professional lab services. I'll also mention that when we buy outreach businesses like I referred to with the Hartford Hospital outreach business that we bought, we're working on building on that to have a strong relationship. Couple that with what we announced this fall with Optum. Optum will allow us to work with one of the leaders in health care analytics, leaders in health care services, to work on understanding what we can do to improve the billing process and thereby helping us with our bad debt exposure as well as making sure we get paid for a lot of the more sophisticated testing that we do. We think them working with us is better than us working independent, and that's a good opportunity for our shareholders going forward. So we're optimistic about that opportunity. But what I also see in my introductory remarks, we believe this continues to build on a strong working relationship we have with UnitedHealth Group. And this new working relationship with revenue cycle management will only enhance that relationship. We actually do the -- we have a strong collaboration and do their wellness work within Optum. We have an existing relationship with some of their physician groups that they're buying in terms of laboratory professional services. And then finally is we continue to be a big supplier of laboratory and professional services for UnitedHealthcare membership today, and we believe that will continue to grow. So we're optimistic about the prospects there. We also announced recently the relationship with IBM. This builds on our relationship and our product that we introduced a couple of years ago with Memorial Sloan Kettering. It's in the growing new field of precision medicine, as you know, and we provide in this relationship a product called OncoVantage, which basically provides visibility to community oncologists, what can be known with 34 actionable genes. From that data, we'll say what drugs will work and what drugs will not work, but as importantly, what clinical trials they could potentially enroll their patients in. This work will expand with the relationship with IBM and also Memorial Sloan. We also mentioned that this is collaborative work once again, and the Broad Institute is involved as well which we're optimistic about, because as I said at the beginning, health care is really a much more collaborative game going forward. And at Quest, we're all about working with others, and it comes through quite clear with the work we've done and how it's helping our business. So let me just stop there. Let me turn it to Mark to make sure I properly addressed the question about the PLS business and how we think about revenue per requisition as a calculation. Mark?"

When you think about the work we do, we do tests. Now, we use requisitions as a surrogate for volume. But in fact, we do tests. So if a patient comes forward with a single test and, let's say, a standard routine test, and another patient comes forward and has 2 of those, there's going to be a different value to the requisition that has nothing to do with price. So the reason that people have, and we have shared requisitions, is there is a margin implication to some extent because the front end and the back end is somewhat of a fixed cost per patient engagement or requisition. So specimen acquisition and billing, you say, the more tests you can get on a requisition, the more efficient you can be. But again, that's on the cost side, not the price side. However, with PLS, as we've explained, the specimen acquisition is incredibly efficient. We don't do the draws. And from a logistics perspective, we're picking up dozens and dozens of tests at a single point in time instead of a handful as we want to do at office physician park. So the logistics is very efficient. We don't incur the draw cost. And then the billing is incredibly efficient because there's no third-party billing, there's no patient responsibility; it's a single bill for a large volume to a client. So I just want to make sure we continue to do what we need to do, that people are clear that the mix calculation is a calculation and it's not price. We actually call out price very specifically so you understand apples-and-apples if there are any headwinds, and we're actually getting paid less per test."

And maybe help us, is it in the run rate at this point? Is there some sort of ramp we should consider and sort of the fourth quarter and in 2017? Any help there? And then just on the pricing side, as you just explained, I guess, what I'm still grappling with is just understanding. So on a test-by-test basis, is the price the same? Or is it lower in PLS, right? Because I would think you'd have more tests per requisition on sort of a hospital test than you would in sort of a normal business. So I guess I'm just trying to reconcile the absolute dollar per test and if that's lower because of a willingness to give up on that because of the benefits on the cost side that you explained."

Let me try to address them all. First off, Barnabas is pretty much largely implemented. We may expand that relationship beyond the current set of hospitals, but at this point, the initial phase of Barnabas is in a run rate. And HCA is the relationship that we said is ramping up. We mentioned about half of the volume growth in the quarter was attributable to PLS, and we don't call out specific relationships, so we're not going to share Barnabas per se or HCA, but we are sharing what PLS is contributing in total. And then contrary to what you may have thought, the test per req for PLS actually tend to be fewer, not greater. When you imagine someone going in for their annual physical, which is quite a bit of our volume, obviously, some of it is acute conditions that people go into their primary care physician for, but you're doing a battery of tests in your annual physical much more than you might for an acute situation going in as an inpatient or an outpatient at a hospital. So there's actually fewer tests. And then finally, on price, it is priced differently because it's not the commercial rates that we have for the core business and for negotiated direct rate with the hospital where we price it in a way that we can save them money and we can make a margin ourselves. So it is different pricing but not necessarily lower or higher because we have pricing relationships all over the board for any given test, depending on the situation. So it gets a little bit complicated. But in general, fewer tests per req, we have definitely future momentum we expect from our PLS in terms of its volume contribution, definitely from HCA. And so you should expect more of our growth coming from PLS certainly in the immediate future."

So first of all, what we've committed is a continued march of making our business better. And when we say better, we want to improve our quality, service and at the same time making it more efficient. And our goal, as you know for that, is what we call our Invigorate program, which we have committed to an improvement of $1.3 billion by the end of 2017. And that's run rate savings that you recall that versus a benchmark of 2011. And as you know, we've been on a great march of showing progress on that. And what we have shown with this relationship is we're far from done. We have a lot more opportunities to improve this business, and we think this relationship with Optum, again, underscores our commitment to continue to make bold changes in this business to become better, okay. And so I keep on saying better because it's both quality and cost. So this relationship with Optum will allow us a couple of things. One is we're going to become more efficient. So how do we become more efficient? One is that by working together with them, our billing operation, which is part of our expense structure, our SG&A cost will become more efficient over time. And we do have commitments around improving that together going forward. That is all part of our commitment for Invigorate. So it allows us to achieve our goal, and also, it extends beyond 2017, obviously, since this is a 10-year relationship. Second is, as I said in my introductory remarks, part of the opportunities we have is to provide better transparency to patients, better transparency to patients as far as what prices are and also what is covered and so they can pay us more often and more quickly. And we believe by providing that, with the help of Optum, will serve both bad debt, our denial rate and just generally our cash flow. So that is part of the relationship as well. We don't disclose the specifics of the agreement. You wouldn't expect that we would. But it's part and parcel of what we -- part of what we believe we need to continue to do to continue to drive the progress in this business. The last part of your question is, how does this affect our relationship with UnitedHealth? What I said when we announced this relationship, and I know UnitedHealth will say the same, is it can't hurt. And again, that builds on our existing relationship. We currently do a lot of work for United already. This is a substantial piece of building on that. They are very committed to it. It's a big opportunity for them. It provides visibility of us to them in a much broader, more significant way than ever. We're obviously going to use this to build on that relationship in wellness. I talked about earlier what we could do around their health care businesses that they're building with OptumCare. We believe we can do more that help them with their analytics services. So there's a lot more that we can do with them and will do with them as we go forward because, as you know, they're a big player in health care, and we need to work with all the big players in health care. So we're encouraged about what we're doing so far. We're off to a good start. As we said, we're going to move the employees over in mid-November, and we'll start to see savings from this next year. So Mark, anything you'd like to add to that?"

So we have a nice bird's-eye view of what's happening with the American population, and we're trying to use that in the most responsible and also the best way for our shareholders. We have talked about in the past of actually providing that data to a variety of third parties, including the Center for Disease Control. We've talked about them using that to understand how they can manage or monitor the performance of what's happening with hepatitis C, by way of an example. We also have sold that data to pharma companies. We're building on that relationship. We've talked about how we're trying to bring to the market and possibly with our collaboration with Quintiles now that Quintiles has merged with IMS. We continue to have a dialogue of how we could use that data to help with their recruitment of patients for clinical trials. And that's something that we'll talk about once again as we get into our Investor Day in November. Because there's a lot of opportunities for it, it takes longer to get some traction with it, but the prospects are good. And specifically with Optum, as you know, Optum has a broad perspective on the market, and they're helping many integrated delivery systems. One of the products we do provide today for integrated delivery systems is around population health and how they can use this data to help manage that population metric managing and how do we try to identify those patients that are costing the risk taker the most amount each year and by looking at performance versus laboratory results, what we could do about that, to help with those gaps in care, if you will, that they have. So a lot of opportunities. Again, come November, we'll share more with you."

So when you talk about margins, I want to make sure whether you're asking dollars or percentages, so I'll address both. But typically, what we said is an outreach purchase, it takes 12 to 18 months to get to its going rate on profitability when we can get all the synergies achieved, and the outreach businesses are typically at our corporate margin percentage. So we usually get some margin dollars pretty quickly on those outreach, but get to our going percentage and ratio profitability, it takes 12 to 18 months. For PLS, it's somewhat similar to an outreach in that there's a transition period of time. A lot of the savings is driven around moving the test menu partially off the hospital site to ours. That doesn't happen the first day. The second piece is really the procurement savings. So it's either changing out the platform or burning through their reagents, which typically are higher cost than ours. It takes a little while before we get to that going profitability. But I'd say the same thing, probably a little closer to 12 than the 18, but we get to the going rate of profitability for PLS within the first year to 1.5 years. Those margins are going to be lower than the corporate average slightly. But as I said before, still an excellent return on invested capital, and they're still double-digit margins."

It feels like -- I felt that your analyst event 2 years ago, you were talking about kind of 8% to 10% operational EPS growth. So there's a pretty sizable delta between that operating income and that kind of operational EPS aspiration.

So the things that are going to contribute to growing earnings faster than our revenue are unchanged. So it's really going to be as we return to growth that has a high drop-through, and then we have the Invigorate program, which certainly is large enough in this period of time to offset price and our cost pay-fors, which is our annual merit inflation and things like that and still have enough to expand margin. As you look at some of the PLS relationships that we've talked about, those have really started up this year. And as I mentioned earlier to the question that how long does it to take PLS to get up and going on its profitability, it generally is 12 to 18 months. So you would expect those deals to be contributing more to the bottom line and helping to expand our margin more than they did this year. So it's really -- gets down to the fundamentals, which is the growth and the high drop-through we get there, our Invigorate program, which continues to drive efficiency, and then all of those things more are on an annual or a CAGR basis as opposed to any given quarter. And year-to-date, we're up 5.4%. So that's a higher number than the third quarter."

So really, it comes down to our capital allocation strategy, which is, once you get beyond the 50% that we guarantee to our -- of our free cash flow to our shareholders, it comes mostly through the dividend but also through some share repurchases, then the decision is what's the best value-creation strategy.

Well, first of all, as I said, we're excited about the opportunity, and it's an embryonic field. It's building. It's evolving. The field of precision medicine or personalized health care is just -- is very new, and it continues to provide opportunities, but also, it takes time to develop. So we believe, once again, that we, in this field, need to work together with others. Two years ago, we announced a relationship with Memorial Sloan Kettering. We've brought a product to the market called OncoVantage. The opportunity we're going after, Bill, is to get to those community oncologists, which, as I said in my remarks, about 70% of cancer care is there. And what we realized is that Memorial Sloan is very strong, and we have a strong presence in the United States. But by working together with some others, once again, we can even enhance what we've done already. And so the IBM opportunity allows us to use their platform and also their data capabilities in a much broader way. Second is, as you know, IBM is building out their go-to-market plans for IBM Watson in general, IBM Watson Health and IBM Watson Genomics. And we're hopeful that, that sales force, coupled with our sales force, will drive some additional demand as people become more aware of this. And the other part of this, Bill, is we believe there's an opportunity for patients to become more aware of what they should gain access to in assessing what they need to do with their cancer care. And IBM is a very powerful marketing machine, and we're hopeful that their work and their visibility around cognitive computing and particularly in health care will help us with this effort. Now as far as future products, we have the existing products today. We're offering that. There is plans for us to expand that capability with a number of actionable genes and then also an expanded panel, which will touch close to 400 genes that we'll look at. Yes, we do believe that this will help us in terms of companion diagnostics with those cancer drugs to rule and rule out patients they can affect and also making sure that we can support in the right way, connecting patients to the right clinical trials through their oncologist with this information. So this is works in progress. A lot will be introduced in time. And it is, I think, a good example of the evolving nature of this whole effort across the world. But we're lining up with some of the best, Memorial Sloan Kettering, IBM, we talked about the Broad Institute, and obviously the relationship we have with MIT and Harvard. So we have a good team working on this, and we feel very, very encouraged about the prospects here."

If you understand how they work, and I would argue a lot of hospital systems work or for-profit corporations, they're going to see how it goes, and we expect to deliver. And so we're hopeful when we deliver that we can then expand that discussion to say, ""Can we help you in some other areas?"" But the first piece of business right now is to do what we said we're going to do in Denver and do that well. And then we'll grow the account as you grow any account going forward. I would also say that this discussion around hospital interest in what we're doing is building. What we find is that the C suite of integrated delivery systems and hospital CEOs and CFOs are quite interested in anything anyone can do to make them more efficient. I personally get engaged in this in a very active way, and I can tell you that when we go in and have a conversation with a CEO and a CFO and share with them that we can save them 15% to 20% of their hospital inpatient laboratory costs, our batting average, if you will, of getting to the next conversation to start sharing some data is quite good. Very few times do they say, ""We're not interested."" Most times they say, ""Interesting. We should take a look at this, and we understand how you can help us. And let's see if the numbers work."" When we go in there, we also talk about their lab strategy. And usually, when we have a discussion around their inpatient laboratory costs, we then have a conversation around their reference testing, their most advanced testing that we provide to about 15% of hospitals. We talk about us being able to provide more of that for them. And then the third leg of the stool is they then start to question, if they're in an outreach business, essentially competing with us, do they want to remain in that business. And the best end state for us is to become their lab partner, where it's Quest inside. So we do all 3. We're helping them with their inpatient labs, making them more efficient. We're providing the most advanced testing for their hospital operations. And then third is we're their laboratory for their nonhospital portion of the care they're providing within their geographic area. And we have a number of examples of that, and then probably some of the best examples is where we've actually formed joint ventures. And we have a number of outstanding joint ventures, the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. Probably the most recent large one is University of Massachusetts. We have a joint venture up in Massachusetts around that. And there's others, too, that we've built. So I would argue that this is a growing trend. It's a trend that we're ahead on. And it takes a while to build a services business. We've built the capabilities. We're now executing, and now we're starting to see the results of our growth."

Some of the mentions that I had in my introductory comments show that we continue to get good growth out of some of the more advanced testing. And particularly, our last question around our work with IBM and the work in genetics, and that field continues to provide nice growth prospects for us. So we're continuing to get growth. And once again, we'll share the growth from that business in due course as we announce our results. As far as pricing, it's already in that 50 basis points headwind, if you will. We don't share specifics on what's happening with commercial contracts or what's happening for test. But it's implied in the 50 basis points. So it's very manageable that we believe there's always going to be some ups and downs in our portfolio of tests, and we're bringing new products to the marketplace as well, which have new price points. So it's in that overall aggregate measure that we provide."

At the same time, we all know that health care is very specialized. And so we also, in addition to the geographic orientation to our sales force, have dedicated specialized sales forces. So we have a specialized sales force for our neurology business. We have a specialized sales force for our anatomic pathology business and specialized sales force for our women's health business.

This morning, I will provide you with the highlights of the quarter and review progress on our strategy, and then Mark will provide more detail on the results and take you through our updated guidance. 
During the third quarter, revenues were up on a reported basis and grew 2.1% on an equivalent basis. Reported EPS decreased 43%, primarily due to the gain from our 2015 contribution to the Q2 Solutions joint venture. On an adjusted basis, EPS grew 7%. Cash from operations were $301 million, up 42%. 
Now let me discuss highlights of the progress we're making in several areas of our 5-point strategy, which, as you well know, is to restore growth, drive operational excellence, simplify the organization, refocus on our Diagnostic Information Services business and deliver disciplined capital deployment. 
So let's start with growth. We continue to make progress with our expanded hospital systems relationships. In professional lab services, HCA began to contribute to growth in the third quarter. As we announced earlier this year, we're managing an inpatient laboratory operation for 6 Denver-area hospitals in the HealthONE system of HCA Healthcare. Revenues from this engagement will continue to increase throughout the end of the year. Our professional lab services agreement with RWJBarnabas Health in New Jersey and Clinical Laboratory Partners, the outreach lab business we acquired from Hartford HealthCare in Connecticut, both contributed to perform well and grew revenue this quarter. 
Beyond our hospital systems relationships, we also continue to deliver solid growth in prescription drug monitoring and infectious disease testing, including Zika. In prescription drug monitoring, we remain an industry leader, with strong growth in the quarter. Providers and payers appreciate our unique ability to help manage the epidemic of prescription drug abuse with appropriate test utilization. 
In infectious disease, we continue to see solid growth in the fourth-generation HIV testing as well as hepatitis C testing for screening and genotyping to help doctors determine the type, dose or duration of treatment. 
Turning to Zika. We complemented our proprietary PCR test with a new antibody test license from the Center for Disease Control. Quest Diagnostics is proud to be among a group of select national reference laboratories selected by the Center for Disease Control to aid the response to the Zika emergency in the United States. 
Looking forward, we're excited about our new agreement with Ancestry. Quest will become Ancestry's first CLIA-approved lab partner to provide DNA testing, enabling AncestryDNA subscribers to build their family tree based on ethnic origins. Over time, we intend to explore additional opportunities with Ancestry to guide people on building and understanding their family health tree. 
We're also very excited about the recent launch of the IBM Watson Genomics from Quest Diagnostics, a new service that helps advance precision medicine by combining cognitive computing with genomic tumor sequencing. The service helps oncologists match patients with cancer therapies and clinical trials based on the tumor's unique DNA. Quest's expertise of genomics and cancer as well as our broad market penetration to half the country's physicians and hospitals means Watson-powered tumor sequencing is accessible for the first time to the community of oncologists who provide 70% of the nation's cancer care. Memorial Sloan Kettering and the Broad Institute will contribute their data and research expertise to further augment the offering. 
The next element of our strategy I will highlight is driving operational excellence. Our collaboration with Optum will help Quest reduce cost and complexity of our billing processes and also increase transparency of health care costs for patients, physicians and employers. Employee engagement in our Optum alliance has been positive, and the integration is on track. Quest employees will transition to Optum team in mid-November. We expect to begin realizing savings from this relationship next year. We view this agreement with Optum as the start of a long-term relationship, and it builds on our long-standing relationship with Optum's parent, UnitedHealth Group. For decades, Quest has served UnitedHealthcare plan participants to help them take action to improve their health based on insights from diagnostic testing and information services. 
Also in the third quarter, we opened 12 patient service centers in 5 states in Safeway supermarkets. In just the first months, patients are finding it easier to access testing in a more convenient location, and we've seen volume increases in these retail settings. We remain excited about expanding patient access through retail partnerships. 
We continue to execute on our last element of our strategy, which is to deliver disciplined capital deployment. We completed our $250 million accelerated share repurchase program announced in May, using the proceeds of the sale of Focus Diagnostics business. Through this ASR, we repurchased approximately 3.1 million shares, additionally bought back another $50 million of company stock, bringing the total repurchases in 2016 to $440 million through the end of the third quarter. 
We look forward to sharing more detail on our market views and strategic outlook at our third Investor Day at the Intercontinental New York Barclay Hotel in Midtown on November 11. Registration information is available on our Investor Relations web page. 
Now Mark will provide an overview on our third quarter financial performance and provide you with an update on our 2016 outlook. Mark?"

Starting with revenues, consolidated revenues of $1.89 billion were up 0.3% versus the prior year on a reported basis. Equivalent revenues grew 2.1% for the company. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services, or DIS for short, grew by 2.",1053,"Thanks, Steve. Starting with revenues, consolidated revenues of $1.89 billion were up 0.3% versus the prior year on a reported basis. Equivalent revenues grew 2.1% for the company. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services, or DIS for short, grew by 2.1% compared to the prior year. Of this growth, approximately 1% was organic. 
Volume, measured by the number of requisitions, increased 2% versus the prior year. Approximately half came from organic growth, including our professional lab services, or PLS, engagements and the other half from recent acquisitions. 
Revenue per requisition in the third quarter was flat versus a year ago. As a reminder, revenue per req is not a proxy for price. It includes a number of variables such as unit price variation, business mix, test mix and test per requisition. Unit price headwinds moderated in the third quarter, down roughly 50 basis points compared to the 100 basis point headwinds we observed in the first half. 
Consistent with previous quarters, our PLS engagements, such as RWJBarnabas Health and HCA, carry lower revenue per requisition due to the nature of the work we are performing and the lower the revenue per req calculation. In the third quarter, impact of our PLS engagements was slightly larger than the 120 basis points we highlighted in the second quarter, which is representative of the strong growth we are seeing in this business. With HCA coming online in the third quarter and ramping up through the end of the year, we expect PLS to continue to grow at a faster rate than the balance of our business in Q4. 
After considering the impacts of unit price and PLS, other mix elements, including test and payer mix, contributed nearly 2% to revenue per req in the quarter. 
Reported operating income for the quarter was $322 million or 17.1% of revenues compared to $631 million or 33.6% of revenues a year ago. Our reported third quarter 2015 results included a $334 million pretax gain on the contribution to our Q2 joint venture with Quintiles. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $320 million or 17% of revenues compared to $325 million or 17.3% of revenues last year. The impact of our former Focus Diagnostics and Celera products businesses in the third quarter of 2015 benefited adjusted operating income by approximately $16 million or 50 basis points. Excluding this impact, margins would have grown by 20 basis points year-over-year. 
Reported EPS was $1.34 in the quarter compared to $2.35 a year ago. The year-over-year decline was driven primarily by the net gain on our Q2 contribution mentioned previously. Adjusted EPS was $1.37, up from $1.28 last year. The company recorded special items with an after-tax benefit totaling $10 million in the quarter, representing an escrow recovery associated with an acquisition, which was partially offset by restructuring and integration charges. The net impact of these items benefited our reported EPS by $0.07. 
Bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues was 4%, 20 basis points better than the previous quarter and 10 basis points higher than 2015. As a reminder, bad debt expense typically improves modestly throughout the year as patients hit their health insurance deductibles. Note that the year-over-year compare is negatively impacted by the fact that our products businesses had a lower associated bad debt rate. When taking this into consideration, our bad debt rate was flat year-over-year. 
Quick comment on our new billing relationship with Optum. To reiterate, expense savings from this relationship will not begin until 2017. We expect modest savings on our billing support costs during each year of the 10-year agreement, and Optum will work with us to help lower our bad debt rate as well as reduce our denials over time. 
Income tax expense in the quarter benefited from the adoption of the new accounting standard related to stock-based compensation. The impact amounted to an EPS benefit of roughly $0.02 in Q3. The new standard also results in a change in weighted shares outstanding by increasing the effect of diluted securities, which slightly offsets the EPS benefit. 
Our DSOs were 46 days, 2 days higher than last year but 1 day better than the prior quarter. The year-over-year increase is primarily attributable to higher levels of patient responsibility. 
Through the first 9 months of 2016, cash provided by operations was $765 million versus $549 million last year. Capital expenditures were $165 million through the third quarter, compared to $169 million a year ago. 
Before moving to guidance, I'd like to highlight that operations in our Southeast region were impacted by Hurricane Matthew earlier this month. Our updated guidance reflects the impact we currently know. Additionally, I want to provide some color on a few notable items which will impact our full year operating cash flows. 
The first relates to after-tax charges for the full year 2016 of $29 million from the retirement of debt. Second, we will incur a full year cash tax outlay of $91 million associated with the Focus divestiture that will be recorded in our operating cash flow, while the associated $275 million from the sale is reported in our investing cash flow. We paid $68 million of this liability in Q3, with the remainder to be paid in the fourth quarter. Third, in Q3, we realized $54 million of proceeds from the termination of interest rate swap agreements. In aggregate, these 3 items are adversely impacting our full year operating cash flow by a net of $66 million. 
Now turning to guidance. Based on our year-to-date results, we are narrowing our 2016 outlook as follows. Revenues to be approximately $7.51 billion, an increase of about 0.5% versus the prior year on a reported basis and an increase of about 2.5% on an equivalent basis. This compares to previous revenue guidance of between $7.47 billion and $7.54 billion. 
Reported diluted EPS to be between $4.47 and $4.52, and adjusted EPS to be between $5.07 and $5.12. This compares to previous EPS guidance of $4.18 and $4.33 on a reported basis and $5.02 and $5.17 on an adjusted basis. 
Cash provided by operations to be approximately $1 billion, which compares to previous guidance of approximately $880 million. 
And finally, capital expenditures to be approximately $250 million, compared to between $250 million and $300 million previously. 
Now let me turn it back to Steve."

Well, first of all, we're encouraged with our continuing to growth that we're seeing in our professional lab services business. We've highlighted 2 in my opening remarks. One is the relationship with HCA. The second is related to our relationship with Barnabas here in New Jersey. They're off and running. They contributed to growth in the third quarter. We're optimistic about their prospects, and also, we have a good funnel with us. You made one comment that I would like to react to. We've been very, very careful to make sure that we describe how this business affects the calculation of revenue per requisition. And what we've done carefully is to talk about in the script, and I'm sure Mark will provide some color, is that we actually provided in the script the unit price impact this quarter to our performance. And that is when you freeze all other characteristics of our business, what the true pricing impact is on our business, where there's other characteristics of our business like business mix and payer mix that affect the calculation of revenue per req. So we feel very positive about the growth prospects of our professional lab services business. It's a great growth opportunity. It's great return on invested capital. Therefore, it's great for shareholder value creation. But it does affect the calculation because it's at a lower price point. That is not to be confused with price reductions. So I want to make sure that's clear because I'm sure when I'm done here that Mark will comment on that as well to make sure it's absolutely clear. As far as partnerships, we believe that being a company that work with others in health care is an important part of what we do. We obviously are demonstrating we know how to do that. A number of things we talked about already have to do with us forming relationships. We talked about professional lab services. I'll also mention that when we buy outreach businesses like I referred to with the Hartford Hospital outreach business that we bought, we're working on building on that to have a strong relationship. Couple that with what we announced this fall with Optum. Optum will allow us to work with one of the leaders in health care analytics, leaders in health care services, to work on understanding what we can do to improve the billing process and thereby helping us with our bad debt exposure as well as making sure we get paid for a lot of the more sophisticated testing that we do. We think them working with us is better than us working independent, and that's a good opportunity for our shareholders going forward. So we're optimistic about that opportunity. But what I also see in my introductory remarks, we believe this continues to build on a strong working relationship we have with UnitedHealth Group. And this new working relationship with revenue cycle management will only enhance that relationship. We actually do the -- we have a strong collaboration and do their wellness work within Optum. We have an existing relationship with some of their physician groups that they're buying in terms of laboratory professional services. And then finally is we continue to be a big supplier of laboratory and professional services for UnitedHealthcare membership today, and we believe that will continue to grow. So we're optimistic about the prospects there. We also announced recently the relationship with IBM. This builds on our relationship and our product that we introduced a couple of years ago with Memorial Sloan Kettering. It's in the growing new field of precision medicine, as you know, and we provide in this relationship a product called OncoVantage, which basically provides visibility to community oncologists, what can be known with 34 actionable genes. From that data, we'll say what drugs will work and what drugs will not work, but as importantly, what clinical trials they could potentially enroll their patients in. This work will expand with the relationship with IBM and also Memorial Sloan. We also mentioned that this is collaborative work once again, and the Broad Institute is involved as well which we're optimistic about, because as I said at the beginning, health care is really a much more collaborative game going forward. And at Quest, we're all about working with others, and it comes through quite clear with the work we've done and how it's helping our business. So let me just stop there. Let me turn it to Mark to make sure I properly addressed the question about the PLS business and how we think about revenue per requisition as a calculation. Mark?"

When you think about the work we do, we do tests. Now, we use requisitions as a surrogate for volume. But in fact, we do tests. So if a patient comes forward with a single test and, let's say, a standard routine test, and another patient comes forward and has 2 of those, there's going to be a different value to the requisition that has nothing to do with price. So the reason that people have, and we have shared requisitions, is there is a margin implication to some extent because the front end and the back end is somewhat of a fixed cost per patient engagement or requisition. So specimen acquisition and billing, you say, the more tests you can get on a requisition, the more efficient you can be. But again, that's on the cost side, not the price side. However, with PLS, as we've explained, the specimen acquisition is incredibly efficient. We don't do the draws. And from a logistics perspective, we're picking up dozens and dozens of tests at a single point in time instead of a handful as we want to do at office physician park. So the logistics is very efficient. We don't incur the draw cost. And then the billing is incredibly efficient because there's no third-party billing, there's no patient responsibility; it's a single bill for a large volume to a client. So I just want to make sure we continue to do what we need to do, that people are clear that the mix calculation is a calculation and it's not price. We actually call out price very specifically so you understand apples-and-apples if there are any headwinds, and we're actually getting paid less per test."

I just hope -- and I guess, on the 2 fronts, on volume and price. First, on the volume side. Just hoping maybe you could give a little bit of sense of what it maybe contributed, specifically HealthONE and Barnabas, to volume growth this quarter. And maybe help us, is it in the run rate at this point? Is there some sort of ramp we should consider and sort of the fourth quarter and in 2017? Any help there? And then just on the pricing side, as you just explained, I guess, what I'm still grappling with is just understanding. So on a test-by-test basis, is the price the same? Or is it lower in PLS, right? Because I would think you'd have more tests per requisition on sort of a hospital test than you would in sort of a normal business. So I guess I'm just trying to reconcile the absolute dollar per test and if that's lower because of a willingness to give up on that because of the benefits on the cost side that you explained."

Let me try to address them all. First off, Barnabas is pretty much largely implemented. We may expand that relationship beyond the current set of hospitals, but at this point, the initial phase of Barnabas is in a run rate. And HCA is the relationship that we said is ramping up. We mentioned about half of the volume growth in the quarter was attributable to PLS, and we don't call out specific relationships, so we're not going to share Barnabas per se or HCA, but we are sharing what PLS is contributing in total. And then contrary to what you may have thought, the test per req for PLS actually tend to be fewer, not greater. When you imagine someone going in for their annual physical, which is quite a bit of our volume, obviously, some of it is acute conditions that people go into their primary care physician for, but you're doing a battery of tests in your annual physical much more than you might for an acute situation going in as an inpatient or an outpatient at a hospital. So there's actually fewer tests. And then finally, on price, it is priced differently because it's not the commercial rates that we have for the core business and for negotiated direct rate with the hospital where we price it in a way that we can save them money and we can make a margin ourselves. So it is different pricing but not necessarily lower or higher because we have pricing relationships all over the board for any given test, depending on the situation. So it gets a little bit complicated. But in general, fewer tests per req, we have definitely future momentum we expect from our PLS in terms of its volume contribution, definitely from HCA. And so you should expect more of our growth coming from PLS certainly in the immediate future."

So first of all, what we've committed is a continued march of making our business better. And when we say better, we want to improve our quality, service and at the same time making it more efficient. And our goal, as you know for that, is what we call our Invigorate program, which we have committed to an improvement of $1.3 billion by the end of 2017. And that's run rate savings that you recall that versus a benchmark of 2011. And as you know, we've been on a great march of showing progress on that. And what we have shown with this relationship is we're far from done. We have a lot more opportunities to improve this business, and we think this relationship with Optum, again, underscores our commitment to continue to make bold changes in this business to become better, okay. And so I keep on saying better because it's both quality and cost. So this relationship with Optum will allow us a couple of things. One is we're going to become more efficient. So how do we become more efficient? One is that by working together with them, our billing operation, which is part of our expense structure, our SG&A cost will become more efficient over time. And we do have commitments around improving that together going forward. That is all part of our commitment for Invigorate. So it allows us to achieve our goal, and also, it extends beyond 2017, obviously, since this is a 10-year relationship. Second is, as I said in my introductory remarks, part of the opportunities we have is to provide better transparency to patients, better transparency to patients as far as what prices are and also what is covered and so they can pay us more often and more quickly. And we believe by providing that, with the help of Optum, will serve both bad debt, our denial rate and just generally our cash flow. So that is part of the relationship as well. We don't disclose the specifics of the agreement. You wouldn't expect that we would. But it's part and parcel of what we -- part of what we believe we need to continue to do to continue to drive the progress in this business. The last part of your question is, how does this affect our relationship with UnitedHealth? What I said when we announced this relationship, and I know UnitedHealth will say the same, is it can't hurt. And again, that builds on our existing relationship. We currently do a lot of work for United already. This is a substantial piece of building on that. They are very committed to it. It's a big opportunity for them. It provides visibility of us to them in a much broader, more significant way than ever. We're obviously going to use this to build on that relationship in wellness. I talked about earlier what we could do around their health care businesses that they're building with OptumCare. We believe we can do more that help them with their analytics services. So there's a lot more that we can do with them and will do with them as we go forward because, as you know, they're a big player in health care, and we need to work with all the big players in health care. So we're encouraged about what we're doing so far. We're off to a good start. As we said, we're going to move the employees over in mid-November, and we'll start to see savings from this next year. So Mark, anything you'd like to add to that?"

So there are a number of initiatives we had already planned to work on that we think are going to improve bad debt and reduce denials. It was part of our Invigorate program. And what's really generating the incremental value here is that Optum is going to bring incremental activities and supplement what we're doing to get us to even a better place we could have gotten on our own or certainly faster than we could have gotten on our own. So it's not as if we're just throwing it over the wall and having Optum pick up what we have been working on, what we had planned to do. We're actually going to continue to do that. A lot of that's involving our IT organization, our commercial organization, et cetera. And we're going to partner with Optum to make that even better."

We have talked about in the past of actually providing that data to a variety of third parties, including the Center for Disease Control. We've talked about them using that to understand how they can manage or monitor the performance of what's happening with hepatitis C, by way of an example. We also have sold that data to pharma companies. We're building on that relationship. We've talked about how we're trying to bring to the market and possibly with our collaboration with Quintiles now that Quintiles has merged with IMS. We continue to have a dialogue of how we could use that data to help with their recruitment of patients for clinical trials. And that's something that we'll talk about once again as we get into our Investor Day in November. Because there's a lot of opportunities for it, it takes longer to get some traction with it, but the prospects are good. And specifically with Optum, as you know, Optum has a broad perspective on the market, and they're helping many integrated delivery systems. One of the products we do provide today for integrated delivery systems is around population health and how they can use this data to help manage that population metric managing and how do we try to identify those patients that are costing the risk taker the most amount each year and by looking at performance versus laboratory results, what we could do about that, to help with those gaps in care, if you will, that they have.

But typically, what we said is an outreach purchase, it takes 12 to 18 months to get to its going rate on profitability when we can get all the synergies achieved, and the outreach businesses are typically at our corporate margin percentage. So we usually get some margin dollars pretty quickly on those outreach, but get to our going percentage and ratio profitability, it takes 12 to 18 months. For PLS, it's somewhat similar to an outreach in that there's a transition period of time. A lot of the savings is driven around moving the test menu partially off the hospital site to ours. That doesn't happen the first day. The second piece is really the procurement savings. So it's either changing out the platform or burning through their reagents, which typically are higher cost than ours. It takes a little while before we get to that going profitability. But I'd say the same thing, probably a little closer to 12 than the 18, but we get to the going rate of profitability for PLS within the first year to 1.5 years. Those margins are going to be lower than the corporate average slightly. But as I said before, still an excellent return on invested capital, and they're still double-digit margins."

So the things that are going to contribute to growing earnings faster than our revenue are unchanged. So it's really going to be as we return to growth that has a high drop-through, and then we have the Invigorate program, which certainly is large enough in this period of time to offset price and our cost pay-fors, which is our annual merit inflation and things like that and still have enough to expand margin. As you look at some of the PLS relationships that we've talked about, those have really started up this year. And as I mentioned earlier to the question that how long does it to take PLS to get up and going on its profitability, it generally is 12 to 18 months. So you would expect those deals to be contributing more to the bottom line and helping to expand our margin more than they did this year. So it's really -- gets down to the fundamentals, which is the growth and the high drop-through we get there, our Invigorate program, which continues to drive efficiency, and then all of those things more are on an annual or a CAGR basis as opposed to any given quarter.

As we've shared, we walk away from more deals than we execute. It's not as if it's not an interest. It's not as if we're not investing a lot of time in evaluating assets and potential outreach deals, but we do have a lot of rigor around our financial metrics. And we don't execute a deal if we don't see a path towards value creation importantly. So really, it comes down to our capital allocation strategy, which is, once you get beyond the 50% that we guarantee to our -- of our free cash flow to our shareholders, it comes mostly through the dividend but also through some share repurchases, then the decision is what's the best value-creation strategy. And we have to feel very comfortable that we're going to create more value through M&A than we will through share repurchases. And therefore, it's really situational. So it's not a change in strategy. It's not a change in appetite. And certainly, there's been a number of assets we've been evaluating, and there's a lot of things we're looking at. And we are still having success with 1% growth from M&A and within the range. And really, nothing has changed other than we're at the low end of the 1% to 2%."

The field of precision medicine or personalized health care is just -- is very new, and it",472,"Yes. Thanks, Bill, for the question. Well, first of all, as I said, we're excited about the opportunity, and it's an embryonic field. It's building. It's evolving. The field of precision medicine or personalized health care is just -- is very new, and it continues to provide opportunities, but also, it takes time to develop. So we believe, once again, that we, in this field, need to work together with others. Two years ago, we announced a relationship with Memorial Sloan Kettering. We've brought a product to the market called OncoVantage. The opportunity we're going after, Bill, is to get to those community oncologists, which, as I said in my remarks, about 70% of cancer care is there. And what we realized is that Memorial Sloan is very strong, and we have a strong presence in the United States. But by working together with some others, once again, we can even enhance what we've done already. And so the IBM opportunity allows us to use their platform and also their data capabilities in a much broader way. Second is, as you know, IBM is building out their go-to-market plans for IBM Watson in general, IBM Watson Health and IBM Watson Genomics. And we're hopeful that, that sales force, coupled with our sales force, will drive some additional demand as people become more aware of this. And the other part of this, Bill, is we believe there's an opportunity for patients to become more aware of what they should gain access to in assessing what they need to do with their cancer care. And IBM is a very powerful marketing machine, and we're hopeful that their work and their visibility around cognitive computing and particularly in health care will help us with this effort. Now as far as future products, we have the existing products today. We're offering that. There is plans for us to expand that capability with a number of actionable genes and then also an expanded panel, which will touch close to 400 genes that we'll look at. Yes, we do believe that this will help us in terms of companion diagnostics with those cancer drugs to rule and rule out patients they can affect and also making sure that we can support in the right way, connecting patients to the right clinical trials through their oncologist with this information. So this is works in progress. A lot will be introduced in time. And it is, I think, a good example of the evolving nature of this whole effort across the world. But we're lining up with some of the best, Memorial Sloan Kettering, IBM, we talked about the Broad Institute, and obviously the relationship we have with MIT and Harvard. So we have a good team working on this, and we feel very, very encouraged about the prospects here."

They have 6 inpatient laboratories that we will manage for them. When we do this, we make them more efficient. If you understand how they work, and I would argue a lot of hospital systems work or for-profit corporations, they're going to see how it goes, and we expect to deliver. And so we're hopeful when we deliver that we can then expand that discussion to say, ""Can we help you in some other areas?"" But the first piece of business right now is to do what we said we're going to do in Denver and do that well. And then we'll grow the account as you grow any account going forward. I would also say that this discussion around hospital interest in what we're doing is building. What we find is that the C suite of integrated delivery systems and hospital CEOs and CFOs are quite interested in anything anyone can do to make them more efficient. I personally get engaged in this in a very active way, and I can tell you that when we go in and have a conversation with a CEO and a CFO and share with them that we can save them 15% to 20% of their hospital inpatient laboratory costs, our batting average, if you will, of getting to the next conversation to start sharing some data is quite good. Very few times do they say, ""We're not interested."" Most times they say, ""Interesting. We should take a look at this, and we understand how you can help us. And let's see if the numbers work."" When we go in there, we also talk about their lab strategy. And usually, when we have a discussion around their inpatient laboratory costs, we then have a conversation around their reference testing, their most advanced testing that we provide to about 15% of hospitals. We talk about us being able to provide more of that for them. And then the third leg of the stool is they then start to question, if they're in an outreach business, essentially competing with us, do they want to remain in that business. And the best end state for us is to become their lab partner, where it's Quest inside. So we do all 3. We're helping them with their inpatient labs, making them more efficient. We're providing the most advanced testing for their hospital operations. And then third is we're their laboratory for their nonhospital portion of the care they're providing within their geographic area. And we have a number of examples of that, and then probably some of the best examples is where we've actually formed joint ventures. And we have a number of outstanding joint ventures, the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. Probably the most recent large one is University of Massachusetts. We have a joint venture up in Massachusetts around that. And there's others, too, that we've built. So I would argue that this is a growing trend. It's a trend that we're ahead on. And it takes a while to build a services business. We've built the capabilities. We're now executing, and now we're starting to see the results of our growth."

And once again, we'll share the growth from that business in due course as we announce our results. As far as pricing, it's already in that 50 basis points headwind, if you will. We don't share specifics on what's happening with commercial contracts or what's happening for test. But it's implied in the 50 basis points.
