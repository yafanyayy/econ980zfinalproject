Well, first, welcome, everyone. We're all pleased that you could join us here today. As you've all been expecting today's presentation goes well beyond our full year results. Anglo American has been a compan",2481,"Can everyone hear me at the back? Thanks, guys. Well, first, welcome, everyone. We're all pleased that you could join us here today. As you've all been expecting today's presentation goes well beyond our full year results. Anglo American has been a company that has been in constant evolution for almost 100 years, and today, we will outline the next phase in that evolution. We are all very excited by what we see as an opportunity to reset and build our company off and reinvigorated and unique asset foundation. We have the resources, we have the people and we certainly have the plan to create the new Anglo American. 
So let's get straight down to business. Today, we've announced the next step in the restructuring that we've been working on over the last 2.5 years, the core portfolio. We are presenting our investors a very unique investment proposition, great assets with mid- to late-cycle buys. First up, the quality of our assets in diamonds, platinum and copper provide the foundation for our core portfolio of commodities. Our leadership position in diamonds through De Beers, our platinum assets in South Africa and our copper assets in Chile provide a quality core resources and assets that can deliver robust cash flow and returns even through the current and below the current price we're currently experiencing in the industry. Second, we're advising doubt we will be cash flow positive in 2016 after identifying $1.9 billion worth of business improvements, incorporating productivity growth and cost and capital reductions. These improvements include the $1.1 billion improvements identified in December. Along with an additional $800 million worth of opportunities, we have now moved into the planned and deliverable category. A number of the points in our presentation in December, Tony picked up, we've actually moved into the deliverable category. We have also made further reductions in capital from the December conversations. We are forecasting group EBITDA of $4.8 billion with cash and EBITDA numbers calculating using the current spot commodity and FX rates. A number of these opportunities are already in play. 
Third, we have increased our target asset disposal program to deliver $3 billion to $4 billion worth of proceeds in 2016. This target is in addition to the $2 billion delivered in 2015. Our confidence in delivering on this target rests with our review of the quality of the assets we are offering for consideration and based on the early interest we've received since our December investment day and in some cases before then. Finally, with the combination of improved annual cash flow and asset sales, we expect our net debt to be less than $10 billion by year-end. Consistent with our intention to rebuild investment-grade credentials, we are targeting a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of less than 2.5x through the cycle. In relation to the core portfolio structure, that would be around $6 billion debt at current spot prices. 
In terms of the core business, the acceleration of our move to a well-defined core around De Beers platinum and copper is best reflected in our thinking when you consider the relative earnings contribution of each business. And the size of the bubble reflects the actual size of the business, and that top chart shows revenue versus EBITDA. That is not simply about scale. More importantly, it's about the quality of the earnings, representing a 30% improvement on EBITDA margins on our current portfolio. Or if I take noncore versus core, it's actually a 40% improvement on the noncore asset mix. The stronger margins are driven by the relative quality of those assets, which will support positive cash flow generation returns well below current spot prices. Our unique market exposure is relatively in favor in a world where consumption is being driven by a growing middle class, as China balances its economy and India continues on its consumer-based demand growth. Of course, we then have to add to U.S., still the world's largest economy. On simplification, we are implementing a much leaner corporate and regional structure to support a very different asset configuration. We're designing for 16 assets compared to our original 65 assets, and in fact, with more than 70 if I take Pebble and -- and other assets into account. The restructuring has been more significant than even we've been reporting, with the center having a much clearer mandate around a few core functional areas. Working on those areas that we think we've let slip over the years and that we're rapidly rebuilding that you'll see in the 2015 results. 
At the same time, we're retiring the critical mass advantage through a diversified manner, allowing us to lead and drive performance from a package of large-scale, low-cost and long-life mining assets. 
In terms of reduced complexity, in late 2013, we started with more than 65 assets as I said. Today, we're down more than 30% to 45 assets, and we have well advanced our processes on another 10 assets. So the move to 16 assets represents an acceleration and deepening of our portfolio restructuring. Our new portfolio is dominated by current world-class or we call them Priority 1 assets, including Jwaneng, Orapa, Venetia, Mogalakwena, Los Bronces and Collahuasi. We also have high-quality assets in projects with Priority 1 potential in the Kayaveko, Amandelbult in the long-term and Sakati in Finland. Our interest in Priority 2 assets in these commodities reflects our focus on maintaining commodity leadership positions that provide leverage or opportunities to enhance our value proposition in these markets, and De Beers is a classic case in point. I won't go through that I think most people probably understand that point. When compared with our stronger operating and capital disciplines that we've introduced in the last 3 years, we believe the cash flow and returns are sustainable and certainly provide a very strong base for us to build and rebuild a great company. 
In terms of the core business profile and people, our overhead and support structures are being reshaped and downsized to fit the new organization. We've actually completed about a 30% downscale of overheads in indirect in certain areas, but obviously, it will go a lot further as we redefine and reshape the portfolio from where we are today. The total headcount will be reduced from 128,000 people today to around 50,000 people. Now to be clear, for those reporting these changes in the public domain, 68,000 people will stay with the assets being sold. Our internal restructuring and efficiency work will reduce the numbers in the stand-alone core by another 10,000. Consistent with our efficiency work, central and global support cost will fall by more than 50%. I think it's important to make those points. I don't want people reporting that we have 78,000 jobs being lost. And in jurisdictions like south Africa, that is an important conversation. The reason we've been able to restructure and we haven't hit the headlines in the last 2.5 years is we do care. We work with our stakeholders, but more importantly, we're working with our employees as we go through the most significant restructure this organization has seen in 99 years. The remaining functions will be scaled to support the divisions as appropriate. At the same time, we'll continue to upgrade our technical and operating capability because we still got a long way to go and a lot of opportunities to pursue at the operations level. Philippe, Duncan and Chris will lead the 3 ongoing business units. Seamus will manage being focused on managing for cash and disposing the assets, and that doesn't mean taking shortcuts or doing the wrong things. We're making sure that we have assets that are salable and provide for potential buyers a good future. Norman is in -- but still reports to me as CEO of Kumba. Normal will lead the work on positioning Kumba from an appropriate exit from the Anglo American portfolio. As I mentioned before, we are consolidating the De Beers and Anglo offices here in London to reduce costs and to improve efficiencies for both. Finally, we implemented a pay freeze across the globe for management functions back in November. We didn't do it publicly. It was a conversation for the organization, but in answering a couple of questions, I just let you know that it was done some months back. 
Now De Beers. In relation to De Beers, our assets are well positioned with product quality and cost advantages, and the curves that we're actually showing there is our margin curve, which reflects quality and cost to give you a sense of where our assets are positioned in that curve. The market for our products remains robust despite the recent supply inventory ingestion. We've taken the right steps to manage that situation, so we are encouraged with our start to the year. However, we would want to see those trends hold for a sustainable period to become more comfortable about where we are. At the asset level, we have large, low-cost and longer-life assets. We also have incremental capacity that can be turned up to meet increasing demand. 
We continue to manage our downstream position and are working to do a lot better on anticipating and driving consumer demand trends. The U.S. remains our most important market, and recent trends have turned modestly positive for Polish prices. In overseas, we have the world's leading industrial technologies business, providing products for use in a wide range of applications and also that's pertaining to diamonds. I wouldn't claim to have the top industrial business in the world but some might think we had. What we have to do is that we have to continue to drive the understanding of the product. When people think diamonds, they need to think De Beers and our premium Forever Mark brand, quite interesting they sell in the Forever Mark brand, which is the premium diamonds, have actually been very strong in the last 3 or 4 months, so that's certainly an encouraging sign for us. Now $100 million investment in key markets through to 2015 was an important catalyst for market support as we all work to unblock the midstream inventory buildup. At this point in time, it looks like it's was money well spent. 
While industry leadership has its advantages, it also has a price that require some courage in tougher times, and we took the tough steps during the course of last year, particularly towards the year-end as we promoted products in Devali in India, in the U.S. in the Thanksgiving, Christmas season, and we will continue to support our products. We will continue to take the long-term view to encourage growth in our products and our brand. 
In platinum, and a lot can be learned from the diamonds industry, and so for us, a lot of education going on between our groups. We continued to improve our operations and moved to the left of the cost curve. We have the Tier 1 asset portfolio in the platinum industry. And for those that have been watching and listening to Chris and the guys talk about the business, being cash flow positive in last year's environment with all of the restructuring that we've done and there's more to be done, was quite an achievement. The operations bit elitist and output them producer with a long life and scalable resource. It is unique and -- it is a unique asset providing us with attractive revenue diversity as well with 50% of its revenues coming from palladium, rhodium, nickel and copper. The assets that we will retain in the core are well positioned on a unit cost curve and also have short- and longer-term improvement potential. We're becoming more active in market development as we seek to promote broad uses for platinum, reflecting its physical versatility as an industrial and industrial, jewelry and investment product. 
In copper, we have a very competitive position in copper. Both Los Bronces and Collahuasi are clear Priority 1 assets that we can continue to develop and improve over the longer term. In Kayaveko, we have another potential Priority 1 asset and our unique, high-grade, high-margin polymetallic project with in Finland. While the market is not ready for either, the positions are material and certainly important assets in our longer-term metal strategy. 
On the industry side, the decline in that curve to your left and I think is a very telling curve in terms of business capacity across the industry. And certainly, where we've seen downside is where we've seen pickups has been in the downside. We think the industry is stretched and certainly gives rise to our belief that the supply fundamentals are actually quite favorable. We're very pleased with our copper position, and we will seek to build that over time, but again, only when the market allows us to ensure that we're making good returns. 
In terms of our core business, and this is where I'll wrap the opening part of the conversation, we are providing a unique exposure for investors. Our core portfolio has a clear bias to consumer goods. As you could see on the right, 78%, when you pull copper parts, quite interesting, where many of those products land, it's a good place to be in the context of the changes as we are seeing in the global markets. Now we didn't have an epiphany back in December and suddenly thought, wouldn't it be great to get into consumer markets. We could see the trends emerging. We're already in those markets with leadership positions. The decision and the push and more aggressive restructuring is that positioning the portfolio to take advantage of those positions and use our position to get our balance sheet in the right shape to make sure that we fully profit and our shareholders and investors fully profit from those positions. In our case, and the more important point to make is the asset foundation that underpins the real strength in our portfolio. While commodity experience some ebb and flow in pricing, what remains key to long-term success is the quality of our assets in volatile markets. We will continue to improve our businesses in relationship to our competitive position. For us, on a long-term basis, that's where the key is, making sure we're managing margins and delivering returns. The commodity in market geographic diversity supports the thesis that we have a good blend of downstream customer exposures. If we put the quality of our assets with this market exposure, which is unique for our industry, it provides investors with some very different investment options. The message is simple: great assets, exciting market exposure differentiated from our peers and a team that is work in progress in sorting the balance sheet. 
And with that, I'll hand across the René, who will help you understand the numbers and what we are doing on the balance sheet. René?"

Our objective is to get net debt level below $6 billion. And over the next 2 slide, I will speak to the levers available to us that we're in the process of putting to achieve this.

And over the next 2 slide, I will speak to the levers available to us that we're in the process of putting to achieve this. 
Mark has described our intention tradition to occur portfolio of assets. We have plan and are in a process of executing against our core program to exist our noncore asset during 2016 and 2017. We have appointed advisers, prepaid the key division information and that our own and we are already engaged with potential buyers for the first 5 asset grouping shown on the slide. The remaining assets are being prepaid for exit, and we expect to be underway during 2016. 
For Kumba, a number of different option will be considered. The potential demerger is an option we'll be also looking at. We recognize that this is a tough market for disposing assets. That said, we are exiting, for example, rhodium and phosphate, nickel. Our long-haul operations in Australia and Syria are all high-quality, low-cost, long-life assets. Our objective for 2016 is to deliver $3 billion to $4 billion of disposal for a number of this production. Running our asset disposal in parallel give us a flexibility to execute on those assets that deliver value and meet our target. In addition, our $15 [ph] billion balance sheet liquidity give us time to achieve value. Overall, our expected proceeds for all the disposal will be greater than $3 billion to $4 billion. 
This slide shows our current expectation for free cash flow for each of our asset in 2016 as spot price and FX. When we presented this slide in December, the negative tale included 19 assets with a negative cash flow of $600 million. This represented a mark-to-market of our preliminary budget at that time, following the sharp drop in commodity prices at end of November. Over the last 2 months, we have finalized our budget and accelerated our cost-reduction and business improvement plans. This chart now reflects a number of action taken on these assets facing then certain impairment as well as identifying operating improvement. As spot commodity and FX rates as of the 10th of February, this has now reduced to 10 negative free cash flow assets with a negative free cash flow of $300 million. We have planned for all these 10 assets. We are aiming to sell 3 assets, including [indiscernible] and we announced the disposal last month. But for the 4 assets are being closed or put under care and maintenance. We expect the ongoing cost of keeping this asset on care and maintenance to be lower over time. 
Work is underway to improve the performance of [indiscernible] and Capcoal by optimizing the mine plant of those operation. And you might have seen the [indiscernible] in Chile concerning a 10% headcount reduction [indiscernible] At $40 a tonne iron ore price, Minas-Rio will be close to breakeven and will continue to improve and its ramp-up. Over time, we would expect the $300 million cash outflow to reduce further to around $100 million, representing mostly care and maintenance cost. 
Over the last few months, we have been working with steady statistical function in the business unit to identify which initiatives we can accelerate and embed in 2016. We have now finalized our plans. At the Investor Day in December, I indicated that marking to market for the sharp fall in commodity prices at end of November would be $1 billion negative free cash flow in 2016. As a result of this additional initiative, we expect that we can deliver further enhancements to EBITDA of $800 million from where we were in December, which when adding further CapEx and working capital addition equates to $1 billion free cash flow improvement. Also, reflecting the rated changes to spot prices and FX in the period means that we now expect to be $400 million free cash flow positive in 2016. 
In December, I also guided the 2016 EBITDA. Under this latest plan, we would now expect to be $4.8 billion EBITDA, split between $2.5 billion for core and $2.3 billion for the noncore asset as defined today. As you can imagine, we stress test our business under a number of scenario. The 10% weaker price scenario somewhat offset by a 5% weakening in the FX, we would expect EBITDA for 2016 to be $4.1 billion. For 2015, we finished of the year at $3.9 billion of net debt, in line with 2014 and below our market guidance between 13 and 13.5. Looking forward, we are guiding a 2016 net debt below $10 billion. This will be achieved through delivering the disposal proceed I have already mentioned between $3 billion and $4 billion in 2016 and positive operating free cash flow we generate will also add to this net debt production. In the medium term, we are targeting a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of below 2.5x, which for our portfolio at the current spot prices means less than $6 billion. We will achieve this through further disposal, and our positive free cash flow, which will increase further in 2017 onwards as CapEx reduces, volume increase, cost improvement continue and recovery continue. We believe this favorable net debt will be consistent with a solid investment-grade credit rating. 
Last night, we have received notification from Moody's that they have downgrade us to Ba3. This is consistent with the view that we expressed the back in December. We understand from Moody's that they are taking a much more pessimistic view across the sector. Nevertheless, as I mentioned back in December, we see minimal operational or financial impact from being subinvestment-grade. We continue to maintain a significant level of liquidity at $15 billion. This includes a $5.4 billion bank facility maturing in 2020 as well as $7 billion of cash on hand. We have minimum bond refinancing over the next 24 months, $1.6 billion in 2016 and $2.6 billion in 2017."

And I'll go through the 2015 operating results reasonably quickly. My primary purpose will be to give you an insight into the numbers so you get a sense of what's working, what needs more work and where we're going and why we're so confident that we can continue to go forward and improve the business by another $1.9 billion over the course of the next 12 months. 
We're a little over 2 years into the major change program and for those that understand the size of these types of ships as you turn them around, I will hope to try and explain where we are in terms of the numbers. So not much to say here. Commodity is under pressure across-the-board. As you would expect, a 24% price decline across your basket talks managing our side in terms what we could control. The fact that we delivered better than our original forecast, remember, our original net debt forecast was $13.5 billion to $14 billion, at $12.9 billion tells you a very simple story. Cost out, capital down, continuing improvements in the business against a 24% decline in our commodity prices. We'll show you how we hit those numbers in the next few minutes. 
In terms of the financial highlights, all disappointments in this market. While we've not -- well, certainly the prices have knocked the financials, all controllables are better than forecast and providing positive offsets. Cost reductions continue to accelerate with productivity and production increases further helping the result, and I'll pull that upon a bit later. Capital is now dropping as we complete our major spends, and lower capital development sustained business capital as well. Net cash proceeds from disposals of $1.7 billion, that's on the $2.1 billion headline sales, we're above our $1.5 billion target, helping us deliver a better net debt number as a consequence. 
As I always do, I'll start with safety and environment. In our first 2 full years of restructuring, you can see the progress on safety and environmental performance through 2014 and 2015. On safety, we improved it across most measures while we reported 6 fatal incidents, from our point of view, a tragedy in every case. The positive is for the second time in our history, and we did this in 2014, we had a fatal-free quarter in Q4. And with the business at full production, that includes platinum, that's the first time we've ever achieved to that outcome. Just as remarkable, we had 1 fatality in the second half of last year. That performance and last year's performance puts us at the front end on our fertility frequency grade across the industry and puts us ahead of the North American mining industry. For Anglo American, 50% of its people, more than 50% of its people is South African. That's a remarkable achievement. And Anglo American has been at the forefront of safety improvement across South Africa, and we've been a significant contributor to the continuing improvement across the country. 
The story is the same in environment. Our incidents reported are almost 80% lower than they were 3 years ago. Again, attention to detail, doing the planning work and making sure that we keep all of our operations controlled have been absolutely critical in terms of the improvement we've achieved across both metrics. Again, I wanted to say a very special or give a very special congratulations to Chris, Chris and the team in platinum, 2 fatalities in the year and continuing improvements on the environmental side. I think they've done a great job, so we're very pleased with the progress that's being made, but I got to say that right across-the-board, the results have been very, very good. 
On the production side, we reported on an aggregate basis a 5% increase in production despite taking Barro Alto down to sort out our furnaces and the pulling back of production in De Beers to match the market. Barro Alto is now operating above nameplate capacity at a 40% lower cost. We will continue to match production in De Beers with the market. The really pleasing aspect of the 5% increase in production is we delivered the improvements even after downsizing the organization by more than 20% over the 18 months. So for that and taking on those challenges and to deliver a better production number is credible. Yes, there were some additional production from Minas-Rio, but the major changes that we made have certainly been significant, no more so in platinum. When Chris took out 350,000 ounces, we did drop our headcounts by 30%, but the improved efficiencies for the rest of the operation have more than offset those changes. 
In terms of the headcounts and this is why I'm also very careful in talking to given that we're talking about people, and that's not easy. The pace of organization restructuring has continued to accelerate. The 23,000 headcount reduction doesn't include the tarmac disposals, which would have added more than 5,000 roles to the headline numbers. We are forecasting another reduction this year of around 40,000 through the course of the year. And most of those changes have been announced and are in process. So as I said, we did nothing else for the balance of the year and just finished the work, off. we'd be down by at least 40,000. We expect a little bit more in actual, in fact. 
Finally, I want to -- I again wanted to make sure people understand today that we're not announcing anything new from what we said in December. When we talked about going from 135,000 to 50,000, a great bulk of the reductions were actually in assets being disposed, people going with the assets. Now we said 135,000, we actually added 128,000 at year-end, so we've done well across overheads and others in reducing the numbers. As we look forward, of the 78 reduction to come, 68  are actually associated with the disposals of assets. So again, for all of the stakeholders that will be listening to this call, we are in conversation, you haven't heard anything new, we respect all of the communities and the people and the stakeholders that we work with and we're doing things the right way. 
On unit costs, as we improve production and reduce numbers, our productivities improved. In short, since 2012, headline production is up 10%, people numbers are down 20% and costs are tracking more than well below where we were in 2012 in the same time frame. The Q4 numbers, excuse me, I should've put tequila on the drink. In terms of the Q4 numbers, in particular, we are showing an acceleration of improvements that we've seen since mid-2014. If you look at that little number, the top right hand, you see the green chart shows the 120. That's productivity. That's 20% more copper equivalent units per person employed. It was actually up to 127 in the fourth quarter. That's the performance we take in 2016 and while we're confident that we can deliver on the improvements that we flagged for 2016. As you can also see, in copper equivalent terms, and we kept of the copper numbers constant, so it's apples for apples, we're showing a 27% reduction in our copper equivalent costs. These improvements have been delivered without material contribution from new projects. Yes, Minas-Rio makes a small contribution but certainly not at the capital level other groups are actually reporting their cost reductions based on. And it's with this performance improvement that we head into 2016, so we are confident we can continue to build on the foundations that we've built in changing the organization. We expect the performance trends to increase as we build the operating model and the skills have developed through the organization. 
On projects, not much to be said the other than, in 2013, we inherited a number of major projects, a lot of questions about capital deliverability and a whole range of other points make. Today, I can report that we've cut $1 billion out of those major spends based on the forecast that we put forward before I started. Minas-Rio has been a big part of that reduction. In fact, we've announced a little bit more of a reduction. FX has helped us, to be quite frank, although much of it is actually hit, so we didn't get as much of a benefit as we would've liked. But certainly, we're coming under the numbers. In terms of 2015, our top line spends were down $2 billion, a 33% reduction. And you'll see another 25% reduction as we go into 2016 and continuing reductions beyond because we haven't committed to major new projects and we've improved our stay in business and my development productivities depending on the operation by somewhere between 20% and 25% and that's part of the cost improvements that we've delivered across the business. 
Finally, in terms of the EBIT improvement in 2015 and beyond, we continue to build on our business improvements with another $1.9 billion forecast for the year, that is in 2016. In 2015, we delivered $1.3 billion in improvements, which were partly offset by the pullback in demand in the diamond market. We expect to accelerate our performance improvement in 2016 to the tune of $1.9 billion as we described. The figure includes $1.1 billion we identified in December as well as other programs that Tony touched on and that the operating leaders have been working on through the course of the last 4 or 5 months because we didn't just have a whole range of new ideas that we opt into the plan, this has been a series of works that have come through and being firmed up. Particularly, as we've rolled out the number of other operating models across the operation, we're seeing real significant takeup in terms of the operating approach. 
In getting ourselves to cash-positive territory, you must remember that we are still funding $1.3 billion in expansion capital in 2016 to finish the commitments that were made prior to mid-2013. So it's $400 million plus to $1.3 billion that we're funding in those expansion projects. In 2017, we see a material drop in the expansion capital, and so our free cash flow generation improved significantly both as a consequence of that and an additional $1 billion we see in operating improvements that we can make across the portfolio. 
So with that, I'll let René pick up the numbers and then I'll do a very quick wrap."

We'll, it's a reasonable question. You're going to get a direct answer. 60% reduction in safety, 70% reduction in environmental incidents, 27% reduction in unit operating costs, 27% improvement in productivity, capital down $1 billion and 30% across general spends, 30% of the portfolio gone. And the board and myself had a good discussion about the next steps. That's in about 2.5 years. Based on delivery thus far, we believe we'll deliver what we promised because we've delivered what we promised to this date. Turning one of these big ships around is an exercise, so we'll let the numbers do the talking. In terms of whether it's the right portfolio, the fact that we delivered those improvements across the business is a function of the portfolio and the ability to share that information across the group. So to lead safety, statistics, productivity improvements and cost reductions across the group is a function of what we've done inside the business and a function of being able to share that across the portfolio. It's something we've not done well in the past. So we're at one. It's a commitment. But from our point of view, judge us on the numbers going forward. Yes?"

But certainly, the first site was encouraging, well above what wv budgeted for the full year. So that's the encouraging piece. On copper, I think you're absolutely right. Duncan and the guys know what they have did you. You actually made a very important observation and you may not know how important the observation is, it's about water and making sure we can take full use or make full use of that capacity. Later this year, Tony will be taking us up the learning curve on what we're doing on great engineering and some other projects to improve the performance of both Los Bronces and Collahuasi. Now Los Bronces has dropped its unit operating cost per tonne down to about 20%. Collahuasi is a bit behind that. It hasn't got the operating model.

I heard someone quoted the other day talking about being successful in business, and they made 2 points: best assets, run them well. Well, I think that's only 2/3 of the story. The most important part of the story is capital discipline. This industry has destroyed value time and time again because we spend money on stupid things. Today, we've not added one project to our portfolio, and in this market, we won't because we're going to hold our capital discipline because every one of us comes to work trying to figure out how we get to 15%. Nothing has changed. The discipline has to be there, and I'm talking discipline to the group, you don't get there.

Now for people, just make sure we're clear, indirect means anyone that's not actually physically touching a product. From the mine, that includes people at the mine through to corporate office, like René and I and Tony and overheads. That's around 7% to 10% for the mining industry. In fact, the more mechanized the asset, the higher that ratio goes because you've got less people on the ground floor. Now our lowest ratio, believe it or not, is platinum where we've still got probably more on our overhead and Chris is working that down. So at the moment, we have the ratio, as you've seen, of 10%. We believe we can get that down further, but we have to automate a number of processes like EDP, ERP structures and do a whole range of things that really. So yes, we can improve it, but there's a big change we can make in the current structures. We've already cut between London and -- around 30% of the numbers. More are happening as we speak. We'll consolidate the 2 London offices into 1 early next year. And so we're going to continue on that search to get the numbers right, but we've made significant changes.

We're all pleased that you could join us here today. As you've all been expecting, today's presentation goes well beyond our full year results. Anglo American has been a company that has been in constant evolution for almos",2485,"Well, first, welcome, everyone. We're all pleased that you could join us here today. As you've all been expecting, today's presentation goes well beyond our full year results. Anglo American has been a company that has been in constant evolution for almost 100 years, and today, we will outline the next phase in that evolution. We're all very excited by what we see as an opportunity to reset and build our company off a reinvigorated and unique asset foundation. We have the resources, we have the people and we certainly have the plan to create the new Anglo American. 
So let's get straight down to business. Today, we've announced the next step in the restructuring that we've been working on over the last 2.5 years, the core portfolio. We are presenting our investors a very unique investment proposition: great assets with mid to late-cycle buys. First up, the quality of our assets in diamonds, platinum and copper provide the foundation for our core portfolio of commodities. Our leadership position in diamonds through De Beers, our platinum assets in South Africa and our copper assets in Chile provide a quality core of resources and assets that can deliver robust cash flow and returns, even through the current and below the current price knock which we're currently experiencing in the industry. 
Second, we're advising that we will be cash flow positive in 2016 after identifying $1.9 billion worth of business improvements, incorporating productivity growth and cost and capital reductions. These improvements include the $1.1 billion improvements identified in December. Along with an additional $800 million worth of opportunities, we have now moved into the planned and deliverable category. A number of the points in our presentation in December Tony picked up, we've actually moved into the deliverable category. We have also made further reductions in capital from the December conversations. We are forecasting group EBITDA of $4.8 billion, with cash and EBITDA numbers calculating using the current spot commodity and FX rates. A number of these opportunities are already in play. 
Third, we have increased our target asset disposal program to deliver $3 billion to $4 billion worth of proceeds in 2016. This target is in addition to the $2 billion delivered in 2015. Our confidence in delivering on this target rests with our view of the quality of the assets we are offering for consideration and based on the early interest we've received since our December Investment Day, and in some cases before then. Finally, with the combination of improved annual cash flow and asset sales, we expect our net debt to be less than $10 billion by year-end. Consistent with our intention to rebuild investment-grade credentials, we are targeting a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of less than 2.5x through the cycle. In relation to the core portfolio structure, that would be around $6 billion debt at current spot prices. 
In terms of the core business, the acceleration of our move to a well-defined core around De Beers platinum and copper is best reflected in our thinking when you consider the relative earnings contribution of each business. And the size of the bubble reflects the actual size of the business, and that top chart shows revenue versus EBITDA. That is not simply about scale. More importantly, it's about the quality of the earnings, representing a 30% improvement on EBITDA margins on our current portfolio. Or if I take noncore versus core, it's actually a 40% improvement on the noncore asset mix. The stronger margins are driven by the relative quality of those assets, which will support positive cash flow generation and returns well below current spot prices. Our unique market exposure is relatively favored in a world where consumption is being driven by a growing middle class, as China rebalances its economy and India continues on its consumer-based demand growth. Of course, we then have to add the U.S., still the world's largest economy. On simplification, we are implementing a much leaner corporate and regional structure to support a very different asset configuration. We're designing for 16 assets compared to our original 65 assets. And in fact, it was more than 70 if I take Pilbara and Michiquillay and other assets into account. The restructuring has been more significant than even we've been reporting, with the center having a much clearer mandate around a few core functional areas. Working on those areas that we think we've let slip over the years and that we're rapidly rebuilding, that you'll see in the 2015 results. 
At the same time, we'll return to critical mass advantage through a diversified manner, allowing us to lead and drive performance from a package of large-scale, low-cost and long-life mining assets. 
In terms of reduced complexity, in late 2013, we started with more than 65 assets, as I said. Today, we're down more than 30% to 45 assets, and we have well advanced our processes on another 10 assets. So the move to 16 assets represents an acceleration and deepening of our portfolio restructuring. Our new portfolio is dominated by current world-class, or we call them, Priority 1 assets, including Jwaneng, Orapa, Venetia, Mogalakwena, Los Bronces and Collahuasi. We also have high-quality assets in projects with Priority 1 potential in Quellaveco, Amandelbult in the longer term and Sakatti in Finland. Our interest in Priority 2 assets in these commodities reflects our focus on maintaining commodity leadership positions that provide leverage or opportunities to enhance our value proposition in these markets, and De Beers is a classic case in point. I won't go through that I think most people probably understand that point. When compared with our stronger operating and capital disciplines that we've introduced in the last 3 years, we believe the cash flow and returns are sustainable and certainly provide a very strong base for us to build and rebuild a great company. 
In terms of the core business profile and people, our overhead and support structures are being reshaped and downsized to fit the new organization. We've actually completed about a 30% downscale of overheads and indirects in certain areas but obviously, it will go a lot further as we redefine and reshape the portfolio from where we are today. The total headcount will be reduced from 128,000 people today to around 50,000 people. Now to be clear, for those reporting these changes in the public domain, 68,000 people will stay with the assets being sold. Our internal restructuring and efficiency work will reduce the numbers in the stand-alone core by another 10,000. Consistent with our efficiency work, central and global support cost will fall by more than 50%. I think it's important to make those points. I don't want people reporting that we have 78,000 jobs being lost. And in jurisdictions like South Africa, that is an important conversation. The reason we've been able to restructure and we haven't hit the headlines in the last 2.5 years is we do care. We work with our stakeholders but, more importantly, we're working with our employees as we go through the most significant restructure this organization has seen in 99 years. The remaining functions will be scaled to support the divisions as appropriate. At the same time, we'll continue to upgrade our technical and operating capability because we've still got a long way to go and a lot of opportunities to pursue at the operations level. Philippe, Duncan and Chris will lead the 3 ongoing business units. Seamus will manage bulks, being focused on managing for cash and disposing the assets. And that doesn't mean taking shortcuts or doing the wrong things. We're making sure that we have assets that are saleable and provide for potential buyers a good future. Norman isn't shown here, but still reports to me as CEO of Kumba. Norman will lead the work on positioning Kumba for an appropriate exit from the Anglo American portfolio. As I mentioned before, we are consolidating the De Beers and Anglo offices here in London to reduce costs and to improve efficiencies for both. 
Finally, we implemented a pay freeze across the globe for management functions back in November. We didn't do it publicly. It was a conversation for the organization, but in answering a couple of questions, just to let you know that it was done some months back. 
Now De Beers. In relation to De Beers, our assets are well positioned with product quality and cost advantages, and the curves that we're actually showing there is our margin curve which reflects quality and cost to give you a sense of where our assets are positioned in that curve. The market for our products remains robust despite the recent supply inventory indigestion. We have taken the right steps to manage that situation, and so we are encouraged with our start to the year. However, we would want to see those trends hold for a sustainable period to become more comfortable about where we are. 
At the asset level, we have large, low-cost and long-life assets. We also have incremental capacity that can be turned up to meet increasing demand. 
We continue to manage our downstream position and are working to do a lot better on anticipating and driving consumer demand trends. The U.S. remains our most important market, and recent trends have turned modestly positive for polished prices. 
In Element 6, we have the world's leading industrial technologies business, providing products for use in a wide range of applications, and also that's pertaining to diamonds. I wouldn't claim to have the top industrial business in the world, but some might think we had. What we have to do is we have to continue to drive the understanding of the product. When people think diamonds, they need to think De Beers and our premium Forevermark brand. Quite interestingly, our sales in the Forevermark brand, which are the premium diamonds, have actually been very strong in the last 3 or 4 months. So that's certainly an encouraging sign for us. Our $100 million investment in key markets through 2015 was an important catalyst for market support as we all worked to unblock the midstream inventory buildup. At this point in time, it looks like it was money well spent. 
While industry leadership has its advantages, it also has a price that requires some courage in tougher times. And we took the tough steps during the course of last year, particularly towards the year-end as we promoted products in Diwali, in India; in the U.S. in the Thanksgiving, Christmas season, and we will continue to support our products. We will continue to take the long-term view to encourage growth in our products and our brand. 
In platinum, and a lot can be learned from the diamonds industry, and so for us, a lot of education going on between our groups. We continued to improve our operations and moved to the left of the cost curve. We have the Tier 1 asset portfolio in the platinum industry. And for those that have been watching and listening to Chris and the guys talk about their business, being cash flow positive in last year's environment, with all of the restructuring that we've done, and there's more to be done, was quite an achievement. The Mogalakwena operation is clearly the standout platinum producer with a long life and scalable resource. It is unique -- it is a unique asset providing us with attractive revenue diversity as well, with 50% of its revenues coming from palladium, rhodium, nickel and copper. The assets that we will retain in the core are well positioned on the unit cost curve and also have short and longer-term improvement potential. We are becoming more active in market development as we seek to promote broader uses for platinum, reflecting its physical versatility as an industrial -- an industrial, jewelry and investment product. 
In copper, we have a very competitive position in copper. Both Los Bronces and Collahuasi are clear Priority 1 assets that we can continue to develop and improve over the longer term. In Quellaveco, we have another potential Priority 1 asset and a unique, high-grade, high-margin polymetallic project with Sakatti in Finland. While the market is not ready for either, the positions are material and certainly important assets in our longer-term metal strategy. 
On the industry side, the declining head grade -- and that curve to your left I think is a very telling curve in terms of business capacity across the industry and certainly, where we've seen downside -- or where we've seen hiccups that's been to the downside. We think the industry is stretched and certainly gives rise to our belief that the supply fundamentals are actually quite favorable. We're very pleased with our copper position, and we will seek to build that over time but, again, only when the market allows us, to ensure that we're making good returns. 
In terms of our core business, and this is where I'll wrap the opening part of the conversation, we are providing a unique exposure for investors. Our core portfolio has a clear bias to consumer goods. As you can see on the right, 78%. When you pull copper apart, it's quite interesting where many of those products land. And it's a good place to be in the context of the changes we are seeing in the global markets. Now we didn't have an epiphany back in December and suddenly thought, ""Wouldn't it be great to get into consumer markets "" We could see the trends emerging. We're already in those markets with leadership positions. The decision and the push and the more aggressive restructuring is about positioning the portfolio to take advantage of those positions and use our positions to get our balance sheet in the right shape to make sure that we fully profit, and our shareholders and investors fully profit from those positions. 
In our case, the more important point to make is the asset foundation that underpins the real strength in our portfolio. While the oil commodity experience some ebb and flow in pricing, what remains key to long-term success is the quality of our assets in volatile markets. We will continue to improve our businesses in relationship to our competitive position. For us, on a long-term basis, that's where the key is: making sure we're managing margins and delivering returns. Our commodity and market geographic diversity supports the thesis that we have a good blend of downstream customer exposures. If we put the quality of our assets with this market exposure, which is unique for our industry, it provides investors with some very different investment options.

Mark has described our",1012,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everybody. Our objective is to get the net debt level below $6 billion. And over the next 2 slide, I will speak to the levers available to us that we're in the process of putting to achieve this. 
Mark has described our intention to transition to a core portfolio of assets. We have plan and are in a process of executing against a comprehensive program to exit our noncore asset during 2016 and 2017. We have appointed advisers, prepared the key divisions' information and data room and we are already engaged with potential buyers for the first 5 asset grouping shown on the slide. The remaining assets are being prepared for exit, and we expect to be under way during 2016. 
For Kumba, a number of different option will be considered. A potential demerger is an option we'll be also looking at. We recognize that this is a tough market for disposing assets. That said, we are exiting, for example, niobium and phosphates, nickel. Our longwall operations in Australia and Syria are all high-quality, low-cost, long-life assets. Our objective for 2016 is to deliver $3 billion to $4 billion of disposal for a number of these transactions. Running our asset disposal in parallel give us the flexibility to execute on those assets that deliver value and meet our target. In addition, our $15 billion balance sheet liquidity give us time to achieve value. Overall, our expected proceeds for all the disposal will be greater than $3 billion to $4 billion. 
This slide shows our current expectation for free cash flow for each of our asset in 2016 at spot prices and FX. When we presented this slide in December, the negative tail included 19 assets with a negative cash flow of $600 million. This represented a mark-to-market of our preliminary budget at that time, following the sharp drop in commodity prices at end of November. Over the last 2 months, we have finalized our budget and accelerated our cost reduction and business improvement plans. This chart now reflects a number of action taken on these assets, placing them -- some on care and maintenance as well as identifying operating improvement. At spot commodity and FX rates as of the 10th of February, this has now reduced to 10 negative free cash flow assets with a negative free cash flow of $300 million. We have planned for all these 10 assets. We are aiming to sell 3 assets, including Callide, and we announced the disposal last month. A further 4 assets are being closed or put under care and maintenance. We will expect the ongoing cost of keeping these asset on care and maintenance to be lower over time. 
Work is under way to improve the performance of El Soldado and Capcoal by optimizing the mine plan of those operation. And you might have seen the announcement in Chile concerning a 10% headcount reduction at Soldado. At $40 a tonne iron ore price, Minas-Rio will be close to breakeven and will continue to improve at its ramp-up. Over time, we would expect the $300 million cash outflow to reduce further to around $100 million, representing mostly care and maintenance cost. 
Over the last few months, we have been working with Tony's technical function and the business unit to identify which initiative we can accelerate and embed in 2016. We have now finalized our plans. At the Investor Day in December, I indicated that marking to market for the sharp fall in commodity prices at end of November would be $1 billion negative free cash flow in 2016. As a result of this additional initiative, we expect that we can deliver further enhancements to EBITDA of $800 million from where we were in December, which when adding further CapEx and working capital addition equates to $1 billion free cash flow improvement. Also, reflecting relative changes to spot prices and FX in the period means that we now expect to be $400 million free cash flow positive in 2016. 
In December, I also guided the 2016 EBITDA. Under this latest plan, we would now expect to be $4.8 billion EBITDA, split between $2.5 billion for core and $2.3 billion for the noncore asset as defined today. 
As you can imagine, we stress test our business under a number of scenario. At 10% weaker price scenario somewhat offset by a 5% weakening in FX, we would expect EBITDA for 2016 to be $4.1 billion. For 2015, we finished the year at $12.9 billion of net debt, in line with 2014 and below our market guidance between $13 billion and $13.5 billion. Looking forward, we are guiding a 2016 net debt below $10 billion. This will be achieved through delivering the disposal proceed I have already mentioned, between $3 billion and $4 billion in 2016; and positive operating free cash flow we generate will also add to this net debt reduction. 
In the medium term, we are targeting a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of below 2.5x, which for our portfolio at the current spot prices means less than $6 billion. We will achieve this through further disposal, and our positive free cash flow, which will increase further in 2017 onwards, as CapEx reduces, volume increase, cost out program continue and De Beers core recovery continue. We believe that this level of net debt will be consistent with a solid investment-grade credit rating. 
Last night, we have received notification from Moody's that they have downgraded us to Ba3. This is consistent with the view that we expressed back in December. We understand from Moody's that they are taking a much more pessimistic view across the sector. Nevertheless, as I mentioned back in December, we see minimal operational or financial impact from being subinvestment-grade. We continue to maintain a significant level of liquidity at $15 billion. This includes a $5.4 billion bank facility maturing in 2020 as well as $7 billion of cash on hand. We have minimal bond refinancing over the next 24 months, $1.6 billion in 2016 and $2.6 billion in 2017."

Ladies and gentlemen, I'll go through the 2015 operating results reasonably quickly. My primary purpose will be to give you an insight into the numbers so you get a sense of what's working, what needs more work and where we're going and why we're so confident that we can continue to go forward and improve the business by another $1.9 billion over the course of the next 12 months. 
We're a little over 2 years into the major change program, and for those that understand the size of these types of ships as you turn them around, I will hope to try and explain where we are in terms of the numbers. 
So not much to say here. Commodity is under pressure across the board. As you would expect, a 24% price decline across our basket took some managing on our side in terms what we could control. The fact that we delivered better than our original forecast -- remember, our original net debt forecast was $13.5 billion to $14 billion, at $12.9 billion tells you a very simple story. Cost out, capital down, continuing improvements in the business against a 24% decline in our commodity prices. We'll show you how we hit those numbers in the next few minutes. 
In terms of the financial highlights, all disappointments in this market. While we've knocked -- well, certainly, the prices have knocked the financials, all controllables are better than forecast and providing positive offsets. Cost reductions continue to accelerate, with productivity and production increases further helping the result. And I'll pull that apart a little bit later. Capital is now dropping as we complete our major spends, and lower capital development and stay-in-business capital as well. Net cash proceeds from disposals of $1.7 billion, that's on the $2.1 billion headline sales, were above our $1.5 billion target, helping us deliver a better net debt number as a consequence. 
As I always do, I'll start with safety and environment. In our first 2 full years of restructuring, you can see the progress on safety and environmental performance through 2014 and 2015. On safety, we improved it across most measures, while we reported 6 fatal incidents, from our point of view, a tragedy in every case. The positive is for the second time in our history, and we did this in 2014, we had a fatal-free quarter in Q4. And with the business at full production, well, that includes platinum, that's the first time we've ever achieved that outcome. Just as remarkable, we had 1 fatality in the second half of last year. That performance and last year's performance puts us at the front end on our fatality frequency grade across the industry and puts us ahead of the North American mining industry. For Anglo American, 50% of its people, or more than 50% of its people is South African. That's a remarkable achievement. And Anglo American has been at the forefront of safety improvement across South Africa, and we've been a significant contributor to the continuing improvement across the country. 
The story is the same in environment. Our incidents reported are almost 80% lower than they were 3 years ago. Again, attention to detail, doing the planning work and making sure that we keep all of our operations controlled have been absolutely critical in terms of the improvement we've achieved across both metrics. Again, I wanted to say a very special -- or give a very special congratulations to Chris Griffith and the team in platinum. Two fatalities in the year and continuing improvements on the environmental side, I think they've done a great job. I'm we're very pleased with the progress that's been made. But I've got to say that right across the board, the results have been very, very good. 
On the production side, we reported, on an aggregate basis, a 5% increase in production despite taking Barro Alto down to sort out the furnaces and the pulling back of production in De Beers to match the market. Barro Alto is now operating above nameplate capacity at a 40% lower cost. We will continue to match production in De Beers with the market. The really pleasing aspect of the 5% increase in production is we delivered the improvements even after downsizing the organization by more than 20% over the 18 months. So for that, and taking on those challenges and to deliver a better production number is credible. Yes, there were some additional production from Minas-Rio, but the major changes that we made have certainly been significant. No more so in platinum where Chris took out 350,000 ounces. We did drop our headcounts by 30%, but the improved efficiencies for the rest of the operation have more than offset those changes. 
In terms of the headcounts, and this is why I'm also very careful in talking to, given that we're talking about people, and that's not easy. The pace of organization restructuring has continued to accelerate. The 23,000 headcount reduction doesn't include the Tarmac disposals, which would have added more than 5,000 roles to the headline numbers. We are forecasting another reduction this year of around 40,000 through the course of the year. Now most of those changes have been announced and are in process. So if I said we did nothing else for the balance of the year and just finished the work off, we'd be down by at least 40,000. We expect a little bit more in actual fact. 
Finally, I want to -- I again want to make sure people understand today that we're not announcing anything new from what we said in December. When we talked about going from 135,000 to 50,000, a great bulk of the reductions were actually in assets being disposed, people going with the assets. Now we said 135,000, we've actually had 128,000 at year-end. So we've done well across overheads and others in reducing the numbers. As we look forward, of the 78,000 reduction to come, 68,000 are actually associated with disposals of assets. So again, for all of the stakeholders that will be listening to this call, we are in conversation, you haven't heard anything new, we respect all the communities and the people and the stakeholders that we work with and we're doing things the right way. 
On unit costs, as we improve production and reduce numbers, our productivities improve. In short, since 2012, headline production is up 10%, people numbers are down 20% and costs are tracking more than well below where we were in 2012 in that same time frame. The Q4 numbers -- excuse me. I should've put tequila in the drink. In terms of the Q4 numbers, in particular, we are showing an acceleration of the improvements that we've seen since mid-2014. If you look at that little number, the top right hand, you see the green chart shows the 120. That's productivity. That's 20% more copper equivalent units per person employed. It was actually up to 127 in the fourth quarter. That's the performance we take into 2016 and why we're confident that we can deliver on the improvements that we flagged for 2016. As you can also see, in copper equivalent terms, and we've kept the copper numbers constant, so it's apples-for-apples, we're showing a 27% reduction in our copper equivalent costs. These improvements have been delivered without material contributions from new projects. Yes, Minas-Rio makes a small contribution, but certainly not at the capital level other groups are actually reporting their cost reductions based on. It is with this performance improvement that we head into 2016, so we are confident we can continue to build on the foundations that we've built in changing the organization. We expect the performance trends to increase as we build the operating model and the skills are developed through the organization. 
On projects, not much to be said, other than in 2013, we inherited a number of major projects. A lot of questions about capital, deliverability and a whole range of other points were made. Today, I can report that we've cut $1 billion out of those major spends based on the forecast that were put forward before I started. Minas-Rio has been a big part of that reduction. In fact, we've announced a little bit more of a reduction. FX has helped us, to be quite frank. Although much of it is actually hit, so we didn't get as much of a benefit as we would've liked. But certainly, we've come in under the numbers. In terms of 2015, our top line spends were down $2 billion, a 33% reduction. And you'll see another 25% reduction as we go into 2016, and continuing reductions beyond because we haven't committed to major new projects and we've improved our stay-in-business and mine development productivities, depending on the operation, by somewhere between 20% and 25%. And that's part of the cost improvements that we've delivered across the business. 
Finally, in terms of the EBIT improvement in 2015 and beyond, we continue to build on our business improvements with another $1.9 billion forecast for the year, that is, in 2016. In 2015, we delivered $1.3 billion in improvements, which were partly offset by the pullback in demand in the diamond market. We expect to accelerate our performance improvement in 2016 to the tune of $1.9 billion, as we described. The figure includes $1.1 billion we identified in December as well as other programs that Tony touched on and that the operating leaders have been working on through the course of the last 4 or 5 months. Because we didn't just have a whole range of new ideas that we opt into the plan, this has been a series of works that have come through and have been firmed up, particularly as we've rolled out a number of operating models across the operation. We're seeing real significant takeup in terms of the operating approach. 
In getting ourselves to cash-positive territory, you must remember that we are still funding $1.3 billion in expansion capital in 2016 to finish the commitments that were made prior to mid-2013. So it's $400 million, plus the $1.3 billion that we're funding in those expansion projects. In 2017, we see a material drop in the expansion capital, and so our free cash flow generation improved significantly, both as a consequence of that and as an additional $1 billion we see in operating improvements that we can make across the portfolio. 
So with that, I'll let René pick up the numbers and then I'll do a very quick wrap."

De Beers sales volume were lower, reflecting our actions to help support destocking in the midstream.  
Thanks, David. Net debt of $12.9 billion was in line with the guidance I gave back in December, benefiting from net cash received from disposal of $1.7 billion in the year as well as reduction to CapEx, which came in at $4 billion versus, as you saw in Mark's slide, $6 billion on average for the last 3 years. Looking to CapEx in 2016, we are now guiding to be below $3 billion as we continue to see the completion of some key growth projects that Mark mentioned, Minas-Rio, Grosvenor, Gahcho Kué and Venetia. In 2017, we expect further CapEx reduction to $2.5 billion."

We're not in any rush. We want to make sure we do the right thing with our stakeholders given the continuing performance improvement we expect from Kumba with the work that Norman has done with support from Tony and the team. You all have noted that Tony came off the board couple of weeks ago. In our view, the greater bulk of the transformation work has been done. Norman's made a lot of changes operationally. We think they're off to the races. And on the other side of that, Tony has got too much other work that he's got to do across the balance of the portfolio.

We started with a strategy around the diversification, focus on the core assets, pull it into the core, deliver sustainable returns and then work that in terms of the base we create. Yes, we're being harder and going deeper because we've got to get the balance sheet sorted to make sure that we're in the right position to take advantage of the opportunities that come. We've lost 40% of the commodity price. That's life. We're reacting, we're responding, we're doing the right things. We've got the best assets in the industry. If the approach that we're putting forward doesn't work, there is no mining industry because we've got the best assets in those industries. That's first point. We also understand how we can improve and cover our bets. The breadth of the disposal portfolio gives us the option to play different assets against each other in deciding on whether we're going to sell an asset. That's also been very carefully thought through. We don't have to sell all the assets. We've got the liquidity. We're delivering cash from our business. We've got more than 10% room in terms of generating cash. We have a range of options to deal with anything the market throws at us. We will deliver. Just behind, yes."

Our lowest ratio, believe it or not, is platinum where we've still got probably more on our overhead, and Chris is working that down. So at the moment, we have a ratio, as you've seen, of 10%. We believe we can get that down further. But we'd have to automate a number of processes like EDP -- ERP structures into a whole range of things differently.

We're certainly doing pretty well in terms of breakeven price.

We're all pleased that you could join us here today. As you've all been expecting, today's presentation goes well beyond our full year results. Anglo American has been a company that has been in constant evolution for alm",2483,"Well, first, welcome, everyone. We're all pleased that you could join us here today. As you've all been expecting, today's presentation goes well beyond our full year results. 
Anglo American has been a company that has been in constant evolution for almost 100 years. And today, we will outline the next phase in that evolution. We're all very excited by what we see as an opportunity to reset and build our company off a reinvigorated and unique asset foundation. We have the resources, we have the people, and we certainly have the plan to create the new Anglo American. 
So let's get straight down to business. Today, we've announced the next step in the restructuring that we've been working on over the last 2.5 years, the core portfolio. We are presenting our investors a very unique investment proposition, great assets with mid to late-cycle bias. 
First up, the quality of our assets in diamonds, platinum and copper provide the foundation for our core portfolio of commodities. Our leadership position in diamonds through De Beers, our platinum assets in South Africa and our copper assets in Chile provide a quality core of resources and assets that can deliver robust cash flow and returns, even through the current and below the current price cycles we're currently experiencing in the industry. 
Second, we're advising that we will be cash flow positive in 2016, after identifying $1.9 billion worth of business improvements, incorporating productivity growth and cost and capital reductions. These improvements include the $1.1 billion improvements identified in December. Along with an additional $800 million worth of opportunities, we have now moved into the planned and deliverable category. A number of the points in our presentation in December Tony picked up, we've actually moved into the deliverable category. We have also made further reductions in capital from the December conversations. We are forecasting group EBITDA of $4.8 billion, with cash and EBITDA numbers calculating using current spot commodity and FX rates. A number of these opportunities are already in play. 
Third, we have increased our target asset disposal program to deliver $3 billion to $4 billion worth of proceeds in 2016. This target is in addition to the $2 billion delivered in 2015. Our confidence in delivering on this target rests with our view of the quality of the assets we are offering for consideration, and based on the early interest we've received since our December Investment Day, and in some cases before then. 
Finally, with the combination of improved annual cash flow and asset sales, we expect our net debt to be less than $10 billion by year-end. Consistent with our intention to rebuild investment-grade credentials, we are targeting a net debt-EBITDA ratio of less than 2.5x through the cycle. In relation to the core portfolio structure, that would be around $6 billion debt at current spot prices. 
In terms of the core business, the acceleration of our move to a well-defined core around De Beers platinum and copper is best reflected in our thinking, when you consider the relative earnings contribution of each business. And the size of the bubble reflects the actual size of the business, and that top chart shows revenue versus EBITDA. But it's not simply about scale. More importantly, it's about the quality of the earnings, representing a 30% improvement on EBITDA margin on our current portfolio. Or if I take noncore versus core, it's actually a 40% improvement on the noncore asset mix. 
The stronger margins are driven by the relative quality of those assets, which will support positive cash flow generation and returns well below current spot prices. Our unique market exposure is relatively favored in a world where consumption is being driven by a growing middle class, as China rebalances its economy and India continues on its consumer-based demand growth. Of course, we then have to add the U.S., still the world's largest economy. 
On simplification, we are implementing a much leaner corporate and regional structure to support a very different asset configuration. We're designing for 16 assets compared to our original 65 assets. And in fact, it was more than 70 if I take Pebble and Michiquillay and other assets into account. The restructuring has been more significant than even we've been reporting, with the center having a much clearer mandate around a few core functional areas. Working on those areas that we think we've let slip over the years and that we're rapidly rebuilding, that you'll see in the 2015 results. 
At the same time, we'll return [ph] the critical mass advantage through a diversified miner, allowing us to lead and drive performance from a package of large-scale, low-cost and long-life mining assets. 
In terms of reduced complexity, in late 2013, we started with more than 65 assets, as I said. Today, we're down more than 30% to 45 assets, and we have well advanced sale processes on another 10 assets. So the move to 16 assets represents an acceleration and deepening of our portfolio restructuring. Our new portfolio is dominated by current world-class, or we call them, Priority 1 assets, including Jwaneng, Orapa, Venetia, Mogalakwena, Los Bronces and Collahuasi. We also have high-quality assets in projects with Priority 1 potential in Quellaveco, Amandelbult in the longer term and Sakatti in Finland. 
Our interest in Priority 2 assets in these commodities reflects our focus on maintaining commodity leadership positions that provide leverage or opportunities to enhance our value proposition in these markets. And De Beers is a classic case in point. I won't go through that. I think most people probably understand that point. When compared with our stronger operating and capital disciplines that we've introduced in the last 3 years, we believe the cash flow and returns are sustainable. And certainly provide a very strong base for us to build and rebuild a great company. 
In terms of the core business profile and people, our overhead and support structures are being reshaped and downsized to fit the new organization. We've actually completed about a 30% downscale of overheads and indirects in certain areas. But obviously, it will go a lot further as we redefine and reshape the portfolio from where we are today. 
The total headcount will be reduced from 128,000 people today to around 50,000 people. Now to be clear, for those reporting these changes in the public domain, 68,000 people will stay with the assets being sold. Our internal restructuring and efficiency work will reduce the numbers in the stand-alone core by another 10,000. Consistent with our efficiency work, central and global support costs will fall by more than 50%. I think it's important to make those points. I don't want people reporting that we have 78,000 jobs being lost. And in jurisdictions like South Africa, that is an important conversation. 
The reason we've been able to restructure, and we haven't hit the headlines in the last 2.5 years, is we do care. We work with our stakeholders. But, more importantly, we're working with our employees as we go through the most significant restructure this organization has seen in 99 years. 
The remaining functions will be scaled to support the divisions as appropriate. At the same time, we'll continue to upgrade our technical and operating capability, because we've still got a long way to go and a lot of opportunities to pursue at the operations level. Philippe, Duncan and Chris will lead the 3 ongoing business units. Seamus will manage bulks, being focused on managing for cash and disposing the assets. And that doesn't mean taking shortcuts or doing the wrong things. We're making sure that we have assets that are saleable and provide for potential buyers a good future. Norman isn't shown here, but still reports to me as CEO of Kumba. Norman will lead the work on positioning Kumba for an appropriate exit from the Anglo American portfolio. As I mentioned before, we are consolidating the De Beers and Anglo offices here in London to reduce costs and to improve efficiencies for both. 
Finally, we implemented a pay freeze across the globe for management factions back in November. We didn't do it publicly. It was a conversation for the organization. But in answering a couple of questions, just let you know that it was done some months back. 
Now De Beers. In relation to De Beers, our assets are well positioned with product quality and cost advantages. And the curves that we're actually showing there is our margin curve, which reflects quality and cost to give you a sense of where our assets are positioned in that curve. The market for our products remains robust, despite the recent supply inventory indigestion. We have taken the right steps to manage that situation, and so we are encouraged with our start to the year. However, we would want to see those trends hold for a sustainable period to become more comfortable about where we are. 
At the asset level, we have large, low-cost and long-life assets. We also have incremental capacity that can be turned up to meet increasing demand. 
We continue to manage our downstream position and are working to do a lot better on anticipating and driving consumer demand trends. The U.S. remains our most important market. And recent trends have turned modestly positive for polished prices. 
In Element 6, we have the world's leading industrial technologies business, providing products for use in a wide range of applications, and also that's pertaining to diamonds. I wouldn't claim to have the top industrial business in the world, but some may think we had. 
What we have to do is we have to continue to drive the understanding of the product. When people think diamonds, they need to think De Beers and our premium Forevermark brand. Quite interestingly, our sales in the Forevermark brand, which are the premium diamonds, have actually been very strong in the last 3 or 4 months. So that's certainly an encouraging sign for us. Our $100 million investment in key markets through 2015 was an important catalyst for market support, as we all worked to unblock the midstream inventory buildup. At this point in time, it looks like it was money well spent. 
While industry leadership has its advantages, it also has a price that requires some courage in tougher times. And we took the tough steps during the course of last year, particularly towards the year-end as we promoted products in Diwali in India, in the U.S. in the Thanksgiving, Christmas season, and we will continue to support our products. We will continue to take the long-term view to encourage growth in our products and our brand. 
In platinum -- and a lot can be learned from the diamonds industry. And so for us, a lot of education going on between our groups. We continued to improve our operations and moved to the left of the cost curve. We have the Tier 1 asset portfolio in the platinum industry. And for those that have been watching and listening to Chris and the guys talk about their business, being cash flow positive in last year's environment, with all of the restructuring that we've done -- and there's more to be done -- was quite an achievement. The Mogalakwena operation is clearly the standout platinum producer with a long life and scalable resource. It is unique -- it is a unique asset providing us with attractive revenue diversity as well, with 50% of its revenues coming from palladium, rhodium, nickel and copper. The assets that we will retain in the core are well positioned on the unit cost curve and also have short and longer-term improvement potential. We are becoming more active in market development, as we seek to promote broader uses for platinum, reflecting its physical versatility as an industrial, jewelry and investment product. 
In copper, we have a very competitive position in copper. Both Los Bronces and Collahuasi are clear Priority 1 assets that we can continue to develop and improve over the longer term. In Quellaveco, we have another potential Priority 1 asset and a unique, high-grade, high-margin polymetallic project with Sakatti in Finland. While the market is not ready for either, the positions are material and certainly important assets in our longer-term metal strategy. 
On the industry side, the declining head grade -- and that curve to your left I think is a very telling curve in terms of business capacity across the industry and certainly where we've seen downside -- or where we've seen hiccups that's been to the downside. We think the industry is stretched and certainly gives rise to our belief that the supply fundamentals are actually quite favorable. We're very pleased with our copper position, and we will seek to build that over time. But, again, only when the market allows us, to ensure that we're making good returns. 
In terms of our core business -- and this is where I'll wrap the opening part of the conversation -- we are providing a unique exposure for investors. Our core portfolio has a clear bias to consumer goods. As you can see on the right, 78%. When you pull copper apart, it's quite interesting where many of those products land. And it's a good place to be in the context of the changes we are seeing in the global markets. Now we didn't have an epiphany back in December and suddenly thought, ""Wouldn't it be great to get into consumer markets?"" We could see the trends emerging. We're already in those markets with leadership positions. The decision and the push and the more aggressive restructuring is about positioning the portfolio to take advantage of those positions and use our positions to get our balance sheet in the right shape to make sure that we fully profit, and our shareholders and investors fully profit from those positions. 
In our case, the more important point to make is the asset foundation that underpins the real strength in our portfolio. While oil commodities experience some ebb and flow in pricing, what remains key to long-term success is the quality of our assets in volatile markets. We will continue to improve our businesses in relationship to our competitive positions. For us, on a long-term basis, that's where the key is, making sure we're managing margins and delivering returns. 
Our commodity and market geographic diversity supports the thesis that we have a good blend of downstream customer exposures. If we put the quality of our assets with this market exposure, which is unique for our industry, it provides investors with some very different investment options. The message is simple, great assets, exciting market exposure differentiated from our peers, and a team that is a works in progress in sorting the balance sheet. 
And with that, I'll hand across to René, who will help you understand the numbers and what we're doing on the balance sheet. René?"

And over the next few slide, I will speak the levers available to us that we're in the process of putting to achieve this. 
Mark has described our intention to transition to a core portfolio of assets. We have plan and are in a process of executing against a comprehensive program to exit our noncore asset during 2016 and 2017. We have appointed advisers, prepared the key divisions' information and data room [ph]. And we are already engaged with potential buyers for the first 5 asset grouping shown on the slide. The remaining assets are being prepared for exit, and we expect to be under way during 2016. 
For Kumba, a number of different option will be considered. A potential demerger is an option we'll be also looking at. 
We recognize that this is a tough market for disposing assets. That said, we are exiting, for example, niobium and phosphate, nickel. Our longwall operations in Australia and Syria are all high-quality, low-cost, long-life assets. Our objective for 2016 is to deliver $3 billion to $4 billion of disposal for a number of these transaction. Running our asset disposal in parallel give us the flexibility to execute on those assets that deliver value and meet our target. In addition, our $15 billion balance sheet liquidity give us time to achieve value. Overall, our expected proceeds for all the disposal will be greater than $3 billion to $4 billion. 
This slide shows our current expectation for free cash flow for each of our asset in 2016 at spot prices and FX. When we presented this slide in December, the negative tail included 19 assets with a negative cash flow of $600 million. This represented a mark-to-market of our preliminary budget at that time, following the sharp drop in commodity prices at end of November. Over the last 2 months, we have finalized our budget and accelerated our cost reduction and business improvement plans. This chart now reflects a number of action taken on these assets, placing them -- some on care and maintenance, as well as identifying operating improvement. At spot commodity and FX rates as of the 10th of February, this has now reduced to 10 negative free cash flow assets with a negative free cash flow of $300 million. We have planned for all these 10 assets. We are aiming to sell 3 assets, including Callide, and we announced the disposal last month. A further 4 assets are being closed or put under care and maintenance. We will expect the ongoing cost of keeping these asset on care and maintenance to be lower over time. 
Work is under way to improve the performance of El Soldado and Capcoal by optimizing the mine plan of those operation. And you might have seen the announcement in Chile concerning a 10% headcount reduction at Soldado. At $40 a tonne iron ore price, Minas-Rio will be close to breakeven and will continue to improve at its ramp-up. Over time, we would expect the $300 million cash outflow to reduce further to around $100 million, representing mostly care and maintenance cost. 
Over the last few months, we have been working with Tony's technical function and the business unit to identify which initiative we can accelerate and embed in 2016. We have now finalized our plans. 
At the Investor Day in December, I indicated that marking to market for the sharp fall in commodity prices at end of November would be $1 billion negative free cash flow in 2016. As a result of this additional initiative, we expect that we can deliver further enhancements to EBITDA of $800 million from where we were in December. Which when adding further CapEx and working capital addition equates to $1 billion free cash flow improvement. Also, reflecting the relative changes to spot prices and FX in the period means that we now expect to be $400 million free cash flow positive in 2016. 
In December, I also guided a 2016 EBITDA. Under this latest plan, we would now expect to be $4.8 billion EBITDA, split between $2.5 billion for core and $2.3 billion for the noncore asset as defined today. 
As you can imagine, we stress test our business under a number of scenario. A 10% weaker price scenario, somewhat offset by a 5% weakening in FX, we would expect EBITDA for 2016 to be $4.1 billion. 
For 2015, we finished the year at $12.9 billion of net debt, in line with 2014 and below our market guidance between $13 billion and $13.5 billion. Looking forward, we are guiding a 2016 net debt below $10 billion. This will be achieved through delivering the disposal proceed I have already mentioned, between $3 billion and $4 billion in 2016. And positive operating free cash flow we generate will also add to this net debt reduction. 
In the medium term, we are targeting a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of below 2.5x, which for our portfolio at the current spot prices means less than $6 billion. We will achieve this through further disposal. And our positive free cash flow, which will increase further in 2017 onwards, as CapEx reduces, volume increase, cost out program continue, and De Beers core recovery continue. We believe that this level of net debt will be consistent with a solid investment-grade credit rating. 
Last night, we have received notification from Moody's that they have downgraded us to Ba3. This is consistent with the view that we expressed back in December. We understand from Moody's that they are taking a much more pessimistic view across the sector. Nevertheless, as I mentioned back in December, we see minimal operational or financial impact from being sub-investment-grade. We continue to maintain a significant level of liquidity at $15 billion. This includes a $5.4 billion bank facility maturing in 2020 as well as $7 billion of cash on hand. We have minimal bond refinancing over the next 24 months, $1.6 billion in 2016 and $2.6 billion in 2017."

Ladies and gentlemen, I'll go through the 2015 operating results reasonably quickly. My primary purpose will be to give you an insight into the numbers, so you get a sense of what's working, what needs more work, and where we're going, and why we're so confident that we can continue to go forward and improve the business by another $1.9 billion over the course of the next 12 months. 
We're a little over 2 years into the major change program. And for those that understand the size of these types of ships as you turn them around, I will hope to try and explain where we are in terms of the numbers. 
So not much to say here. Commodities under pressure across the board. As you would expect, a 24% price decline across our basket took some managing on our side in terms what we could control. The fact that we've delivered better than our original forecast -- remember, our original net debt forecast was $13.5 billion to $14 billion -- at $12.9 billion tells you a very simple story. Cost out, capital down, continuing improvements in the business against a 24% decline in our commodity prices. We'll show you how we hit those numbers in the next few minutes. 
In terms of the financial highlights, all disappointments in this market. While we've knocked -- well, certainly, the prices have knocked the financials, all controllables are better than forecast and providing positive offsets. Cost reductions continue to accelerate, with productivity and production increases further helping the result. And I'll pull that apart a little bit later. Capital is now dropping, as we complete our major spends, and lower capital development and stay-in-business capital as well. Net cash proceeds from disposals of $1.7 billion, that's on the $2.1 billion headline sales. We're above our $1.5 billion target, helping us deliver a better net debt number as a consequence. 
As I always do, I start with safety and environment. In our first 2 full years of restructuring, you can see the progress on safety and environmental performance through 2014 and 2015. On safety, we improved it across most measures, while we reported 6 fatal incidents, from our point of view, a tragedy in every case. The positive is for the second time in our history, and we did this in 2014, we had a fatal-free quarter in Q4. And with the business at full production there, that includes platinum, that's the first time we've ever achieved that outcome. 
Just as remarkable, we had one fatality in the second half of last year. That performance and last year's performance puts us at the front end on a fatality frequency grade across the industry and puts us ahead of the North American mining industry. For an Anglo American with 50% of its people, or more than 50% of its people is South Africa, that's a remarkable achievement. And Anglo American has been at the forefront of safety improvement across South Africa. And we've been a significant contributor to the continuing improvement across the country. 
The story is the same in environment. Our incidents reported are almost 80% lower than they were 3 years ago. Again, attention to detail, doing the planning work and making sure that we keep all of our operations control has been absolutely critical in terms of the improvement we've achieved across both metrics. Again, I wanted to say a very special -- or give a very special congratulations to Chris Griffith and the team in platinum. Two fatalities in the year and continuing improvements on the environmental side, I think they've done a great job and very pleased with the progress that's been made. But I've got to say that right across the board, the results have been very, very good. 
On the production side, we reported, on an aggregate basis, a 5% increase in production, despite taking Barro Alto down to sort out the furnaces and the pulling back in production in De Beers to match the market. Barro Alto is now operating above nameplate capacity at a 40% lower cost. We will continue to match production in De Beers with the market. 
The really pleasing aspect of the 5% increase in production is we delivered the improvements even after downsizing the organization by more than 20% over the 18 months. So for that, and taking on those challenges and to deliver a better production number is credible. Yes, there was some additional production from Minas-Rio, but the major changes that we made have certainly been significant. No more so in platinum, where Chris took out 350,000 ounces. We did drop our headcounts by 30%. But the improved efficiencies for the rest of the operation have more than offset those changes. 
In terms of the headcounts, and this is one that I'm also very careful in talking to, given that we're talking about people, and that's not easy. The pace of organization restructuring has continued to accelerate. The 23,000 headcount reduction doesn't include the Tarmac disposals, which would have added more than 5,000 roles to the headline numbers. We are forecasting another reduction this year of around 40,000 through the course of the year. Now most of those changes have been announced and are in process. So if I said we did nothing else for the balance of the year and just finished the work off, we'd be down by at least 40,000. We expect a little bit more in actual fact. 
Finally, I want to -- I again want to make sure people understand today that we're not announcing anything new from what we said in December. When we talked about going from 135,000 to 50,000, a great bulk of the reductions were actually in assets being disposed, people going with the assets. Now we said 135,000, we've actually had 128,000 at year-end. So we've done well across overheads and others in reducing the numbers. As we look forward, of the 78,000 reduction to come, 68,000 are actually associated with disposals of assets. So again, for all of the stakeholders that will be listening to this call, we are in conversation. You haven't heard anything new. We respect all of the communities and the people and the stakeholders that we work with. And we're doing things the right way. 
On unit costs, as we improve production and reduce numbers, our productivities improve. In short, since 2012, headline production is up 10%, people numbers are down 20%, and costs are tracking more than -- well below where we were in 2012 in that same time frame. The Q4 numbers -- excuse me. I should've put tequila in the drink. 
In terms of the Q4 numbers, in particular, we are showing an acceleration of the improvements that we've seen since mid-2014. If you look at that little number, the top right hand, you see the green chart shows the 120. That's productivity. That's 20% more copper equivalent units per person employed. It was actually up to 127 in the fourth quarter. That's the performance we take into 2016. And why we're confident that we can deliver on the improvements that we flagged for 2016. 
As you can also see, in copper equivalent terms -- and we've kept the copper numbers constant, so it's apples-for-apples -- we're showing a 27% reduction in our copper equivalent costs. These improvements have been delivered without material contributions from new projects. Yes, Minas-Rio makes a small contribution, but certainly not at the capital level other groups are actually reporting their cost reductions based on. It is with this performance improvement that we head into 2016, so we are confident we can continue to build on the foundations that we've built in changing the organization. We expect the performance trends to increase, as we build the operating model and the skills are developed through the organization. 
On projects, not much to be said, other than in 2013, we inherited a number of major projects. A lot of questions about capital, deliverability and a whole range of other points made. Today, I can report that we've cut $1 billion out of those major spends based on the forecasts that were put forward before I started. Minas-Rio has been a big part of that reduction. In fact, we've announced a little bit more of a reduction. FX has helped us, to be quite frank. Although most of it is actually hid, so we didn't get as much of a benefit as we would've liked. But certainly, we've come in under the numbers. 
In terms of 2015, our top line spends were down $2 billion, a 33% reduction. And you'll see another 25% reduction as we go into 2016. And continuing reductions beyond, because we haven't committed to major new projects. And we've improved our stay-in-business and mine development productivities, depending on the operation, by somewhere between 20% and 25%. And that's part of the cost improvements that we've delivered across the business. 
Finally, in terms of the EBIT improvement in 2015 and beyond, we continue to build on our business improvements with another $1.9 billion forecast for the year, that is, in 2016. In 2015, we delivered $1.3 billion in improvements, which were partly offset by the pullback in demand in the diamond market. We expect to accelerate our performance improvement in 2016 to the tune of $1.9 billion, as we described. The figure includes $1.1 billion we identified in December, as well as other programs that Tony touched on and that the operating leaders have been working on through the course of the last 4 or 5 months. Because we didn't just have a whole range of new ideas that we popped into the plan. This has been a series of works that have come through and have been firmed up, particularly as we've rolled out a number of operating models across the operation. We're seeing real significant takeup in terms of the operating approach. 
In getting ourselves to cash-positive territory, you must remember we are still funding $1.3 billion in expansion capital in 2016 to finish the commitments that were made prior to mid-2013. So it's $400 million, plus the $1.3 billion that we're funding in those expansion projects. In 2017, we see a material drop in the expansion capital. And so our free cash flow generation improved significantly, both as a consequence of that and of an additional $1 billion we see in operating improvements that we can make across the portfolio. 
So with that, I'll let René pick up the numbers, and then I'll do a very quick wrap."

The largest variance was price, which gave a $4.2 billion negative EBIT variance year-on-year. That reflects a 24% decline in commodity prices. Weaker local currencies helped reduce the cost base by $1.8 billion, primarily [ph] the rand and the Australian dollar. Our sales volume were higher, benefiting us by $0.3 billion, reflecting the return to a normal production situation in platinum. Our cash improvement was $1 billion, with real cost reductions across most of the business unit as well as lower corporate cost and exploration expenditure. De Beers sales volume were lower, reflecting our actions to help support destocking in the midstream.  
Thanks, David. Net debt of $12.9 billion was in line with the guidance I gave back in December, benefiting from net cash received from disposal of $1.7 billion in the year as well as reduction to CapEx, which came in at $4 billion versus, as you saw in Mark's slide, $6 billion on average for the last 3 years. Looking to CapEx in 2016, we are now guiding to be below $3 billion, as we continue to see the completion of some key growth projects that Mark mentioned, Minas-Rio, Grosvenor, Gahcho Kué and Venetia. In 2017, we expect further CapEx reduction to $2.5 billion."

Firstly, one for René, just on the credit agencies. They're usually insiders on your results. So I'm curious why you think they've done a triple downgrade ahead of your numbers, particularly given the EBITDA guidance and the net debt target that you've given? Is it a case of them not wanting to give you upfront progress for that? Secondly, on Kumba, it's an asset which is trading on a very low multiple for obvious reasons. Why sell that within a 12-, 18-month time frame? Would you be better off just waiting for the future optionality in that asset? And finally, just on your future business mix. It's going to be dominated by diamonds and platinum. You've given the consumer angle, but they're also extremely opaque. So how would you address that over the medium term?"

I think it had been very important for us to work with the De Beers team and our stakeholders on the transparency front. I think we've got more to do there. We'll keep doing that and make sure that we're improving our disclosure. But at the same time, not compromising the commercial issues and the sensitivities of our key stakeholders. So that will be a work in progress. And we do value your feedback on that front. Chris, in platinum, very open. And if there are any thoughts you have there, we'd be very open to look at how we can do a better job in explaining platinum and take a bit more of the lid off the actual aboveground stocks that we're seeing. Clearly, there's still some stock sloshing around. And so we're looking to improve our intelligence in the market. If we get that right, we'll certainly be happy to share that with yourself and compare notes on both of those points. Copper, we think there's great potential in the 2 material assets we have. And the longer-term positions we have, I think, again, we're very placed -- we're very well placed in those assets. In terms of Kumba, we think that will take 18 months to play out as a minimum. We're not in any rush. We want to make sure we do the right thing with our stakeholders, given the continuing performance improvement we expect from Kumba with the work that Norman has done with support from Tony and the team. You all have noted that Tony came off the board couple of weeks ago. In our view, the greater bulk of the transformation work has been done. Norman has made a lot of changes operationally. We think they're off to the races. And on the other side of that, Tony has got too much other work that he's got to do across the balance of the portfolio. And he hasn't been able to attend all the meetings. So to be fair to shareholders, we thought we should put someone there that can fully dedicate themselves to the board functions, as opposed to the operating work Tony will continue to have in the business.

Turning one of these big ships around is an exercise, so we'll let the numbers do the talking. In terms of whether it's the right portfolio, the fact that we've delivered those improvements across the business is a function of the portfolio and the ability to share that information across the group. So to lead safety, statistics, productivity improvements and cost reductions across the group is a function of what we've done inside the business and a function of being able to share that across the portfolio.

But certainly, the first site was encouraging, well above what we budgeted for the full year. So that's the encouraging piece. On copper, I think you're absolutely right. Duncan and the guys know what they have to do. You actually made a very important observation, and you may not know how important the observation is. It's about water and making sure we can take full use or make full use of that capacity. Later this year, Tony will be taking us up the learning curve on what we're doing on grade engineering and some other projects to improve the performance of both Los Bronces and Collahuasi. Now Los Bronces has dropped its unit operating cost per tonne by about 20%. Collahuasi is a bit behind that, because it hasn't got the operating model.

One is making sure it's properly capitalized, which you said earlier, it's looking pretty good, so tick that issue. But the other 2 issues with an unbundle like that, of course, are share flowback in terms of people not wanting Kumba shares, Anglo shareholders not wanting Kumba shares. And then the third issue around Kumba has to be black economic empowerment and how that's structured in Kumba going forward. I don't know if you've got some comments you can make around those 2 latter issues in terms of the complexity of unbundling Kumba? And whether there are any other complexities that you see maybe to do with South African National Treasury and issues like that?"

I think that I indicated at that time that there was a lot of flexibility on the platinum side. I indicated that there may be more stress on the Kumba side.

And to again, to stress this limit at end of December '16, it would require price of iron ore from the 1st of January to end of December just around $31, $32.

Now for people, just make sure we're clear, indirect means anyone that's not actually physically touching product. From the mine, that includes people at the mine through to corporate office, like René and I and Tony are overheads. That's around 7% to 10% for the mining industry. In fact, the more mechanized the asset, the higher that ratio goes, because you've got less people at the ground floor. Our lowest ratio, believe it or not, is platinum, where we've still got probably more of an overhead, and Chris is working that down. So at the moment, we have a ratio, as you've seen, of 10%. We believe we can get that down further. But we'd have to automate a number of the processes like EDP -- ERP structures and do a whole range of things differently. So yes, we can improve it. But there's a big change we can make in the current structures. We've already cut between London and Jo-burg around 30% of the numbers. More are happening as we speak. We'll consolidate the 2 London offices into 1 early next year. And so we're going to continue on that search to get the numbers right. But we've made significant changes.

I know it's a pretty busy day generally in the markets, so we'll try and be as succinct and efficient as we can possibly be. For us, and today, I'm pleased to announce that we're on track to deliver on all of our full year business targets and while I'm not suggesting it's going to be easy from here, we've still got lots of challenges and probably a tougher market to navigate during the second half. We're very pleased with the results and what it says about our progress. But at the same time, we're not satisfied with where we are. And I think that's an important point to make.
Today, what I'd like to do is get through the results in a fairly quickly. I know most of you will have had a little bit of time to see the numbers and we'll do during the course of the day. But I think it's important that we'll just put the key points that we see in the results that we think are important to note. And what we'll also try and do is take you through how we see the balance of the year unfolding, and why we believe the foundations that we've put in place should help us continue our improvements into '17 and beyond. So it's not simply about this year, it's about the foundations that we're setting for the longer term and we have been setting for the last 3 years.
So firstly, we remain committed to the establishment of our core portfolio of diamonds, PGMs and copper, and that core portfolio has been built around what we see as world-class assets. Our primary objective is to operate the businesses that are cost competitive or operating businesses that are cost competitive, can generate reliable cash flow through our price cycle, while providing longer-term improvement opportunities that can be realized through disciplined capital deployment and efficient operations management.  We believe we can further support returns by exercising responsible supply discipline in those markets, in particular, where we have a leadership position. More specifically, I'm pleased to report to the next phase of our business transformation is well underway. We are well ahead of our annual cash flow target with $1.1 billion delivered in the first half, with $2.5 billion EBITDA also tracking ahead of our full-year target.  As you know, we took some heavy bruises back in the last quarter last year, as we said what a difference 7 months makes. But from our point of view, there is still a long way for us to go, and the way I characterize the results in the first half, it's a positive step, it's an encouraging step, but we're still very cautious, and there's still a lot of work for us to do and for us, to carry on during the balance of this year and into '17 as we do the restructuring, and then beyond that, clearly, we've got to continue to improve to remain competitive and improve our positions across all of those in selected commodities.
Our strategy to retain liquidity stood us in good stead through probably a most difficult period end of last year and in the first quarter of this year, and I think commodity prices for us were at the bottom in the first quarter. And whilst we're encouraged to see prices improve in a range of areas, we're still not that optimistic in iron ore given the supply situation. The second half in De Beers will see some, as we normally expect, seasonal changes in sales, but we're certainly been encouraged by what we've seen so far. But in terms of things we can control, we've made good progress. In terms of portfolio and in terms of the $1.9 billion improvement, we've seen 1.6  -- are on track to deliver $1.6 billion of volume and cost improvements. And when we went into the detailed execution planning for the improvement program, we've identified $300 billion in capital and the working capital changes that we'll still realize as or still be realized in our $1.9 billion, and will impact that a little bit more in the presentation.
In terms of disposals or progress on the restructuring of portfolio restructuring, very pleased to announce the niobium phosphate sale. That went very well, but at the same time, I think it does reflect the quality of the asset, the recent work we've done in that asset, and I'll talk a little bit about some of the technology stuff that we did that has application across the broader portfolio, and the fact that we set up competitive bidding processes and that process was competitively bid. And the result, I think, was a solid one, but at the same time, I also think John Money has got a good set of assets so I think we've tried to get that balance right and so far, we're -- we believe, that we've been the right thing and I think they have a very good asset into the bargain.
In terms of the net debt, we're down to $11.7 billion and if I account for the announced disposal proceeds, we'd be at about $10.3 billion. So again, encouraging process -- progress on the net debt target, but still small to do.
On our medium-term gearing target of net debt EBITDA of less than 2.5, we're already in that range and that's encouraging. Again, we've got to keep working hard because I think we're getting a little bit of help on both iron ore prices and with FX. And so still a lot to be done, but I think the direction we've traveled is positive.
To start with safety and environment, we have had a tough 6 months, regrettably. We've lost 5 colleagues in 5 incidents, I'm just going to get myself water. Sorry about that. So whilst we've improved our safety performance by around 60% in the last 3 years, it really does in this sort of restructuring process, we have to keep our eyes very firmly fixed on how relationships are going and what we're doing in the safety front. So we've initiated some clear actions to make sure we pull ourselves back to that improvement record. On the good side, or the positive side, we've shown a 21% improvement in our all-accident frequency rate, and we have to continue that sort of progress across the board. So good progress in 3 years, little -- very disappointed tragically, people impacted in the last 6 months. But we got to get ourselves back on the rise in terms of that performance. Our environmental performance continues to be solid, and I think the environmental performance in particular reflects the greater attention to detail and the planning work we've been doing in making sure that we're controlling all of our process. And so improving availability and utilization usually means improving environmental performance because 60% of environmental issues occur in unplanned breakdowns of equipment. So when you're operating a plant and equipment more reliably, you tend to get less environmental issues. So for us, it's a clear measure and one that I've used since I started in the business and because I think it's also a measure of a whole range of other things in the business as is safety.
In terms of the operating performance, overall production was broadly in line with the prior year. We're about 1% lower on copper equivalent basis. This was despite pulling back production at De Beers in response to weaker market conditions. While at same time, we sold [ph] 8.3 million carats to De Beers, which is 29% higher than H1 2015. So I think the progress and the work we did in the last half of last year has certainly paid benefits this year. And we're encouraged by what we see in the market still, although we remain cautious, want to see a bit more for we say that we've dealt with all the pipeline issues. But so far, so good.  I'd like to make a very important point as part of the production results. You need to remember that the production this year versus last year has been delivered despite downsizing the organization by more than 10%. So from a productivity point of view, it's a more credible performance considering De Beers and the fact that our establishment numbers are lower.
In copper, a little disappointing with Los Bronces being impacted by some very significant dumps of snow. We'll unpack that a little bit later and explain what impact that's had and why we tend to adjust next year's forecast as well, but on the good side, it was done very well and certainly, we'd expect them to continue to improve. So that's been a bright side of that story.  Platinum was solid after lower-than-expected refined production in Q1 after stock taken safety stoppages. But Christian will pulled that back very quickly, so very pleased with the second quarter performance. Mogalakwena continues to be very pleasing. We're up north of 400,000 ounce rates despite ore in the last 2.5 years, I think we were up almost -- we were up more than 30% without spending capital. So I think Chris and the guys have done a great job, and it does give some sense of what's possible with the operating model and the good work the team has been doing on a range of fronts.  Amandelbult also began to turn a quarter and we're quite encouraged with what we're seeing there. In nickel, Barro Alto is now operating at main plate capacity, so that was a big jump for us, a big task to get the furnaces right, very pleased with the progress there and you'll see pretty good past performance there as well.
In coal, the South African operations have continued to perform in line with plan. And the Australian met coal production was strong despite 2 major longwall moves in the first half. So we'll do a bit better in the second half, given I think, we may almost sneak through without a longwall move. So really pleased with that, and in fact, Seamus is smiling today, he's just come, just landed back in the country I think maybe this morning, and he tells me that yesterday Grosvenor has produced 37,000 tonnes. So projects been commissioned 7 months early, under budget and certainly make a significant contribution. I think we'll be careful in analyzing [ph] those sorts of numbers. You got to remember you got longwall moves and that's a peak number, but some really in the commissioning, fantastic job and really proud of what the guys have done at Grosvenor. For us I think it really helps demonstrate where we come from on projects and operations.  
So apart from the challenges at Los Bronces, and taking into account that the [indiscernible] has done a lot of restructuring in the first 6 months in dropping manning levels by 31%, a solid operating performance, not as good as we would've liked, but most importantly, really good work on the cost side. And from our perspective, I'm more concerned and more focused on the costs and margins than we are in the absolute production. And so for us, the most pleasing aspect of our first half performance, and I think this is the key in making sure that we're generating free cash flow is the operating cost performance. Overall costs were down 19% compared to this time last year. Yes, we've had help from foreign exchange, but we're also in some reasonably high inflation jurisdictions as well. So the guys have done a good job, very pleased, and we've seen consistent performance improvement right across the board. And from our perspective, a 19% cost reduction reflects around about 7% [indiscernible] across all businesses, but it is patchy depending on how far various parts of the business were in the restructuring. But generally, you're seeing the impact of the hard work that's been done out of the last 2.5 to 3 years. So for us, even though we're going through a major restructuring, and it is significant in any scale, the fact that we've been able to hold the costs is pleasing, and it's something that really remains key part of our focus as we go forward.
Now just to put the organization restructuring into perspective, since 2013, we've reduced our manpower levels down to 120,000. And so we've seen another 6% reduction during the course of the last 6 months. The majority of these reductions have been from restructuring our corporate offices, Kumba, Minas-Rio, call, ongoing work in platinum in London and Jo'burg. Based on the disposals announced today phosphates and niobium, Rustenburg, Foxleigh and Callide, we are at a pro forma workforce level around 98,000. Now that is a 40% reduction from where we were in 2013.  Interestingly, I'll show this a little later. Our actual full production is actually up since 2012. So the productivity improvement is quite dramatic.
Finally, as I've said before, I want people to understand, and in particular, my colleagues in South Africa, that we're not announcing anything new today with these reductions. They have been announced before. What we're doing is simply explaining where we are on the restructuring journey. I think that's an important point to make for those that are watching these things very closely and have been reporting publicly on our programs. So nothing new, it's where we are in the process and where we said we'd be.
In terms of the change, I thought one slide would help explain what we've been doing, and this is since the second half of 2013. If I could say based on what we announced in December and unpacked on February, we are on track to deliver, firstly a 12% improvement in absolute production across the business since around 2012, and that's despite a 1/3 reduction in the actual operating assets in the business. Now granted some of those assets are small, but when we started at 68 at the end of 2015, we're down to 45, and with asset disposals already announced, we're down to 42. Second key statistic is that our productivity continues to improve. So as you've reduced the numbers, reduced the assets, we've reduced the numbers. We've also restructured and improved our efficiencies. Our workforce numbers will be 40% lower by year end, and on an apples-for-apples basis, our productivity or production per person employed will be up by 50% by year end. And that's with disposals already put in place and disposals announced. So when I talk to those figures, I am including niobium phosphate and Rustenburg. So we get the good with the lower, but at the end of the year, that's about where we'll be in terms of the productivity that's come out of the restructuring over the last 3 years.  Now these numbers are being delivered in spite of the pullback in De Beers due to the market issues to ensure we're matching in our markets and with only modest early contributions from Minas-Rio, Grosvenor and Gahcho Kué. Now we start to see a pickup in those contributions next year, Gahcho Kué obviously, and depending on where we go with the assets with Grosvenor. The third point is when we talk about cost reductions, yes, we've had some support and help from foreign exchange. But again, when you look at the input inflation numbers in jurisdictions like South Africa, there's been a lot of inflation we've been swimming against in those jurisdictions. But we're -- we reported U.S. dollar 36% reduction in our operating costs, these are nominal terms against where we were in 2012. And that performance improvement, and that actually reflects the half year number, and we expect to replicate that -- we'll be close to replicating that on a full year basis. That's been driven substantially by the productivity improvements, but also in other improvements as we get more out of trucks that also helps reduce our capital as well. And so I think that chart more than any other chart reflects the physical changes in the business and how we're restructuring the portfolio and looking to improve our relative positions across our full commodity swing.
In terms of the portfolio, as I said, we started around 68 assets, down to 48 -- 45 at the end of last year, with sales announced at [ph] 42. There's no change to the strategy that we set out in February. In particular, on the asset program and [indiscernible] where we are, I'm not going to go talk about any individual asset sales for obvious reasons. We have a process underway and we'll make announcement only as and when we are in a position to execute. Any sales have to be for value, and I want to stress that point again. The main concern shareholders, people that we work for, expressed in our conversations is we support the strategy contingent upon your ability to deliver value from the sales. Now there's always some debate on what value we may have on an asset, but for us, that is true north. It is a bad value, and it's bad having the discipline to hold and make sure we get value for the assets. And so far, we believe we've delivered on that promise, and we believe with the results for the first half, and in particular, with the cash flow we've generated, it actually supports us holding to that principle as we go forward.
So with that, let me hand across to René who will go through the key numbers and the finances and then I'll pick back up with a bit of a broader summary."
409115,377081104,1014882,"Anglo American plc, H1 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Anglo American plc","Executives","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everybody.Let's start with the highlight for the first half. EBITDA is down 25%. We'll see when we go through [indiscernible] the key driver was the decline in commodity prices. Also $2.5 billion of EBITDA in the first",1068,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everybody.
Let's start with the highlight for the first half. EBITDA is down 25%. We'll see when we go through [indiscernible] the key driver was the decline in commodity prices. Also $2.5 billion of EBITDA in the first 6 months, $1.4 billion came from the core, which includes platinum, De Beers and copper, and $1.1 billion from noncore.  So I think the tax rate of 32%, up versus last year at 28%. That reflects the profit mix for the full year, we expect [indiscernible] of effective tax rate to be around 32%.  CapEx, $1.2 billion compared to $2 billion last year. Getting the benefit of the commissioning of a number of projects, Minas-Rio, but also Grosvenor, as Mark mentioned earlier, and Gahcho Kué coming on stream in September. We are also getting the benefit of the optimization of SIB CapEx and stripping. Free cash flow was very strong at $1.1 billion compared to $0.2 billion last year. The benefit of the cash improvement initiatives that we launched at the beginning of the year, the very strong working capital management, we see that in one of the slide later in my presentation, and the lower CapEx.  Net debt at $11.7 billion, but $10.3 billion if you factor the after-tax proceeds from niobium and phosphate that we are expecting in September, October. Finally, we recognize a $1.2 billion positive impairment on Moranbah and Grosvenor.
Turning to the EBIT reconciliation, $1.9 billion last year coming down to $1.4 billion this year. The key driver was the negative $1.2 billion impact from lower commodity prices, and you see the breakdown between bulks and base precious. We also got a smaller positive inventory stock adjustment from platinum, $180 million last year, around $40 million this year. In term of sales volume variance, a positive variance from De Beers. Volume was up 29%. That was offset by lower production at -- in copper due to the very high level of snowfall in the Santiago area; but also in Kumba, lower production as we were redesign of the pit.
Cash cost were $300 million lower than last year, primarily in the second quarter of the year as we develop our cash improvement initiative in the first quarter this year. So on track to deliver the $1.6 billion that Mark highlighted earlier in the presentation.
Net debt of $11.7 billion, so a significant reduction compared to 2015 of $12.9 billion, including a $500 million working capital release, as well as a reduction of CapEx as we saw earlier. We also got the benefit of the liability management exercise that we did back in March. The benefit was $120 million, and we expect further interest cost savings over the next 18 months, around $63 million.
And again, if we deduct the $1.4 billion of net disposal proceed, the level of net debt stands at $10.3 billion. That give us a net debt to annualized EBITDA of 2.2x. If you exclude the niobium and phosphate contribution in the first half of this year.  As we announced in December, the dividend has been suspended. 
Looking to CapEx for the remainder of the year, we are now guiding between $2.5 billion and $2.7 billion, which merely reflects the reallocation of $200 million of cost saving targets to lower deferred stripping.  In 2017, we expect CapEx to be lower, to be below $2.5 billion, that only includes the benefit of the disposal, which have been announced so far, so just niobium and phosphate.
Turning to working capital management, so the level of working capital at end of 2015 was $3.8 billion. We got the benefit of $700 million of inventory reduction, $0.5 billion [ph] coming from De Beers. We sold 18.3 million carats in the first half of this year, while we produced 13.3 million carats. So we -- you remember that at the end of 2015, second half of '15, we substantially reduced the level of supply to the market to help the cycle the level of inventory, we were able now to resume the level of supply and reduce the inventory buildup, which we had in the second half of 2015.  Kumba was able to maintain the level of sales, despite the level of -- the lower level of production. I also want to highlight the platinum level of inventory. We had some issues, as you remember, in the first quarter of this year at the precious metal refinery due to Section 54 interruption. So there was an inventory buildup in the work in progress during earlier this year, and platinum very successfully has been able to ramp up the level of production and the level of inventory is now back to normal level.  Platinum [ph] was down $200 million, and then we had the impact of the recovery in prices towards the end of the first half and FX with a level of working capital at the end of June at $3.3 billion.
We have maintained very strong level of liquidity. You first see the decline in gross debt from $19.8 billion to $17.5 billion, some of that coming from the liability management exercise. The level of maturity is relatively low over the next 18 months, so $900 million this year and $1.9 billion in '17. That's after the impact taking reconciliation impact of bond buyback that we did in March. And we have maintained a very strong level of liquidity, still in excess of $15 billion. And that's, again, before the benefit of the $1.4 billion of disposal proceed from the sale of niobium and phosphate that we're expecting in September or October.
So we are transitioning to a core portfolio of high-quality asset. We expect the transaction which have been announced, so Rustenburg, the Australian coal assets and niobium and phosphate, to be completed in the second half of this year. And as Mark has already said, we don't comment on the individual asset sale. Processes are underway.
So in term of wrap-up, we maintain our commitment, whether it's in term of net debt targets, so well on track to have level of net debt below $10 billion. Controllable with our EBITDA guidance of $4.8 billion export [ph]; but again, on track to deliver the $1.6 billion, CapEx below -- between $2.5 billion and $2.7 billion and attributable free cash flow well above the $1 billion number.
Back to Mark."

Okay, so just to go straight to the operating summaries, firstly, in platinum, Chris and the guys have done a great job, they're continuing to restructure and reduce our cost base. And that process has been a tough one. As each month goes by, we're tightening in all parts of the business. I have to say the performance at Mogalakwena has been really pleasing in the way the guys have brought the potential of that asset through. And I think in many ways, we're still on a sadly get our arms around what's possible and I've got to reflect great credit to Chris and the guys and the good work they've done there. We've also been working hard to make sure that we set out Rustenburg and Union to success post disposal. That's important to us. In Rustenburg's case, the section level approval is our last significant milestone that will be done, and that process is substantially in our colleagues hence whether it's a banyan the way they've structured there BA proposals and they're in dialogue with the department. And so we made good progress but we do have to be patient in those process, particularly for an asset like Rustenburg where you have that complexity. Going forward, I think the focus the team has on capital and cost discipline, that's the heart of the business and the changes that have been made, and Chris' tenure as we've gone forward and certainly from our point of view, we regard the assets that we have to work with as the best in the industry, and we're now starting to really understand what potential we have in terms of continuous improvement like what they've done in the hard work that they've done.
In De Beers, we have a new CEO in the building. Bruce Cleaver is here, and he's hit the ground running. So congratulations to Bruce. We are very pleased to report the encouraging rebound in the first half diamond sales, supported by the decisive actions we took to pull back on rough production sales in the second half of 2015. I think a very important process and also a process where I think -- which I think has brought us much closer to our site holders but still a lot of work to be done as we make sure that we understand their sensitivity and issues and make sure that we really are partners with both them and the countries in which we work.  Based on the latest data we are seeing in U.S. sales, they have been reasonably solid, although other sales around global mix reflecting differences in FX rates and on specific issues in local markets. We believe based on the mix of data, it is prudent to remain cautious in terms of the outlook for diamonds. And I think from our point of view, that's the appropriate way to think about and work within the business. In terms of our performance, clearly, sensitivity to the market is our first priority in addition to controlling what we can control.  We still expect the usual seasonality on sales, and so it is very likely our second half sales will be lower than our first half sales. The next couple of slides will also help us understand the pipeline balance and where we need to focus with customers to get our demand supply balance right. And that's a big task for Bruce, but certainly, one that I've had great feedback from site holders specifically on the way he's interacting and working with all of the team players. In fact, he's just come back from Botswana and we've had some very, very constructive conversations with our partners.  We've also made encouraging progress on cost reductions. A snap line was removed from the mix at the end of 2015. That was a tough call. The recent confirmation by the government that we can flood the mine, which in that environment is actually the right thing to do from an environmental perspective. That actually reduces our annual maintenance cost by $50 million a year. So that's a very important approval for us to receive and allows us to maintain the asset at a nominal maintenance cost on an annual basis. And again, there is still the potential to access the asset longer-term, but it also minimizes our costs in the short term. So we think that's been a good outcome and the cooperation work with the government, with the Canadian government has been very constructive and we've acknowledged their approach and the team for doing good work on the ground.
In terms of copper, we've had a tough 12 months in copper, with drafts in 2015 followed by record snowfalls and then being hit by early in record snows in 2016, at Los Bronces has been a tough 12 months. Now I'll deal more specifically with Los Bronces in a minute. It's not simply about snowfall. We made a couple of poor decisions in equipment selection that have impacted the outcome, but that's been corrected, and I'll just speak to that in a second. At El Soldado, we've turned a corner. We were originally forecasting a potential $100 million cash loss when we looked at spot prices back in December. We've adjusted the mining strategy. We've restructured and lower the manning levels at the site. And so today, we actually were cash positive in the first 6 months. So I think Duncan and the team has done a great job in recalibrating and getting El Soldado in the right place. So that's been a good performance. And while we remain under pressure within some tight mining areas at Los Bronces, the team has done a great job in terms of its cost management, and you can see in terms of the performance that despite the volume pressures, the cost reductions predominantly have helped us improve our performance, and that's where the real focus has been. So as we continue to improve and get Los Bronces back to where it needs to be, we should continue doing -- to improve that performance. But that will be more in the second half of '17. But certainly, the focus on costs will continue and I've been very encouraged and I think the guys have done a good job in certainly improving the operations, and there's a lot more we can do and acknowledging Collahuasi good performance, very solid, been very happy. The cooperation with our partners has been good. Whilst we don't have the operating model which we think would help us improve or quicken the rate of change, we certainly are very pleased with the relationship and the way we've been working together on the improvements at Collahuasi.
On Los Bronces specifically, and I won't say much of them other than to give you a sense of the snow and some of the tight areas and the right-hand picture that we've been working in, we used gear that was probably a bit bigger than it should have been to take out some of the areas, and that's impacted our ability to access high-grade and it's been pushed some months back. The good news is the pit configuration is right. We've not done anything to damage the integrity, but the sequencing will have to take a little bit longer to get to that high grade, which will impact the balance of this year, which we picked up in the guidance numbers and early in '17, and then we start to get that back into shape. So again, the snow has been the big issue. We lost some of our flexibility with the snows at the end of '15, and then when we had the early dumps in '16, we actually impacted our ability to access which we made a little bit worse by making a couple of bad choices on equipment. That's been corrected. Both Duncan and Tony have been working with the team. So I think a few lessons have been learned there and we'll pull that back. But overall, very happy with the cost performance of the operation and more improvements to be had.
At nickel, the turnaround at Barro Alto has underpinned and aggressively improved the cost improvement story as we continue to work the asset towards the potential. In the nickel industry, good news stories have been a little hard to find over the last few years, and in my view, Barro Alto has been one of the good news stories in the industry and certainly very pleased with what the team has done. Rubin and the guys have done a great job and certainly, happy with the progress they've made and they're doing a good job in the operations and that's been very pleasing.
On coal, Seamus and the team continued to do a great job. Whilst we get rather sick of talking about the improvements that have been delivered, the guys have again improved on their productivities and costs. Maybe not as dramatic as what we saw 2 years ago, but the basis certainly improved. And I've got to give great credit to the work that's been done. And as I said, Grosvenor, 7 months early, under budget and continuing to prove the operation. The other point I would make, and this goes across the board, but in particular, with coal, we're not only improving our operating cost, we're improving our capital costs as a consequence of the efficiencies in development and the other activities that we're driving across the business. So our capital numbers are improving. Both as a  -- as a reflection of the disciplines that we're introducing in terms of capital spend, but also, as a consequence of the improving productivities that we're getting from equipment. For example, mine fleets getting 30% more hours out of the gear that we have on the ground, has been a key part of that improvement as well, and the car guys have done a fantastic job across both operating costs and capital.
On Kumba, again, Norman and the guys have had a tough 6 months as they've been going through their restructuring. At Sishen in particular, we've seen a 31% reduction in employing contractor numbers. It did absorb considerable time and effort, even more than Norman anticipated, but the good news was that by June, we're starting to see the numbers improve and so that's encouraging. But even with all of that restructuring and the bulk of the manpower numbers still in the half numbers, the breakeven price delivery of $34 a tonne was a good performance under those circumstance. Norman and the team have got a challenge, and then with Timba and Seamus taking on the challenge going forward, it would be important to continue the improvement, settle the operation and content that improvement going to be absolutely critical in making sure that Kumba can be as good as it can be. So I'd like to say congratulations to [indiscernible] he's done a great job in South African coal; Seamus, I think has been a champion for Timba and the work he's done. And so we're thrilled to see someone that's done such a good job in can get the opportunity to take on a big jump like Kumba. But with the work that he's done and what he's shown us in coal, we think he'll do a great job for Kumba.
At Minas-Rio, the ramp-up continuous. Again, Seamus took over the asset a few months back. The focus has been, again, on settling the operation, getting the cost down and working out how we can figure and balance the performance and the commissioning, consistent with the licensing processes that are in place both as a function of the [indiscernible] obviously has made the government far more sensitive on these types of things and making sure that we've got the mining strategy balanced to what's slightly take a little bit more time on the licensing front. And I think 2, 3 numbers, the 15  to 17 million tonne forecast, we think we're well on track with that with the improvements. But the cost performance is the one that from my point of view is the most encouraging. If you look at the unit cost, if I'll be at $32 a tonne wet, our original target at 26 million tonnes was $33 to $35. So the guys have done a good job pulling costs down, getting the overheads down, and they're doing a good job on those costs. We'll keep focusing on those costs, and in the course of the next 6 months, we'll have a better understanding of what we should be able to do at 26 million tonne [indiscernible] rate. Just one item in terms of the licensing process, we've gained an interim approval in the second phase license which was important for us so we're able to open up the next few areas, which will make sure that we've got balance and productivity and we're in that process now. The licensing process for us, we don't see any technical problems with the facilities or the tailings end because we're using a very different technology to what was used at a market, which is using upstream lefts. Our downstream strategy, which is certainly a very different civil construction, it seemed to be probably a favored type of construction for tailings dam. So not on the occasion that are happy with that technology that's been used. So we don't see that in of itself as a risk in the licensing. It really is the process that we have to go through. It's quite a protracted process and become a little more difficult, obviously, since the incident.
Before I go through summary, I did want to make one point. In all of the work we've been doing in the last 3 years, it's been very much about reengineering the way the business works. So it's about business process reengineering and cost reduction. And they are 2 different things, it's about efficiency, changing the way we operate, getting 30% more out of our equipment, improving our productivities so that our cost reductions and our cost improvements and our business improvements are long term sustainable.  We also believe that innovation is going to play a more significant role in the way we run the business in the next 5 to 10 years. I'm not of the view that the industry has hit a wall on cost and efficiency improvement. In fact, I'm on the opposite view that I think we will see a period of time in this industry where there will be more innovation and more step changes in costs because of what we've come through as an industry. So manufacturing type approaches, which is reflected in our operating model, that's an opportunity that will continue to deliver us beyond 2016. And that's item 2 there. And on the business restructuring, we'll see more contribution from the core assets over time. So that's another area of improvement. 
But I want to talk about 3 step changes that we've been investing in as a business because for us, the key to continuing improvement beyond '16 and in particular, beyond '17, is about the types of things we've seen in the business. So great concentration, just explain that in our niobium business, we introduced a screening process in front of the main concentrator that took the run-up minefield and then upgraded the grade by 30%. That has helped us improve clearly given us more bang for our buck in the process and improved our recovery and the quality of the recovery in the process.  And I think that was also part of why we were able to deliver a good price on the sale because we got the full capacity pretty quickly and people can see more opportunity improve because the new technologies we put in place. Now that technology in approach is already being applied to Barro Alto and looking at improving our grow it from the line of perspective and there were some improvement potentials there and that type of approach. We've seen application in copper, we see it in certainly the open cat platinum operations, we see it in De Beers. So that's one area where the Tony, with the group executives are working on in terms of things that we can do get a better bang for our buck and improve our costs. Second, and you'll see a photo of a machine that we've just put underground that Twickenham, it hasn't started cutting it, Chris, I don't think, but we have been doing some technical development work with that. There's capcoal on a rapid mine development system. So for us, the ability to develop more productively is about reducing our costs. And so we think there's great potential in resources like Amandelbult, Brockton and Twickenham, those sorts of assets. That'll take some time. But it's a very different approach to what you would have seen some years back in the platinum industry. Still very early, but we're thinking about doing things differently because we know we're going to have to continue to lead in cost reductions and efficiency improvements across the business.  The third area is a bit of a catchall, but it actually picks up 2 key technologies, and it's water consumption. We believe that we can reduce our water consumption per tonne processed in the copper business in Chile by more than 50%. Now for those that have been tracking the Chile industry and the discussions around desalination plants and the massive capital that's been committed to those types of projects, we think there's got to be a better way. So in the last 12 months in our new open technology platforms, we've been working with a range of partners. We've identified a technology by coarse grinding and then changing the way we float material, which is obviously coarser than what you would normally do. And then changing the way we process that tailings. We can reduce our water consumption by around 50%. Now that type of technology can be applied in copper because that's what we've been doing our test work on. But it can be also applied to other environments and other processes. So it could be platinum issue, it could be Botswana. Those areas that are short water, this is a major step. As a second technology we're now working on where it actually dewaters the material and we call it interstitial, but it's a technology that also improves water or dewatering of products. So ultimately, we are looking to see if we can design mines that don't require wet tailings disposal. So in the next couple of years, this for us is a game changer in copper, because for us, Los Bronces, Collahuasi, the size of those resources at the amount of constraint by available water. If we can break that and we're already working our pilots and how we get through the process, that for us is a game changer and it starts to explain to you why we're keen on copper and why we think our assets in copper have great potential, in Mogalakwena, our diamond assets and beyond. And those technologies are things that I think you'll hear a lot more from us and probably over time compared to those in the industry who may not be where we're up to at the moment but I think these are going to be game changers. And so I think it's a fallacy when people say, Innovation, cost reduction start going to occur. It will be a matter of goes quickest on the ground and have quickly apply those technologies to their operations. So main thing I want to say, we are not sitting on our bums working simply on cost reductions. It's about efficiencies and about hitting the process and hitting our capital deployment in every way we can to create value.
So finally, in terms of the new Anglo American, the work on the core [indiscernible] we have restructured the portfolio with 35% smaller in terms of number of assets, but our productivity have more than offset that production. And our move to the core portfolio is on track, but we still hold the value imperative front and center in all of our conversations.  Positive free cash flow in 2016 at spot prices and FX. We're ahead of targets, and there's a lot more work to be done. In our noncore portfolio of bulks and minerals, being managed for cash and disposal, all of our key assets are back where they should be. One point I'd make is when we got up in December, we talked about $600 million leakage from those assets that weren't delivering. We've got that down to 200 and we're improving that with for example the changes in Snap Lake. So that's been an important focus for us and it will continue to be a focus of improvement for us.
And then finally, in terms of net debt, we've made a good start, still a long way to go. But the fact that we're delivering free cash flow and delivering value from our disposals, the 2 came together to help us hit those targets. So we've made a good start. It's a solid start. We're happy with the progress, but we are not satisfied with where we are.
So with that, more than happy to take questions."

In our view, in the areas we haven't changed our fundamental view on where those commodities are, and why we think there will be pressure, particularly on the supply side. So to be quite frank, we are surprised. The iron ore price is where it is, and we think there will be pressure on  coal as well. And whilst we've got some -- a couple of very good quality coking coal assets, we think overall coal is impacted by thermal coal, and so we think the supply side is a big issue. So we haven't changed our fundamental view, and therefore, we haven't changed the strategy that we remain committed. I think the one thing that really is important, I mentioned that a bit earlier and I will say it again, the good news with our results is that the underlying business is performing better, and we think we can continue to do better. And therefore, generating free cash flow allows you to hold your value discipline, if I can say it that way. And therefore, as a consequence, it might take longer to realize value from those assets. So I think it's far too early to make any changes based on what we've seen in the markets so far. And I think there's still a lot of debt, a lot of risk out there. And we're still very cautious on the commodities, and therefore, we're going to hold the strategy, remain cautious. It will take a little bit longer because diminish and we try to make the right call. But so far, I think we've held pretty well to true north on value and that's where we want to start. Okay, yes?"

So there are no constraints on mine development for the copper business in developing the operations. So we still got a very tight footprint. We probably are 2 years behind moving. So back in 2011, 2012, we didn't move up there when we should have it, so we're behind in positioning. But now the guys are working to improve their productivities and the snow has made the fact that those areas of type more difficult. So there's no constraints and it doesn't need more capital. It just needs a consistency. What happened is we then put gear that was bigger than it should have been on the cutbacks to make sure that we delivered copper in the short-term when we should have put the smaller gear and so we didn't have any spillover, and that was an incorrect operating decision that we've corrected. It's not a capital issue, it's not a configuration issue. Hold to that discipline, we will get the numbers. So it was a mistake operationally, and we take accountability for that, and that's why I've said that the snow made it more difficult, but we did not make the right call, but it's not a capital issue. Third point in terms of our values, we have been extremely rigorous in the last couple of years and much rigorous prior to that, but we've taken some tough views in what we think will happen in supply. We've seen quite different behavior than we've seen in the past on supply, and we've taken that into account. Asking forward iron ore and coal prices, in particular. So we haven't change that view based on everything we've seen so far. We haven't seen any real changes in behavior, and therefore, the prices that we're using reflect what we see out in the market, with the dynamics in the markets. So no change at this stage. And certainly, I'd have to be convinced that the dynamics have changed materially. We haven't seen that yet. [indiscernible] by the way, that the big issue."

Our installed capacity with the Gahcho Kué is north of 35 million carats. We will grow production with the market. We believe that the endowment associated with Jwaneng, Arapa, Venetia and those other major assets is significant, and that we've not explored the true potential of those assets, in particular. Now I won't declare anything beyond having a view. That's the work that Bruce is leading, with Tony and the guys having some very strong views on that, and also from an exploration perspective, in [indiscernible] positions we hold. So we think there's lots there. But certainly, there's 20% installed capacity, it doesn't require major capital. It's there and we can grow that with the market and beyond that, we've got significant endowments to work with in the diamond business. From our point of view, well-positioned in the long-term in diamonds. Secondly, in platinum, Mogalakwena, Amandelbult, Twickenham, those assets are significant assets that can make a long-term  contribution and have in of themselves significant organic growth potential. If I just use Mogalakwena as a simple example, Chris hates me doing this, but Mogalakwena, over 100 million ounces reserve. We're producing 400,000 ounces a year. In my previous life in 21 assets, we had 70 million ounces and we're producing 4.5 million ounces. We're not suggesting that's what we're going to do with Mogalakwena. The platinum industry doesn't need more platinum, but in that resource grouping, we have by far and away, I think, the best platinum industry, and again, market-related loss of opportunities. The key thing is to dominate the left-hand side of the cost curve, more interesting costs and margins and being on the left-hand side of the cost curve, that's where we create opportunity. What I want to do is grow the earnings first, make sure we maintain our capital discipline and then the opportunities will come our best organic development opportunities in the industry. And that's where that will come. In copper, Collahuasi and Los Bronces, 2 of the best resources in the world, new development discovery in Papua New Guinea, [indiscernible] in Finland, lots of good opportunities emerging. And certainly with the technology, starts giving a significant potential. So we think we've got a good portfolio that needs work and one  of the things that we'll deliver in the next couple of years is articulate that it's probably not the best time to be talking about those sorts of things. I want to put a cap on it. We're not going to write out our capital discipline is going to hold, and that's something we've done in the last 3 years. We've not gone crazy, we've not committed new project other than Gahcho Kué commitment and the exploration vessel and we're going to hold that discipline because we've got lots of options and lots of things we can do without spending capital.

So can you maybe tell me what's wrong with that math? And then secondly, on the working capital, say the things, obviously saw a working capital inflow from reduction of inventories.

So we are now at a very low level. In platinum, we probably now at a stable level. There will be some replenishment of finished good inventory and a reduction in the pipeline  inventory. So overall, should be relatively stable at the end of the year. So don't expect a reversal of what we have generated in the first half of this year."

And nickel, we're continuing to improve Barro Alto as we get full rate. We've had some smaller issues that we resolve, we expect Barro Alto to do a little bit better. So you got incremental improvements across the portfolio from a volume perspective and you've also got the continuing impact of the reductions and the work we're doing on the cost side.

You'll see the team is actually to members are in the audience. But we've gone from 17 down to 11 direct report probably end up with about 9 in the new configuration. I think that reflects a different way of doing things. By the time Rene turns 60 and is retired, with Norman going into his new role, I think Chris is the only one still in the same role when I started. So the management restructuring has been significant. We've done so as the executive I think it's 45% in my numbers. It will be at about half where it was. And it's about sharpening the focus. That's the first point. Second point, on the costs, we are not going to give detail in a breakdown on the cost as you probably expected. But what I would say is that in the continuing work with the operating model, we're seeing improvements on a consistent basis. It is reasonable to expect improvements will continue into 2017, and Tony and the guys, Tony, the executive in Nigeria that have identified a number of things they believe they can deliver as part of that improvement. That's point one. Two, we do get the benefit of new assets, making a  contribution, Gahcho Kué is an example and continuing improvements within those businesses, which we do have in the numbers. The third element, the technical staff is relatively small in its contribution, actually. So it's mainly from the stuff that we can see. It was in we actually back that with real opportunities, but to be fair, the opportunities that have been defined predominantly within the center and now we're in the conversation with the regions working out with the priorities and how we'll deliver against those objectives. So we're already planning that work now. As you would expect us to be so that we can deliver. So that's a very active process as we speak. In terms of the South Africa cash, sorry, in terms of the disposal, one major sale we believe would get us to $3 billion. So we'll think, we believe, we'll hit the minimum threshold. But again, it has to be subject to value. We would need to [ph] sales to get to $4 billion [ph] René. And so we've got the processes in place. If we don't get there, it'll be because we've seen we can't get there for value. And I'm not scared and we're not scared to stand up and say we have sent getting the value. So we will now in terms of where we are heading by the end of the next quarter we'll have a very clear view where we've got to land. So I think that'll be pretty clear. Because the processes are all doing fairly well and we're happy with the progress. I'm not going to tip which one will go first. You can probably guess where we're more advanced, but the next couple of months will tell those tales. In terms of South African cash, we have always assumed that the current arrangements with South Africa would remain in place, and that for us to repatriate funds would simply be a matter of time once and the dividend was installed. So we've kept our liquidity, we've kept all of our flexibility on the basis that we now have to repatriate those sums in an appropriate way with the dividends so we're not concerned about having cash-strapped in any positions. There is always an opportunity to have a sit down with some of the work through and we'll keep that option open and we want to keep a good relationship with the South African government. So we're quite comfortable either way, we could deal with the issues either way. Yes, and then back."

When we first did the value proposition for the major diversified and we talked about what made the major diversifieds major, oh was their ability to share information and be on the front edge of cost and cost effective practices. In our case, the operating model, we think, is worth somewhere between 5% and 10% on an operating costs and an apples-for-apples basis and their ability to continue to implement that over time and be compared to is about sharing the expectation. We've got across the group. We weren't doing that as a group and hadn't been doing it. That's what's changed within the group and we're sharing these ideas across the group and helping each other with their cost improvements, hence, the more rapid improvement in our cost structures. And that's worth a lot of money. In terms of administration, when we consolidated De Beers, we sold $100 million a year in administration and some support function but just consolidating the 2 [ph] reduce financing costs supply administration, IT, whole range of areas across the business. We think it's worth $1.5 billion a year to the group by being the group. And a lot of that stuff we're working with Bruce at the moment on additional improvement, we think we can help the team with. Now the technical innovations, me, how do you put a number across the 3 groups on what that cost -- that water innovation and technology is worth, and that's 5 years ahead of competitors and trying to get that sort of thing 3 to 5 but those sort of changes I what we have went in the past. That's the value proposition. We think it's worth a lot of money. In talking about copper, in making a decision between a coal asset and a copper asset, Collahuasi is a 70-year asset. How do you value a 70-year copper asset where we could double or go even further than in terms of its production potential, whereas the coal we're seeing is very clear. We've got the dimensions the only debate about whether we get the right price for coal is actually the pricing assumptions you make. So, hence, any deals we try to do, we try to put some kickers in there on price because none of us are going to get the price right. So we thought long and hard about what's core. It's around the quality of the assets and in many cases, we don't think the market appropriately values those assets. Those assets we are selling are assets we think we can price reasonably well in the market. And so far, we have been able to do that. So that's the decision that we do think there's a compelling reason for being Anglo American."

On the $6 billion net debt target, no change. Our view is that in holding and hanging tough on value, I think the important thing is that that net debt target goes with the configuration at spot prices. And so we haven't changed -- that's the logic to get to our 2.5 -- less than 2.5x [ph] net debt over or EBITDA rather net debt. The good going around. The key point is the  2.5 is more important to us than the absolute that figure a think that's the point we wanted to make. It's actually the EBITDA the net debt is the more critical. Secondly -- the other way again. On the EBITDA sustainability, again, we believe with the incremental improvements that we are making, even though we probably have some headwinds, we should again be pretty solid and the second half and beyond that, we improvements we're continuing to deliver. It's a solid number. I won't try and forecast prices.

We look at the risks associated with those cash flows, and in some cases, there are cash flow from an asset or a jurisdiction with very different to different types of assets and what the prognosis is. We look at a range of prices for the commodity interesting how robust those cash flows are and we determine a range of value and a likely value. Again, we don't try and value the assets in someone else's hands. We have a sense of what those assets are worth in our hands and what we think we can do to improve them. But at the same time, again, I think you get into a slippery slope trying to value it in someone else's hands. What's it worth in your hands I think is critical and that's the first point. The second point, which I think people don't consider as much as they should and certainly something important for us, is what's the opportunity cost of having that capital tied up in that asset compared to the other options you have for that capital with the new business. And for us, that's where the arguments are compelling in the way we're deploying our capital across the group. And we've made the decision about high-quality assets that the years, they haven't been getting the support they should have been getting compared to assess that we've been putting money into that shouldn't have that money. And if I can say it as bluntly as it is, if anybody put their hand up, and this is a little unfair, they got the capital. Not today. It's aggressively competitive and we look at where is is that capital going to work hard us to deliver value to shareholders. So it's an opportunity cost, which is a compelling part of the way we think about that capital allocation. I hope that helps."

And then secondly, I think moving Norman to oversee the South African disposals as a package is probably a great move. But this it also suggest perhaps that given the sort of common complexities across all of the assets, be it be or as though South Africa specific issues, does it also suggests that maybe these assets are more likely now to be exact group package rather than individual?"

Two, in terms of Norman, yes, I think Norman's done really or has taken really hard yards I had came in and a good job. The major restructuring is done. He and I have been talking about the possibilities for him for the future. He's made the decision on Kumba, and from my perspective, navigating the complexity in South Africa is absolutely critical, and I don't think there's anyone better than Norman to be able to do that for us on the ground. And think that will -- and we get great feedback, by the way. It isn't meant to suggest that we're going to package or not package. Our current strategy is to continue on with the process on each of the assets, but we remain very open to possibilities to deliver value for our shareholders. At the same time, it has to work for stakeholders, and including that for the government. And making sure that we capture that sweet spot, I think is going to be the key in getting this done the right way from both perspectives. And that's why Norman's on the ground. We want to make sure that we don't drop any balls from the process and so I think he's the right call and we remain open to the right opportunities on the basis that it delivers value for our clients."

Thank you very much for taking the time to join us today. I know it's a pretty busy day generally in the markets, so we'll try and be as succinct and efficient as we can possibly be, for us.
And today, I'm pleased to announce that we're on track to deliver on all of our full year business targets. And while I'm not suggesting it's going to be easy from here, we've still got lots of challenges and probably a tougher market to navigate during the second half. We're very pleased with the results and what it says about our progress, but at the same time, we're not satisfied with where we are. And I think that's an important point to make.
Today, what I'd like to do is get through the results fairly quickly. I know most of you will have had a little bit of time to see the numbers, and we'll do during the course of the day, but I think it's important that we'll just put the key points that we see in the results that we think are important to note. And what we'll also try and do is take you through how we see the balance of the year unfolding and why we believe the foundations that we've put in place should help us continue our improvements into '17 and beyond. So it's not simply about this year. It's about the foundations that we're setting for the longer term and we have been setting for the last 3 years.
So firstly, we remain committed to the establishment of our core portfolio of diamonds, PGMs and copper. And that core portfolio has been built around what we see as world-class assets. Our primary objective is to operate the businesses that are cost competitive -- or operate in businesses that are cost competitive, can generate reliable cash flow through our price cycles while providing longer-term improvement opportunities that can be realized through disciplined capital deployment and efficient operations management. We believe we can further support returns by exercising responsible supply discipline in those markets, in particular where we have a leadership position. More specifically, I'm pleased to report that the next phase of our business transformation is well underway. We are well ahead of our annual cash flow target with $1.1 billion delivered in the first half, with $2.5 billion EBITDA also tracking ahead of our full year target. As you know, we took some heavy bruises back in the last quarter last year. As Meno [ph] said, what a difference 7 months makes, but from our point of view, there is still a long way for us to go. And the way I characterize the results in the first half, it's a positive step. It's an encouraging step, but we're still very cautious and there's still a lot of work for us to do and for us to carry on with during the balance of this year and into '17 as we do the restructuring. And then beyond that, clearly we've got to continue to improve to remain competitive and improve our positions across all of those selected commodities.
Our strategy to retain liquidity stood us in good stead through probably a most difficult period at the end of last year and in the first quarter of this year. And I think commodity prices for us were at the bottom in the first quarter. And whilst we are encouraged to see prices improve in a range of areas, we're still not that optimistic in iron ore given the supply situation. The second half, in De Beers, we'll see some, as we normally expect, seasonal changes in sales, but we've certainly been encouraged by what we've seen so far. But in terms of things we can control, we've made good progress.
In terms of portfolio and in terms of the $1.9 billion in improvement, we've seen 1.6 -- or we're on track to deliver $1.6 billion of volume and cost improvements. And when we went into the detailed execution planning for the improvement program, we've identified $300 billion in capital and working capital changes that we'll still realize as -- or still be realized in our $1.9 billion. And we'll unpack that a little bit more in the presentation. In terms of disposals or progress on the restructuring or portfolio restructuring, very pleased to announce the niobium, phosphate sale. That went very well. But at the same time, I think it does reflect the quality of the asset; the recent work we've done in that asset, and I'll talk a little bit about some of the technology stuff we did that has application across the broader portfolio; and the fact that we set up competitive bidding processes, and that process was competitively bid. And the result, I think, was a solid one, but at the same time, I also think China moly has got a good set of assets. So I think we've tried to get that balance right, and so far, we believe that we've done the right thing. And I think they have a very good asset into the bargain.
In terms of the net debt, we're down to $11.7 billion. And if I account for the announced disposal proceeds, we'd be at about $10.3 billion. So again, encouraging progress on the net debt target but still some more to do. On our medium-term gearing target of net debt-EBITDA of less than 2.5x, we're already in that range, and that's encouraging. Again, we've got to keep working hard because I think we're getting a little bit of help on both iron ore prices and with FX. And so still a lot to be done, but I think the direction of travel is positive.
To start with safety and environment. We have had a tough 6 months, regrettably. We've lost 5 [ph] colleagues in 5 incidents -- I'm just going to get a glass of water. Sorry about that.
So whilst we've improved our safety performance by around 60% in the last 3 years, it really does -- in this sort of restructuring process, we have to keep our eyes very firmly fixed on how relationships are going and what we're doing on the safety front. So we've initiated some clear actions to make sure we pull ourselves back to that improvement record. On the good side or the positive side, we've shown a 21% improvement in our all accident frequency rate, and we have to continue that sort of progress across the board. So good progress in 3 years. Little -- we're very disappointed; tragically, people impacted in the last 6 months. We got to get ourselves back on the rails in terms of that performance.
And environmental performance continues to be solid. And I think the environmental performance in particular reflects the greater attention to detail and the planning work we've been doing in making sure that we're controlling all of our process. So improving availability and utilization usually means improving environmental performance because 60% of environmental issues occur in unplanned breakdowns of equipment. So when you're operating a plant and equipment more reliably, you tend to get less environmental issues. And so for us, it's a clear measure. And it's one that I've used since I started in the business and because I think it's also a measure of a whole range of other things in the business, as is safety.
In terms of the operating performance, overall production was broadly in line with the prior year. We're about 1% lower on copper equivalent basis. This was despite pulling back production at De Beers in respond to -- in response to weaker market conditions, while at the same time, we sold 18.3 million carat to De Beers, which was 29% higher than H1 2015. So I think the progress on the work we did in the last half of last year has certainly paid benefits this year. And we're encouraged by what we see in the market still, although we remain cautious. We want to see a bit more before we say that we've dealt with all of the pipeline issue, but so far, so good.
I'd like to make a very important point as part of the production results. You need to remember that the production this year versus last year has been delivered despite downsizing the organization by more than 10%. So from a productivity point of view, it's a more credible performance considering De Beers and the fact that our establishment numbers are lower.
In copper, a little disappointing with Los Bronces being impacted by some very significant dumps of snow. We'll unpack that a little bit later and explain what impact that's had and why we've had to adjust next year's forecast as well. But on the good side, Collahuasi has done very well, and certainly we'd expect them to continue to improve. So that's been a bright side of that story.
Platinum was solid after lower-than-expected refined production in Q1 after stocktake and safety stoppages. But Chris and the team have pulled that back very quickly, so very pleased with the second quarter performance. Mogalakwena continues to be very pleasing. We're up north of 400,000 ounce rates [ph] despite -- or in the last 2.5 years, I think we were up almost -- or we're up more than 30% without spending capital. So I think Chris and the guys have done a great job. And it does give some sense of what's possible with the operating model and the good work the team has been doing on a range of fronts. Amandelbult has also begun to turn the corner, and we're quite encouraged with what we're seeing there.
In nickel, Barro Alto is now operating at nameplate capacity. So that was a big jump for us, a big task to get the furnaces right. We've very pleased with the progress there. And you'll see pretty good cost performance there as well.
In coal, the South African operations have continued to perform in line with the plan. And the Australian met coal production was strong despite 2 major longwall moves in the first half. So we'll do a bit better in the second half given I think we may almost sneak through without a longwall move. So really pleased with that. And in fact, Seamus is smiling today. He's just come, just landed back in the country, I think, maybe this morning. And he tells me that, yesterday, Grosvenor produced 30,000 -- 37,000 tonnes, so project has been commissioned 7 months early, under budget and certainly make a significant contribution. I think we'll be careful in annualizing those sorts of numbers. You got to remember you've got longwall moves. And that's a peak number but so early in the commissioning; fantastic job, and really proud of what the guys have done at Grosvenor; and for us, I think, really helps demonstrate where we come from on projects and operations.
So apart from the challenges at Los Bronces and taking into account that the Kumba team has done a lot of restructuring in the first 6 months in dropping manning levels by 31%, a solid operating performance, not as good as we would have liked but most importantly really good work on the cost side. And from our perspective, I'm more concerned and more focused on the costs and margins than we are in the absolute production numbers. And so for us, the most pleasing aspect of our first half performance, and I think this is the key in making sure that we're generating free cash flow, is the operating cost performance. Our overall costs were down 19% compared to this time last year. Yes, we've had help from foreign exchange, but we're also in some reasonably high-inflation jurisdictions as well. So the guys have done a good job, very pleased. And we've seen consistent performance improvement right across the board. And for our -- from our perspective, a 19% cost reduction reflects around about 7% real [ph] across all businesses, but it is patchy, depending on how far various parts of the business were in the restructuring. But generally, you're seeing the impact of the hard work that's been done over the last 2.5 to 3 years. So for us, even though we're going through a major restructuring, and it is significant in any scale, the fact that we've been able to hold the costs is pleasing. And it's something that really remains key part of our focus as we go forward.
Now just to put the organization restructuring into perspective. Since 2013, we've reduced our manpower levels down to 120,000. And so we've seen another 6% reduction during the course of the last 6 months. The majority of these reductions have been from restructuring our corporate offices: Kumba, Minas-Rio, coal, ongoing work in platinum in London and Joburg. Based on disposals announced today, phosphates and niobium, Rustenburg, Foxleigh and Callide, we are at a pro forma workforce level of around 98,000. Now that is a 40% reduction from where we were in 2013.  Interestingly, and I'll show this a little later, our actual full production is actually up since 2012, so the productivity improvement is quite dramatic.
Finally, as I've said before, I want people to understand, and in particular my colleagues in South Africa, that we're not announcing anything new today with these reductions. They have been announced before. What we're doing is simply explaining where we are on the restructuring journey. And I think that's an important point to make for those that are watching these things very closely and have been reporting publicly on our programs. So nothing new. It's where we are in the process, and we're where we said we'd be.
In terms of the change, I thought one slide would help explain what we've been doing. And this is since the second half of 2013, if I could say. Based on what we announced in December and unpacked in February, we are on track to deliver, firstly, a 12% improvement in absolute production across the business since around 2012. And that's despite a 1/3 reduction in the actual operating assets in the business. Now granted some of those assets are small, but when we started, at -- 68 at the end of 2015. We're down to 45. And with asset disposals already announced, we're down to 42. Second key statistic is that our productivity continues to improve. So as you've reduced the numbers, we've reduced the assets. We've reduced the numbers. We've also restructured and improved our efficiencies. Our workforce numbers will be 40% lower by year-end. And on an apples-for-apples basis, our productivity or production per person employed will be up by 50% by year-end. And that's with disposals already put in place and disposals announced. So when I talk to those figures, I am including niobium, phosphate and Rustenburg. So we get the good with the lower, but at the end of the year, that's about where we'll be in terms of the productivity that's come out of the restructuring over the last 3 years. Now these numbers are being delivered, in spite of the pullback in De Beers due to the market issues, to ensure we're matching our markets; and with only modest early contributions from Minas-Rio, Grosvenor and Gahcho Kué. Now we'll start to see a pickup in those contributions next year, Gahcho Kué obviously, and depending on where we go with assets at Grosvenor.
The third point is, when we talk about cost reductions, yes, we've had some support and help from foreign exchange, but again when you look at the input inflation numbers in jurisdictions like South Africa, there's been a lot of inflation we've been swimming against in those jurisdictions. But we've reported a U.S. dollar 36% reduction in our operating costs, and these are in nominal terms against where we were in 2012, and that performance improvement. And that actually reflects the half year number, and we expect to replicate that or we'll be close to replicating that on a full year basis. That's been driven substantially by the productivity improvements but also in other improvements as we get more out of trucks. That also helps reduce our capital as well.
And so that -- I think that chart, more than any other chart, reflects the physical changes in the business and how we're restructuring the portfolio and looking to improve our relative positions across our full commodity sweep.
In terms of the portfolio, as I said, we started around 68 assets, down to 48 -- 45 at the end of last year. With sales announced, we're at 42. There is no change to the strategy that we set out in February. In particular on the asset program, and René will lay that out where we are, I'm not going to talk about any individual asset sales, for obvious reasons. We have a process underway, and we'll make announcements only as and when we are in a position to execute. Any sales have to be for value, and I want to stress that point again. The main concern shareholders, people that we work for expressed in our conversations is, ""We support the strategy contingent upon your ability to deliver value from the sales."" There's always some debate on what value we may have on an asset, but for us, that is true north. It is about value. And it's about having the discipline to hold and make sure we get value for the assets. And so far, we believe we've delivered on that promise. And we believe, with the results for the first half and in particular with the cash flow we've generated, it actually supports us holding to that principle as we go forward.
So with that, let me hand across to René, who will go through the key numbers and the finances. And then I'll pick back up with a bit of a broader summary, okay?
Thanks, René."

CapEx were $1.2 billion compared to $2 billion last year, getting the benefit of the commissioning of a number of projects, Minas-Rio but also Grosvenor, as Mark mentioned earlier, and Gahcho Kué coming onstream in September. We are also getting the benefit of the optimization of SIB CapEx and stripping.
Free cash flow was very strong at $1.1 billion compared to $0.2 billion last year, the benefit of the cash improvement initiatives that we launched at the beginning of the year; the very strong working capital management, we'll see that in one of the slide later in my presentation; and the lower CapEx. Net debt at $11.7 billion but $10.3 billion if you factor the after-tax proceed from niobium and phosphate that we are expecting in September, October. Finally, we recognized a $1.2 billion price-driven impairment on Moranbah and Grosvenor.
Turning to the EBIT reconciliation, $1.9 billion last year coming down to $1.4 billion this year. The key driver was the negative $1.2 billion impact from lower commodity prices. And you see the breakdown between bulks and base and precious. We also got a smaller positive inventory stock adjustment from platinum, $180 million last year, around $40 million this year. In term of sales volume variance, a positive variance from De Beers. Volume was up 29%. That was offset by lower production at -- in copper due to the very high level of snowfall in the Santiago area but also, in Kumba, lower production as we were through a redesign of the pit. Cash costs were $300 million lower than last year, predominantly in the second quarter of this year -- of the year as we develop our cash improvement initiative in the first quarter of this year. So on track to deliver the $1.6 billion that Mark highlighted earlier in the presentation.
Net debt of $11.7 billion, so a significant reduction compared to 2015 of $12.9 billion, including a $500 million working capital release; as well as a reduction of CapEx, as we saw earlier. We also got the benefit of the liability management exercise that we did back in March. The benefit was $120 million. And we expect further interest cost savings over the next 18 months, around $63 million. And again, if we deduct the $1.4 billion of net disposal proceed, the level of net debt stands at $10.3 billion. That give us a net debt-to-annualized EBITDA of 2.2x if you exclude the niobium and phosphate contribution in the first half this year.
As we announced in December, the dividend has been suspended.
Looking to CapEx for the remainder of the year, we are now guiding between $2.5 billion and $2.7 billion, which mostly reflects the reallocation of $200 million of cost-saving targets to lower deferred stripping.  In 2017, we expect CapEx to be lower, to be below $2.5 billion. That only includes the benefit of the disposal which have been announced so far, so just niobium and phosphate.
Turning to working capital management. So the level of working capital at end of 2015 was $3.8 billion. We got the benefit of $700 million of inventory reduction, $0.5 billion coming from De Beers. We sold 18.3 million carat in the first half of this year, while we produced 13.3 million carats. So we -- you'll remember that, at the end of 2015, second half of '15, we substantially reduced the level of supply to the market to help the stakeholders reduce their level of inventory. We were able now to resume the level of supply and reduce the inventory buildup which we had in the second half of 2015. Kumba was able to maintain the level of sales despite the level of -- the lower level of production. And I also want to highlight the platinum level of inventory. We had some issue, as you remember, in the first quarter of this year at the precious metal refinery due to Section 54 interruption. So there was an inventory buildup in the work in progress during earlier this year, and very -- platinum very successfully has been able to ramp up the level of production. And the level of inventory is now back to normal level.
Debtors was down $200 million. And then we had the impact of the recovery in prices towards the end of the first half, and FX, with the level of working capital at end of June at $3.3 billion.
We have maintained a very strong level of liquidity. You first see the decline in gross debt from $19.8 billion to $17.5 billion, some of that coming from the liability management exercise. The level of maturity is relatively low over the next 18 months, so $900 million this year and $1.9 billion in '17. That's after the impact, taking consideration of the impact of the bond buyback that we did in March. And we have maintained a very strong level of liquidity, still in excess of $15 billion. And that's, again, before the benefit of the $1.4 billion of disposal proceed from the sale of niobium and phosphate that we're expecting in September or October.
So we are transitioning to a core portfolio of high-quality asset. And we expect the transaction which have been announced, so Rustenburg, the Australian coal assets and niobium and phosphate, to be completed in the second half of this year. And as Mark has already said, we don't comment on the individual asset sale. Processes are underway.
So in term of a wrap-up. We maintain our commitment, whether it's in term of net debt targets, so well on track to have a level of net debt below $10 billion; comfortable with our EBITDA guidance of $4.8 billion at spot.
[Audio Gap]
again on track to deliver the $1.6 billion, CapEx below -- between $2.5 billion and $2.7 billion and attributable free cash flow well above the $1 billion number.
Back to Mark."

Chris and the guys have done a great job. They're continuing to restructure and reduce our cost base, and that process has been a tough one. As each month go",3629,"Thanks, René.
Okay, so just to go straight into the operating summaries.
Firstly, in platinum. Chris and the guys have done a great job. They're continuing to restructure and reduce our cost base, and that process has been a tough one. As each month goes by, we're tightening in all parts of the business. I'd have to say the performance at Mogalakwena has been really pleasing in the way the guys have brought the potential of that asset through. And I think in many ways we're still on a [indiscernible] to just get our arms around what's possible, and I've got to reflect great credit to Chris and the guys for the good work they've done there. We've also been working hard to make sure that we set up Rustenburg and Union for success post disposal. That's important to us. In Rustenburg's case, the sectional-level approval is a last significant milestone that will be done. And that process is substantially in our colleagues' hands with Sibanye, in the way they're structured the BEE proposals. And they're in dialogue with the department. And so we've made good progress. But we do have to be patient in those process, particularly for an asset like Rustenburg where you have that complexity. Going forward, I think, the focus the team has on capital and cost discipline, that's the heart of the business and the changes that have been made and in Chris's tenure as we've gone forward. And certainly from our point of view, we regard the assets that we have to work with as the best in the industry, and we're now starting to really understand what potential we have in terms of continuous improvement like what they've done and the hard work that they've done.
In De Beers, we have a new CEO in the building. And Bruce Cleaver is here. And he's hit the ground running. So congratulations to Bruce. We are very pleased to report the encouraging rebound in the first half diamond sales; supported by the decisive actions we took to pull back on rough production and sales in the second half of 2015, I think a very important process and also a process where I think -- which I think has brought us much closer to our site holders but still a lot of work to be done as we make sure that we understand their sensitivities and issues and make sure that we really are partners with both them and the countries in which we work. Based on the latest data we're seeing in U.S. sales, they've been reasonably solid. Although, other sales around the global are mixed, reflecting differences in FX rates and on specific issues in local markets. We believe, based on the mix of data, it is prudent to remain cautious in terms of the outlook for diamonds. And I think, from our point of view, that's the appropriate way to think about and work within the business. In terms of our performance, clearly, sensitivity to the market is our first priority, in addition to controlling what we can control. We still expect the usual seasonality on sales, and so it is very likely our second half sales will be lower than our first half sales. The next couple of slides will also help us understand the pipeline balance and where we need to focus with customers to get our demand-supply balanced right. And that's a big task for Bruce but certainly one that I've had great feedback from site holders specifically on the way he's interacting and working with all of the team players. And in fact, he's just come back from Botswana, and we've had some very, very constructive conversations with our partners.
We've also made encouraging progress on cost reductions. So Snap Lake was removed from the mix at the end of 2015. That was a tough call. The recent confirmation by the government that we can flood the mine, which in that environment is actually the right thing to do from an environmental perspective, that actually reduces our annual maintenance cost by $50 million a year, so that's a very important approval for us to receive and allows us to maintain the asset at a nominal maintenance cost on an annual basis. And again, there is still the potential to access the asset longer term, but it also minimizes our costs in the short term. So we think that's been a good outcome. And the cooperation work with the government, with the Canadian government, has been very constructive. And I've got to acknowledge the approach and the team for doing good work on the ground.
In terms of copper. We've had a tough 12 months in copper with droughts in 2015, followed by record snowfalls. And then being hit by early and record snows in 2016 at Los Bronces, it's been a tough 12 months. Now I'll deal more specifically with Los Bronces in a minute. It's not simply about snowfall. We made a couple of poor decisions in equipment selection that have impacted the outcome, but that's been corrected, and I'll just speak to that in a second. At El Soldado, we've turned the corner. We were originally forecasting a potential $100 million cash loss when we looked at spot prices back in December. We've adjusted the mining strategy. We've restructured and lower the manning levels at the site, and so today we actually were cash positive in the first 6 months. So I think Duncan and the team have done a great job in recalibrating and getting El Soldado in the right place, so that's been a good performance. And while we remain under pressure with some tight mining areas at Los Bronces, the team has done a great job in terms of its cost management. And you can see in terms of the performance that, despite the volume pressures, the cost reductions predominantly have helped us improve our performance. And that's where the real focus has been, so as we continue to improve and get Los Bronces back to where it needs to be, we should continue doing -- to improve that performance. But that will be more in the second half of '17, but certainly the focus on costs will continue. And I've been very encouraged. And I think the guys have done a good job in certainly improving the operations, and there's a lot more we can do.
And acknowledging Collahuasi's good portfolio. It's been very solid. We've been very happy. The cooperation with our partner has been good. Whilst we don't have the operating model which we think would help us improve or quicken the rate of change, we're certainly very pleased with the relationship and the way we've been working together on the improvements at Collahuasi.
On Los Bronces specifically. And I won't say much other than to give you a sense of the snow and some of the tight areas in the right-hand picture that we've been working in. We used gear that was probably a bit bigger than it should have been to take out some of the areas, and that's impacted our ability to access high grade. And it's been pushed some months back. The good news is the pit configuration is right. We've not done anything to damage the integrity, but the sequencing will have to take a bit longer to get to that high grade, which will impact the balance of this year, which we picked up in the guidance numbers, and early in '17. And then we start to get that back into shape. So again, the snow has been the big issue. We lost some of our flexibility with the snows at the end of '15. And then when we had the early dumps in '16, we actually impacted our ability to access, which we made a little bit worse by making a couple of bad choices on equipment. That's been corrected. Both Duncan and Tony have been working with the team. So I think a few lessons have been learned there. And we'll pull that back but overall very happy with the cost performance of the operation and more improvements to be had.
At nickel, the turnaround at Barro Alto has underpinned an aggressive improvement -- cost improvement story as we continued to work the asset towards its potential. In the nickel industry, good news stories have been a little hard to find over the last few years, and in my view, Barro Alto has been one of the good news stories in the industry. And certainly very pleased with what the team's done. Ruben and the guys have done a great job. And certainly happy with the progress they've made. And they're doing a good job in the operations, and that's been very pleasing.
On coal, Seamus and the team continued to do a great job. Whilst we get rather sick of talking about the improvements that have been delivered, Seamus and the guys have again improved on their productivities and costs, maybe not as dramatic as what we saw 2 years ago but the basis certainly improved. And I've got to give great credit to the work that's been done. And as I said, Grosvenor, 7 months early, under budget and continuing to prove the operations. The other point I would make, and this goes across the board but in particular with coal, we're not only improving our operating costs. We're improving our capital costs as a consequence of the efficiencies in development and the other activities that we're driving across the business. So our capital numbers are improving both as a -- the -- as a reflection of the disciplines that we're introducing in terms of capital spends but also as a consequence of the improving productivities that we're getting from equipment. And for example, mine fleets getting 30% more hours out of the gear that we have on the ground has been a key part of that improvement as well. And the coal guys have done a fantastic job across both operating costs and capital.
On Kumba. Again, Norman and the guys have had a tough 6 months, as they've been going through their restructuring. At Sishen in particular, we've seen a 31% reduction in employing contractor numbers. It did absorb considerable time and effort, even more than Norman anticipated, but the good news was that, by June, we were starting to see the numbers improve. And so that's encouraging, but even with all of that restructuring and the bulk of the manpower number still in the half numbers, the breakeven price delivery of $34 a tonne was a good performance under those circumstance. Norman and the team have got a challenge, and then with Themba and Seamus taking on the challenge going forward: It would be important to continue that improvement, settle the operation and continue that improvement, going to be absolutely critical in making sure that Kumba can be as good as it can be. For me, I'd like to say congratulations to Themba Mkhwanazi. He's done a great job in South African coal. Seamus, I think, has been a champion for Themba and the work he's done. And so we're thrilled to see someone that's done such a good job in coal get the opportunity to take on a big jump like Kumba, but with the work that he's done and what he's shown us in coal, we think he will do a great job for Kumba.
At Minas-Rio, the ramp-up continues. Again, Seamus took over the asset a few months back. The focus has been, again, on settling the operation, getting the costs down and working out how we can figure and balance the performance and the commissioning consistent with the licensing processes that are in place both as a function of the Samarco, we've said it, obviously has made the government far more sensitive on these types of things; and making sure that we've got the mining strategy balanced to what's likely to take a little bit more time on the licensing front. And I think 2 key numbers: The 15 million to 17 million tonne forecast, we think we're well on track with that with the improvements, but the cost performance is the one that from my point of view is the most encouraging. If you look at the unit cost FOB at $32 a tonne wet, our original target at 26 million tonnes was $33 to $35. So the guys have done a great job pulling costs down, getting the overheads down. And they're doing a good job on those costs. We will keep focusing on those costs, and in the course of the next 6 months, we'll have a better understanding of what we should be able to do at 26 million tonne design rate [ph].
Just one item in terms of the licensing process. We've gained an interim approval on the second phase license, which was important for us, so we're able to open up the next few areas, which will make sure that we've got balance and productivity. And we're in that process now. The licensing process, for us, we don't see any technical problems with the facilities or the tailings dam because we are using a very different technology to what was used at Samarco, which was using upstream lifts. Our downstream strategy, which is a -- certainly a very different civil construction, seem to be probably a favored type of construction for tailings dams, so we've got no indication that people are unhappy with the technology that's been used. So we don't see that in of itself as a risk in the licensing. It really is the process that we have to go through. It's quite a protracted process and have become a little more difficult, obviously, since the incident.
Before I go through summary, I did want to make one point. In all of the work we've been doing in the last 3 years, it's been very much about reengineering the way the business works. So it's about business process reengineering and cost reduction. And they are 2 different things. So it's about efficiency, changing the way we operate, getting 30% more out of our equipment, improving our productivities so that our cost reductions and our cost improvements and our business improvements are long-term sustainable. We also believe that innovation is going to play a more significant role in the way we run the business in the next 5 to 10 years. I am not of the view that the industry has hit a wall on cost and efficiency improvement. In fact, I'm of the opposite view that I think we will see a period of time in this industry where there will be more innovation and more step changes in costs because of what we've come through as an industry. So manufacturing-type approaches, which is reflected in our operating model, that's an opportunity that will continue to deliver us beyond 2016. And that's item two there. And on the business restructuring, we'll see more contribution from the core assets over time. So that's another area of improvement, but I want to talk about 3 step changes that we've been investing in as a business because, for us, the key to continuing improvement beyond '16 and in particular beyond '17 is about the types of things we've seen in the business.
So great concentration. I'll just explain that in our niobium business we introduced a screening process in front of the main concentrator that took the run-of-mine feed and upgraded the grade by 30%. That has helped us improve clearly -- or given us more bang for our buck in the process and improved our recovery and the quality of the recovery in the process. And I think that was also part of why we were able to deliver a good price on the sale, because we got to full capacity pretty quickly and people can see more opportunity to improve because of the new technologies we've put in place. Now that technology and approach is already being applied at Barro Alto and looking at improving and growing from a mining perspective. And there are some improvement potentials there or that type of approach. We see application in copper. We see it in certainly the open cut platinum operations. We see it in De Beers. So that's one area of work that Tony, with the group executives, are working on in terms of things that we can do to get a better bang for their buck and improve their costs.
Second, and you'll see a photo of a machine that we've just put underground that Twickenham. It hasn't started cutting it, Chris, I don't think, but we have been doing some technical development work with Atlas Copco on a rapid mine development system. So for us, the ability to develop more productively is about reducing our costs. And so we think there's great potential in resources like Amandelbult, Der Brochen and Twickenham, those sorts of assets. That'll take some time, but it's a very different approach to what you would have seen some years back in the platinum industry. Still very early, but we are thinking about doing things differently because we know we're going to have to continue to lead in cost reductions and efficiency improvements across the business.
The third area is a bit of a catchall, but it actually picks up 2 key technologies, and it's water consumption. We believe that we can reduce our water consumption per tonne processed in the copper business in Chile by more than 50%. Now for those that have been tracking the Chile industry and the discussions around desalination plants and the massive capital that's being committed to those types of projects, we think there's got to be a better way. So in the last 12 months and in our new open technology platforms, we've been working with a range of partners. We've identified a technology by coarse grinding and then changing the way we float material which is obviously coarser than what you would normally do and then changing the way we process the tailings. We can reduce our water consumption by around 50%. Now that type of technology can be applied in copper, because that's what we've been doing our test work on, but it can be also applied to other environments and other processes. So it could be a platinum issue. It could be Botswana, those areas that are short water. This is a major step. There's a second technology we're now working on where it actually dewaters the material, and we call it interstitial, but it's a technology that also improves water -- or dewatering of products. So ultimately, we are looking to see if we can design mines that don't require wet tailings disposal. So in the next couple of years, this for us is a game changer in copper because -- for us, Los Bronces, Collahuasi, the size of those resources at the moment of constraint by available water, if we can break that, and we're already working out pilots on how we get through the process, that for us is a game changer. And it starts to explain to you why we're keen on copper and why we think our assets in copper have great potential; and Mogalakwena, our diamond assets and beyond. And those technologies are things that I think you will hear a lot more from us and probably over time compared to those in the industry who may not be where we're up to at the moment, but I think these are going to be game changers. And so I think it's a fallacy when people say innovation and cost reductions aren't going to occur. It will be a matter of who's quickest on the ground and how quickly can -- they can apply those technologies to their operations.
So the main thing I wanted to say, we are not sitting on our bums working simply on cost reductions. It's about efficiencies and about hitting the process and hitting our capital deployment in every way we can to create value.
So finally, in terms of the new Anglo American, the work on the core part of the asset. We have restructured the portfolio. And we're 35% smaller in terms of number of assets, but our productivities have more than offset that reduction. And our move to the core portfolio is on track, but we still hold the value imperative front and center in all of our conversations: Positive free cash flow in 2016 at spot prices and FX, we're ahead of targets, and there's a lot more work to be done. In our noncore portfolio of bulks and minerals managed -- being managed for cash and disposal, all of our key assets are back where they should be. One point I'd make is, when we got up in December, I mean, we talked about $600 million leakage from those assets that weren't delivering. We've got that down to $200 million, and we're improving that with, for example, the changes with Snap Lake. So that's been an important focus for us, and it will continue to be a focus of improvement for us. And then finally, in terms of net debt, we've made a good start. Still a long way to go, but the fact that we're delivering free cash flow and delivering value from our disposals, the two came together to help us hit those targets.
So we've made a good start. It's a solid start. We're happy with the progress, but we're not satisfied with where we are.
So with that, more than happy to take questions."

[Audio Gap]
we haven't changed our fundamental view on where those commodities are; and why we think there will be pressure, particularly on the supply side. So to be quite frank, we are surprised. The iron ore price is where it is, and we think there will be pressure on  coal as well. And whilst we've got some -- a couple of very good-quality coking coal assets, we think overall coal is impacted by thermal coal. And so we think the supply side is a big issue. So we haven't changed our fundamental view, and therefore we haven't changed the strategy and we remain committed. I think the one thing that really is important, and I mentioned it a bit earlier and I'll say it again, the good news with our results is that the underlying business is performing better and we think we can continue to do better. And therefore, generating free cash flow allows you to hold your value discipline, if I can say it that way. And therefore, as a consequence, it might take longer to realize value from those assets. So I think it's far too early to make any changes based on what we've seen in the markets so far. And I think there's still a lot of debt, a lot of risk out there, and we're still very cautious on the commodity sweep. And therefore, we're going to hold the strategy, remain cautious. It might take a bit longer because our values won't diminish and we'll try and make the right call. But so far, I think we've held pretty well to true north on value, and that's where we want to stay. Yes?"

So there are no constraints on mine development for the copper business in developing the operation. So we still got a very tight footprint. We probably are 2 years behind moving. So back in 2011, 2012, we didn't move up there when we should have it, so we're behind in positioning. But now the guys are working. They've improved their productivities. And the snow has made the fact that those areas are tight more difficult. So there's no constraints and it doesn't need more capital. It just needs a consistency. What happened is we then put gear that was bigger than it should have been on the cutbacks to make sure that we delivered copper in the short term when we should have put the smaller gear. And so we didn't have any spillover, and that was an incorrect operating decision that we've corrected. It's not a capital issue, it's not a configuration issue. Hold to that discipline, we will get the numbers. So it was a mistake operationally, and we take accountability for that, and that's why I've said that the snow made it more difficult, but we didn't make the right call. But it's not a capital issue. Third point, in terms of our values, we have been extremely rigorous in the last couple of years, and I'm not saying we weren't rigorous prior to that, but we've taken some tough views on what we think will happen on supply. We've seen quite different behavior than we've seen in the past on supply, and we've taken that into account, casting [ph] forward iron ore and coal prices, in particular. So we haven't changed that view based on everything we've seen so far. We haven't seen any real changes in behavior and, therefore, the prices that we're using reflect what we see out in the market and the dynamics in the market. So no change at this stage. And certainly, I'd have to be convinced that the dynamics have changed materially. We haven't seen that yet. [indiscernible] by the way, that's the big issue."

Our installed capacity with Gahcho Kué is north of 35 million carats. We will grow production with the market. We believe that the endowment associated with Jwaneng, Orapa, Venetia and those other major assets is significant, and that we've not explored the true potential of those assets, in particular. Now I won't declare anything beyond having a view. And that's the work that Bruce is leading, with Tony and the guys having some very strong views on that, and also from an exploration perspective, in ground positions we hold. So we think there's lots there. But certainly, there's 20% installed capacity. It doesn't require major capital. It's there and we can grow that with the market. And beyond that, we've gotten significant endowments to work with in the diamond business. So from our point of view, well positioned in the long term in diamonds. Secondly, in platinum, Mogalakwena, Amandelbult, Twickenham, those assets are significant assets that can make a long-term  contribution and have, in of themselves, significant organic growth potential. If I just use Mogalakwena as a simple example -- Chris hates me doing this. But Mogalakwena, over 100 million ounces reserve. We're producing 400,000 ounces a year. In my previous life, in 21 assets, we had 70 million ounces and we were producing 4.5 million ounces. I'm not suggesting that's what we're going to do with Mogalakwena. The platinum industry doesn't need more platinum, but in that resource grouping, we have, by far and away, I think the best platinum industry and, again, market-related lots of opportunities. The key thing is to dominate the left-hand side of the cost curve. I'm more interested in costs and margins. And being on the left-hand side of the cost curve, that's where we create opportunity. What I want to do is grow the earnings first, make sure we maintain our capital discipline and then the opportunities will come over, best organic development opportunities in the industry. And that's where that will come. In copper, Collahuasi and Los Bronces, 2 of the best resources in the world; new development discovery in Papua New Guinea; Sakatti, up in Finland; lots of good opportunities emerging. And certainly, with the technology stuff, so that gives us significant potential. So we think we've got a good portfolio that needs work. And one of the things that we'll do over the next couple of years is articulate, but it's probably not the best time to be talking about those sorts of things. I want to put a cap on it. We're not going to run out. Our capital discipline is going to hold, and that's something we've done in the last 3 years. We've not gone crazy, we've not committed new project other than Gahcho Kué commitment and the exploration vessel, and we're going to hold that discipline because we've got lots of options and lots of things we can do without spending capital. I'll come around. I'll come up to you in the second round."

But that is an additional or separate set of areas, and the innovation stuff probably make some contribution next year. But that's the key. We're not putting any numbers to that at this stage, okay? Rene? And then I'll come back."

Or if you're suggesting that's completely independent, $1 billion additional, could you potentially give us some sort of update in terms of what the bigger initiatives are that you've identified? I appreciate that 6 months ago that was a thumb suck number or a reference number, but obviously there's been ongoing work since then in terms of clarifying that. Second question is just in terms of the disposals and following up on Anna's point about manganese, if you look at the potential sources, there's still a $500 million to $1 billion, $1.5 billion hole versus your full year target of $3 billion to $4 billion. So you've got nickel, potentially, you've got South African coal and you've got manganese, potentially. Where would you -- what's the most likely potential sale? And if you do sell South African coal, would that be contingent on approval from the SARB to be able to repatriate those profits for debt reduction? And then the third thing is just an observation. Do you think the simplification of the business has maybe gone too far, judging by today's front row?"

You'll see the team is actually in -- or some of the team members are in the audience. But now I've gone from 17 down to 11 direct report. Probably end up with about 9 in the new configuration. I think that reflects a different way of doing things. By the time René turns 60 and is retired, with Norman going into his new role, I think Chris is the only one still in the same role when I started. So the management restructuring has been significant. We've downsized the executive by, I think, it's 45%, my numbers. It'll be at about half where it was. And it's about sharpening the focus. That's the first point. Second point, on the costs, we're not going to give detail and a breakdown on the costs, as you probably expected. But what I would say is that in the continuing work with the operating model, we're seeing improvements on a consistent basis. It is reasonable to expect improvements will continue into 2017, and Tony and the guys -- Tony and the executives in Nigeria, have identified a number of things they believe they can deliver as part of that improvement. That's point one. Two, we do get the benefit of new assets making a contribution, Gahcho Kué is an example; and continuing improvements within those businesses, which we do have in the numbers. The third element, the technical stuff is relatively small in its contribution next year. So it's mainly from the stuff that we can see. It wasn't as thumb suck. We had actually backed that with real opportunities. But to be fair, there are opportunities that have been defined predominantly within the center and now we're in the conversation with the regions, working out where the priorities will be and how we'll deliver against those objectives. So we're already planning that work now, as you would expect us to be, so that we can deliver. So that's a very active process as we speak. In terms of South Africa cash -- or sorry, in terms of the disposal, one major sale we believe would get us to $3 billion. So we all think, we believe we'll hit the minimum threshold. But again, that has to be subject to value. We would need 2 sales to get to $4 billion, René? And so we've got the processes in place. If we don't get there, it'll be because we've said we can't get there for value. And I'm not scared and we're not scared to stand up and say we haven't found some because we're not getting the value. So we will know, in terms of where we're heading, by the end of the next quarter, we'll have a very clear view of where we're going to land. So I think that'll be pretty clear because the processes are all doing fairly well and we're happy with the progress. I'm not going to tip which one will go first. You can probably guess where we're more advanced, but the next couple of months will tell those tales. In terms of South Africa cash, we have always assumed that the current arrangements with South Africa would remain in place, and that for us to repatriate funds would simply be a matter of time once the dividend was installed. So we've kept our liquidity, we've kept all of our flexibility on the basis that we now have to repatriate those sums in an appropriate way with the dividends. So we're not concerned about having cash strapped in any positions. There is always an opportunity to have a sit-down with SARB and work something through, and we'll keep that option open and we want to keep a good relationship with the South African government. So we're quite comfortable either way. We can deal with the issues either way. Yes? And then back."

When we first did the value proposition for the major diversified and we talked about what made the major diversifieds major, was their ability to share information and be on the front edge of cost and cost-effective practices. In our case, the operating model, we think, is worth somewhere between 5% and 10% on an operating costs in an apples-for-apples basis and their ability to continue to implement that over time and be competitive. It's about sharing the expectation we've got across the group. We weren't doing that as a group and hadn't been doing it. That's what's changed within the group, and we're sharing these ideas across the group and helping each other with our cost improvements, hence, the more rapid improvement in our cost structures. And that's worth a lot of money. In terms of administration,  when we consolidated De Beers, we said $100 million a year in administration and some support function. But just consolidating the 2 reduced financing costs, supply administration, IT, whole range of areas across the business. We think that's worth $1.5 billion a year to the group by being the group. And a lot of that stuff we're working with Bruce at the moment on additional improvements, we think we can help the team with. Now the technical innovations, I mean, how do you put a number across the 3 groups on what that cost -- that water innovation and technology is worth. And that's being 5 years ahead of competitors in trying to get that sort of thing -- I don't know whether that's 3 to 5, but those sort of changes is what we haven't leveraged in the past. That's the value proposition. We think it's worth a lot of money. In talking about copper, in making a decision between a coal asset and a copper asset, Collahuasi is a 70-year asset. How do you value a 70-year copper asset, where we could double or go even further than that in terms of its production potential? Where is the coal sitting? We know, and it's very clear. We've got the dimensions. The only debate about whether you're getting the right price for coal is actually the pricing assumptions you make. So hence, any deals we're trying to do, we try to put some kickers in there on price because none of us are going to get the price right. So we thought long and hard about what's core. It's around the quality of the assets and, in many cases, we don't think the market appropriately values those assets. Those assets we are selling are assets we think we can price reasonably well in the market. And so far, we have been able to do that. So that's the decision. But we do think there's a compelling reason for being Anglo American. Okay. Go back."

Is $2.5 billion really a sustainable level without the kind of growth projects that could get approved medium term? And then with sort of the Moranbah and Grosvenor impairments, what drove the change in pricing at this point? Why didn't you change your long-term met coal price at the same time as the iron ore price? It seems a bit bizarre. Or is it, to some extent, linked to the sale process? What's sort of the book value sort of at the end of it? And then maybe just lastly on De Beers as well, it would be helpful to get a sense as to where inventories are in the midstream, how financing issues are in the mainstream.

On the $6 billion net debt target, no change. Our view is that in holding and hanging tough on value, I think the important thing is that, that net debt target goes with the configuration at spot prices. And so we haven't changed. That's the logic to get to our 2.5 -- less than 2.5x turn net debt over -- or EBITDA over net debt. The key -- the other way around. The key point is the 2.5 is more important to us than the absolute debt figure. I think that's the point we wanted to make. It's actually -- the EBITDA over net debt is the more critical point. Secondly -- the other way around again. On the EBITDA sustainability, again, we believe with the incremental improvements that we're making, even though we probably have some headwinds, we should again be pretty solid in the second half. And beyond that, with the improvements we're continuing to deliver, we think it's a solid number. I won't try and forecast prices. But certainly, from where we are in terms of the controllables, we think we've got the right configuration in the operations. And the incremental improvements we can see will continue to carry us pretty well into the core. On Moranbah, Grosvenor and the price lines in coal, we actually -- we're doing continuous work on our forecasting for commodities, and there's been a lot of work done in coal, in particular, given where we are and thinking about those ratios. And when we come back to the board with a recommendation, that recommendation has to have a pretty well-thought-out view on pricing, as you'd would expect. And as a consequence, on pricing, we've done that work in the last couple of months. We've reflected the view on pricing in the write-down of the asset. René, do you what to add anything to that?"

So we're being cautious and we're being very flexible with our customers as well, and I think that's the key. Financing of the midstream. It's not surprising banks are becoming tougher on their financing. We've also set some pretty clear requirements of anybody that we do business with. We think, in the long term, it's probably the right thing for the industry. And we're making sure that, again, we're being as flexible as we can or can be with our partners.

We look at the risks associated with those cash flows and, in some cases, a cash flow from an asset or a jurisdiction is very different to different types of assets and what the prognosis is.

Again, we don't try and value the assets in someone else's hands. We have a sense of what those assets are worth in our hands and what we think we can do to improve them. But at the same time, again, I think you can get into a slippery slope trying to value it in someone else's hands. What's it worth in your hands I think is critical, and that's the first point. The second point, which I think people don't consider as much as they should, and certainly something important for us, is what's the opportunity cost of having that capital tied up in that asset compared to the other options you have for that capital with the new business. And for us, that's where the arguments are compelling, in the way we're deploying our capital across the group. And we've made a decision about high-quality assets that, over the years, they haven't been getting the support they should have been getting compared to assets that we've been putting money into that shouldn't have got the money. And if I can say it as bluntly as it is, if anybody put their hand up, and this is a little unfair, they got the capital. Not today. It's aggressively competitive, and we look at where is that capital going to work hardest to deliver value to shareholders. So it's the opportunity cost, which is a compelling part of the way we think about that capital allocation. I hope that helps."

Two, in terms of Norman, yes, I think Norman's done really -- or he's taken really hard yards Kumba, done a good job. The major restructuring is done. He and I have been talking about the possibilities for him for the future. He's made the decision on Kumba, and from my perspective, navigating the complexity in South Africa is absolutely critical, and I don't think there's anyone better than Norman to be able to do that for us on the ground. And I think that would -- and we see great feedback, by the way. It isn't meant to suggest that we're going to package or not package. Our current strategy is to continue on with the process on each of the assets, but we remain very open to possibilities to deliver value for our shareholders. At the same time, it has to work for stakeholders, and including that for the government. And making sure that we capture that sweet spot, I think, is going to be the key in getting this done the right way from both perspectives. And that's why Norman's on the ground. We want to make sure that we don't drop any balls from the process, and so I think he's the right call.

Thank you very much for taking the time to join us today. I know it's a pretty busy day generally in the markets, so we'll try and be as succinct and efficient as we can possibly be, for us.
And today, I'm pleased to announce that we're on track to deliver on all of our full year business targets. And while I'm not suggesting it's going to be easy from here, we've still got lots of challenges and probably a tougher market to navigate during the second half. We're very pleased with the results and what it says about our progress, but at the same time, we're not satisfied with where we are. And I think that's an important point to make.
Today, what I'd like to do is get through the results fairly quickly. I know most of you will have had a little bit of time to see the numbers, and will do during the course of the day, but I think it's important that we'll just put out the key points that we see in the results that we think are important to note. And what we'll also try and do is take you through how we see the balance of the year unfolding and why we believe the foundations that we've put in place should help us continue our improvements into '17 and beyond. So it's not simply about this year. It's about the foundations that we're setting for the longer term and we have been setting for the last 3 years.
So firstly, we remain committed to the establishment of our core portfolio of diamonds, PGMs and copper. And that core portfolio has been built around what we see as world-class assets. Our primary objective is to operate the businesses that are cost competitive -- or operate in businesses that are cost competitive, can generate reliable cash flow through our price cycles while providing longer-term improvement opportunities that can be realized through disciplined capital deployment and efficient operations management. We believe we can further support returns by exercising responsible supply discipline in those markets, in particular, where we have a leadership position. More specifically, I'm pleased to report that the next phase of our business transformation is well underway. We are well ahead of our annual cash flow target with $1.1 billion delivered in the first half, with $2.5 billion EBITDA also tracking ahead of our full year target. As you know, we took some heavy bruises back in the last quarter last year. As Menno said, what a difference 7 months makes, but from our point of view, there is still a long way for us to go. And the way I characterize the results in the first half, it's a positive step. It's an encouraging step. But we're still very cautious, and there's still a lot of work for us to do and for us to carry on with during the balance of this year and into '17 as we do the restructuring. And then beyond that, clearly we've got to continue to improve to remain competitive and improve our positions across all of those selected commodities.
Our strategy to retain liquidity stood us in good stead through probably a most difficult period the end of last year and in the first quarter this year. And I think commodity prices for us were at the bottom in the first quarter. And whilst we are encouraged to see prices improve in a range of areas, we're still not that optimistic in iron ore given the supply situation. The second half, in De Beers, we'll see some, as we normally expect, seasonal changes in sales, but we've certainly been encouraged by what we've seen so far. But in terms of things we can control, we've made good progress.
In terms of portfolio and in terms of the $1.9 billion improvement, we've seen 1.6 -- or we're on track to deliver $1.6 billion of volume and cost improvements. And when we went into the detailed execution planning for the improvement program, we've identified $300 billion in capital and working capital changes that we'll still realize as -- or still be realized in our $1.9 billion. And we'll unpack that a little bit more in the presentation. In terms of disposals or progress on the restructuring or portfolio restructuring, very pleased to announce the niobium, phosphate sale. That went very well. But at the same time, I think it does reflect the quality of the asset; the recent work we've done in that asset, and I'll talk a little bit about some of the technology stuff we did that has application across the broader portfolio; and the fact that we set up competitive bidding processes, and that process was competitively bid. And the result, I think, was a solid one, but at the same time, I also think China Moly has got a good set of assets. So I think we've tried to get that balance right, and so far, we believe that we've done the right thing. And I think they have a very good asset into the bargain.
In terms of net debt, we're down to $11.7 billion. And if I account for the announced disposal proceeds, we'd be at about $10.3 billion. So again, encouraging progress on the net debt target but still some more to do. On our medium-term gearing target of net debt-EBITDA of less than 2.5x, we're already in that range, and that's encouraging. Again, we've got to keep working hard because I think we're getting a little bit of help on both iron ore prices and with FX. And so still a lot to be done, but I think the direction of travel is positive.
To start with safety and the environment. We have had a tough 6 months, regrettably. We've lost 5 (sic) [ 6 ] colleagues in 5 incidents -- I'm just going to get a glass of water. Sorry about that.
So whilst we've improved our safety performance by around 60% in the last 3 years, it really does -- in this sort of restructuring process, we have to keep our eyes very firmly fixed on how relationships are going and what we're doing on the safety front. So we've initiated some clear actions to make sure we pull ourselves back to that improvement record. On the good side or the positive side, we've shown a 21% improvement in our all accident frequency rate, and we have to continue that sort of progress across the board. So good progress in 3 years. Little -- we're very disappointed; tragically, people impacted in the last 6 months. We got to get ourselves back on the rails in terms of that performance.
On environmental performance: continues to be solid. And I think the environmental performance in particular reflects the greater attention to detail and the planning work we've been doing in making sure that we're controlling all of our processes. So improving availability and utilization usually means improving environmental performance because 60% of environmental issues occur in unplanned breakdowns of equipment. So when you're operating a plant and equipment more reliably, you tend to get less environmental issues. And so for us, it's a clear measure. And it's one that I've used since I started in the business and because I think it's also a measure of a whole range of other things in the business, as is safety.
In terms of the operating performance, overall production was broadly in line with the prior year. We're about 1% lower on copper equivalent basis. This was despite pulling back production at De Beers in response to weaker market conditions, while at the same time, we sold 18.3 million carats to De Beers, which was 29% higher than H1 2015. So I think the progress in the work we did in the last half of last year has certainly paid benefits this year. And we're encouraged by what we see in the market still, although we remain cautious. We want to see a bit more before we say that we've dealt with all of the pipeline issue, but so far, so good.
I'd like to make a very important point as part of the production results. You need to remember that the production this year versus last year has been delivered despite downsizing the organization by more than 10%. So from a productivity point of view, it's a more credible performance considering De Beers and the fact that our establishment numbers are lower.
In copper, a little disappointing with Los Bronces being impacted by some very significant dumps of snow. We'll unpack that a little bit later and explain what impact that's had and why we've had to adjust next year's forecast as well. But on the good side, Collahuasi has done very well, and certainly we'd expect them to continue to improve. So that's been a bright side of that story.
Platinum was solid after lower-than-expected refined production in Q1 after stocktake and safety stoppages. But Chris and the team have pulled that back very quickly, so very pleased with the second quarter performance. Mogalakwena continues to be very pleasing. We're up north of 400,000 ounce rates despite -- or in the last 2.5 years, I think we were up almost -- or we're up more than 30% without spending capital. So I think Chris and the guys have done a great job. And it does give some sense of what's possible with the operating model and the good work the team has been doing on a range of fronts. Amandelbult has also begun to turn the corner, and we're quite encouraged with what we're seeing there.
In nickel, Barro Alto is now operating at nameplate capacity. So that was a big jump for us, a big task to get the furnaces right. We've very pleased with the progress there. And you'll see pretty good cost performance there as well.
In coal, the South African operations have continued to perform in line with the plan. And the Australian met coal production was strong despite 2 major longwall moves in the first half. So we'll do a bit better in the second half given I think we may almost sneak through without a longwall move. So really pleased with that. And in fact, Seamus is smiling today. He's just come, just landed back in the country, I think, maybe this morning. And he tells me that, yesterday, Grosvenor produced 30,000 -- 37,000 tonnes, so project has been commissioned 7 months early, under budget and certainly make a significant contribution. I think we'll be careful in annualizing those sorts of numbers. You got to remember you've got longwall moves. And that's a peak number but so early in the commissioning; fantastic job, and really proud of what the guys have done at Grosvenor; and for us, I think, really helps demonstrate where we come from on projects and operations.
So apart from the challenges at Los Bronces and taking into account that the Kumba team has done a lot of restructuring in the first 6 months in dropping manning levels by 31%, a solid operating performance, not as good as we would have liked but most importantly really good work on the cost side. And from our perspective, I'm more concerned and more focused on the costs and margins than we are on the absolute production numbers. And so for us, the most pleasing aspect of our first half performance, and I think this is the key in making sure that we're generating free cash flow, is the operating cost performance. Our overall costs were down 19% compared to this time last year. Yes, we've had help from foreign exchange, but we're also in some reasonably high-inflation jurisdictions as well. So the guys have done a good job, very pleased. And we've seen consistent performance improvement right across the board. And for our -- from our perspective, a 19% cost reduction reflects around about 7% real across all businesses, but it is patchy, depending on how far various parts of the business were in the restructuring. But generally, you're seeing the impact of the hard work that's been done over the last 2.5 to 3 years. So for us, even though we're going through a major restructuring, and it is significant in any scale, the fact that we've been able to hold the costs is pleasing. And it's something that really remains key part of our focus as we go forward.
Now just to put the organization restructuring into perspective. Since 2013, we've reduced our manpower levels down to 120,000. And so we've seen another 6% reduction during the course of the last 6 months. The majority of these reductions have been from restructuring our corporate offices: Kumba, Minas-Rio, coal, ongoing work in platinum in London and Joburg. Based on disposals announced today, phosphates and niobium, Rustenburg, Foxleigh and Callide, we are at a pro forma workforce level of around 98,000. Now that is a 40% reduction from where we were in 2013.  Interestingly, and I'll show this a little later, our actual full production is actually up since 2012, so the productivity improvement is quite dramatic.
Finally, as I've said before, I want people to understand, and in particular my colleagues in South Africa, that we're not announcing anything new today with these reductions. They have been announced before. All we're doing is simply explaining where we are on the restructuring journey. And I think that's an important point to make for those that are watching these things very closely and have been reporting publicly on our program. So nothing new. It's where we are in the process, and we're where we said we'd be.
In terms of the change, I thought one slide would help explain what we've been doing, and this is since the second half of 2013. If I could say, based on what we announced in December and unpacked in February, we are on track to deliver, firstly, a 12% improvement in absolute production across the business since around 2012. And that's despite a 1/3 reduction in the actual operating assets in the business. Now granted some of those assets are small, but when we started, at 68, at the end of 2015. We're down to 45. And with asset disposals already announced, we're down to 42. Second key statistic is that our productivity continues to improve. So as you've reduced the numbers, we've reduced the assets. We've reduced the numbers. We've also restructured and improved our efficiencies. Our workforce numbers will be 40% lower by year-end. And on an apples-for-apples basis, our productivity or production per person employed will be up by 50% by year-end. And that's with disposals already put in place and disposals announced. So when I talk to those figures, I am including niobium, phosphate and Rustenburg. So we get the good with the lower, but at the end of the year, that's about where we'll be in terms of the productivity that's come out of the restructuring over the last 3 years. Now these numbers are being delivered in spite of the pullback in De Beers, due to the market issues, to ensure we're matching our markets; and with only modest early contributions from Minas-Rio, Grosvenor and Gahcho Kué. Now we'll start to see a pickup in those contributions next year, Gahcho Kué obviously, and depending on where we go with assets at Grosvenor.
The third point is, when we talk about cost reductions, yes, we've had some support and help from foreign exchange. But again, when you look at the input inflation numbers in jurisdictions like South Africa, there's been a lot of inflation we've been swimming against in those jurisdictions. But we've reported a U.S. dollar 36% reduction in our operating costs, and these are in nominal terms against where we were in 2012. And that performance improvement -- and that actually reflects the half year number, and we expect to replicate that or be close to replicating that on a full year basis. That's been driven substantially by the productivity improvements but also in other improvements as we get more out of trucks. That also helps reduce our capital as well.
And so that -- I think that chart, more than any other chart, reflects the physical changes in the business and how we're restructuring the portfolio and looking to improve our relative positions across our full commodity sweep.
In terms of the portfolio, as I said, we started around 68 assets, down to 48 -- 45 the end of last year. With sales announced, we're at 42. There is no change to the strategy that we set out in February. In particular on the asset program, and René will lay that out where we are, I'm not going to talk about any individual asset sales, for obvious reasons. We have a process underway, and we'll make announcements only as and when we are in a position to execute. Any sales have to be for value, and I want to stress that point again. The main concern shareholders, people that we work for expressed in our conversations is, ""We support the strategy contingent upon your ability to deliver value from the sales."" Now there's always some debate on what value we may have on an asset, but for us, that is true north. It is about value. It is about having the discipline to hold and make sure we get value for the assets. And so far, we believe we've delivered on that promise. And we believe, with the results for the first half and in particular with the cash flow we've generated, it actually supports us holding to that principle as we go forward.
So with that, let me hand across to René, who will go through the key numbers and the finances. And then I'll pick back up with a bit of a broader summary, okay?
Thanks, René."

Of the $2.5 billion of EBITDA in the",1079,"Thank you, Mark. And good morning, everybody.
We'll start with the highlight for the first half.
EBITDA, down 25%. We'll see, when we go through the reconciliation, the key driver was the decline in commodity prices. Of the $2.5 billion of EBITDA in the first 6 months, $1.4 billion came from the core, which includes platinum, De Beers and copper; and $1.1 billion from noncore. The effective tax rate of 32%, up versus last year at 28%, that reflects the profit mix. For the full year, we expect the level of effective tax rate to be around 32%. CapEx were $1.2 billion compared to $2 billion last year, getting the benefit of the commissioning of a number of projects, Minas-Rio but also Grosvenor, as Mark mentioned earlier, and Gahcho Kué coming onstream in September. We are also getting the benefit of the optimization of SIB CapEx and stripping.
Free cash flow was very strong at $1.1 billion compared to $0.2 billion last year, the benefit of the cash improvement initiatives that we launched at the beginning of the year; the very strong working capital management, we'll see that in one of the slide later in my presentation; and the lower CapEx. Net debt at $11.7 billion but $10.3 billion if you factor the after-tax proceed from niobium and phosphate that we are expecting in September, October. Finally, we recognized a $1.2 billion price-driven impairment on Moranbah and Grosvenor.
Turning to the EBIT reconciliation, $1.9 billion last year coming down to $1.4 billion this year. The key driver was the negative $1.2 billion impact from lower commodity prices. And you see the breakdown between bulks and base -- precious. We also got a smaller positive inventory stock adjustment from platinum, $180 million last year, around $40 million this year. In term of sales volume variance, a positive variance from De Beers. Volume was up 29%. That was offset by lower production at -- in copper due to the very high level of snowfall in the Santiago area but also, in Kumba, lower production as we were through a redesign of the pit. Cash costs were $300 million lower than last year, predominantly in the second quarter of this year -- of the year as we develop our cash improvement initiative in the first quarter of this year. So on track to deliver the $1.6 billion that Mark highlighted earlier in the presentation.
Net debt of $11.7 billion, so a significant reduction compared to 2015 of $12.9 billion, including a $500 million working capital release; as well as a reduction of CapEx, as we saw earlier. We also got the benefit of the liability management exercise that we did back in March. The benefit was $120 million. And we expect further interest cost savings over the next 18 months, around $63 million. And again, if we deduct the $1.4 billion of net disposal proceed, the level of net debt stands at $10.3 billion. That give us a net debt-to-annualized EBITDA of 2.2x if you exclude the niobium and phosphate contribution in the first half this year.
As we announced in December, the dividend has been suspended.
Looking to CapEx for the remainder of the year, we are now guiding between $2.5 billion and $2.7 billion, which mostly reflects the reallocation of $200 million of cost-saving targets to lower deferred stripping. In 2017, we expect CapEx to be lower, to be below $2.5 billion. That only includes the benefit of the disposal which have been announced so far, so just niobium and phosphate.
Turning to working capital management. So the level of working capital at end of 2015 was $3.8 billion. We got the benefit of $700 million of inventory reduction, $0.5 billion coming from De Beers. We sold 18.3 million carat in the first half of this year, while we produced 13.3 million carats. So we -- you'll remember that, at the end of 2015, second half of '15, we substantially reduced the level of supply to the market to help the Sightholders reduce their level of inventory. We were able now to resume the level of supply and reduce the inventory buildup which we had in the second half of 2015. Kumba was able to maintain the level of sales despite the level of -- the lower level of production. And also I want to highlight the platinum level of inventory. We had some issue, as you remember, in the first quarter of this year at the precious metal refinery due to Section 54 interruption. So there was an inventory buildup in the work in progress during earlier this year, and very -- platinum very successfully has been able to ramp up the level of production. And the level of inventory is now back to a normal level.
Debtors was down $200 million. And then we had the impact of the recovery in prices towards the end of the first half, and FX, with the level of working capital at end of June at $3.3 billion.
We have maintained a very strong level of liquidity. You first see the decline in gross debt from $19.8 billion to $17.5 billion, some of that coming from the liability management exercise. The level of maturity is relatively low over the next 18 months, so $900 million this year and $1.9 billion in '17. That's after the impact, taking consideration the impact of the bond buyback that we did in March. And we have maintained a very strong level of liquidity, still in excess of $15 billion. And that's, again, before the benefit of the $1.4 billion of disposal proceed from the sale of niobium and phosphate that we're expecting in September, October.
So we are transitioning to a core portfolio of high-quality asset. We expect the transaction which have been announced, so Rustenburg, the Australian coal assets and niobium and phosphate, to be completed in the second half of this year. And as Mark has already said, we don't comment on the individual asset sale. Processes are underway.
So in term of a wrap-up. We maintain our commitment, whether it's in term of net debt targets, so well on track to have a level of net debt below $10 billion; comfortable with our EBITDA guidance of $4.8 billion at spot.
[Audio Gap]
again on track to deliver the $1.6 billion, CapEx below -- between $2.5 billion and $2.7 billion and attributable free cash flow well above the $1 billion number.
Back to Mark."

Okay, so just to go straight into the operating summaries.
Firstly, in platinum. Chris and the guys have done a great job. They're continuing to restructure and reduce our cost base, and that process has been a tough one. As each month goes by, we're tightening in all parts of the business. I'd have to say the performance at Mogalakwena has been really pleasing in the way the guys have brought the potential of that asset through. And I think in many ways we're still only starting to just get our arms around what's possible, and I've got to reflect great credit to Chris and the guys for the good work they've done there. We've also been working hard to make sure that we set up Rustenburg and Union for success post disposal. That's important to us. In Rustenburg's case, the sectional-level approval is our last significant milestone that will be done. And that process is substantially in our colleagues' hands with Sibanye, in the way they're structured the BEE proposals. And they're in dialogue with the department. And so we've made good progress. But we do have to be patient in this process, particularly for an asset like Rustenburg where you have that complexity. Going forward, I think, the focus the team has on capital and cost discipline, that's the heart of the business and the changes that have been made and in Chris's tenure as we've gone forward. And certainly from our point of view, we regard the assets that we have to work with as the best in the industry, and we're now starting to really understand what potential we have in terms of continuous improvement like what they've done and the hard work that they've done.
In De Beers, we have a new CEO in the building. Bruce Cleaver is here. And he's hit the ground running. So congratulations to Bruce. We are very pleased to report an encouraging rebound in the first half diamond sales; supported by the decisive actions we took to pull back on rough production and sales in the second half of 2015, I think a very important process and also a process where I think -- which I think has brought us much closer to our Sightholders but still a lot of work to be done as we make sure that we understand their sensitivities and issues and make sure that we really are partners with both them and the countries in which we work. Based on the latest data we're seeing in U.S. sales, they've been reasonably solid. Although, other sales around the global are mixed, reflecting differences in FX rates and on specific issues in local markets. We believe, based on the mix of data, it is prudent to remain cautious in terms of the outlook for diamonds. And I think, from our point of view, that's the appropriate way to think about and work within the business. In terms of our performance, clearly, sensitivity to the market is our first priority, in addition to controlling what we can control. We still expect the usual seasonality on sales, and so it is very likely our second half sales will be lower than our first half sales. The next couple of sites will also help us understand the pipeline balance and where we need to focus with customers to get our demand-supply balanced right. And that's a big task for Bruce but certainly one that I've had great feedback from Sightholders specifically on the way he's interacting and working with all of the team players. And in fact, he's just come back from Botswana, and we've had some very, very constructive conversations with our partners.
We've also made encouraging progress on cost reductions. So Snap Lake was removed from the mix at the end of 2015. That was a tough call. The recent confirmation by the government that we can flood the mine, which in that environment is actually the right thing to do from an environmental perspective, that actually reduces our annual maintenance cost by $50 million a year, so that's a very important approval for us to receive and allows us to maintain the asset at a nominal maintenance cost on an annual basis. And again, there is still the potential to access the asset longer term, but it also minimizes our costs in the short term. So we think that's been a good outcome. And the cooperation and work with the government -- the Canadian government, has been very constructive. And I've got to acknowledge their approach and the team for doing good work on the ground.
In terms of copper. We've had a tough 12 months in copper with droughts in 2015, followed by record snowfalls. And then being hit by early and record snows in 2016 at Los Bronces, it's been a tough 12 months. Now I'll deal more specifically with Los Bronces in a minute. It's not simply about snowfall. We made a couple of poor decisions in equipment selection that have impacted the outcome, but that's been corrected, and I'll just speak to that in a second. At El Soldado, we've turned the corner. We were originally forecasting a potential $100 million cash loss when we looked at spot prices back in December. We've adjusted the mining strategy. We've restructured and lower the manning levels at the site, and so today we actually were cash positive in the first 6 months. So I think Duncan and the team has done a great job in recalibrating and getting El Soldado in the right place, so that's been a good performance. And while we remain under pressure with some tight mining areas at Los Bronces, the team has done a great job in terms of its cost management. And you can see in terms of the performance that, despite the volume pressures, the cost reductions predominantly have helped us improve our performance. And that's where the real focus has been, so as we continue to improve and get Los Bronces back to where it needs to be, we should continue doing -- to improve that performance. But that will be more in the second half of '17, but certainly the focus on costs will continue. And I've been very encouraged. And I think the guys have done a good job in certainly improving the operations, and there's a lot more we can do.
And acknowledging Collahuasi's good performance. It's been very solid. We've been very happy. The cooperation with our partner has been good. Whilst we don't have the operating model which we think would help us improve or quicken the rate of change, we're certainly very pleased with the relationship and the way we've been working together on the improvements at Collahuasi.
On Los Bronces specifically. And I won't say much other than to give you a sense of the snow and some of the tight areas in the right-hand picture that we've been working in. We used gear that was probably a bit bigger than it should have been to take out some of the areas, and that's impacted our ability to access high grade. And it's been pushed some months back. The good news is the pit configuration is right. We've not done anything to damage the integrity, but the sequencing will have to take a bit longer to get to that high grade, which will impact the balance of this year, which we picked up in the guidance numbers, and early in '17. And then we start to get that back into shape. So again, the snow has been the big issue. We lost some of our flexibility with the snows at the end of '15. And then when we had the early dumps in '16, we actually impacted our ability to access, which we made a little bit worse by making a couple of bad choices on equipment. That's been corrected. Both Duncan and Tony have been working with the team. So I think a few lessons have been learned there. And we'll pull that back but overall very happy with the cost performance of the operation and more improvements to be had.
At nickel, the turnaround at Barro Alto has underpinned an aggressive improvement -- cost improvement story as we continue to work the asset towards its potential. In the nickel industry, good news stories have been a little hard to find over the last few years, and in my view, Barro Alto has been one of the good news stories in the industry. And certainly very pleased with what the team's done. Ruben and the guys have done a great job. And certainly happy with the progress they've made. And they're doing a good job in the operations, and that's been very pleasing.
On coal, Seamus and the team continue to do a great job. Whilst we get rather sick of talking about the improvements that have been delivered, Seamus and the guys have again improved on their productivities and costs, maybe not as dramatic as what we saw 2 years ago but the basis certainly improved. And I've got to give great credit to the work that's been done. And as I said, Grosvenor, 7 months early, under budget and continuing to prove the operations. The other point I would make, and this goes across the board but in particular with coal, we're not only improving our operating costs. We're improving our capital costs as a consequence of the efficiencies in development and the other activities that we're driving across the business. So our capital numbers are improving both as a -- the -- as a reflection of the disciplines that we're introducing in terms of capital spends but also as a consequence of the improving productivities that we're getting from equipment. For example, mine fleets getting 30% more hours out of the gear that we have on the ground has been a key part of that improvement as well. And the coal guys have done a fantastic job across both operating cost and capital.
On Kumba. Again, Norman and the guys have had a tough 6 months, as they've been going through their restructuring. At Sishen in particular, we've seen a 31% reduction in employee and contractor numbers. It did absorb considerable time and effort, even more than Norman anticipated, but the good news was that, by June, we were starting to see the numbers improve. And so that's encouraging, but even with all of that restructuring and the bulk of the manpower number still in the half numbers, the breakeven price delivery of $34 a tonne was a good performance under those circumstance. Norman and the team have got a challenge. And then with Themba and Seamus taking on the challenge going forward: it'd be important to continue that improvement, settle the operation and continue that improvement, going to be absolutely critical in making sure that Kumba can be as good as it can be. For me, I'd like to say congratulations to Themba Mkhwanazi. He's done a great job in South African coal. Seamus, I think, has been a champion for Themba and the work he's done. And so we're thrilled to see someone that's done such a good job in coal get the opportunity to take on a big job like Kumba, but with the work that he's done and what he's shown us in coal, we think he will do a great job for Kumba.
At Minas-Rio, the ramp-up continues. Again, Seamus took over the asset a few months back. The focus has been, again, on settling the operation, getting the costs down and working out how we configure and balance the performance and the commissioning consistent with the licensing processes that are in place. Both as a function of -- the Samarco incident, obviously, has made the government far more sensitive on these types of things; and making sure that we've got the mining strategy balanced to what's likely to take a little bit more time on the licensing front. And I think 2 key numbers: the 15 million to 17 million tonne forecast, we think we're well on track with that with the improvements, but the cost performance is the one that from my point of view is the most encouraging. If you look at the unit cost FOB at $32 a tonne wet, our original target at 26 million tonnes was $33 to $35. So the guys have done a great job pulling costs down, getting the overheads down. And they're doing a good job on those costs. We will keep focusing on those costs, and in the course of the next 6 months, we'll have a better understanding of what we should be able to do at 26 million tonne design rate.
Just one item in terms of the licensing process. We've gained an interim approval on the second phase license, which was important for us, so we're able to open up the next few areas, which will make sure that we've got balance and productivity. And we're in that process now. The licensing process, for us, we don't see any technical problems with the facilities or the tailings dam because we're using a very different technology to what was used at Samarco, which was using upstream lifts. Our downstream strategy, which is a -- certainly a very different civil construction, is seen to be probably a favored type of construction for tailings dams. So we've got no indication that people are unhappy with the technology that's being used. So we don't see that in of itself as a risk in the licensing. It really is the process that we have to go through. It's quite a protracted process and become a little more difficult, obviously, since the incident.
Before I go to summary, I did want to make one point. In all of the work we've been doing in the last 3 years, it's been very much about reengineering the way the business works. So it's about business process reengineering and cost reduction. And they are 2 different things. So it's about efficiency, changing the way we operate, getting 30% more out of our equipment, improving our productivities so that our cost reductions and our cost improvements and our business improvements are long-term sustainable. We also believe that innovation is going to play a more significant role in the way we run the business in the next 5 to 10 years. I am not of the view that the industry has hit a wall on cost and efficiency improvement. In fact, I'm of the opposite view that I think we will see a period of time in this industry where there will be more innovation and more step changes in costs because of what we've come through as an industry. So manufacturing-type approaches, which is reflected in our operating model, that's an opportunity that will continue to deliver us beyond 2016. That's item two there. And on the business restructuring, we'll see more contribution from the core assets over time. So that's another area of improvement, but I want to talk about 3 step changes that we've been investing in as a business because, for us, the key to continuing improvement beyond '16 and in particular beyond '17 is about the types of things we've seen in the business.
So great concentration. I'll just explain that in our niobium business we introduced a screening process in front of the main concentrator that took the run-of-mine feed and uprated the grade by 30%. That has helped us improve clearly -- or given us more bang for our buck in the process and improved our recovery and the quality of the recovery in the process. And I think that was also part of why we were able to deliver a good price on the sale, because we got to full capacity pretty quickly and people can see more opportunity to improve because of the new technologies we've put in place. Now that technology and approach is already being applied at Barro Alto in looking at improving our grade from a mining perspective. And there are some improvement potentials there or that type of approach. We see application in copper. We see it in, certainly, the open cut platinum operations. We see it in De Beers. So that's one area of work that Tony, with the group executives, are working on in terms of things that we can do to get a better bang for our buck and improve our costs.
Second, and you'll see a photo of a machine that we've just put underground at Twickenham. It hasn't started cutting yet, Chris, I don't think, but we have been doing some technical development work with Atlas Copco on a rapid mine development system. So for us, the ability to develop more productively is about reducing our costs. And so we think there's great potential in resources like Amandelbult, Der Brochen and Twickenham, those sorts of assets. That'll take some time, but it's a very different approach to what you would have seen some years back in the platinum industry. Still very early, but we are thinking about doing things differently because we know we're going to have to continue to lead in cost reductions and efficiency improvements across the business.
The third area is a bit of a catchall, but it actually picks up 2 key technologies, and it's water consumption. We believe that we can reduce our water consumption per tonne processed in the copper business in Chile by more than 50%. Now for those that have been tracking the Chile industry and the discussions around desalination plants and the massive capital that's being committed to those types of projects, we think there's got to be a better way. So in the last 12 months and in our new open technology platforms, we've been working with a range of partners. We've identified a technology by coarse grinding and then changing the way we float material which is obviously coarser than what you would normally do and then changing the way we process the tailings. We can reduce our water consumption by around 50%. Now that type of technology can be applied in copper, because that's what we've been doing our test work on, but it can be also applied to other environments and other processes. So it could be a platinum issue. It could be Botswana, those areas that are short water. This is a major step. There's a second technology we're now working on where it actually dewaters the material, and we call it interstitial, but it's a technology that also improves water -- or dewatering of product. So ultimately, we are looking to see if we can design mines that don't require wet tailings disposal. So in the next couple of years, this for us is a game changer in copper. Because for us, Los Bronces, Collahuasi, the size of those resources at the moment are constrained by available water. If we can break that, and we're already working out pilots on how we get through the process, that for us is a game changer. And it starts to explain to you why we're keen on copper and why we think our assets in copper have great potential, and Mogalakwena, our diamond assets and beyond. And those technologies are things that I think you will hear a lot more from us and probably, over time, competitors in the industry who may not be where we're up to at the moment. But I think these are going to be game changers. And so I think it's a fallacy when people say innovation and cost reductions aren't going to occur. It will be a matter of who's quickest on the ground and how quickly can -- they can apply those technologies to their operations.
So the main thing I wanted to say, we are not sitting on our bums working simply on cost reductions. It's about efficiencies and about hitting the process and hitting our capital deployment in every way we can to create value.
So finally, in terms of the new Anglo American, the work on the core 
[Audio Gap] 
of the asset. We have restructured the portfolio. And we're 35% smaller in terms of number of assets, but our productivities have more than offset that reduction. And our move to the core portfolio is on track, but we still hold the value imperative front and center in all of our conversation. Positive free cash flow in 2016 at spot prices and FX, we're ahead of targets, and there's a lot more work to be done. In our noncore portfolio of bulks and minerals managed -- being managed for cash and disposal, all of our key assets are back where they should be. One point I'd make is, when we got up in December and we talked about $600 million leakage from those assets that weren't delivering. We've got that down to $200 million, and we're improving that with, for example, the changes with Snap Lake. So that's been an important focus for us, and it will continue to be a focus of improvement for us. And then finally, in terms of net debt, we've made a good start. Still a long way to go, but the fact that we're delivering free cash flow and delivering value from our disposals, the 2 came together to help us hit those targets.
So we've made a good start. It's a solid start. We're happy with the progress, but we're not satisfied with where we are.
So with that, more than happy to take questions."

we haven't changed our fundamental view on where those commodities are; and why we think there will be pressure, particularly on the supply side. So to be quite frank, we are surprised the iron ore price is where it is, and we think there will be pressure on coal as well. And whilst we've got some -- a couple of very good-quality coking coal assets, we think overall coal is impacted by thermal coal. And so we think the supply side is a big issue. So we haven't changed our fundamental view, and therefore we haven't changed the strategy and we remain committed. I think the one thing that really is important, and I mentioned it a bit earlier and I'll say it again, the good news with our results is that the underlying business is performing better and we think we can continue to do better. And therefore, generating free cash flow allows you to hold your value discipline, if I can say it that way. And therefore, as a consequence, it might take longer to realize value from those assets. I think it's far too early to make any changes based on what we've seen in the markets so far. And I think there's still a lot of debt, a lot of risk out there, and we're still very cautious on the commodity sweep. And therefore, we're going to hold the strategy, remain cautious. It might take a bit longer because our values won't diminish and we'll try and make the right call. But so far, I think we've held pretty well to true north on value, and that's where we want to stay. Okay, yes?"

So there are no constraints on mine development for the copper business in developing the operation. So we still got a very tight footprint. We probably are 2 years behind moving. So back in 2011, 2012, we didn't move up there when we should have it, so we're behind in positioning. But now the guys are working. They've improved their productivities. And the snow has made the fact that those areas are tight more difficult. So there's no constraints and it doesn't need more capital. It just needs the consistency. What happened is we then put gear that was bigger than it should have been on the cutbacks to make sure that we delivered copper in the short term when we should have put the smaller gear in so we didn't have any spillover. And that was an incorrect operating decision that we've corrected. It's not a capital issue, it's not a configuration issue. Hold to that discipline, we'll get the numbers. So it was a mistake, operationally, and we take accountability for that, and that's why I've said that the snow made it more difficult, but we didn't make the right call. But it's not a capital issue. Third point, in terms of our values, we have been extremely rigorous in the last couple of years, and I'm not saying we weren't rigorous prior to that, but we've taken some tough views on what we think will happen on supply. We've seen quite different behavior than we've seen in the past on supply, and we've taken that into account, casting [ph] forward iron ore and coal prices, in particular. So we haven't changed that view based on everything we've seen so far. We haven't seen any real changes in behavior and, therefore, the prices that we're using reflect what we see out in the market and the dynamics in the market. So no change at this stage. And certainly, I'd have to be convinced that the dynamics have changed materially. We haven't seen that yet. [indiscernible] by the way, that's the big issue."

Our installed capacity with Gahcho Kué is north of 35 million carats. We will grow production with the market. We believe that the endowment associated with Jwaneng, Orapa, Venetia and those other major assets is significant, and that we've not explored the true potential of those assets, in particular. Now I won't declare anything beyond having a view. And that's the work that Bruce is leading, with Tony and the guys having some very strong views on that, and also from an exploration perspective, in ground positions we hold. So we think there's lots there. But certainly, there's 20% installed capacity. It doesn't require major capital. It's there and we can grow that with the market. And beyond that, we've got significant endowments to work with in the diamond business. So from our point of view, well positioned for the long term in diamonds. Secondly, in platinum, Mogalakwena, Amandelbult, Twickenham, those assets are significant assets that can make a long-term  contribution and have, in of themselves, significant organic growth potential. If I just use Mogalakwena as a simple example -- Chris hates me doing this. But Mogalakwena, over 100 million ounces reserve. We're producing 400,000 ounces a year. In my previous life, in 21 assets, we had 70 million ounces and we were producing 4.5 million ounces. I'm not suggesting that's what we're going to do with Mogalakwena. The platinum industry doesn't need more platinum, but in that resource grouping, we have, by far and away, I think the best platinum industry and, again, market-related lots of opportunities. The key thing is to dominate the left-hand side of the cost curve. I'm more interested in costs and margins and being on the left-hand side of the cost curve. That's where we create opportunity. What I want to do is grow the earnings first, make sure we maintain our capital discipline and then the opportunities will come over, best organic development opportunities in the industry. And that's where that will come. In copper, Collahuasi, Los Bronces, 2 of the best resources in the world; new development discovery in Papua New Guinea; Sakatti, up in Finland; lots of good opportunities emerging. And certainly, with the technology stuff, so that gives us significant potential. So we think we've got a good portfolio that needs work. And one of the things that we'll do over the next couple of years is articulate, but it's probably not the best time to be talking about those sorts of things. I want to put a cap on it. We're not going to run out. Our capital discipline is going to hold, and that's something we've done in the last 3 years. We've not gone crazy, we've not committed a new project other than Gahcho Kué commitment and the exploration vessel, and we're going to hold our discipline because we've got lots of options and lots of things we can do without spending capital. I'll come around. I'll come up to you in the second row."

Remember, we have to move the stones across from before the sites. On Kumba, we have substantially reduced the level of finished goods inventory because of the production shortfall. So we are now at a very low level. In platinum, we probably now at a stable level. There will be some replenishment of finished good inventory and a reduction in the pipeline inventory.

We've not got the 2 longwall moves in the second half, so that makes a big difference in Australian coal. Copper, you'll have seen the numbers so you'll be able to work those numbers out I would've thought fairly quickly. On nickel, we're continuing to improve Barro Alto as we've got full rate. We've had some smaller issues that we resolved, so we expect Barro Alto will do a little bit better. So you've got incremental improvements across the portfolio from a volume perspective and you've also got the continuing impact of the reductions and the work we're doing on the cost side. So I don't think your maths is too bad at all. Sorry, into 2017, the trend continues, and we talked about the $1 billion. So the improvement trends should continue into '17. That's the momentum.

Or if you're suggesting that's completely independent, $1 billion additional, could you potentially give some sort of update in terms of what the bigger initiatives are that you've identified? I appreciate that 6 months ago that was a thumb suck number or a reference number, but obviously there's been ongoing work since then in terms of clarifying that. Second question is just in terms of the disposals and following up on Anna's point about manganese, if you look at the potential sources, there's still a $500 million to $1 billion, $1.5 billion hole versus your full year target of $3 billion to $4 billion. So you've got nickel, potentially, you've got South African coal and you've got manganese, potentially. Where would you -- what's the most likely potential sale? And if you do sell South African coal, would that be contingent on approval from the SARB to be able to repatriate those profits for debt reduction? And then the third thing is just an observation.

You'll see the team is actually in -- or some of the team members are in the audience. But now I've gone from 17 down to 11 direct report. Probably end up with about 9 in the new configuration. I think that reflects a different way of doing things. By the time René turns 60 and is retired, with Norman going into his new role, I think Chris is the only one still in the same role when I started. So the management restructuring has been significant. We've downsized the executive by, I think, it's 45%, by numbers. It'll be at about half where it was. And it's about sharpening the focus. I think that's the first point. Second point, on the costs, we're not going to give detail or a breakdown on the costs, as you probably expected. But what I would say is that in the continuing work with the operating model, we're seeing improvements on a consistent basis. It is reasonable to expect improvements will continue into 2017, and Tony and the guys -- Tony and the executives in Nigeria, have identified a number of things they believe they can deliver as part of that improvement. That's point one. Two, we do get the benefit of new assets making a contribution, Gahcho Kué is an example; and continuing improvements within those businesses, which we do have in the numbers. The third element, the technical stuff is relatively small in its contribution next year. So it's mainly from the stuff that we can see. It wasn't a thumb suck. We'd actually backed that with real opportunities. But to be fair, there are opportunities that had been defined predominantly within the center and now we're in the conversation with the regions, working out where the priorities will be and how we'll deliver against those objectives. So we're already planning that work now, as you would expect us to be, so that we can deliver. So that's a very active process as we speak. In terms of South Africa cash -- or sorry, in terms of the disposal, one major sale we believe would get us to $3 billion. So we all think -- we believe we'll hit the minimum threshold. But again, it has to be subject to value. We would need 2 sales to get to $4 billion, René? And so we've got the processes in place. If we don't get there, it'll be because we've said we can't get there for value. And I'm not scared and we're not scared to stand up and say we haven't sold something because we're not getting the value. So we will know, in terms of where we're heading, by the end of the next quarter, we'll have a very clear view of where we're going to land. So I think that'll be pretty clear because the processes are all doing fairly well and we're happy with the progress. I'm not going to tip which one will go first. You can probably guess where we're more advanced, but the next couple of months will tell those tales. In terms of South Africa cash, we have always assumed that the current arrangements with South Africa would remain in place, and that for us to repatriate funds would simply be a matter of time once the dividend was installed. So we've kept our liquidity, we've kept all of our flexibility on the basis that we now have to repatriate those sums in an appropriate way with the dividends. So we're not concerned about having cash trapped in any positions. There is always an opportunity to have a sit-down with SARB and work something through, and we'll keep that option open and we want to keep a good relationship with the South African government. So we're quite comfortable either way. We can deal with the issues either way. Yes? And then back."

When we first did the value proposition for the major diversified and we talked about what made the major diversifieds major, was their ability to share information and be on the front edge of cost and cost-effective practices. In our case, the operating model, we think, is worth somewhere between 5% and 10% on an operating costs in an apples-for-apples basis and our ability to continue to implement that over time and be competitive. It's about sharing the expectation we've got across the group. We weren't doing that as a group and hadn't been doing it. That's what's changed within the group, and we're sharing these ideas across the group and helping each other with our cost improvements, hence, the more rapid improvement in our cost structures. And that's worth a lot of money. In terms of administration,  when we consolidated De Beers, we said $100 million a year in administration and some support function. But just consolidating the 2 reduced financing costs, supply, administration, IT, whole range of areas across the business. We think it's worth $1.5 billion a year to the group by being the group. And a lot of that stuff, we're working with Bruce at the moment on additional improvements we think we can help the team with. Now the technical innovations, I mean, how do you put a number across the 3 groups on what that cost -- that water innovation technology is worth. And us being 5 years ahead of competitors in trying to get that sort of thing -- I don't know whether that's 3 to 5, but those sort of changes is what we haven't leveraged in the past. That's the value proposition. We think it's worth a lot of money. In talking about copper, in making a decision between a coal asset and a copper asset, Collahuasi is a 70-year asset. How do you value a 70-year copper asset, where we could double or go even further than that in terms of its production potential? Whereas the coals thing, we know, is very clear. We've got the dimensions. The only debate about whether you're getting the right price for coal is actually the pricing assumptions you make. So hence, any deals we're try and to do, we try and put some kickers in there on price because none of us are going to get the price right. So we thought long and hard about what's core. It's around the quality of the assets and, in many cases, we don't think the market appropriately values those assets. Those assets we are selling are assets we think we can price reasonably well in the market. And so far, we have been able to do that. So that's the decision. But we do think there's a compelling reason for being Anglo American. Okay. Go back."

Is $2.5 billion really a sustainable level without the kind of growth projects that could get approved medium term? And then with sort of the Moranbah and Grosvenor impairments, what drove the change in pricing at this point? Why didn't you change your long-term met coal price at the same time as the iron ore price? It seems a bit bizarre. Or is it, to some extent, linked to the sale process? What's sort of the book value sort of at the end of it? And then maybe just lastly on De Beers as well, it would be helpful to get a sense as to where inventories are in the midstream, how financing issues are in the mainstream.

On the $6 billion net debt target, no change. Our view is that in holding and hanging tough on value, I think the important thing is that, that net debt target goes with the configuration at spot prices. And so we haven't changed. That's the logic to get to our 2.5 -- less than 2.5x turn net debt over -- or EBITDA over net debt. The -- the other way around. The key point is the 2.5 is more important to us than the absolute debt figure. I think that's the point we wanted to make. It's actually -- the EBITDA over net debt is the more critical point. Secondly -- sorry, the other way around again. On the EBITDA sustainability, again, we believe with the incremental improvements that we're making, even though we'll probably have some headwinds, we should again be pretty solid in the second half. And beyond that, with the improvements we're continuing to deliver, we think it's a solid number. I won't try and forecast prices. But certainly, from where we are in terms of the controllables, we think we've got the right configuration in the operations. And the incremental improvements we can see will continue to carry us pretty well into the core. On Moranbah, Grosvenor and the price lines in coal, we actually -- we're doing continuous work on our forecasting for commodities, and there's been a lot of work done in coal, in particular, given where we are and thinking about those ratios. And when we come back to the board with a recommendation, that recommendation has to have a pretty well-thought-out view on pricing, as you'd would expect. And as a consequence, on pricing, we've done that work in the last couple of months. We've reflected the view on pricing in the write-down of the asset. René, do you what to add anything to that?"

So we watch carefully what's happening there. But certainly, a lot has moved through the system. We may not be at a balanced position, but it varies depending on the product. So we're being cautious and we're being very flexible with our customers as well, and I think that's the key. Financing of the midstream. It's not surprising banks are becoming tougher on their financing. We've also set some pretty clear requirements of anybody that we do business with. We think, in the long term, it's probably the right thing for the industry. And we're making sure that, again, we're being as flexible as we can be with our partners. So it's not surprising there are some changed faces in the financing side and it probably will continue for some time as things settle down.

We look at the risks associated with those cash flows and, in some cases, a cash flow from an asset or a jurisdiction is very different to different types of assets and what the prognosis is. We look at a range of prices for the commodity in testing how robust those cash flows are and we determine a range of value and a likely value. Again, we don't try and value the assets in someone else's hands. We have a sense of what those assets are worth in our hands and what we think we can do to improve them. But at the same time, again, I think you get into a slippery slope trying to value it in someone else's hands. What's it worth in your hands, I think, is critical. And that's the first point. The second point, which I think people don't consider as much as they should, and certainly something important for us, is what's the opportunity cost of having that capital tied up in that asset compared to the other options you have for that capital within your business. And for us, that's where the arguments are compelling, in the way we're deploying our capital across the group. And we've made a decision about high-quality assets that, over the years, they haven't been getting the support they should have been getting, compared to assets that we've been putting money into that shouldn't have got the money. And if I can say it as bluntly as this, if anybody put their hand up, and this is a little unfair, they got the capital. Not today. It's aggressively competitive, and we look at where is that capital going to work hardest to deliver value to shareholders. So it's the opportunity cost which is a compelling part of the way we think about that capital allocation. I hope that helps."

And we're going to stick with that as a principle in terms of the way we operate. That's point one. Two, in terms of Norman, yes, I think Norman's done really -- or he's taken really hard yards Kumba, done a good job. The major restructuring is done. He and I have been talking about the possibilities for him for the future. He's made the decision on Kumba, and from my perspective, navigating the complexity in South Africa is absolutely critical, and I don't think there's anyone better than Norman to be able to do that for us on the ground. And I think that would -- and we receive great feedback, by the way. It isn't meant to suggest that we're going to package or not package. Our current strategy is to continue on with the process on each of the assets, but we remain very open to possibilities to deliver value for our shareholders. At the same time, it has to work for stakeholders, and including that's for the government. And making sure that we capture that sweet spot, I think, is going to be the key in getting this done the right way from both perspectives. And that's why Norman's on the ground. We want to make sure that we don't drop any balls through the process, and so I think he's the right call. And we remain open to the right opportunities on the basis that it delivers value for all players."

Thank you very much for taking the time to join us today. I know it's a pretty busy day generally in the markets, so we'll try and be as succinct and efficient as we can possibly be, for us.
And today, I'm pleased to announce that we're on track to deliver on all of our full year business targets. And while I'm not suggesting it's going to be easy from here, we've still got lots of challenges and probably a tougher market to navigate during the second half. We're very pleased with the results and what it says about our progress, but at the same time, we're not satisfied with where we are. And I think that's an important point to make.
Today, what I'd like to do is get through the results fairly quickly. I know most of you will have had a little bit of time to see the numbers, and will do during the course of the day, but I think it's important that we'll just put out the key points that we see in the results that we think are important to note. And what we'll also try and do is take you through how we see the balance of the year unfolding and why we believe the foundations that we've put in place should help us continue our improvements into '17 and beyond. So it's not simply about this year. It's about the foundations that we're setting for the longer term and we have been setting for the last 3 years.
So firstly, we remain committed to the establishment of our core portfolio of diamonds, PGMs and copper. And that core portfolio has been built around what we see as world-class assets. Our primary objective is to operate the businesses that are cost competitive -- or operate in businesses that are cost competitive, can generate reliable cash flow through our price cycles while providing longer-term improvement opportunities that can be realized through disciplined capital deployment and efficient operations management. We believe we can further support returns by exercising responsible supply discipline in those markets, in particular, where we have a leadership position. More specifically, I'm pleased to report that the next phase of our business transformation is well underway. We are well ahead of our annual cash flow target with $1.1 billion delivered in the first half, with $2.5 billion EBITDA also tracking ahead of our full year target. As you know, we took some heavy bruises back in the last quarter last year. As Menno said, what a difference 7 months makes, but from our point of view, there is still a long way for us to go. And the way I characterize the results in the first half, it's a positive step. It's an encouraging step. But we're still very cautious, and there's still a lot of work for us to do and for us to carry on with during the balance of this year and into '17 as we do the restructuring. And then beyond that, clearly we've got to continue to improve to remain competitive and improve our positions across all of those selected commodities.
Our strategy to retain liquidity stood us in good stead through probably a most difficult period the end of last year and in the first quarter this year. And I think commodity prices for us were at the bottom in the first quarter. And whilst we are encouraged to see prices improve in a range of areas, we're still not that optimistic in iron ore given the supply situation. The second half, in De Beers, we'll see some, as we normally expect, seasonal changes in sales, but we've certainly been encouraged by what we've seen so far. But in terms of things we can control, we've made good progress.
In terms of portfolio and in terms of the $1.9 billion improvement, we've seen 1.6 -- or we're on track to deliver $1.6 billion of volume and cost improvements. And when we went into the detailed execution planning for the improvement program, we've identified $300 billion in capital and working capital changes that we'll still realize as -- or still be realized in our $1.9 billion. And we'll unpack that a little bit more in the presentation. In terms of disposals or progress on the restructuring or portfolio restructuring, very pleased to announce the niobium, phosphate sale. That went very well. But at the same time, I think it does reflect the quality of the asset; the recent work we've done in that asset, and I'll talk a little bit about some of the technology stuff we did that has application across the broader portfolio; and the fact that we set up competitive bidding processes, and that process was competitively bid. And the result, I think, was a solid one, but at the same time, I also think China Moly has got a good set of assets. So I think we've tried to get that balance right, and so far, we believe that we've done the right thing. And I think they have a very good asset into the bargain.
In terms of net debt, we're down to $11.7 billion. And if I account for the announced disposal proceeds, we'd be at about $10.3 billion. So again, encouraging progress on the net debt target but still some more to do. On our medium-term gearing target of net debt-EBITDA of less than 2.5x, we're already in that range, and that's encouraging. Again, we've got to keep working hard because I think we're getting a little bit of help on both iron ore prices and with FX. And so still a lot to be done, but I think the direction of travel is positive.
To start with safety and the environment. We have had a tough 6 months, regrettably. We've lost 5 (sic) [ 6 ] colleagues in 5 incidents -- I'm just going to get a glass of water. Sorry about that.
So whilst we've improved our safety performance by around 60% in the last 3 years, it really does -- in this sort of restructuring process, we have to keep our eyes very firmly fixed on how relationships are going and what we're doing on the safety front. So we've initiated some clear actions to make sure we pull ourselves back to that improvement record. On the good side or the positive side, we've shown a 21% improvement in our all accident frequency rate, and we have to continue that sort of progress across the board. So good progress in 3 years. Little -- we're very disappointed; tragically, people impacted in the last 6 months. We got to get ourselves back on the rails in terms of that performance.
On environmental performance: continues to be solid. And I think the environmental performance in particular reflects the greater attention to detail and the planning work we've been doing in making sure that we're controlling all of our processes. So improving availability and utilization usually means improving environmental performance because 60% of environmental issues occur in unplanned breakdowns of equipment. So when you're operating a plant and equipment more reliably, you tend to get less environmental issues. And so for us, it's a clear measure. And it's one that I've used since I started in the business and because I think it's also a measure of a whole range of other things in the business, as is safety.
In terms of the operating performance, overall production was broadly in line with the prior year. We're about 1% lower on copper equivalent basis. This was despite pulling back production at De Beers in response to weaker market conditions, while at the same time, we sold 18.3 million carats to De Beers, which was 29% higher than H1 2015. So I think the progress in the work we did in the last half of last year has certainly paid benefits this year. And we're encouraged by what we see in the market still, although we remain cautious. We want to see a bit more before we say that we've dealt with all of the pipeline issue, but so far, so good.
I'd like to make a very important point as part of the production results. You need to remember that the production this year versus last year has been delivered despite downsizing the organization by more than 10%. So from a productivity point of view, it's a more credible performance considering De Beers and the fact that our establishment numbers are lower.
In copper, a little disappointing with Los Bronces being impacted by some very significant dumps of snow. We'll unpack that a little bit later and explain what impact that's had and why we've had to adjust next year's forecast as well. But on the good side, Collahuasi has done very well, and certainly we'd expect them to continue to improve. So that's been a bright side of that story.
Platinum was solid after lower-than-expected refined production in Q1 after stocktake and safety stoppages. But Chris and the team have pulled that back very quickly, so very pleased with the second quarter performance. Mogalakwena continues to be very pleasing. We're up north of 400,000 ounce rates despite -- or in the last 2.5 years, I think we were up almost -- or we're up more than 30% without spending capital. So I think Chris and the guys have done a great job. And it does give some sense of what's possible with the operating model and the good work the team has been doing on a range of fronts. Amandelbult has also begun to turn the corner, and we're quite encouraged with what we're seeing there.
In nickel, Barro Alto is now operating at nameplate capacity. So that was a big jump for us, a big task to get the furnaces right. We've very pleased with the progress there. And you'll see pretty good cost performance there as well.
In coal, the South African operations have continued to perform in line with the plan. And the Australian met coal production was strong despite 2 major longwall moves in the first half. So we'll do a bit better in the second half given I think we may almost sneak through without a longwall move. So really pleased with that. And in fact, Seamus is smiling today. He's just come, just landed back in the country, I think, maybe this morning. And he tells me that, yesterday, Grosvenor produced 30,000 -- 37,000 tonnes, so project has been commissioned 7 months early, under budget and certainly make a significant contribution. I think we'll be careful in annualizing those sorts of numbers. You got to remember you've got longwall moves. And that's a peak number but so early in the commissioning; fantastic job, and really proud of what the guys have done at Grosvenor; and for us, I think, really helps demonstrate where we come from on projects and operations.
So apart from the challenges at Los Bronces and taking into account that the Kumba team has done a lot of restructuring in the first 6 months in dropping manning levels by 31%, a solid operating performance, not as good as we would have liked but most importantly really good work on the cost side. And from our perspective, I'm more concerned and more focused on the costs and margins than we are on the absolute production numbers. And so for us, the most pleasing aspect of our first half performance, and I think this is the key in making sure that we're generating free cash flow, is the operating cost performance. Our overall costs were down 19% compared to this time last year. Yes, we've had help from foreign exchange, but we're also in some reasonably high-inflation jurisdictions as well. So the guys have done a good job, very pleased. And we've seen consistent performance improvement right across the board. And for our -- from our perspective, a 19% cost reduction reflects around about 7% real across all businesses, but it is patchy, depending on how far various parts of the business were in the restructuring. But generally, you're seeing the impact of the hard work that's been done over the last 2.5 to 3 years. So for us, even though we're going through a major restructuring, and it is significant in any scale, the fact that we've been able to hold the costs is pleasing. And it's something that really remains key part of our focus as we go forward.
Now just to put the organization restructuring into perspective. Since 2013, we've reduced our manpower levels down to 120,000. And so we've seen another 6% reduction during the course of the last 6 months. The majority of these reductions have been from restructuring our corporate offices: Kumba, Minas-Rio, coal, ongoing work in platinum in London and Joburg. Based on disposals announced today, phosphates and niobium, Rustenburg, Foxleigh and Callide, we are at a pro forma workforce level of around 98,000. Now that is a 40% reduction from where we were in 2013.  Interestingly, and I'll show this a little later, our actual full production is actually up since 2012, so the productivity improvement is quite dramatic.
Finally, as I've said before, I want people to understand, and in particular my colleagues in South Africa, that we're not announcing anything new today with these reductions. They have been announced before. All we're doing is simply explaining where we are on the restructuring journey. And I think that's an important point to make for those that are watching these things very closely and have been reporting publicly on our program. So nothing new. It's where we are in the process, and we're where we said we'd be.
In terms of the change, I thought one slide would help explain what we've been doing, and this is since the second half of 2013. If I could say, based on what we announced in December and unpacked in February, we are on track to deliver, firstly, a 12% improvement in absolute production across the business since around 2012. And that's despite a 1/3 reduction in the actual operating assets in the business. Now granted some of those assets are small, but when we started, at 68, at the end of 2015. We're down to 45. And with asset disposals already announced, we're down to 42. Second key statistic is that our productivity continues to improve. So as you've reduced the numbers, we've reduced the assets. We've reduced the numbers. We've also restructured and improved our efficiencies. Our workforce numbers will be 40% lower by year-end. And on an apples-for-apples basis, our productivity or production per person employed will be up by 50% by year-end. And that's with disposals already put in place and disposals announced. So when I talk to those figures, I am including niobium, phosphate and Rustenburg. So we get the good with the lower, but at the end of the year, that's about where we'll be in terms of the productivity that's come out of the restructuring over the last 3 years. Now these numbers are being delivered in spite of the pullback in De Beers, due to the market issues, to ensure we're matching our markets; and with only modest early contributions from Minas-Rio, Grosvenor and Gahcho Kué. Now we'll start to see a pickup in those contributions next year, Gahcho Kué obviously, and depending on where we go with assets at Grosvenor.
The third point is, when we talk about cost reductions, yes, we've had some support and help from foreign exchange. But again, when you look at the input inflation numbers in jurisdictions like South Africa, there's been a lot of inflation we've been swimming against in those jurisdictions. But we've reported a U.S. dollar 36% reduction in our operating costs, and these are in nominal terms against where we were in 2012. And that performance improvement -- and that actually reflects the half year number, and we expect to replicate that or be close to replicating that on a full year basis. That's been driven substantially by the productivity improvements but also in other improvements as we get more out of trucks. That also helps reduce our capital as well.
And so that -- I think that chart, more than any other chart, reflects the physical changes in the business and how we're restructuring the portfolio and looking to improve our relative positions across our full commodity sweep.
In terms of the portfolio, as I said, we started around 68 assets, down to 48 -- 45 the end of last year. With sales announced, we're at 42. There is no change to the strategy that we set out in February. In particular on the asset program, and René will lay that out where we are, I'm not going to talk about any individual asset sales, for obvious reasons. We have a process underway, and we'll make announcements only as and when we are in a position to execute. Any sales have to be for value, and I want to stress that point again. The main concern shareholders, people that we work for expressed in our conversations is, ""We support the strategy contingent upon your ability to deliver value from the sales."" Now there's always some debate on what value we may have on an asset, but for us, that is true north. It is about value. It is about having the discipline to hold and make sure we get value for the assets. And so far, we believe we've delivered on that promise. And we believe, with the results for the first half and in particular with the cash flow we've generated, it actually supports us holding to that principle as we go forward.
So with that, let me hand across to René, who will go through the key numbers and the finances. And then I'll pick back up with a bit of a broader summary, okay?
Thanks, René."

Of the $2.5 billion of EBITDA in the",1079,"Thank you, Mark. And good morning, everybody.
We'll start with the highlight for the first half.
EBITDA, down 25%. We'll see, when we go through the reconciliation, the key driver was the decline in commodity prices. Of the $2.5 billion of EBITDA in the first 6 months, $1.4 billion came from the core, which includes platinum, De Beers and copper; and $1.1 billion from noncore. The effective tax rate of 32%, up versus last year at 28%, that reflects the profit mix. For the full year, we expect the level of effective tax rate to be around 32%. CapEx were $1.2 billion compared to $2 billion last year, getting the benefit of the commissioning of a number of projects, Minas-Rio but also Grosvenor, as Mark mentioned earlier, and Gahcho Kué coming onstream in September. We are also getting the benefit of the optimization of SIB CapEx and stripping.
Free cash flow was very strong at $1.1 billion compared to $0.2 billion last year, the benefit of the cash improvement initiatives that we launched at the beginning of the year; the very strong working capital management, we'll see that in one of the slide later in my presentation; and the lower CapEx. Net debt at $11.7 billion but $10.3 billion if you factor the after-tax proceed from niobium and phosphate that we are expecting in September, October. Finally, we recognized a $1.2 billion price-driven impairment on Moranbah and Grosvenor.
Turning to the EBIT reconciliation, $1.9 billion last year coming down to $1.4 billion this year. The key driver was the negative $1.2 billion impact from lower commodity prices. And you see the breakdown between bulks and base -- precious. We also got a smaller positive inventory stock adjustment from platinum, $180 million last year, around $40 million this year. In term of sales volume variance, a positive variance from De Beers. Volume was up 29%. That was offset by lower production at -- in copper due to the very high level of snowfall in the Santiago area but also, in Kumba, lower production as we were through a redesign of the pit. Cash costs were $300 million lower than last year, predominantly in the second quarter of this year -- of the year as we develop our cash improvement initiative in the first quarter of this year. So on track to deliver the $1.6 billion that Mark highlighted earlier in the presentation.
Net debt of $11.7 billion, so a significant reduction compared to 2015 of $12.9 billion, including a $500 million working capital release; as well as a reduction of CapEx, as we saw earlier. We also got the benefit of the liability management exercise that we did back in March. The benefit was $120 million. And we expect further interest cost savings over the next 18 months, around $63 million. And again, if we deduct the $1.4 billion of net disposal proceed, the level of net debt stands at $10.3 billion. That give us a net debt-to-annualized EBITDA of 2.2x if you exclude the niobium and phosphate contribution in the first half this year.
As we announced in December, the dividend has been suspended.
Looking to CapEx for the remainder of the year, we are now guiding between $2.5 billion and $2.7 billion, which mostly reflects the reallocation of $200 million of cost-saving targets to lower deferred stripping. In 2017, we expect CapEx to be lower, to be below $2.5 billion. That only includes the benefit of the disposal which have been announced so far, so just niobium and phosphate.
Turning to working capital management. So the level of working capital at end of 2015 was $3.8 billion. We got the benefit of $700 million of inventory reduction, $0.5 billion coming from De Beers. We sold 18.3 million carat in the first half of this year, while we produced 13.3 million carats. So we -- you'll remember that, at the end of 2015, second half of '15, we substantially reduced the level of supply to the market to help the Sightholders reduce their level of inventory. We were able now to resume the level of supply and reduce the inventory buildup which we had in the second half of 2015. Kumba was able to maintain the level of sales despite the level of -- the lower level of production. And also I want to highlight the platinum level of inventory. We had some issue, as you remember, in the first quarter of this year at the precious metal refinery due to Section 54 interruption. So there was an inventory buildup in the work in progress during earlier this year, and very -- platinum very successfully has been able to ramp up the level of production. And the level of inventory is now back to a normal level.
Debtors was down $200 million. And then we had the impact of the recovery in prices towards the end of the first half, and FX, with the level of working capital at end of June at $3.3 billion.
We have maintained a very strong level of liquidity. You first see the decline in gross debt from $19.8 billion to $17.5 billion, some of that coming from the liability management exercise. The level of maturity is relatively low over the next 18 months, so $900 million this year and $1.9 billion in '17. That's after the impact, taking consideration the impact of the bond buyback that we did in March. And we have maintained a very strong level of liquidity, still in excess of $15 billion. And that's, again, before the benefit of the $1.4 billion of disposal proceed from the sale of niobium and phosphate that we're expecting in September, October.
So we are transitioning to a core portfolio of high-quality asset. We expect the transaction which have been announced, so Rustenburg, the Australian coal assets and niobium and phosphate, to be completed in the second half of this year. And as Mark has already said, we don't comment on the individual asset sale. Processes are underway.
So in term of a wrap-up. We maintain our commitment, whether it's in term of net debt targets, so well on track to have a level of net debt below $10 billion; comfortable with our EBITDA guidance of $4.8 billion at spot.
[Audio Gap]
again on track to deliver the $1.6 billion, CapEx below -- between $2.5 billion and $2.7 billion and attributable free cash flow well above the $1 billion number.
Back to Mark."

Chris and the guys have done a great job. They're continuing to restructure and reduce our cost base, and that process has been a tough one. As each month go",3617,"Thanks, René.
Okay, so just to go straight into the operating summaries.
Firstly, in platinum. Chris and the guys have done a great job. They're continuing to restructure and reduce our cost base, and that process has been a tough one. As each month goes by, we're tightening in all parts of the business. I'd have to say the performance at Mogalakwena has been really pleasing in the way the guys have brought the potential of that asset through. And I think in many ways we're still only starting to just get our arms around what's possible, and I've got to reflect great credit to Chris and the guys for the good work they've done there. We've also been working hard to make sure that we set up Rustenburg and Union for success post disposal. That's important to us. In Rustenburg's case, the sectional-level approval is our last significant milestone that will be done. And that process is substantially in our colleagues' hands with Sibanye, in the way they're structured the BEE proposals. And they're in dialogue with the department. And so we've made good progress. But we do have to be patient in this process, particularly for an asset like Rustenburg where you have that complexity. Going forward, I think, the focus the team has on capital and cost discipline, that's the heart of the business and the changes that have been made and in Chris's tenure as we've gone forward. And certainly from our point of view, we regard the assets that we have to work with as the best in the industry, and we're now starting to really understand what potential we have in terms of continuous improvement like what they've done and the hard work that they've done.
In De Beers, we have a new CEO in the building. Bruce Cleaver is here. And he's hit the ground running. So congratulations to Bruce. We are very pleased to report an encouraging rebound in the first half diamond sales; supported by the decisive actions we took to pull back on rough production and sales in the second half of 2015, I think a very important process and also a process where I think -- which I think has brought us much closer to our Sightholders but still a lot of work to be done as we make sure that we understand their sensitivities and issues and make sure that we really are partners with both them and the countries in which we work. Based on the latest data we're seeing in U.S. sales, they've been reasonably solid. Although, other sales around the global are mixed, reflecting differences in FX rates and on specific issues in local markets. We believe, based on the mix of data, it is prudent to remain cautious in terms of the outlook for diamonds. And I think, from our point of view, that's the appropriate way to think about and work within the business. In terms of our performance, clearly, sensitivity to the market is our first priority, in addition to controlling what we can control. We still expect the usual seasonality on sales, and so it is very likely our second half sales will be lower than our first half sales. The next couple of sites will also help us understand the pipeline balance and where we need to focus with customers to get our demand-supply balanced right. And that's a big task for Bruce but certainly one that I've had great feedback from Sightholders specifically on the way he's interacting and working with all of the team players. And in fact, he's just come back from Botswana, and we've had some very, very constructive conversations with our partners.
We've also made encouraging progress on cost reductions. So Snap Lake was removed from the mix at the end of 2015. That was a tough call. The recent confirmation by the government that we can flood the mine, which in that environment is actually the right thing to do from an environmental perspective, that actually reduces our annual maintenance cost by $50 million a year, so that's a very important approval for us to receive and allows us to maintain the asset at a nominal maintenance cost on an annual basis. And again, there is still the potential to access the asset longer term, but it also minimizes our costs in the short term. So we think that's been a good outcome. And the cooperation and work with the government -- the Canadian government, has been very constructive. And I've got to acknowledge their approach and the team for doing good work on the ground.
In terms of copper. We've had a tough 12 months in copper with droughts in 2015, followed by record snowfalls. And then being hit by early and record snows in 2016 at Los Bronces, it's been a tough 12 months. Now I'll deal more specifically with Los Bronces in a minute. It's not simply about snowfall. We made a couple of poor decisions in equipment selection that have impacted the outcome, but that's been corrected, and I'll just speak to that in a second. At El Soldado, we've turned the corner. We were originally forecasting a potential $100 million cash loss when we looked at spot prices back in December. We've adjusted the mining strategy. We've restructured and lower the manning levels at the site, and so today we actually were cash positive in the first 6 months. So I think Duncan and the team has done a great job in recalibrating and getting El Soldado in the right place, so that's been a good performance. And while we remain under pressure with some tight mining areas at Los Bronces, the team has done a great job in terms of its cost management. And you can see in terms of the performance that, despite the volume pressures, the cost reductions predominantly have helped us improve our performance. And that's where the real focus has been, so as we continue to improve and get Los Bronces back to where it needs to be, we should continue doing -- to improve that performance. But that will be more in the second half of '17, but certainly the focus on costs will continue. And I've been very encouraged. And I think the guys have done a good job in certainly improving the operations, and there's a lot more we can do.
And acknowledging Collahuasi's good performance. It's been very solid. We've been very happy. The cooperation with our partner has been good. Whilst we don't have the operating model which we think would help us improve or quicken the rate of change, we're certainly very pleased with the relationship and the way we've been working together on the improvements at Collahuasi.
On Los Bronces specifically. And I won't say much other than to give you a sense of the snow and some of the tight areas in the right-hand picture that we've been working in. We used gear that was probably a bit bigger than it should have been to take out some of the areas, and that's impacted our ability to access high grade. And it's been pushed some months back. The good news is the pit configuration is right. We've not done anything to damage the integrity, but the sequencing will have to take a bit longer to get to that high grade, which will impact the balance of this year, which we picked up in the guidance numbers, and early in '17. And then we start to get that back into shape. So again, the snow has been the big issue. We lost some of our flexibility with the snows at the end of '15. And then when we had the early dumps in '16, we actually impacted our ability to access, which we made a little bit worse by making a couple of bad choices on equipment. That's been corrected. Both Duncan and Tony have been working with the team. So I think a few lessons have been learned there. And we'll pull that back but overall very happy with the cost performance of the operation and more improvements to be had.
At nickel, the turnaround at Barro Alto has underpinned an aggressive improvement -- cost improvement story as we continue to work the asset towards its potential. In the nickel industry, good news stories have been a little hard to find over the last few years, and in my view, Barro Alto has been one of the good news stories in the industry. And certainly very pleased with what the team's done. Ruben and the guys have done a great job. And certainly happy with the progress they've made. And they're doing a good job in the operations, and that's been very pleasing.
On coal, Seamus and the team continue to do a great job. Whilst we get rather sick of talking about the improvements that have been delivered, Seamus and the guys have again improved on their productivities and costs, maybe not as dramatic as what we saw 2 years ago but the basis certainly improved. And I've got to give great credit to the work that's been done. And as I said, Grosvenor, 7 months early, under budget and continuing to prove the operations. The other point I would make, and this goes across the board but in particular with coal, we're not only improving our operating costs. We're improving our capital costs as a consequence of the efficiencies in development and the other activities that we're driving across the business. So our capital numbers are improving both as a -- the -- as a reflection of the disciplines that we're introducing in terms of capital spends but also as a consequence of the improving productivities that we're getting from equipment. For example, mine fleets getting 30% more hours out of the gear that we have on the ground has been a key part of that improvement as well. And the coal guys have done a fantastic job across both operating cost and capital.
On Kumba. Again, Norman and the guys have had a tough 6 months, as they've been going through their restructuring. At Sishen in particular, we've seen a 31% reduction in employee and contractor numbers. It did absorb considerable time and effort, even more than Norman anticipated, but the good news was that, by June, we were starting to see the numbers improve. And so that's encouraging, but even with all of that restructuring and the bulk of the manpower number still in the half numbers, the breakeven price delivery of $34 a tonne was a good performance under those circumstance. Norman and the team have got a challenge. And then with Themba and Seamus taking on the challenge going forward: it'd be important to continue that improvement, settle the operation and continue that improvement, going to be absolutely critical in making sure that Kumba can be as good as it can be. For me, I'd like to say congratulations to Themba Mkhwanazi. He's done a great job in South African coal. Seamus, I think, has been a champion for Themba and the work he's done. And so we're thrilled to see someone that's done such a good job in coal get the opportunity to take on a big job like Kumba, but with the work that he's done and what he's shown us in coal, we think he will do a great job for Kumba.
At Minas-Rio, the ramp-up continues. Again, Seamus took over the asset a few months back. The focus has been, again, on settling the operation, getting the costs down and working out how we configure and balance the performance and the commissioning consistent with the licensing processes that are in place. Both as a function of -- the Samarco incident, obviously, has made the government far more sensitive on these types of things; and making sure that we've got the mining strategy balanced to what's likely to take a little bit more time on the licensing front. And I think 2 key numbers: the 15 million to 17 million tonne forecast, we think we're well on track with that with the improvements, but the cost performance is the one that from my point of view is the most encouraging. If you look at the unit cost FOB at $32 a tonne wet, our original target at 26 million tonnes was $33 to $35. So the guys have done a great job pulling costs down, getting the overheads down. And they're doing a good job on those costs. We will keep focusing on those costs, and in the course of the next 6 months, we'll have a better understanding of what we should be able to do at 26 million tonne design rate.
Just one item in terms of the licensing process. We've gained an interim approval on the second phase license, which was important for us, so we're able to open up the next few areas, which will make sure that we've got balance and productivity. And we're in that process now. The licensing process, for us, we don't see any technical problems with the facilities or the tailings dam because we're using a very different technology to what was used at Samarco, which was using upstream lifts. Our downstream strategy, which is a -- certainly a very different civil construction, is seen to be probably a favored type of construction for tailings dams. So we've got no indication that people are unhappy with the technology that's being used. So we don't see that in of itself as a risk in the licensing. It really is the process that we have to go through. It's quite a protracted process and become a little more difficult, obviously, since the incident.
Before I go to summary, I did want to make one point. In all of the work we've been doing in the last 3 years, it's been very much about reengineering the way the business works. So it's about business process reengineering and cost reduction. And they are 2 different things. So it's about efficiency, changing the way we operate, getting 30% more out of our equipment, improving our productivities so that our cost reductions and our cost improvements and our business improvements are long-term sustainable. We also believe that innovation is going to play a more significant role in the way we run the business in the next 5 to 10 years. I am not of the view that the industry has hit a wall on cost and efficiency improvement. In fact, I'm of the opposite view that I think we will see a period of time in this industry where there will be more innovation and more step changes in costs because of what we've come through as an industry. So manufacturing-type approaches, which is reflected in our operating model, that's an opportunity that will continue to deliver us beyond 2016. That's item two there. And on the business restructuring, we'll see more contribution from the core assets over time. So that's another area of improvement, but I want to talk about 3 step changes that we've been investing in as a business because, for us, the key to continuing improvement beyond '16 and in particular beyond '17 is about the types of things we've seen in the business.
So great concentration. I'll just explain that in our niobium business we introduced a screening process in front of the main concentrator that took the run-of-mine feed and uprated the grade by 30%. That has helped us improve clearly -- or given us more bang for our buck in the process and improved our recovery and the quality of the recovery in the process. And I think that was also part of why we were able to deliver a good price on the sale, because we got to full capacity pretty quickly and people can see more opportunity to improve because of the new technologies we've put in place. Now that technology and approach is already being applied at Barro Alto in looking at improving our grade from a mining perspective. And there are some improvement potentials there or that type of approach. We see application in copper. We see it in, certainly, the open cut platinum operations. We see it in De Beers. So that's one area of work that Tony, with the group executives, are working on in terms of things that we can do to get a better bang for our buck and improve our costs.
Second, and you'll see a photo of a machine that we've just put underground at Twickenham. It hasn't started cutting yet, Chris, I don't think, but we have been doing some technical development work with Atlas Copco on a rapid mine development system. So for us, the ability to develop more productively is about reducing our costs. And so we think there's great potential in resources like Amandelbult, Der Brochen and Twickenham, those sorts of assets. That'll take some time, but it's a very different approach to what you would have seen some years back in the platinum industry. Still very early, but we are thinking about doing things differently because we know we're going to have to continue to lead in cost reductions and efficiency improvements across the business.
The third area is a bit of a catchall, but it actually picks up 2 key technologies, and it's water consumption. We believe that we can reduce our water consumption per tonne processed in the copper business in Chile by more than 50%. Now for those that have been tracking the Chile industry and the discussions around desalination plants and the massive capital that's being committed to those types of projects, we think there's got to be a better way. So in the last 12 months and in our new open technology platforms, we've been working with a range of partners. We've identified a technology by coarse grinding and then changing the way we float material which is obviously coarser than what you would normally do and then changing the way we process the tailings. We can reduce our water consumption by around 50%. Now that type of technology can be applied in copper, because that's what we've been doing our test work on, but it can be also applied to other environments and other processes. So it could be a platinum issue. It could be Botswana, those areas that are short water. This is a major step. There's a second technology we're now working on where it actually dewaters the material, and we call it interstitial, but it's a technology that also improves water -- or dewatering of product. So ultimately, we are looking to see if we can design mines that don't require wet tailings disposal. So in the next couple of years, this for us is a game changer in copper. Because for us, Los Bronces, Collahuasi, the size of those resources at the moment are constrained by available water. If we can break that, and we're already working out pilots on how we get through the process, that for us is a game changer. And it starts to explain to you why we're keen on copper and why we think our assets in copper have great potential, and Mogalakwena, our diamond assets and beyond. And those technologies are things that I think you will hear a lot more from us and probably, over time, competitors in the industry who may not be where we're up to at the moment. But I think these are going to be game changers. And so I think it's a fallacy when people say innovation and cost reductions aren't going to occur. It will be a matter of who's quickest on the ground and how quickly can -- they can apply those technologies to their operations.
So the main thing I wanted to say, we are not sitting on our bums working simply on cost reductions. It's about efficiencies and about hitting the process and hitting our capital deployment in every way we can to create value.
So finally, in terms of the new Anglo American, the work on the core 
[Audio Gap] 
of the asset. We have restructured the portfolio. And we're 35% smaller in terms of number of assets, but our productivities have more than offset that reduction. And our move to the core portfolio is on track, but we still hold the value imperative front and center in all of our conversation. Positive free cash flow in 2016 at spot prices and FX, we're ahead of targets, and there's a lot more work to be done. In our noncore portfolio of bulks and minerals managed -- being managed for cash and disposal, all of our key assets are back where they should be. One point I'd make is, when we got up in December and we talked about $600 million leakage from those assets that weren't delivering. We've got that down to $200 million, and we're improving that with, for example, the changes with Snap Lake. So that's been an important focus for us, and it will continue to be a focus of improvement for us. And then finally, in terms of net debt, we've made a good start. Still a long way to go, but the fact that we're delivering free cash flow and delivering value from our disposals, the 2 came together to help us hit those targets.
So we've made a good start. It's a solid start. We're happy with the progress, but we're not satisfied with where we are.
So with that, more than happy to take questions."

we haven't changed our fundamental view on where those commodities are; and why we think there will be pressure, particularly on the supply side. So to be quite frank, we are surprised the iron ore price is where it is, and we think there will be pressure on coal as well. And whilst we've got some -- a couple of very good-quality coking coal assets, we think overall coal is impacted by thermal coal. And so we think the supply side is a big issue. So we haven't changed our fundamental view, and therefore we haven't changed the strategy and we remain committed. I think the one thing that really is important, and I mentioned it a bit earlier and I'll say it again, the good news with our results is that the underlying business is performing better and we think we can continue to do better. And therefore, generating free cash flow allows you to hold your value discipline, if I can say it that way. And therefore, as a consequence, it might take longer to realize value from those assets. I think it's far too early to make any changes based on what we've seen in the markets so far. And I think there's still a lot of debt, a lot of risk out there, and we're still very cautious on the commodity sweep. And therefore, we're going to hold the strategy, remain cautious. It might take a bit longer because our values won't diminish and we'll try and make the right call. But so far, I think we've held pretty well to true north on value, and that's where we want to stay. Okay, yes?"

So there are no constraints on mine development for the copper business in developing the operation. So we still got a very tight footprint. We probably are 2 years behind moving. So back in 2011, 2012, we didn't move up there when we should have it, so we're behind in positioning. But now the guys are working. They've improved their productivities. And the snow has made the fact that those areas are tight more difficult. So there's no constraints and it doesn't need more capital. It just needs the consistency. What happened is we then put gear that was bigger than it should have been on the cutbacks to make sure that we delivered copper in the short term when we should have put the smaller gear in so we didn't have any spillover. And that was an incorrect operating decision that we've corrected. It's not a capital issue, it's not a configuration issue. Hold to that discipline, we'll get the numbers. So it was a mistake, operationally, and we take accountability for that, and that's why I've said that the snow made it more difficult, but we didn't make the right call. But it's not a capital issue. Third point, in terms of our values, we have been extremely rigorous in the last couple of years, and I'm not saying we weren't rigorous prior to that, but we've taken some tough views on what we think will happen on supply. We've seen quite different behavior than we've seen in the past on supply, and we've taken that into account, casting [ph] forward iron ore and coal prices, in particular. So we haven't changed that view based on everything we've seen so far. We haven't seen any real changes in behavior and, therefore, the prices that we're using reflect what we see out in the market and the dynamics in the market. So no change at this stage. And certainly, I'd have to be convinced that the dynamics have changed materially. We haven't seen that yet. [indiscernible] by the way, that's the big issue."

Our installed capacity with Gahcho Kué is north of 35 million carats. We will grow production with the market. We believe that the endowment associated with Jwaneng, Orapa, Venetia and those other major assets is significant, and that we've not explored the true potential of those assets, in particular. Now I won't declare anything beyond having a view. And that's the work that Bruce is leading, with Tony and the guys having some very strong views on that, and also from an exploration perspective, in ground positions we hold. So we think there's lots there. But certainly, there's 20% installed capacity. It doesn't require major capital. It's there and we can grow that with the market. And beyond that, we've got significant endowments to work with in the diamond business. So from our point of view, well positioned for the long term in diamonds. Secondly, in platinum, Mogalakwena, Amandelbult, Twickenham, those assets are significant assets that can make a long-term  contribution and have, in of themselves, significant organic growth potential. If I just use Mogalakwena as a simple example -- Chris hates me doing this. But Mogalakwena, over 100 million ounces reserve. We're producing 400,000 ounces a year. In my previous life, in 21 assets, we had 70 million ounces and we were producing 4.5 million ounces. I'm not suggesting that's what we're going to do with Mogalakwena. The platinum industry doesn't need more platinum, but in that resource grouping, we have, by far and away, I think the best platinum industry and, again, market-related lots of opportunities. The key thing is to dominate the left-hand side of the cost curve. I'm more interested in costs and margins and being on the left-hand side of the cost curve. That's where we create opportunity. What I want to do is grow the earnings first, make sure we maintain our capital discipline and then the opportunities will come over, best organic development opportunities in the industry. And that's where that will come. In copper, Collahuasi, Los Bronces, 2 of the best resources in the world; new development discovery in Papua New Guinea; Sakatti, up in Finland; lots of good opportunities emerging. And certainly, with the technology stuff, so that gives us significant potential. So we think we've got a good portfolio that needs work. And one of the things that we'll do over the next couple of years is articulate, but it's probably not the best time to be talking about those sorts of things. I want to put a cap on it. We're not going to run out. Our capital discipline is going to hold, and that's something we've done in the last 3 years. We've not gone crazy, we've not committed a new project other than Gahcho Kué commitment and the exploration vessel, and we're going to hold our discipline because we've got lots of options and lots of things we can do without spending capital.

The thing is, so I said in real terms, our 7% reduction has been really pleasing across the group and we've absorbed a lot of internal inflation in South Africa and other places. But as I said, we've had some pretty good help. But I think the productivity number, for me, is the most important one, is that 40% improvement tells you how much we've done at the cost improvement level. But we'll take the help where we can get it. Secondly, on disposals, the focus for us is value. It may take a little bit longer. In our case -- I'm sorry, just on that point?"

Remember, we have to move the stones across from before the sites. On Kumba, we have substantially reduced the level of finished goods inventory because of the production shortfall. So we are now at a very low level. In platinum, we probably now at a stable level. There will be some replenishment of finished good inventory and a reduction in the pipeline inventory. So overall, we should be relatively stable at the end of the year. So don't expect a reversal of what we have generated in the first half of this year."

We've not got the 2 longwall moves in the second half, so that makes a big difference in Australian coal. Copper, you'll have seen the numbers so you'll be able to work those numbers out I would've thought fairly quickly. On nickel, we're continuing to improve Barro Alto as we've got full rate. We've had some smaller issues that we resolved, so we expect Barro Alto will do a little bit better. So you've got incremental improvements across the portfolio from a volume perspective and you've also got the continuing impact of the reductions and the work we're doing on the cost side. So I don't think your maths is too bad at all. Sorry, into 2017, the trend continues, and we talked about the $1 billion. So the improvement trends should continue into '17. That's the momentum.

Or if you're suggesting that's completely independent, $1 billion additional, could you potentially give some sort of update in terms of what the bigger initiatives are that you've identified? I appreciate that 6 months ago that was a thumb suck number or a reference number, but obviously there's been ongoing work since then in terms of clarifying that. Second question is just in terms of the disposals and following up on Anna's point about manganese, if you look at the potential sources, there's still a $500 million to $1 billion, $1.5 billion hole versus your full year target of $3 billion to $4 billion. So you've got nickel, potentially, you've got South African coal and you've got manganese, potentially. Where would you -- what's the most likely potential sale? And if you do sell South African coal, would that be contingent on approval from the SARB to be able to repatriate those profits for debt reduction? And then the third thing is just an observation. Do you think the simplification of the business has maybe gone too far, judging by today's front row?"

You'll see the team is actually in -- or some of the team members are in the audience. But now I've gone from 17 down to 11 direct report. Probably end up with about 9 in the new configuration. I think that reflects a different way of doing things. By the time René turns 60 and is retired, with Norman going into his new role, I think Chris is the only one still in the same role when I started. So the management restructuring has been significant. We've downsized the executive by, I think, it's 45%, by numbers. It'll be at about half where it was. And it's about sharpening the focus. I think that's the first point. Second point, on the costs, we're not going to give detail or a breakdown on the costs, as you probably expected. But what I would say is that in the continuing work with the operating model, we're seeing improvements on a consistent basis. It is reasonable to expect improvements will continue into 2017, and Tony and the guys -- Tony and the executives in Nigeria, have identified a number of things they believe they can deliver as part of that improvement. That's point one. Two, we do get the benefit of new assets making a contribution, Gahcho Kué is an example; and continuing improvements within those businesses, which we do have in the numbers. The third element, the technical stuff is relatively small in its contribution next year. So it's mainly from the stuff that we can see. It wasn't a thumb suck. We'd actually backed that with real opportunities. But to be fair, there are opportunities that had been defined predominantly within the center and now we're in the conversation with the regions, working out where the priorities will be and how we'll deliver against those objectives. So we're already planning that work now, as you would expect us to be, so that we can deliver. So that's a very active process as we speak. In terms of South Africa cash -- or sorry, in terms of the disposal, one major sale we believe would get us to $3 billion. So we all think -- we believe we'll hit the minimum threshold. But again, it has to be subject to value. We would need 2 sales to get to $4 billion, René? And so we've got the processes in place. If we don't get there, it'll be because we've said we can't get there for value. And I'm not scared and we're not scared to stand up and say we haven't sold something because we're not getting the value. So we will know, in terms of where we're heading, by the end of the next quarter, we'll have a very clear view of where we're going to land. So I think that'll be pretty clear because the processes are all doing fairly well and we're happy with the progress. I'm not going to tip which one will go first. You can probably guess where we're more advanced, but the next couple of months will tell those tales. In terms of South Africa cash, we have always assumed that the current arrangements with South Africa would remain in place, and that for us to repatriate funds would simply be a matter of time once the dividend was installed. So we've kept our liquidity, we've kept all of our flexibility on the basis that we now have to repatriate those sums in an appropriate way with the dividends. So we're not concerned about having cash trapped in any positions. There is always an opportunity to have a sit-down with SARB and work something through, and we'll keep that option open and we want to keep a good relationship with the South African government. So we're quite comfortable either way. We can deal with the issues either way. Yes? And then back."

When we first did the value proposition for the major diversified and we talked about what made the major diversifieds major, was their ability to share information and be on the front edge of cost and cost-effective practices. In our case, the operating model, we think, is worth somewhere between 5% and 10% on an operating costs in an apples-for-apples basis and our ability to continue to implement that over time and be competitive. It's about sharing the expectation we've got across the group. We weren't doing that as a group and hadn't been doing it. That's what's changed within the group, and we're sharing these ideas across the group and helping each other with our cost improvements, hence, the more rapid improvement in our cost structures. And that's worth a lot of money. In terms of administration,  when we consolidated De Beers, we said $100 million a year in administration and some support function. But just consolidating the 2 reduced financing costs, supply, administration, IT, whole range of areas across the business. We think it's worth $1.5 billion a year to the group by being the group. And a lot of that stuff, we're working with Bruce at the moment on additional improvements we think we can help the team with. Now the technical innovations, I mean, how do you put a number across the 3 groups on what that cost -- that water innovation technology is worth. And us being 5 years ahead of competitors in trying to get that sort of thing -- I don't know whether that's 3 to 5, but those sort of changes is what we haven't leveraged in the past. That's the value proposition. We think it's worth a lot of money. In talking about copper, in making a decision between a coal asset and a copper asset, Collahuasi is a 70-year asset. How do you value a 70-year copper asset, where we could double or go even further than that in terms of its production potential? Whereas the coals thing, we know, is very clear. We've got the dimensions. The only debate about whether you're getting the right price for coal is actually the pricing assumptions you make. So hence, any deals we try and do, we try and put some kickers in there on price because none of us are going to get the price right. So we thought long and hard about what's core. It's around the quality of the assets and, in many cases, we don't think the market appropriately values those assets. Those assets we are selling are assets we think we can price reasonably well in the market. And so far, we have been able to do that. So that's the decision. But we do think there's a compelling reason for being Anglo American. Okay. Go back."

And then with sort of the Moranbah and Grosvenor impairments, what drove the change in pricing at this point?

On the $6 billion net debt target, no change. Our view is that in holding and hanging tough on value, I think the important thing is that, that net debt target goes with the configuration at spot prices. And so we haven't changed. That's the logic to get to our 2.5 -- less than 2.5x turn net debt over -- or EBITDA over net debt. The -- the other way around. The key point is the 2.5 is more important to us than the absolute debt figure. I think that's the point we wanted to make. It's actually -- the EBITDA over net debt is the more critical point. Secondly -- sorry, the other way around again. On the EBITDA sustainability, again, we believe with the incremental improvements that we're making, even though we'll probably have some headwinds, we should again be pretty solid in the second half. And beyond that, with the improvements we're continuing to deliver, we think it's a solid number. I won't try and forecast prices. But certainly, from where we are in terms of the controllables, we think we've got the right configuration in the operations. And the incremental improvements we can see will continue to carry us pretty well into the core. On Moranbah, Grosvenor and the price lines in coal, we actually -- we're doing continuous work on our forecasting for commodities, and there's been a lot of work done in coal, in particular, given where we are and thinking about those ratios. And when we come back to the board with a recommendation, that recommendation has to have a pretty well-thought-out view on pricing, as you'd would expect. And as a consequence, on pricing, we've done that work in the last couple of months. We've reflected the view on pricing in the write-down of the asset. René, do you what to add anything to that?"

So we watch carefully what's happening there. But certainly, a lot has moved through the system. We may not be at a balanced position, but it varies depending on the product. So we're being cautious and we're being very flexible with our customers as well, and I think that's the key. Financing of the midstream. It's not surprising banks are becoming tougher on their financing. We've also set some pretty clear requirements of anybody that we do business with. We think, in the long term, it's probably the right thing for the industry. And we're making sure that, again, we're being as flexible as we can be with our partners. So it's not surprising there are some changed faces in the financing side and it probably will continue for some time as things settle down. But what we want is a healthy, long-term vibrant industry, and those issues need to be resolved. But we've seen pretty good progress. Bruce, anything else?"

Just wanted to ask you a little bit more about how you define value. In this market, no one wants to overpay for an asset. You've shown with your coking coal assets as well, valuations change as you write down and impair the book values of assets. So how do you define the asset? How do you leave value for your customer -- or for the purchaser of your assets so that there's a win-win situation? Do you look at the value and use that they derive from acquiring the assets that may serve to offer them synergies that you can see?"

We look at the risks associated with those cash flows and, in some cases, a cash flow",346,"Look, we look at value as being the financial value in our hands in terms of what we think we can realize in terms of cash flow from that business on a go-forward basis. We look at the risks associated with those cash flows and, in some cases, a cash flow from an asset or a jurisdiction is very different to different types of assets and what the prognosis is. We look at a range of prices for the commodity in testing how robust those cash flows are and we determine a range of value and a likely value. Again, we don't try and value the assets in someone else's hands. We have a sense of what those assets are worth in our hands and what we think we can do to improve them. But at the same time, again, I think you get into a slippery slope trying to value it in someone else's hands. What's it worth in your hands, I think, is critical. And that's the first point. The second point, which I think people don't consider as much as they should, and certainly something important for us, is what's the opportunity cost of having that capital tied up in that asset compared to the other options you have for that capital within your business. And for us, that's where the arguments are compelling, in the way we're deploying our capital across the group. And we've made a decision about high-quality assets that, over the years, they haven't been getting the support they should have been getting, compared to assets that we've been putting money into that shouldn't have got the money. And if I can say it as bluntly as this, if anybody put their hand up, and this is a little unfair, they got the capital. Not today. It's aggressively competitive, and we look at where is that capital going to work hardest to deliver value to shareholders. So it's the opportunity cost which is a compelling part of the way we think about that capital allocation. I hope that helps."

The first one being on the Eskom coal business or domestic coal business. A lot of rhetoric out of Eskom, not just you guys but others as well, about those assets, those types of operations, those types of relationships. How would you characterize Anglo's relationship with Eskom in terms of those operations at the moment? And how do you see what looks to be pretty much an impasse or not certainly a meeting of the minds, how do you see that panning out in respect of those particular operations? Because it just feels like disposing of them is going to be very, very difficult given the different views on either side there? And then secondly, I think moving Norman to oversee the South African disposals as a package is probably a great move. But does it also suggest, perhaps, that -- and again, given the sort of common complexities across all of those assets, be it BEE or the South Africa-specific issues, does it kind of also suggest that maybe these assets are more likely now to be exited from the group as some sort of package rather than individual?"

Firstly, on Eskom, based on the direct conversations with Eskom, we believe we've got a good relationship. One might think that might not be the case based on the public conversations, but what we don't do is we will not engage in a public conversation around the assets, period. Based on the conversations we're in, it is constructive. It is a little bit different to see people negotiate in the press. We don't intend to do it. We'll keep the conversations direct, and I'm sure that we'll land some way that works for us and that works for all of our stakeholders, and that's the objective we have. And we're going to stick with that as a principle in terms of the way we operate. That's point one. Two, in terms of Norman, yes, I think Norman's done really -- or he's taken really hard yards Kumba, done a good job. The major restructuring is done. He and I have been talking about the possibilities for him for the future. He's made the decision on Kumba, and from my perspective, navigating the complexity in South Africa is absolutely critical, and I don't think there's anyone better than Norman to be able to do that for us on the ground. And I think that would -- and we receive great feedback, by the way. It isn't meant to suggest that we're going to package or not package. Our current strategy is to continue on with the process on each of the assets, but we remain very open to possibilities to deliver value for our shareholders. At the same time, it has to work for stakeholders, and including that's for the government. And making sure that we capture that sweet spot, I think, is going to be the key in getting this done the right way from both perspectives. And that's why Norman's on the ground. We want to make sure that we don't drop any balls through the process, and so I think he's the right call. And we remain open to the right opportunities on the basis that it delivers value for all players."

We still have a lot of potential to improve the utilization of the assets on the ground. And it remains a great opportunity for us to improve. And the amount of capital that we've cut out of the business, that doesn't need to be spent, is significant. We think $2.5 billion is a good starting point.
