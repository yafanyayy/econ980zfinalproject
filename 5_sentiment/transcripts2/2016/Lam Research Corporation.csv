I will first begin with a review of our calendar 2015 accomplishments, including comments on the relevance to the growth outperformance opportunities for the company, then offer a perspective on",2102,"Thank you, Satya, and thank you, all, for joining us today. I will first begin with a review of our calendar 2015 accomplishments, including comments on the relevance to the growth outperformance opportunities for the company, then offer a perspective on wafer fab equipment spending in 2016 as well as the trends driving our longer-term favorable outlook. Concluding my prepared comments with a progress update on our planned business combination with KLA-Tencor. Doug will then review our financial and operational performance as well as provide guidance for the March 2016 quarter.
2015 was another record year for Lam Research, augmented by our plan to combine with KLA-Tencor this year. A partnership that we believe will create an unmatched capability for the global semiconductor industry by uniting best-in-class process technologies with process control, creating a new paradigm in process enablement, accelerating innovation for the benefit of our customers.
Last year, for the first time in our history, we exceeded $6 in earnings per share, grew shipments by 25% to nearly $6 billion, reported record revenues of $5.9 billion with operating profits expanding at greater than 1.5x revenues, demonstrating, we believe, sustainable leverage in our business model.
In this context in 2015, we achieved record output from our factories while improving our on-time delivery performance and shortening cycle time for installations, a very solid operational contribution.
2015 was the third consecutive calendar year in which we have significantly outgrown the industry. Over the last 3 years, we have grown our shipments at an annualized rate of more than 22%, well in excess of WFE CapEx growth of 6% in the same period.
Our success is always predicated on customer trust and the opportunity customers are willing to provide us. It is also the result of our vision, strategy and operational execution to bring a capability in leading-edge process technologies to bear on the most fundamental technology inflections that are driving an increasing proportion of wafer fab equipment spending.
In short, calendar 2015 was a year we are very proud of, many worked extremely hard but the increased the strategic relevance of Lam, hence the demonstrated results make that effort rewarding. I would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere appreciation to all of our employees across every function and in every location, without whom as a collective group, these, these accomplishments would not have been possible. The culture and values of Lam and a priority on continued learning and developments remain a foundation of competitive differentiation. We recommit to that as even stronger aspiration in 2016.
We estimate that the industry grew wafer fab equipment spending by approximately 4% to $33 billion in 2015, marginally stronger than earlier expectations. Our SAM share of WFE expanded to slightly more than 30% in 2015, driven by technology inflections, including the industry conversion to 3D device architecture in nonvolatile memory and also in logic, increased use of multi-patterning in DRAM and logic applications and increased adoption of advanced packaging integration schemes. Our demonstrated strength in these extremely complex technology and cost-sensitive process flows allowed us to grow Lam share of our SAM to the mid- to high 40% range in 2015.
Multiple patterning has become a key driver in enabling our customer scaling plans. Our VECTOR ALD and our Hydra conductor etch technology have enabled scaling and proactively positions reduction in the cost of multiple patterning through variability reduction and productivity improvements. We solidified our #1 position in 3D NAND for deposition and etch with differentiated products such as the high productivity VECTOR Strata and industry leading ALTUS and Flex products, which address the higher spec challenges of advanced memory applications.
In the multi-patterning segments, we saw an unprecedented ramp for our Kiyo with Hydra technology for conductor etch, where we've increased our installed base by more than a factor of 5 in the last 12 months. The Hydra conductor etch process control technology has delivered improved CD uniformity by approximately 50% from the prior baseline.
We saw very strong momentum for our VECTOR ALD products, where we doubled our shipments for multi-patterning applications enabled by best-in-class within wafer, wafer-to-wafer film thickness and CD variation control. The VECTOR ALD platform has improved system productivity by up to 50% in the year, delivering the lowest cost of ownership available in the industry currently. All market segments combines the headline for Lam deposition was an approximate 2 percentage points market share gain in the year on a very strong SAM expansion.
In 2015, founded on the depth of etch technical competency and capability of Lam and supplemented by some positive customer mix, we achieved the largest expansion of market share in over 5 years in our etch business, growing our total share by over 5 percentage points to the high 50% level. We are well on track towards delivering the longer-term goals that we communicated at our Analyst Day in July last year.
In a perpetually competitive industry segment we had a truly great year, maintaining our leading HVM position in conductor etch and making substantial gains in dielectric etch. 
In the conductor segments, we saw a fast ramp of key OS series product at multiple DRAM and 3D NAND customers. We were particularly pleased with the substantial market share gains we had in dielectric etch in 2015 with our Flex F and G series product families at multiple memory customers with increased potential and momentum emerging also in logic. We remain focused on delivering critical etch technologies for high aspect ratio etch as our customers scale the DRAM capacitor and the film stack types in 3D nonvolatile memory structures.
In our clean business, 2015 was a year of solid execution and some strategic repositioning. We recorded our largest increase in single-wafer clean market share in any prior year with a mid-single-digit percentage gain. Our strategic planning process ratified again the increasing strategic relevance of clean within our product portfolio. It also provided a framework for the streamlining actions we reported to you late last year. We entered 2016 and about a future of sustainable profitable growth. Excited about the increasing breadths of the Lam wet and dry technology product portfolio targeted at supporting additional clean and increasingly complex surface preparation and other yield enhancing applications.
Providing the foundation for the overall business momentum is the performance of our installed base. A key focus of our customer service business group. Here, we set another record for revenues. This business was focused on creating collaborative solutions to improve our customers' productivity. Also utilization and reduce their risk through the equipment lifecycle with products including advanced protective services and productivity upgrades. We are also addressing the needs of leading edge and trailing edge customers across a variety of wafer sizes and markets through a broader and more capable refurbished tools offering.
2016 has begun with well-publicized volatility and some contraction in growth expectations for the global macro economy with risks in some emerging markets but balanced by split and steady, it's slow improvement in a number of developed markets. Within this environment, Lam continues to be optimistic that the underlying technology drivers of mobility, cloud and the Internet of Things provide a foundation for an exciting multiyear opportunity for our products and services.
We assume 3D nonvolatile memory, a new memory technology adoption are at a tipping points of this year, resulting in an accelerated demand for solid-state memory in 2016. We are particularly optimistic in these segments where we see many years of technology visibility and opportunities for Lam to improve the cost and performance roadmaps for our customers. We expect to see double-digit growth in nonvolatile memory CapEx in 2016, driven by the need for the industry to convert to 3D capable capacity. Based on our analytics, the equipment industry is scheduled to support the delivery of a 3D-capable installed base of between 350,000 to 400,000 wafer starts per month of total capacity by the end of this year, supporting NAND feed growth this year of mid-30%. 
Rational industry spending is a common theme in a consolidated world. We anticipate to meaningfully reduce year-over-year spending in DRAM with customers focusing on 20-nanometer and 1x nodes migrations to continue to improve their cost competitiveness, supporting industry growth -- industry bit growth in the mid-20% range.
On a combined basis, we expect overall memory CapEx at the $15 billion level plus or minus $1 billion. From a foundry and logic CapEx standpoint, we continue to see an increase in projected spending for 10-nanometer investments as well as 28-nanometer and above investments across a number of customers. Since our update in October, we've seen some reported weakness in end market demand for high-end smartphones with content continuing to expand however. And in that context, we expect to see growth in 14-nanometer wafer demand as more companies ramp products of these nodes throughout the year. Taken together, we expect foundry and logic spending to be up slightly year-over-year at the $17 billion to $18 billion level in 2016.
As a result of these trends, we expect that 2016 WFE will track to approximately $33 billion plus or minus $2 billion, which is relatively unchanged from the initial views we provided you in October. We are off to a great start this year with probably positive customer engagements and an anticipated book-to-bill in March comfortably exceeding 1. Based on our current understanding of customer plans, we are very confident that our shipments in the first half of calendar year 2016 will exceed the second half of calendar 2015, and early indications suggest our shipments in the second half of '16 will grow from this new first half baseline. 
As a closing headline, December was our weakest shipments quarter in a record-setting calendar 2015 year. We anticipate the March quarter is a weakness in the 2016 year, which overall is anticipated to be stronger for Lam than 2015.
I will now update our progress towards completing our planned combination with KLA-Tencor and provide an early glimpse of our integration planning. We are working closely with regulatory agencies across several global regions to obtain the necessary approvals for the closing of this transaction. We remain confident that we can secure approvals and complete the transaction in mid-2016. Any updates to the developments on the regulatory front will be made through relevant filings or press releases that will be broadly disseminated to investors. We will not comment further on the subject in this meeting today.
We're in the early stages of planning for the successful integration of Lam and KLA, hence the process -- and the process that will enable us to realize the full strategic and financial potential of the combination while continuing to operate as 2 standalone companies with compelling products, technologies and people. 
We formed an integration planning team and we plan to leverage our experience from successfully integrating Lam with Novellus, a team with strong representation from both companies is established and already quite active but the primary focus to develop a comprehensive understanding of what people who do end exactly how we do it. At a more personal level, I continue to be very pleased with the dialogue with customers around the world, who without exception, look to the value proposition available of enhance innovation from this business combination.
As has been clear from our public filings related to the merger, we intend to continue the existing KLA-Tencor supply and support relationship with the broad industry ecosystem of our customers and suppliers to our customers both. We will be ready for day 1 execution, I have no doubt, based on numerous interactions worldwide. I am delighted that we have an engineering and technology community in both companies we see more opportunities each and everyday to deliver more compelling value together that is possible separately. Excitement is definitely building, our deal hypothesis being validated through our planning.
While 2015 was a record year for Lam Research, we believe that 2016 holds even more promise with the current momentum in our business, our opportunity for continued outperformance and the anticipated creation of an even a stronger and more strategically relevant company in partnership with KLA, we are positioning Lam for significant performance improvements now and over the long term.
In closing, I'd like to express my thanks, again to our customers for their trust and partnership, employees for our differentiated culture and performance, suppliers for their support and commitments, and investors for their confidence and continued interest in Lam.
Let me now turn the call over to Doug, who will provide a review of our financial performance and our March quarter outlook."
30655,321490385,921847,"Lam Research Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2016",2016-01-27,"Earnings Calls","Lam Research Corporation","Executives","Great. Thanks, Martin, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today on what I know is a busy earnings day. We ended calendar year 2015 with strong performance. Meeting or exceeding the midpoint of our guidance for December quarter on all financial metric",1224,"Great. Thanks, Martin, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today on what I know is a busy earnings day. We ended calendar year 2015 with strong performance. Meeting or exceeding the midpoint of our guidance for December quarter on all financial metrics. 
Earnings per share came in above the high-end of our guidance range. In addition to the numerous milestones Martin mentioned during his prepared remarks, during calendar year 2015, we generated over $1.2 billion in cash from operations which was an increase of more than 45% compared to calendar year 2014 and we returned more than $410 million to our shareholders through stock repurchases and dividends. We are very pleased with what we've achieved this quarter as well as this calendar year.
Shipments continued at a healthy level in the December quarter totaling $1,288,000,000, which was a little bit above the midpoint of our guidance. 
As we anticipated, memory shipments decreased in the quarter with the combined memory segment representing 65% of total system shipments and that compares with 72% in the prior quarter.
DRAM shipments made up 42% of the system shipments, which was up from 32% in the previous quarter. DRAM investments continue to be largely focus on 20-nanometer conversions. Customers continue to ramp NAND and other nonvolatile memory technologies, which made up 33% of the system shipments and this is down 40% level that was on the September quarter.
NAND investments were again primarily directed towards deployment of 3D NAND capacity.
December quarter foundry shipments were 25% of system shipments and this was up from 18% in the previous quarter. Foundry spending was broad-based, the combination of 10-nanometer pilot capability, first generation FinFET capacity as well as trailing edge investments. 
The logic and other segment accounted for 10% of system shipments, which was about the same level as last quarter. Revenue in the quarter came in at $1,426,000,000, which was a little bit above the midpoint of guidance and down 11% compared to the record high level that we saw on the September quarter.
Gross margin came in right at the midpoint of guidance at 45.5%. And as I always mention, you should expect to see some quarter-to-quarter variability gross margin due to multiple factors such as product mix, customer concentration as well as overall business volumes. Our financial model continues to be the right tool for you to use to build your models and think about our ongoing financial performance.
Operating expenses in the December quarter declined to $352 million, coming in at 25% of revenue and this is compared with 23% in the September quarter. About 63% of the OpEx spend in the quarter is allocated to R&D, which was around the same ratio we've held throughout the calendar year.
Funding of strategic R&D programs continue our technology and productivity leadership that's critical to meeting our objectives of growing the company at a faster pace than the industry. The market share success we are currently enjoying is a result of investments we've made in previous years. We aim to continue that outperformance.
Operating income in the December quarter was $296 million, down from $380 million in the prior quarter. Operating margin was 20.8%, which was down from 23.8% in September and a little bit above the midpoint of the guidance range.
Operating income and operating margin declined sequentially as a result of the lower revenues in the period.
Our tax rate for the quarter was approximately 7%, down compared to 14% last quarter. The tax rate is lower primarily due to the permanent extension of the R&D tax credit in the United States. A tax rate of low to mid-teens for the remainder of 2016 would be a reasonable number for you to include in your models. Based on a share count of about 172 million shares, earnings per share for the December quarter were $1.57. This was above the high end of our guided range due to the favorable tax rate in the quarter as well as the higher revenue.
The share count includes dilution from the 2016 and 2041 convertible notes with the total dilutive impact of about 11 million shares on a non-GAAP basis. Dilution schedules for the 2016, 2018 and 2041 convertible notes are available on our Investor Relations website for your reference.
In the quarter, we returned $48 million in dividend distributions to our shareholders. We did not repurchase any shares in the December quarter as we have temporarily suspended share repurchases in anticipation of the business combination with KLA-Tencor.
Let me now move to the balance sheet. Cash generation was strong again in the quarter with cash from operations coming in at $295 million. During the quarter, cash and short-term investments, including restricted cash, increased to $4.7 billion, up from $4.5 billion in September. Day sales outstanding increased to 70 days versus 62 days last quarter. The increase in DSO was due to the timing of shipments within the quarter with shipments being more biased towards the back half of the period.
Inventory turn remains strong at 3.6x. Deferred revenue at the end of the quarter were $395 million, which was down from last quarter. And I just point out, this number excludes $109 million from shipments to customers in Japan, which will revenue in future quarters.
I'd like to remind you that those Japan shipments remain as inventory carried at cost on our balance sheet. Company noncash expenses during the quarter includes the following: $33 million for equity comp; $39 million for amortization; and $33 million for depreciation.
Capital expenditures were $28 million which was down from $49 million in the September quarter. CapEx can sometimes be a lumpy number as you saw in December. CapEx for the year came in at $173 million. We ended the quarter with approximately 7,300 regular full-time employees. I'd point out that we have been relatively flat headcount-wise for the last 2 quarters.
Entering 2016, we continue to be pleased in the momentum of our business and the progress we're making towards our targeted financial model. For the March quarter, our non-GAAP guidance is as follows: we expect shipment growth to $1,430,000,000, plus or minus $75 million; we expect revenue of $1,300,000,000, plus or minus $75 million; this lower revenue for March is largely consistent with our December shipments. We expect gross margin of 44%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. The margin decline in March is due to both customer as well as product mix. I expect margin to improve from this level as we go through 2016. We forecast operating margins of 17% plus or minus 1 percentage point. And finally, we're forecasting earnings per share of $1.7, plus or minus $0.10, based on a share count of approximately 172.5 million shares. In the outlook for the company, we are optimistic in the trajectory of demand for our products and services.
We expect shipments and revenue in the June quarter will be stronger than in the March quarter. With the anticipated strength in shipments, we expect to grow our deferred revenue balances in the first half of 2016. As we sit here today, I expect the second half of the year would have a stronger top line in the first half due to investments in leading edge foundry and logic.
That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, please open the call for questions."

So there's a plus or minus of each one of those, so that's kind of a segment composition. Our sense of first half, second half WFE, we're currently modeling a 47, 48, 53, 52 type of profile. So overall, stronger second half than first half. DRAM, foundry and microprocessors, all second half stronger than first half. And NAND, to your point, slightly stronger in the first half of the year. And I would say that the upside to the extent, there's upside in the first half, second half is split as I've just characterized with NAND is all defined around the performance of devices and their momentum in kind of market and so on and so forth.

So let me deal with margin and OpEx together. The full process relative to the operating expenses in the company is we have a tremendous opportunity here to continue to outgrow the industry and our commitments to invest in R&D to support that initiative is a really important commitment for the company. So we're not jerking left and right our commitments to customers around enabling technology. We're committed and we have to work through these short-term kind of variability that we see as a result of concentrated customers these days. But having said that, we talked a lot about R&D and SG&A percentages, so Doug can talk more if you want to in the call, but I think you know what we're trying to do there. We've essentially, in the guidance provided today, retains or constrained the operating expense investments to a level that's pretty similar to the March '15 quarter. And just to remind you, in March '15, we were just coming off the back of a $5 billion revenue year. Now we're coming off the back of a $6 billion revenue year, so to have the operating expenses at the 3 50 level, I think, is a testament to the business model and the commitment to the management team to be responsible in the context of long-term and short-term performance improvement. Last thing to say relative to gross margins, I don't think we're the first large equipment company to message December through March gross margin contraction in the scheme of things, the best counsel we have for you is the long-term model and the 22% range of operating income is still the ambition of the company in the '16 year."

At a segment level, the story that I'll describe for WFE slightly stronger than the year-over-year at relative to slightly weaker memory investments. Historically, that's meant something to us in terms of the degree of outperformance. But 1 piece of really important context is, we're really positioned well in the image sensor transitions and I think when other folks were struggling a little bit with logic spending reductions, we generally kind of marched right through that because of that positioning and it's as strong today as it was then. Our momentum in foundries and in microprocessor logic is now, I hope, well understood to be a positive trajectory for the company. And so we still believe that in a essentially flat WFE, our SAM increases. One part of that is the inflections message, right?

I will first begin with a review of our calendar 2015 accomplishments, including comments on the relevance to the growth outperformance opportunities for the company, then offer a perspective on",2096,"Thank you, Satya, and thank you, all, for joining us today. I will first begin with a review of our calendar 2015 accomplishments, including comments on the relevance to the growth outperformance opportunities for the company, then offer a perspective on wafer fab equipment spending in 2016 as well as the trends driving our longer-term favorable outlook, concluding my prepared comments with a progress update on our planned business combination with KLA-Tencor. Doug will then review our financial and operational performance as well as provide guidance for the March 2016 quarter.
2015 was another record year for Lam Research augmented by our plan to combine with KLA-Tencor this year, a partnership that we believe will create an unmatched capability for the global semiconductor industry by uniting best-in-class process technologies with process control, creating a new paradigm in process enablement, accelerating innovation for the benefit of our customers. Last year, for the first time in our history, we exceeded $6 in earnings per share, grew shipments by 25% to nearly $6 billion, reported record revenues of $5.9 billion with operating profits expanding at greater than 1.5x revenues demonstrating, we believe, sustainable leverage in our business model.
In this context in 2015, we achieved record output from our factories while improving our on-time delivery performance and shortening cycle time for installations, a very solid operational contribution. 2015 was the third consecutive calendar year in which we have significantly outgrown the industry. Over the last 3 years, we have grown our shipments at an annualized rate of more than 22%, well in excess of WFE CapEx growth of 6% in the same period.
Our success is always predicated on customer trust and the opportunity customers are willing to provide us. It is also the result of our vision, strategy and operational execution to bring a capability in leading-edge process technologies to bear on the most fundamental technology inflections that are driving an increasing proportion of wafer fab equipment spending.
In short, calendar 2015 was a year we are very proud of. Many worked extremely hard, but the increased strategic relevance of Lam, hence the demonstrated results, make that effort rewarding. I would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere appreciation to all of our employees across every function and in every location without whom, as a collective group, these accomplishments would not have been possible. The culture and values of Lam and a priority on continued learning and developments remain a foundation of competitive differentiation. We recommit to that as even stronger aspiration in 2016.
We estimate that the industry grew wafer fab equipment spending by approximately 4% to $33 billion in 2015, marginally stronger than earlier expectations. Our SAM share of WFE expanded to slightly more than 30% in 2015 driven by the technology inflections, including the industry conversion to 3D device architecture in nonvolatile memory and also in logic, increased use of multi-patterning in DRAM and logic applications and increased adoption of advanced packaging integration schemes. Our demonstrated strength in these extremely complex technology and cost-sensitive process flows allowed us to grow Lam share of our SAM to the mid- to high 40% range in 2015.
Multiple patterning has become a key driver in enabling our customer scaling plans. Our VECTOR ALD and our Hydra conductor etch technology have enabled scaling and proactively position reductions in the cost of multiple patterning through variability reduction and productivity improvements. We solidified our #1 position in 3D NAND for deposition and etch with differentiated products, such as the high-productivity VECTOR Strata and industry leading ALTUS and Flex products, which address the high aspect ratio challenges of advanced memory applications.
In the multi-patterning segments, we saw an unprecedented ramp for our Kiyo with Hydra technology for conductor etch where we've increased our installed base by more than a factor of 5 in the last 12 months. The Hydra conductor etch process control technology has delivered improved CD uniformity by approximately 50% from the prior baseline.
We saw very strong momentum for our VECTOR ALD products where we doubled our shipments for multi-patterning applications enabled by best-in-class within wafer, wafer-to-wafer film thickness and CD variation control. The VECTOR ALD platform has improved system productivity by up to 50% in the year, delivering the lowest cost of ownership available in the industry currently. All market segments combined, the headline for Lam deposition was an approximate 2 percentage points market share gain in the year on a very strong SAM expansion.
In 2015, founded on the depth of etch technical competency and capability of Lam and supplemented by some positive customer mix, we achieved the largest expansion of market share in over 5 years in our etch business, growing our total share by over 5 percentage points to the high 50% level. We are well on track towards delivering the longer-term goal that we communicated at our Analyst Day in July last year. In a perpetually competitive industry segment, we had a truly great year, maintaining our leading HVM position in conductor etch and making substantial gains in dielectric etch.
In the conductor segments, we saw a fast ramp of key OS series product to multiple DRAM and 3D NAND customers. We were particularly pleased with the substantial market share gains we had in dielectric etch in 2015 with our Flex F and G series product families at multiple memory customers with increased potential and momentum emerging also in logic. We remain focused on delivering critical etch technologies for high aspect ratio etch as our customers scale the DRAM capacitor and the film stack height in 3D nonvolatile memory structures.
In our clean business, 2015 was a year of solid execution and some strategic repositioning. We recorded our largest increase in single-wafer clean market share in any prior year with a mid-single-digit percentage gain. Our strategic planning process ratified again the increasing strategic relevance of clean within our product portfolio. It also provided a framework for the streamlining actions we reported to you late last year. We entered 2016 energized about the future of sustainable profitable growth, excited about the increasing breadths of the Lam wet and dry technology product portfolio targeted at supporting traditional clean and increasingly complex surface preparation and other yield-enhancing applications.
Providing the foundation for the overall business momentum is the performance of our installed base, a key focus of our customer service business group. Here, we set another record for revenues. This business group is focused on creating collaborative solutions to improve our customers' productivity, also asset utilization and reduce their risk through the equipment life cycle with products including advanced predictive services and productivity upgrades. We're also addressing the needs of leading edge and trailing edge customers across a variety of wafer sizes and markets through a broader and more capable refurbished tools offering.
2016 has begun with well-publicized volatility and some contraction in growth expectations for the global macro economy with risks in some emerging markets but balanced by steady yet slow improvement in a number of developed markets. Within this environment, Lam continues to be optimistic that the underlying technology drivers of mobility, cloud and the Internet of Things provide a foundation for an exciting multiyear opportunity for our products and services.
We assume 3D nonvolatile memory, a new memory technology adoption, are at a tipping point this year, resulting in an accelerated demand for solid-state memory in 2016. We are particularly optimistic in this segment where we see many years of technology visibility and opportunities for Lam to improve the cost and performance road maps for our customers. We expect to see double-digit growth in nonvolatile memory CapEx in 2016 driven by the need for the industry to convert to 3D-capable capacity. Based on our analytics, the equipment industry is scheduled to support the delivery of a 3D-capable installed base of between 350,000 to 400,000 wafer starts per month of total capacity by the end of this year, supporting NAND bit growth this year of mid-30%.
Rational industry spending is a common theme in a consolidated world. We anticipate to meaningfully reduce year-over-year spending in DRAM with customers focusing on 20-nanometer and 1x nodes migrations to continue to improve their cost competitiveness, supporting industry growth -- industry bit growth in the mid-20% range. On a combined basis, we expect overall memory CapEx at the $15 billion level plus or minus $1 billion.
From a foundry and logic CapEx standpoint, we continue to see an increase in projected spending for 10-nanometer investments as well as 28-nanometer and above investments across a number of customers. Since our update in October, we've seen some reported weakness in end market demand for high-end smartphones with content continuing to expand however. And in that context, we expect to see growth in 14-nanometer wafer demand as more companies ramp products of this node throughout the year. Taken together, we expect foundry and logic spending to be up slightly year-over-year at the $17 billion to $18 billion level in 2016. As a result of these trends, we expect that 2016 WFE will track to approximately $33 billion plus or minus $2 billion, which is relatively unchanged from the initial views we provided you in October.
We are off to a great start this year with broadly positive customer engagements and an anticipated book-to-bill in March comfortably exceeding 1. Based on our current understanding of customer plans, we are very confident that our shipments in the first half of calendar year 2016 will exceed the second half of calendar 2015, and early indications suggest our shipments in the second half of '16 will grow from this new first half baseline.
As a closing headline, December was our weakest shipments quarter in a record-setting calendar 2015 year. We anticipate the March quarter is a weakness in the 2016 year, which overall is anticipated to be stronger for Lam than 2015.
I will now update our progress towards completing our planned combination with KLA-Tencor and provide an early glimpse of our integration planning. We are working closely with regulatory agencies across several global regions to obtain the necessary approvals for the closing of this transaction. We remain confident that we can secure approvals to complete the transaction in mid-2016. Any updates to the developments on the regulatory front will be made through relevant filings or press releases that will be broadly disseminated to investors. We will not comment further on this subject in this meeting today.
We're in the early stages of planning for the successful integration of Lam and KLA and the process that will enable us to realize the full strategic and financial potential of the combination while continuing to operate as 2 stand-alone companies with compelling products, technologies and people. We formed an integration planning team, and we plan to leverage our experience from successfully integrating Lam with Novellus. A team with strong representation from both companies is established and already quite active, with a primary focus to develop a comprehensive understanding of what we both do and exactly how we do it. At a more personal level, I continue to be very pleased with the dialogue with customers around the world who, without exception, look to the value proposition available of enhanced innovation from this business combination.
As has been clear from our public filings related to the merger, we intend to continue the existing KLA-Tencor supply and support relationship with the broad industry ecosystem of our customers and suppliers to our customers both. We will be ready for day 1 execution, I have no doubt, based on numerous interactions worldwide. I am delighted that we have an engineering and technology community in both companies who see more opportunities each and every day to deliver more compelling value together than is possible separately. Excitement is definitely building, our deal hypothesis being validated through our planning.
While 2015 was a record year for Lam Research, we believe that 2016 holds even more promise. With the current quarter momentum in our business, our opportunity for continued outperformance and the anticipated creation of an even stronger and more strategically relevant company in partnership with KLA, we are positioning Lam for significant performance improvements now and over the long term.
In closing, I'd like to express my thanks, again, to our customers for their trust and partnership, employees for our differentiated culture and performance, suppliers for their support and commitments and investors for their confidence and continued interest in Lam.
Let me now turn the call over to Doug, who will provide a review of our financial performance and our March quarter outlook."

Thanks, Martin, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today on what I know is a busy earnings day. We ended calendar year 2015 with strong performance, meeting or exceeding the midpoint of our guidance for the December quarter on all financial me",1227,"Great. Thanks, Martin, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today on what I know is a busy earnings day. We ended calendar year 2015 with strong performance, meeting or exceeding the midpoint of our guidance for the December quarter on all financial metrics.
Earnings per share came in above the high-end of our guidance range. In addition to the numerous milestones Martin mentioned during his prepared remarks, during calendar year 2015, we generated over $1.2 billion in cash from operations, which was an increase of more than 45% compared to calendar year 2014. And we returned more than $410 million to our shareholders through stock repurchases and dividends. We're very pleased with what we've achieved this quarter as well as this calendar year.
Shipments continued at a healthy level in the December quarter totaling $1,288,000,000, which was a little bit above the midpoint of our guidance. As we anticipated, memory shipments decreased in the quarter with the combined Memory segment representing 65% of total system shipments, and that compares with 72% in the prior quarter.
DRAM shipments made up 42% of the system shipments, which was up from 32% in the previous quarter. DRAM investments continue to be largely focused on 20-nanometer conversions. Customers continue to ramp NAND and other nonvolatile memory technologies, which made up 23% of the system shipments, and this was down from the 40% level that we saw in the September quarter. NAND investments were, again, primarily directed towards deployment of 3D NAND capacity.
December quarter Foundry shipments were 25% of system shipments, and this was up from 18% in the previous quarter. Foundry spending was broad-based with the combination of 10-nanometer pilot capability, first-generation FinFET capacity as well as trailing edge investments. The Logic and Other segment accounted for 10% of system shipments, which was about the same level as last quarter.
Revenue in the quarter came in at $1,426,000,000, which was a little bit above the midpoint of guidance and down 11% compared to the record high level that we saw on the September quarter. Gross margin came in right at the midpoint of guidance at 45.5%. And as I always mention, you should expect to see some quarter-to-quarter variability in gross margin due to multiple factors, such as product mix, customer concentration as well as overall business volumes. Our financial model continues to be the right tool for you to use to build your models and think about our ongoing financial performance.
Operating expenses in the December quarter declined to $352 million, coming in at 25% of revenue and this compared with 23% in the September quarter. About 63% of the OpEx spend in the quarter was allocated to R&D, which was around the same ratio we've held throughout the calendar year.
Funding of strategic R&D programs to continue our technology and productivity leadership is critical to meeting our objectives of growing the company at a faster pace than the industry. The market share success we are currently enjoying is the result of investments we've made in previous years. We aim to continue that outperformance.
Operating income in the December quarter was $296 million, down from $380 million in the prior quarter. Operating margin was 20.8%, which was down from 23.8% in September and a little bit above the midpoint of the guided range. Operating income and operating margin declined sequentially as a result of the lower revenues in the period.
Our tax rate for the quarter was approximately 7%, down compared to 14% last quarter. The tax rate was lower primarily due to the permanent extension of the R&D tax credit in the United States. A tax rate of low to mid-teens for the remainder of 2016 would be a reasonable number for you to include in your models.
Based on a share count of about 172 million shares, earnings per share for the December quarter were $1.57. This was above the high-end of our guided range due to the favorable tax rate in the quarter as well as the higher revenue. The share count includes dilution from the 2016 and 2041 convertible notes with the total dilutive impact of about 11 million shares on a non-GAAP basis. Dilution schedules for the 2016, 2018 and 2041 convertible notes are available on our Investor Relations website for your reference.
In the quarter, we returned $48 million in dividend distributions to our shareholders. We did not repurchase any shares in the December quarter as we have temporarily suspended share repurchases in anticipation of the business combination with KLA-Tencor.
Let me now move to the balance sheet. Cash generation was strong again in the quarter with cash from operations coming in at $295 million. During the quarter, cash and short-term investments, including restricted cash, increased to $4.7 billion, up from $4.5 billion in September. Days sales outstanding increased to 70 days versus 62 days last quarter. The increase in DSO was due to the timing of shipments within the quarter with shipments being more biased towards the back half of the period. Inventory turns remain strong at 3.6x.
Deferred revenue at the end of the quarter were $395 million, which was down from last quarter. And I'd just point out, this number excludes $109 million from shipments to customers in Japan, which will revenue in future quarters. I'd like to remind you that those Japan shipments remain as inventory carried at cost on our balance sheet.
Company noncash expenses during the quarter includes the following: $33 million for equity comp, $39 million for amortization and $33 million for depreciation. Capital expenditures were $28 million, which was down from $49 million in the September quarter. CapEx can sometimes be a lumpy number as you saw in December. CapEx for the year came in at $173 million.
We ended the quarter with approximately 7,300 regular full-time employees. I'd point out that we have been relatively flat headcount-wise for the last 2 quarters.
Entering 2016, we continue to be pleased with the momentum in our business and the progress we're making towards our targeted financial model. For the March quarter, our non-GAAP guidance is as follows. We expect shipment growth to $1,430,000,000 plus or minus $75 million. We expect revenue of $1,300,000,000 plus or minus $75 million. This lower revenue for March is largely consistent with our December shipments.
We expect gross margin of 44% plus or minus 1 percentage point. The margin decline in March is due to both customer as well as product mix. I expect margin to improve from this level as we go through 2016. We forecast operating margins of 17% plus or minus 1 percentage point. And finally, we're forecasting earnings per share of $1.07 plus or minus $0.10 based on a share count of approximately 172.5 million shares.
In the outlook for the company, we are optimistic in the trajectory of demand for our products and services. We expect shipments and revenue in the June quarter will be stronger than in the March quarter. With the anticipated strength in shipments, we expect to grow our deferred revenue balances in the first half of 2016. As we sit here today, I expect the second half of the year will have a stronger top line in the first half due to investments in leading edge, foundry and logic.
That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, please open the call for questions."

So that's a kind of segment composition. Our sense of first half, second half WFE, we're currently modeling a 47, 48, 53, 52 type of profile. So overall, stronger second half than first half. DRAM, foundry and microprocessors, all second half stronger than first half. And NAND, to your point, slightly stronger in the first half of the year. And I would say that the upside, to the extent there's upside, in the first half, second half split that I've just characterized with NAND is all defined around the performance of devices and then momentum in kind of SSD [ph] market and so on and so forth.

And by the time we get to '18, our estimate is 55% or slightly higher. So the SAM expansion story, the targeted market share story, certainly have us optimistic that we are continuing to grow the company in an environment of flat WFE, and the economics that we're targeting are exactly as we've communicated in our long-term financial model.

We're committed and we have to work through these short-term kind of variability that we see as a result of concentrated customers these days. But having said that, we talked a lot about R&D and SG&A percentages, so Doug can talk more if you want to in the call, but I think you know what we're trying to do there. We've essentially, in the guidance provided today, retained or constrained the operating expense investments to a level that's pretty similar to the March '15 quarter. And just to remind you, in March '15, we were just coming off the back of a $5 billion revenue year. Now we're coming off the back of a $6 billion revenue year, so to have the operating expenses at the 3 50 level, I think, is a testament to the business model and the commitment to the management team to be responsible in the context of long-term and short-term performance improvement. Last thing to say relative to gross margins, I don't think we're the first large equipment company to message December through March gross margin contraction.

So I'm not sure which comes first in all of this and the customers can speak to their tolerance of risk. To your point, everybody is invested with plans in 3D NAND this calendar year.

At a segment level, the story that I'd describe for WFE is slightly stronger foundry year-over-year at relative to a slightly weaker memory investment. So historically, that's meant something to us in terms of the degree of outperformance. But one piece of really important context is we really positioned well in the image sensor transitions and I think when other folks were struggling a little bit with logic spend reductions, we generally kind of marched right through that because of that positioning and it's as strong today as it was then. Our momentum in foundries and in microprocessor logic is now, I hope, well understood to be a positive trajectory for the company. And so we still believe that in a essentially flat WFE, our SAM increases. One part of that is the inflections message, right? So something like a 33% reference point for 2015, a proportion of WFE that is inflation based. And that's kind of walking its way to the 55% level.

And we did some kind of strategic repositioning as you might remember towards the end of last year and rationalized some cost structure and kind of focused a little bit more on what we consider to be the most relevant opportunities to grow. I mean, it's a kind of mid to high teens market share play for us today. And the message we communicated today is strategically relevant. We're excited about kind of a profitable growth opportunity coming into '16 and we're broadening the product portfolio wet and dry, and time will tell what we can accomplish as a result of that investment. But I think that most of us would say we feel better about clean this year than we did last year and we'll make that continue."

I mean, the challenge for the industry is not just a challenge of physics, it's a challenge of economics. At a strategic level, we concluded that the most -- the responsible action we could take, the most significant contribution we can make to the success of our customers would come from the integration of process and process control. A big part of that value proposition is associated with new engagements across the companies with customers because the reality is, as you all know, the KLA team is a little bit more entrenched and stronger relatively in foundry logic than we are and we are more than them in kind of memory. So there's absolutely a kind of an opportunity there. There are engineering exchange programs. We're building momentum, specifying the types of things that we think are relevant to new collaborations and joint development activities with customers when we get to be 1 company. And quite how far that goes, how quickly, your reference right now is the $600 million bogey we have in the proxy for revenue synergies. And I would say I feel better about that today than I did when I talked to you about it last time because I see excitement emerging in the engineering community around the substance of opportunity which is kind of everything about delivery vision here. And I see a sustained willingness in the customer base to support our plans to support them. So pretty excited at this point."

I remember vividly describing a relationship to you 10 years ago that would work for 3 years, 5 years which doesn't work anymore because it is consolidated, it is a much more viable play and every week counts.

Because I think the imagery situation is getting better but it's probably not all the way there, but it's a lot better. There's tremendous discipline. It's a very efficient spend because it's all about conversions which is increased performance and lower cost which is more profitably. Despite the fact that profitability levels have come down, they're still reasonably able to support investment. I just think it's like a lot of discipline in a year when bit density conversion is playing out in DRAM as well which creates a little bit more complexity to your question. So I would say we have modeled pretty conservatively, our expectations. Maybe there's a little bit of upside in the second half of the year.

I will first begin with a review of our calendar 2015 accomplishments, including comments on the relevance to the growth outperformance opportunities for the company, then offer a perspective on wafer fab equipment spending in 2016 as well as the trends driving our longer-term favorable outlook, concluding my prepared comments with a progress update on our planned business combination with KLA-Tencor. Doug will then review our financial and operational performance as well as provide guidance for the March 2016 quarter.
2015 was another record year for Lam Research, augmented by our plan to combine with KLA-Tencor this year, a partnership that we believe will create an unmatched capability for the global semiconductor industry by uniting best-in-class process technologies with process control, creating a new paradigm in process enablement, accelerating innovation for the benefit of our customers. Last year, for the first time in our history, we exceeded $6 in earnings per share, grew shipments by 25% to nearly $6 billion, reported record revenues of $5.9 billion with operating profits expanding at greater than 1.5x revenues, demonstrating, we believe, sustainable leverage in our business model.
In this context, in 2015 we achieved record output from our factories while improving our on-time delivery performance and shortening cycle time for installations, a very solid operational contribution. 2015 was the third consecutive calendar year in which we have significantly outgrown the industry. Over the last 3 years, we have grown our shipments at an annualized rate of more than 22%, well in excess of WFE CapEx growth of 6% in the same period.
Our success is always predicated on customer trust and the opportunity customers are willing to provide us. It is also the result of our vision, strategy and operational execution to bring a capability in leading-edge process technologies to bear on the most fundamental technology inflections that are driving an increasing proportion of wafer fab equipment spending.
In short, calendar 2015 was a year we are very proud of. Many worked extremely hard, but the increased strategic relevance of Lam and the demonstrated results make that effort rewarding. I would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere appreciation to all of our employees across every function and in every location, without whom, as a collective group, these accomplishments would not have been possible. The culture and values of Lam and a priority on continued learning and developments remain a foundation of competitive differentiation. We recommit to that as even stronger aspiration in 2016.
We estimate that the industry grew wafer fab equipment spending by approximately 4% to $33 billion in 2015, marginally stronger than earlier expectations. Our SAM share of WFE expanded to slightly more than 30% in 2015, driven by the technology inflections, including the industry conversion to 3D device architecture in nonvolatile memory and also in logic, increased use of multi-patterning in DRAM and logic applications and increased adoption of advanced packaging integration schemes. Our demonstrated strength in these extremely complex technology and cost-sensitive process flows allowed us to grow Lam's share of our SAM to the mid- to high 40% range in 2015.
Multiple patterning has become a key driver in enabling our customer scaling plans. Our VECTOR ALD and our Hydra conductor etch technology have enabled scaling and proactively positioned reductions in the cost of multiple patterning through variability reduction and productivity improvements. We solidified our #1 position in 3D NAND for deposition and etch with differentiated products, such as the high-productivity VECTOR Strata and industry leading ALTUS and Flex products, which address the high aspect ratio challenges of advanced memory applications.
In the multi-patterning segments, we saw an unprecedented ramp for our Kiyo with Hydra technology for conductor etch where we've increased our installed base by more than a factor of 5 in the last 12 months. The Hydra conductor etch process control technology has delivered improved CD uniformity by approximately 50% from the prior baseline.
We saw very strong momentum for our VECTOR ALD products where we doubled our shipments for multi-patterning applications enabled by best-in-class within wafer, wafer-to-wafer film thickness and CD variation control. The VECTOR ALD platform has improved system productivity by up to 50% in the year, delivering the lowest cost of ownership available in the industry currently. All market segments combined, the headline for Lam deposition was an approximate 2 percentage points market share gain in the year on a very strong SAM expansion.
In 2015, founded on the depth of etch technical competency and capability of Lam and supplemented by some positive customer mix, we achieved the largest expansion of market share in over 5 years in our etch business, growing our total share by over 5 percentage points to the high 50% level. We are well on track towards delivering the longer-term goal that we communicated at our Analyst Day in July last year. In a perpetually competitive industry segment we had a truly great year, maintaining our leading HVM position in conductor etch and making substantial gains in dielectric etch.
In the conductor segments, we saw a fast ramp of key OS series product to multiple DRAM and 3D NAND customers. We were particularly pleased with the substantial market share gains we had in dielectric etch in 2015 with our Flex F and G series product families at multiple memory customers with increased potential and momentum emerging also in logic. We remain focused on delivering critical etch technologies for high aspect ratio etch as our customers scale the DRAM capacitor and the film stack height in 3D nonvolatile memory structures.
In our clean business, 2015 was a year of solid execution and some strategic repositioning. We recorded our largest increase in single-wafer clean market share in any prior year with a mid-single-digit percentage gain. Our strategic planning process ratified again the increasing strategic relevance of clean within our product portfolio. It also provided a framework for the streamlining actions we reported to you late last year. We enter 2016 energized about the future of sustainable, profitable growth, excited about the increasing breadth of the Lam wet and dry technology product portfolio targeted at supporting traditional clean and increasingly complex surface preparation and other yield-enhancing applications.
Providing the foundation for the overall business momentum is the performance of our installed base, a key focus of our customer service business group. Here, we set another record for revenues. This business group is focused on creating collaborative solutions to improve our customers' productivity, also asset utilization and reduce their risk through the equipment life cycle with products including advanced predictive services and productivity upgrades. We're also addressing the needs of leading edge and trailing edge customers across a variety of wafer sizes and markets through a broader and more capable refurbished tools offering.
2016 has begun with well-publicized volatility and some contraction in growth expectations for the global macro economy with risks in some emerging markets but balanced by steady if slow improvements in a number of developed markets. Within this environment Lam continues to be optimistic that the underlying technology drivers of mobility, cloud and the Internet of Things provide a foundation for an exciting multiyear opportunity for our products and services.
We assume 3D nonvolatile memory, a new memory technologies adoption, are at a tipping point this year, resulting in an accelerated demand for solid-state memory in 2016. We are particularly optimistic in this segment, where we see many years of technology visibility and opportunities for Lam to improve the cost and performance roadmaps for our customers. We expect to see double-digit growth in nonvolatile memory CapEx in 2016 driven by the need for the industry to convert to 3D-capable capacity. Based on our analytics, the equipment industry is scheduled to support the delivery of a 3D-capable installed base of between 350,000 to 400,000 wafer starts per month of total capacity by the end of this year, supporting NAND bit growth this year of mid-30%.
Rational industry spending is a common theme in a consolidated world. We anticipate to meaningfully reduce year-over-year spending in DRAM with customers focusing on 20-nanometer and 1x nodes migrations to continue to improve their cost competitiveness, supporting industry growth -- industry bit growth in the mid-20% range. On a combined basis, we expect overall memory CapEx at the $15 billion level, plus or minus $1 billion.
From a foundry and logic CapEx standpoint, we continue to see an increase in projected spending for 10-nanometer investments as well as 28-nanometer and above investments across a number of customers. Since our update in October, we've seen some reported weakness in end market demand for high-end smartphones with content continuing to expand however. And in that context we expect to see growth in 14-nanometer wafer demand as more companies ramp products of this node throughout the year. Taken together, we expect foundry and logic spending to be up slightly year-over-year at the $17 billion to $18 billion level in 2016. As a result of these trends, we expect that 2016 WFE will track to approximately $33 billion plus or minus $2 billion, which is relatively unchanged from the initial views we provided you in October.
We are off to a great start this year with broadly positive customer engagements and an anticipated book-to-bill in March comfortably exceeding 1. Based on our current understanding of customer plans, we are very confident that our shipments in the first half of calendar year 2016 will exceed the second half of calendar 2015, and early indications suggest our shipments in the second half of '16 will grow from this new first half baseline.
As a closing headline, December was our weakest shipments quarter in a record-setting calendar 2015 year. We anticipate the March quarter is a weakness in the 2016 year, which overall is anticipated to be stronger for Lam than 2015.
I will now update our progress towards completing our planned combination with KLA-Tencor and provide an early glimpse of our integration planning. We are working closely with regulatory agencies across several global regions to obtain the necessary approvals for the closing of this transaction. We remain confident that we can secure approvals to complete the transaction in mid-2016. Any updates to the developments on the regulatory front will be made through relevant filings or press releases that will be broadly disseminated to investors. We will not comment further on this subject in this meeting today.
We're in the early stages of planning for the successful integration of Lam and KLA and the process that will enable us to realize the full strategic and financial potential of the combination while continuing to operate as 2 stand-alone companies with compelling products, technologies and people. We've formed an integration planning team, and we plan to leverage our experience from successfully integrating Lam with Novellus. A team with strong representation from both companies is established and already quite active, with a primary focus to develop a comprehensive understanding of what we both do and exactly how we do it. 
At a more personal level, I continue to be very pleased with the dialogue with customers around the world who, without exception, look to the value proposition available of enhanced innovation from this business combination.
As has been clear from our public filings related to the merger, we intend to continue the existing KLA-Tencor supply and support relationship with the broad industry ecosystem of our customers and suppliers to our customers both. We will be ready for day 1 execution, I have no doubt, based on numerous interactions worldwide. I am delighted that we have an engineering and technology community in both companies who see more opportunity each and every day to deliver more compelling value together than is possible separately. Excitement is definitely building, our deal hypothesis being validated through our planning.
While 2015 was a record year for Lam Research, we believe that 2016 holds even more promise. With the current quarter momentum in our business, our opportunity for continued outperformance and the anticipated creation of an even stronger and more strategically relevant company in partnership with KLA, we are positioning Lam for significant performance improvements now and over the long term.
In closing, I'd like to express my thanks again to our customers for their trust and partnership, employees for our differentiated culture and performance, suppliers for their support and commitments and investors for their confidence and continued interest in Lam.
Let me now turn the call over to Doug, who will provide a review of our financial performance and our March quarter outlook."

We ended calendar year 2015 with strong performance, meeting or exceeding the midpoint of our guidance for the December quarter on all financial me",1229,"Great. Thanks, Martin, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today on what I know is a busy earnings day. We ended calendar year 2015 with strong performance, meeting or exceeding the midpoint of our guidance for the December quarter on all financial metrics.
Earnings per share came in above the high end of our guidance range. In addition to the numerous milestones Martin mentioned during his prepared remarks, during calendar year 2015 we generated over $1.2 billion in cash from operations, which was an increase of more than 45% compared to calendar year 2014. And we returned more than $410 million to our shareholders through stock repurchases and dividends. We're very pleased with what we've achieved this quarter as well as this calendar year.
Shipments continued at a healthy level in the December quarter, totaling $1,288,000,000, which was a little bit above the midpoint of our guidance. As we anticipated, memory shipments decreased in the quarter with the combined Memory segment representing 65% of total system shipments, and that compares with 72% in the prior quarter.
DRAM shipments made up 42% of the system shipments, which was up from 32% in the previous quarter. DRAM investments continue to be largely focused on 20-nanometer conversions. Customers continue to ramp NAND and other nonvolatile memory technologies, which made up 23% of the system shipments, and this was down from the 40% level that we saw in the September quarter. NAND investments were, again, primarily directed towards deployment of 3D NAND capacity.
December quarter Foundry shipments were 25% of system shipments, and this was up from 18% in the previous quarter. Foundry spending was broad-based with the combination of 10-nanometer pilot capability, first-generation FinFET capacity, as well as trailing edge investments. The Logic and Other segment accounted for 10% of system shipments, which was about the same level as last quarter.
Revenue in the quarter came in at $1,426,000,000, which was a little bit above the midpoint of guidance and down 11% compared to the record high level that we saw on the September quarter. Gross margin came in right at the midpoint of guidance at 45.5%. And as I always mention, you should expect to see some quarter-to-quarter variability in gross margin due to multiple factors, such as product mix, customer concentration, as well as overall business volumes. Our financial model continues to be the right tool for you to use to build your models and think about our ongoing financial performance.
Operating expenses in the December quarter declined to $352 million, coming in at 25% of revenue and this compared with 23% in the September quarter. About 63% of the OpEx spend in the quarter was allocated to R&D, which was around the same ratio we've held throughout the calendar year.
Funding of strategic R&D programs to continue our technology and productivity leadership is critical to meeting our objectives of growing the company at a faster pace than the industry. The market share success we are currently enjoying is the result of investments we've made in previous years. We aim to continue that outperformance.
Operating income in the December quarter was $296 million, down from $380 million in the prior quarter. Operating margin was 20.8%, which was down from 23.8% in September and a little bit above the midpoint of the guided range. Operating income and operating margin declined sequentially as a result of the lower revenues in the period.
Our tax rate for the quarter was approximately 7%, down compared to 14% last quarter. The tax rate was lower primarily due to the permanent extension of the R&D tax credit in the United States. A tax rate of low to mid-teens for the remainder of 2016 would be a reasonable number for you to include in your models.
Based on a share count of about 172 million shares, earnings per share for the December quarter were $1.57. This was above the high end of our guided range due to the favorable tax rate in the quarter as well as the higher revenue. The share count includes dilution from the 2016 and 2041 convertible notes with the total dilutive impact of about 11 million shares on a non-GAAP basis. Dilution schedules for the 2016, 2018 and 2041 convertible notes are available on our Investor Relations website for your reference.
In the quarter we returned $48 million in dividend distributions to our shareholders. We did not repurchase any shares in the December quarter, as we have temporarily suspended share repurchases in anticipation of the business combination with KLA-Tencor.
Let me now move to the balance sheet. Cash generation was strong again in the quarter with cash from operations coming in at $295 million. During the quarter cash and short-term investments, including restricted cash, increased to $4.7 billion, up from $4.5 billion in September. Days sales outstanding increased to 70 days versus 62 days last quarter. The increase in DSO was due to the timing of shipments within the quarter with shipments being more biased towards the back half of the period. Inventory turns remain strong at 3.6x.
Deferred revenue at the end of the quarter were $395 million, which was down from last quarter. And I'd just point out, this number excludes $109 million from shipments to customers in Japan, which will revenue in future quarters. I'd like to remind you that those Japan shipments remain as inventory carried at cost on our balance sheet.
Company noncash expenses during the quarter includes the following: $33 million for equity comp, $39 million for amortization and $33 million for depreciation. Capital expenditures were $28 million, which was down from $49 million in the September quarter. CapEx can sometimes be a lumpy number, as you saw in December. CapEx for the year came in at $173 million.
We ended the quarter with approximately 7,300 regular full-time employees. I'd point out that we have been relatively flat headcount-wise for the last 2 quarters.
Entering 2016, we continue to be pleased with the momentum in our business and the progress we're making towards our targeted financial model. For the March quarter, our non-GAAP guidance is as follows. We expect shipment growth to $1,430,000,000 plus or minus $75 million. We expect revenue of $1,300,000,000 plus or minus $75 million. This lower revenue for March is largely consistent with our December shipments.
We expect gross margin of 44% plus or minus 1 percentage point. The margin decline in March is due to both customer as well as product mix. I expect margin to improve from this level as we go through 2016. We forecast operating margins of 17% plus or minus 1 percentage point. And finally, we're forecasting earnings per share of $1.07 plus or minus $0.10 based on a share count of approximately 172.5 million shares.
In the outlook for the company, we are optimistic in the trajectory of demand for our products and services. We expect shipments and revenue in the June quarter will be stronger than in the March quarter. With the anticipated strength in shipments, we expect to grow our deferred revenue balances in the first half of 2016. As we sit here today, I expect the second half of the year will have a stronger top line than the first half due to investments in Leading Edge, Foundry and Logic.
That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, please open the call for questions."

So there's a plus or minus at each one of those. So that's a kind of segment composition. 
Our sense of first half, second half WFE, we're currently modeling a 47, 48, 53, 52 type of profile. So overall, stronger second half than first half. DRAM, Foundry and Microprocessors, all second half stronger than first half. And NAND, to your point, slightly stronger in the first half of the year. 
And I would say that the upside, to the extent there's upside, in the first half/second half split that I've just characterized with NAND is all defined around the performance of devices and then momentum in kind of SSD markets and so on and so forth. So that's the summary of our modeling at this point in the year."

Just to remind you, our estimate of inflection-based spending as a percentage of WFE in the year just completed was in the low 30% range. And by the time we get to '18, our estimate is 55% or slightly higher. So the SAM expansion story, the targeted market share story certainly have us optimistic that we are continuing to grow the company in an environment of flat WFE, and the economics that we're targeting are exactly as we've communicated in our long-term financial model.

So let me deal with margin and OpEx together. The full process relative to the operating expenses of the company is we have a tremendous opportunity here to continue to outgrow the industry and our commitments to invest in R&D to support that initiative is a really important commitment for the company. So we're not jerking left and right our commitments to customers around enabling technology. We're committed and we have to work through these short-term kind of variability that we see as a result of concentrated customers these days. 
But having said that, we talked a lot about R&D and SG&A percentages, so Doug can talk more if you want to in the call, but I think you know what we're trying to do there. We've essentially, in the guidance provided today, retained or constrained the operating expense investments to a level that's pretty similar to the March '15 quarter. And just to remind you, in March '15 we were just coming off the back of a $5 billion revenue year. Now we're coming off the back of a $6 billion revenue year. So to have the operating expenses at the $350 million level I think is a testament to the business model and the commitment to the management team to be responsible in the context of long-term and short-term performance improvement. 
Last thing to say relative to gross margins, I don't think we're the first large equipment company to message December to March gross margin contraction. In the scheme of things, the best counsel we have for you is the long-term model, and the 22% range of operating income is still the ambition of the company in the '16 year."

I mean, we have been very disciplined making a -- in making the investment in our future, long-term future a priority for the company. It's a multiyear commitment that extends way back. 
And it's a tough thing to get balanced, but I think the company did a nice job of identifying the opportunity to grow through technology inflections. The technology and engineering or resource company did a fantastic job delivering us competitive products and services. Our field organization nailed the interface with the customer in terms of positioning but, more importantly, supporting ramps and productivity agendas and installed base performance. 
So it's a total team effort. And our plan is to build upon that foundation. And whether we can do exactly the same thing in the next 3 years that we did in the last 3 time will tell, but you've got a pretty committed company to a growth trajectory that is profitable."

At a segment level, the story that I describe for WFE is slightly stronger foundry year-over-year relative to a slightly weaker memory investment. So historically that's meant something to us in terms of the degree of outperformance. But one piece of really important context is we really positioned well in the image sensor transitions. And I think when other folks were struggling a little bit with logic spend reductions we generally kind of marched right through that because of that positioning. And it's as strong today as it was then. Our momentum in foundries and in microprocessor logic is now, I hope, well understood to be a positive trajectory for the company. 
And so we still believe that in essentially a flat WFE our SAM increases. One part of that is the inflections message, right? So something like a 33% reference point for 2015, the proportion of WFE that is inflection based, and that's kind of walking its way to the 55% level. We've just come off a stunning market share year for the company and we're going to keep kind of working hard. And the long-term market share objectives I think are well within grasp at this point.

This afternoon, I will share highlights from the March quarter, provide some perspective on how we're performing relative to our growth objectives and share commentary on the industry environments so far this year. Prior to turning the call over to Doug, I will conclude my prepared remarks with a status update on our planned business combination with KLA-Tencor.
Lam Research is off to a very solid beginning in 2016 with our March quarter results providing evidence of continued strong execution against our longer-term outperformance ambition.
2016 is a year where connected with the device architecture and process flow decisions of our customers also with our decisions several years to back to invest for the long-term in enabling key technology inflections, we actively compete for more than 30% of WFE.
In the quarter just ended, we delivered revenues and shipments above the midpoint of our guidance and gross margin, operating income and non-GAAP EPS that were all above the high end of our guidance range. We demonstrated business model flexibility by managing core operating expenses to a level last reported a year ago while growing investments in R&D over the same period.
Importantly, the results this quarter reflect a healthy balance of leadership focused on both our short-term and long-term. Most important, of course, is our long-term commitments to the success of our customers.
Overall, our performance is a testament to the high-quality focus, the teamwork and execution of Lam employees throughout the company. And for that, I would like to thank them all sincerely.
As we evaluate the performance of Lam currently and develop strategies to support our vision for the combined company, we are driven by the opportunity for compelling value creation. Standalone and combined with KLA-Tencor, we model robust and predictable cash generation, supplemented by growth outperformance. And over time, more opportunities for investing in profitable growth and returning excess cash to shareholders.
The growth thesis for Lam over the next several years is rooted in our strategy to partner closely with our customers to enable key technology inflections such as 3D device architecture and multi-patterning process flows and is validated by our performance in the last several years. As our results reveal, this strategy is working and is enabling the increased strategic relevance of Lam Research in our industry. Calendar 2016 is a year where industry spending trends are increasingly biased to disciplined and strategic investments across most device segments which lends further supports to our conviction in a multiyear company outperformance opportunity. This spending bias we contend also is a driver for continued healthy WFE spending levels for the foreseeable future despite somewhat tepid macro conditions.
Now looking at our progress across the inflection. First with 3D NAND. We see increasing adoption rates of this technology, strong traction for our products and service offerings and a growing clarity around the next generation device industry roadmaps.
First-generation 3D NAND production involves etching through 30 or more stacked pairs of films. But these are growing to 60 or more pairs for next generation devices, resulting in increased challenges for critical high aspect ratio dielectric etch and also staircase conductor etch. Our Flex F and G series dielectric products featuring proprietary iron energy control and high selectivity have tripled their installed base in the last year and established Lam as the market leader in dielectric etch segments. Our Kiyo conductor etch platform with industry leading etch selectivity has enabled more than a 2x improvement in the number of layers that can be etched in-situ for staircase applications with the results that a majority of 3D NAND customers have now included Lam in their staircase etch HVM purchases.
Our VECTOR ALD platform offers differentiated processing capability, allowing expansion of our SAM for multi-pattern to now include 3D NAND gap filled applications also.
Turning to FinFETs and multi-patterning. During the quarter, we continued to build on the momentum of our differentiated Kiyo with higher conductor etch and flex dielectric etch platforms for critical front-end-of-line FinFET transistor solutions for 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer technology nodes. As we communicated at the recent SPIE lithography conference, atomic level processing to control variability is increasingly critical for multiple patterning and that need will persist in an EUV-enabled environment. Our customers at the conference continues to affirm their strategy of levering improved -- leveraging improvements in both EUV and multi-patterning to address their needs and together with our peer group, we have conviction, the deposition and etch multi-patterning applications will grow for many years to come.
Fundamental to enabling our share gains has been the performance of our 35,000-plus process module installed base and in calendar '15, a 10 point improvement in our customer satisfaction indexes. On this last point, it was extremely satisfying that our logic segment capabilities and partnership have progressed to a point where we were one of very few companies recognized recently as preferred quality supplier to Intel. The focus we explained at SEMICON West 2015 of developing new value-added products and services is intended to provide our customers productivity, utilization and risk benefits in addition to creating new SAM growth opportunities across leading edge and mature technology nodes for our company. As planned, over a multiyear period, we are on schedule for our installed base business revenues to outgrow materially our installed base units expansion.
In calendar '16, our emphasis includes implementing systemic improvements in customer satisfaction, increasing our spares market share with new products differentiated by Lam's specific OEM knowledge and learning and building upon the early adoption successes of new installed base, advanced services and productivity solutions achieved last year.
Now I would like to provide a brief update on demand and WFE trends. Expectations of the experts for global economic growth have been revised slightly lower since our last report. End market demand transfer technology products remain mixed with additional weaknesses in the PC market and relatively stable, although lower-than-expected growth rates in mobile. Meanwhile, we continue to expect solid demand for leading-edge selection in the enterprise market driven by the long-term move to the cloud storage and computation applications both. More importantly perhaps, we believe that Lam and the equipment industry broadly have an opportunity and responsibility to innovate for and with our customers to create a catalyst for the high levels of IC unit demand. Certainly, that is our conviction and thinking, both as a standalone process company and combined with KLA-Tencor.
Our outlook for the memory market continues to reflect the offsetting factors of strong 3D NAND spending and meaningful declines in DRAM spending driven largely by PC weakness year-over-year. The latter has resulted in now well-publicized and rational response from our DRAM customers, which should continue to help improve the IC unit supply and demand balance. We expect the DRAM capacity to remain essentially flat to slightly down this year. 
DRAM WFE, we estimate to represent mid to high $5 billion spending this year, focused almost excessively on 20-nanometer and 1x nanometer upgrade investments to improve cost competitiveness and device performance. We expect nonvolatile memory industry WFE to exceed $9 billion in 2016 with every industry participants committed to the 3D roadmap.
The spending patterns and the strategic actions by our customers in 2016 offer the clearest evidence yet to 3D NAND and new nonvolatile memories are evolving to have a transformational influence on the computer and the storage industry as device and systems architectures involve for consumer and enterprise cloud applications. 3D NAND in particular has an integration scheme that is heavily biased towards deposition and etch, a statement that is increasingly through as the customers transition from building greenfield 3D fabs to conversions from 2D to 3D and eventually from first-generation 3D through subsequent vertical scaling. 
We assess that the equipment industry remains on track to ship a cumulative 350,000 to 400,000 wafer starts per month of 3D NAND capacity by the end of 2016, which includes around 2/3 by year-end production qualified. The headline for Lam is that with just under a quarter of global capacity 3D NAND capable by the end of this year, we are in a very early stages of a multiyear growth opportunity. There is much for us to be excited about.
We continue to expect flat to slightly better WFE in Foundry and Logic, where the majority of the spending is focused on a strategic investments to enable 10-nanometer technology. Although as stated previously, IoT applications, automotive, wearables and low-end phones, et cetera, are driving a healthy resurgence of 28-nanometer capital expenditure.
Doug will provide more details in our financial guidance but our shipments outlook in a flattish WFE environment is consistent with our ongoing outperformance commentary and prior long-term models. We end this quarter with our strongest backlog and deferred revenue balance combined in the recent history of Lam and we expect strong shipments in June with sequential growth of approximately 9%. We retain our 2016 WFE outlook of $33 billion, plus or minus $2 billion. And from a momentum perspective, guide the first half '16 shipments stronger than our second half '15. And although slightly muted perhaps from our more conservative DRAM outlook today and some first half, second half rebalancing, we're still encouraged by the potential for slightly stronger shipments in second half '16 over our first half '16.
Now I will conclude with some comments on the planned combination of Lam Research with KLA-Tencor. As a reminder, with continued execution and our priority on being #1 in customer trust, we have the confidence that standalone Lam Research has a continuing growth outperformance opportunity over the next several years. We have elected to use this recent period of strength as an exciting outlook to pursue an even more strategic agenda to innovate beyond what is possible in 2 great companies separately for the benefit of all stakeholders. We invested a number of years developing this strategy with our customers and believe with all subsequent interactions, they are materially invested in the success of our mission. They trust our genuine commitments to the broad ecosystem and they are increasingly motivated by the opportunity for new joint development projects together.
As we move through the early stages of integration planning, and our conviction in the business combination and the opportunities it will drive for the customer and combined company is only getting stronger. Integration planning team has been focus on understanding the organizational design and business processes of the 2 companies in order to ensure a seamless transition for our customers, suppliers and employees. We have announced internally and introduced to our customers a very strong global leadership team with balanced representation from both companies. Although we remain 2 separate companies until the date of the deal closing, and until that time, our most fundamental responsibility is to deliver on preexisting commitments made to our customers, comprehensive integration activities have reinforced our confidence in achieving both the stated cost and revenue synergies.
In recent weeks, we received approval from both KT and Lam stockholders and have received regulatory approvals in Israel, Taiwan and Ireland. We are actively engaged with all required -- all other required agencies and remain confident that we will close the transaction some time around midyear. Our best estimate is June/July plus or minus a couple of months. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Doug, who will provide an update on the March quarter and our guidance for June."

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today in what I know is a busy earnings day.We're pleased with the momentum to be starting the year with. Our results for the March quarter came in above the midpoint",1202,"Okay, great. Thank you, Martin. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today in what I know is a busy earnings day.
We're pleased with the momentum to be starting the year with. Our results for the March quarter came in above the midpoint of guidance for all metrics.
Shipments for the quarter were $1,446,000,000, which was up 12% sequentially and above the midpoint of the guided range. Memory shipments were strong in the quarter with the combined memory segment making up 70% of total system level shipments and that compares with 65% in the prior quarter. Memory shipments were made -- weighted heavily toward the nonvolatile segment, which represented 43% of system shipments in the March quarter. This was up from 23% in the prior quarter, driven by ongoing customer investments in 3D NAND to wafer capacity as well as increasing layer counts. We continue to see 3D NAND spending focus on both new wafers as well as technology conversions. DRAM made up 27% of the shipments, which was down from 42% in the December quarter. We're seeing continued disciplined spending in the DRAM segment with a focus on 20-nanometer technology conversions to both reduce cost per bid and to enable improve performance.
The Foundry segment was up slightly in dollar terms in the March quarter accounting for 23% of system shipments. Foundry spending is focused on both leading edge, 10-nanometer investments as well as continued spending at 28-nanometer and above. The logic and other segment contributed 7% of system shipments.
Shipments into the China region were particularly strong in March, representing 27% of total shipments. The majority of spending in China continues to be spent by global multinational customers, putting capacity in place within the country.
Revenue came in at $1,314 million in the March quarter, which was down roughly 8% from the December quarter. This revenue result was consistent with our expectations for the quarter. Gross margin for the period came in at 45.1%, somewhat stronger than we expected. Better field and factory utilization and favorable product mix benefited gross margin in the quarter. And as I've shared with you before, our gross margins are a function of a number of factors such as overall business volumes, product mix and customer concentration and you should expect to see some variability quarter-to-quarter.
I'd like to remind you that our financial model is still the best way to think about our ongoing performance.
Operatives expense in the quarter were roughly flat at $350 million and this compares to $352 million in the December quarter. The majority of our spending continues to be allocated to funding our critical R&D programs. These investments are important in preparing for the current and next generation technology inflections, enabling us to take full advantage of the opportunities ahead of us.
Operating income in the March quarter came in at $242 million and that compares to $296 million in the prior quarter. Operating margin was 18.4%, above the high-end of the guided range due to both the higher revenue as well as a stronger gross margin.
The tax rate for the quarter was 14% and that compares with 7% last quarter. That, by the way, was about what we expected. The tax rate for low to midteens for the remainder of 2016 would be reasonable for you to use in your earnings models. Based on a share count of approximately 172 million shares, earnings per share for the March quarter were $1.18 above the guided range. The share count includes dilution on a non-GAAP basis from both the 2016 and 2041 convertible notes with the total dilutive impact of about 11 million shares. Dilution schedules for the 2016, 2018 and 2041 convertible notes are available on our Investor Relations website for your reference.
We returned $48 million in dividend distributions to our shareholders. This equated to $0.30 on a per share basis. We did not repurchased any shares in the open market in the March quarter, consistent with our stated plans ahead of closing the proposed KLA-Tencor transaction.
So now, let me turn to the balance sheet. We continue to have a healthy cash position. Cash and short-term investments, including restricted cash, increased to $4.8 billion at the end of the quarter. Cash from operations was $183 million and that compares to $295 million in December. The March shipment profile was biased towards the back-end of the quarter, resulting in an increase in both accounts receivable and days sales outstanding quarter-over-quarter. DSO increased to 86 days in March. I expect this will reduce in the June quarter as linearity is less back-end weighted. The quality of our civil balance continues to be very strong. We've got a blue-chip set of customers.
Inventory turns declined to 3-point to times due to the inventory build for the growth in the June quarter. Days payable outstanding extended to 46 days as a result of the timing of purchases within the quarter. Cash generation was partially offset by dividends paid as well as capital expenditures. We exited the quarter with deferred revenues of $511 million which was up from $395 million in December. This amount excludes $121 million in shipments to customers in Japan, which will revenue in future quarters. These Japanese shipments remains on our balance sheet as inventory carried to cost. company noncash expenses for the quarter included $35 million for equity comp, $39 million for amortization and $35 million for depreciation. Capital expenditures were $46 million, which was up from $28 million in the December quarter. We ended the quarter with approximately 7,300 regular full-time employees, which was flat with December.
Looking ahead now, I'd like to provide a non-GAAP guidance for the June quarter. We expect shipments of $1,575,000,000, plus or minus $75 million. We expect revenue of $1,525,000,000, again, plus or minus $75 million. We expect gross margin of 46%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. I do expect that -- excuse me, the September quarter gross margin will be a little bit softer than in June due to customer concentration and product mix. Let me forecast operating margins of 22%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. And finally, we're forecasting earnings per share of $1.63, plus or minus $0.10 based on a share count of approximately 173 million shares. We're pleased with our performance this quarter and with the guidance we've just shared for the June quarter. We're delivering financial results coming from the strategic focus of the company by creating differentiated product and service offerings that enable the success of our customers. 
As we sit here today, I continue to expect the second half of the year will have a stronger top line than the first half due to investments in Leading Edge, Foundry and Logic.
And just 1 last item I'd like to share with you. We will not be doing our normal Investor Day at SEMICON West this year. Our plans will be to do something later in the year, likely in the month of November. We'll announce exact dates and venue later in the year as we finalize our plans.
That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, Martin and I would now like to open up the call for questions."

And so clearly, there is upside to the extent that there are indigenous company investments made, which to your point require access to technology one way or the other, either it's acquired, partnered or developed internally. My instinct is that in the long-term, the investment that's available to our industry, the investments in WFE naturally balances around supply and demand. And so is there a spike at the beginning of a geographic commitment to an investment like China? Probably yes. Exactly how much? To be determined in my opinion. But I think at least, perhaps if not more important question is, what are the opportunities for incremental IC unit demand to be created from these investments? And what's capital additions would prevail in that context? And I think we all recognize that incremental IC unit growth only occurs when there are outperformance or cost benefits above and beyond our baseline. And certainly, the partnerships that emerge in China between design houses, semiconductor companies, electronics companies and ultimately semiconductor manufacturers, create opportunities for partnerships to be a capitalist demand. And whether performance benefits prevail is to be determined and cost benefits obviously capture the government incentives and agenda that are relevance particularly in China in the next several years. So I do expect a bump to be determined how big. I do think it's somewhat to open, I do think it will be executed with discipline. And I think in the long term, it's all about the cost and the performance of the chip."

Probably 1/3 of that is being qualified at the end of the year, so it will take some time to get production ready. There are I think 1.3 million wafer starts per month to capacity in the nonvolatile memory space. So the headline is, less than 25% of it is capable of making a 3D device by the end of this year. I think your question obviously is specifically unanswerable because at the end of the day, the pace at which the customer transitions is a byproduct of success in the marketplace on performance and cost, but the momentum is clearly there. It is the device and our customers have made that commitment I think 70, 95% of spending this year is 3D device architecture and they will tell, as best I can tell, execute that over a 4-year period, plus or minus a bit.

So for me, as the technology roadmap of the customer gets more challenging, the bigger the proportion of etch-related differentiation will be occupied by atomic level control. The deposition also might be slightly difference. And again, this is clearly a commentary for Lam Research because we don't have the comprehensive deposition product portfolio. We have at least 1 sizable gap in the product portfolio compared to others. And so the atomic level deposition product road map for us has an opportunity to be disruptive more holistically and creates growth potentials for Lam Research above and beyond what might be available for a generic deposition kind of baseline."

This afternoon, I will share highlights from the March quarter, provide some perspective on how we're performing relative to our growth objectives and share commentary on the industry environment so far this year. Prior to turning the call over to Doug, I will conclude my prepared remarks with a status update on our planned business combination with KLA-Tencor.
Lam Research is off to a very solid beginning in 2016 with our March quarter results providing evidence of continued strong execution against our longer-term outperformance ambition. 2016 is a year where, connected with the device architecture and process flow decisions of our customers also with our decisions several years to back to invest for the long-term in enabling key technology inflections, we actively compete for more than 30% of WFE.
In the quarter just ended, we delivered revenues and shipments above the midpoint of our guidance and gross margin, operating income and non-GAAP EPS that were all above the high end of our guidance range. We demonstrated business model flexibility by managing core operating expenses to a level last reported a year ago, while growing investments in R&D over the same period.
Importantly, the results this quarter reflect a healthy balance of leadership focus on both our short term and long term, most important, of course, is our long-term commitments to the success of our customers. Overall, our performance is a testament to the high-quality focus, the teamwork and execution of Lam employees throughout the company and for that, I would like to thank them all sincerely.
As we evaluate the performance of Lam currently and develop strategies to support our vision for the combined company, we are driven by the opportunity for compelling value creation. Stand-alone and combined with KLA-Tencor, we model robust and predictable cash generation supplemented by growth outperformance and over time, more opportunities for investing in profitable growth and returning excess cash to shareholders.
The growth thesis for Lam over the next several years is rooted in our strategy to partner closely with our customers to enable key technology inflections, such as 3D device architecture and multi-patterning process flows and is validated by our performance in the last several years. As our results reveal, this strategy is working and is enabling the increased strategic relevance of Lam Research in our industry. Calendar 2016 is a year where industry spending trends are increasingly biased to disciplined and strategic investments across most device segments, which lends further supports to our conviction in a multiyear company outperformance opportunity. This spending bias we contend also is a driver for continued healthy WFE spending levels for the foreseeable future despite somewhat tepid macro conditions.
Now looking at our progress across the inflection. First with 3D NAND. We see increasing adoption rates of this technology, strong traction for our products and service offerings and a growing clarity around next-generation device industry road maps. First-generation 3D NAND production involves etching through 30 or more stacked pairs of films, but these are growing to 60 or more pairs for next-generation devices, resulting in increased challenges for critical high aspect ratio dielectric etch and also staircase conductor etch. Our Flex F and G series dielectric products featuring proprietary ion energy control and high selectivity have tripled their installed base in the last year and established Lam as the market leader in dielectric etch segments.
Our Kiyo conductor etch platform with industry leading etch selectivity has enabled more than a 2x improvement in the number of layers that can be etched in-situ for staircase applications with the results that a majority of 3D NAND customers have now included Lam in their staircase etch HVM purchases. Our VECTOR ALD platform offers differentiated processing capability, allowing expansion of our SAM for multi-patterning to now include 3D NAND gap fill applications also.
Turning to FinFETs and multi-patterning. During the quarter, we continued to build on the momentum of our differentiated Kiyo with Hydra conductor etch and Flex dielectric etch platforms for critical front-end-of-line FinFET transistor solutions for 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer technology nodes. As we communicated at the recent SPIE lithography conference, atomic-level processing to control variability is increasingly critical for multiple patterning and that need will persist in an EUV-enabled environment. Our customers at the conference continues to affirm their strategy of levering improved -- leveraging improvements in both EUV and multi-patterning to address their needs. And together with our peer group, we have conviction that deposition and etch multi-patterning applications will grow for many years to come.
Fundamental to enabling our share gains has been the performance of our 35,000-plus process module installed base and in calendar '15, a 10-point improvement in our customer satisfaction indexes. On this last point, it was extremely satisfying that our logic segment capabilities and partnership have progressed to a point where we were one of very few companies recognized recently as preferred quality supplier to Intel.
The focus we explained at SEMICON West 2015 of developing new value-added products and services is intended to provide our customers productivity, utilization and reuse benefits in addition to creating new SAM growth opportunities across leading edge and mature technology nodes for our company. As planned, over a multiyear period, we are on schedule for our installed base business revenues to outgrow materially our installed base units expansion. In calendar '16, our emphasis includes implementing systemic improvements in customer satisfaction, increasing our spares market share with new products differentiated by Lam-specific OEM knowledge and learning and building upon the early adoption successes of new installed base advanced services and productivity solutions achieved last year.
Now I would like to provide a brief update on demand and WFE trends. Expectations of the experts for global economic growth have been revised slightly lower since our last report. End market demand trends for technology products remained mixed with additional weaknesses in the PC market and relatively stable although lower-than-expected growth rates in mobile. Meanwhile, we continue to expect solid demand for leading-edge silicon in the enterprise market driven by the long-term move to the cloud, storage and computation applications both.
More importantly perhaps, we believe that Lam and the equipment industry broadly have an opportunity and responsibility to innovate for and with our customers to create a catalyst for the high levels of IC unit demand. Certainly, that is our conviction and thinking, both as a stand-alone process company and combined with KLA-Tencor.
Our outlook for the memory market continues to reflect the offsetting factors of strong 3D NAND spending and meaningful declines in DRAM spending driven largely by PC weakness year-over-year. The latter has resulted in now well publicized and rational response from our DRAM customers, which should continue to help improve the IC unit supply/demand balance. We expect DRAM capacity to remain essentially flat to slightly down this year.
DRAM WFE, we estimate to represent mid to high $5 billion spending this year, focused almost exclusively on 20-nanometer and 1x nanometer upgrade investments to improve cost competitiveness and device performance. We expect nonvolatile memory industry WFE to exceed $9 billion in 2016 with every industry participants committed to the 3D road map.
Spending patterns and the strategic actions by our customers in 2016 offer the clearest evidence yet. The 3D NAND and new nonvolatile memories are evolving to have a transformational influence on the compute and storage industry as device and system architectures evolve for consumer and enterprise cloud applications. 3D NAND, in particular, has an integration scheme that is heavily biased towards deposition and etch, a statement that is increasingly true as the customers transition from building greenfield 3D fabs to conversions from 2D to 3D and eventually from first-generation 3D through subsequent vertical scaling.
We assess that the equipment industry remains on track to ship a cumulative 350,000 to 400,000 wafer starts per month of 3D NAND capacity by the end of 2016, which includes around 2/3 by year-end production qualified. The headline for Lam is that with just under a quarter of global capacity 3D NAND-capable by the end of this year, we are in a very early stages of a multiyear growth opportunity. There is much for us to be excited about.
We continue to expect flat to slightly better WFE in Foundry and Logic where the majority of the spending is focused on a strategic investments to enable 10-nanometer technology. Although as stated previously, IoT applications, automotive, wearables and low-end phones, et cetera, are driving a healthy resurgence of 28-nanometer capital expenditure.
Doug will provide more details in our financial guidance, but our shipments outlook in a flattish WFE environment is consistent with our ongoing outperformance commentary and prior long-term models. We ended this quarter with our strongest backlog and deferred revenue balance combined in the recent history of Lam, and we expect stronger shipments in June with sequential growth of approximately 9%. We retain our 2016 WFE outlook of $33 billion plus or minus $2 billion, and from a momentum perspective, guide the first half '16 shipments stronger than our second half '15. And although slightly muted perhaps from our more conservative DRAM outlook today and some first half, second half rebalancing, we're still encouraged by the potential for slightly stronger shipments second half '16 over our first half '16.
Now I will conclude with some comments on the planned combination of Lam Research with KLA-Tencor. As a reminder, with continued execution and our priority on being #1 in customer trust, we have the confidence that stand-alone Lam Research has a continuing growth outperformance opportunity over the next several years. We have elected to use this recent period of strength and an exciting outlook to pursue an even more strategic agenda to innovate beyond what is possible in 2 great companies separately for the benefit of all stakeholders. We invested a number of years developing this strategy with our customers and believe with all subsequent interactions, they are materially invested in the success of our vision. They trust our genuine commitments to the broad ecosystem, and they are increasingly motivated by the opportunity for new joint development projects together.
As we move through the early stages of integration planning, our conviction in the business combination and the opportunities it will drive for the customer and combined company is only getting stronger. The integration planning team has been focused on understanding the organizational design and business processes of the 2 companies in order to ensure a seamless transition for our customers, suppliers and employees. We have announced internally and introduced to our customers a very strong global leadership team with balanced representation from both companies. Although we remain 2 separate companies until the date of the deal closing, and until that time our most fundamental responsibility is to deliver on preexisting commitments made to our customers, comprehensive integration activities have reinforced our confidence in achieving both the stated cost and revenue synergies.
In recent weeks, we received approval from both KT and Lam stockholders and have received regulatory approvals in Israel, Taiwan and Ireland. We are actively engaged with all required -- all other required agencies and remain confident that we will close the transaction some time around midyear. Our best estimate is June, July plus or minus a couple of months.
With that, let me turn the call over to Doug who will provide an update on the March quarter and our guidance for June."

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today in what I know is a busy earnings day.We're pleased with the momentum to be starting the year with. Our results for the March quarter came in above the midpoint",1198,"Okay. Great. Thank you, Martin. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today in what I know is a busy earnings day.
We're pleased with the momentum to be starting the year with. Our results for the March quarter came in above the midpoint of guidance for all metrics. Shipments for the quarter were $1,446,000,000, which was up 12% sequentially and above the midpoint of the guided range. Memory shipments were strong in the quarter with the combined memory segment making up 70% of total system level shipments and that compares with 65% in the prior quarter.
Memory shipments were made -- were weighted heavily toward the nonvolatile segment, which represented 43% of system shipments in the March quarter. This was up from 23% in the prior quarter driven by ongoing customer investments in 3D NAND wafer capacity as well as increasing layer counts. We continue to see 3D NAND spending focused on both new wafers as well as technology conversions. DRAM made up 27% of the shipments, which was down from 42% in the December quarter. We're seeing continued disciplined spending in the DRAM segment with a focus on 20-nanometer technology conversions to both reduce cost per bit and to enable improved performance.
The Foundry segment was up slightly in dollar terms in the March quarter, accounting for 23% of system shipments. Foundry spending is focused on both leading-edge 10-nanometer investments as well as continued spending at 28-nanometer and above. The Logic and Other segment contributed 7% of system shipments.
Shipments into the China region were particularly strong in March, representing 27% of total shipments. The majority of spending in China continues to be spent by global multinational customers, putting capacity in place within the country.
Revenue came in at $1,314,000,000 in the March quarter, which was down roughly 8% from the December quarter. This revenue result was consistent with our expectations for the quarter. Gross margin for the period came in at 45.1%, somewhat stronger than we expected. Better field and factory utilization and favorable product mix benefited gross margin in the quarter. And as I've shared with you before, our gross margins are a function of a number of factors, such as overall business volumes, product mix and customer concentration, and you should expect to see some variability quarter-to-quarter. I'd like to remind you that our financial model is still the best way to think about our ongoing performance.
Operating expenses in the quarter were roughly flat at $350 million, and this compares to $352 million in the December quarter. The majority of our spending continues to be allocated to funding our critical R&D programs. These investments are important in preparing for the current and next-generation technology inflections, enabling us to take full advantage of the opportunities ahead of us.
Operating income in the March quarter came in at $242 million, and that compares to $296 million in the prior quarter. Operating margin was 18.4%, above the high-end of the guided range due to both the higher revenue as well as the stronger gross margin. The tax rate for the quarter was 14%, and that compares with 7% last quarter. That, by the way, was about what we expected. A tax rate in the low to mid-teens for the remainder of 2016 would be reasonable for you to use in your earnings models.
Based on a share count of approximately 172 million shares, earnings per share for the March quarter were $1.18 above the guidance range. This share count includes dilution on a non-GAAP basis from both the 2016 and 2041 convertible notes with the total dilutive impact of about 11 million shares. Dilution schedules for the 2016, 2018 and 2041 convertible notes are available on our Investor Relations website for your reference.
We returned $48 million in dividend distributions to our shareholders. This equated to $0.30 on a per share basis. We did not repurchase any shares in the open market in the March quarter, consistent with our stated plans ahead of closing the proposed KLA-Tencor transaction.
So now let me turn to the balance sheet. We continue to have a healthy cash position. Cash and short-term investments, including restricted cash, increased to $4.8 billion at the end of the quarter. Cash from operations was $183 million, and that compares to $295 million in December. The March shipment profile was biased toward the back end of the quarter, resulting in an increase in both accounts receivable and days sales outstanding quarter-over-quarter. DSO increased to 86 days in March. I expect this will reduce in the June quarter as linearity is less back-end weighted. The quality of our receivable balance continues to be very strong. We've got a blue-chip set of customers.
Inventory turns declined to 3.2x due to the inventory build for the growth in the June quarter. Days payable outstanding extended to 46 days as a result of the timing of purchases within the quarter. Cash generation was partially offset by dividends paid as well as capital expenditures.
We exited the quarter with deferred revenues of $511 million, which was up from $395 million in December. This amount excludes $121 million in shipments to customers in Japan, which will revenue in future quarters. These Japanese shipments remained on our balance sheet as inventory carried at cost. Company noncash expenses for the quarter included $35 million for equity comp, $39 million for amortization and $35 million for depreciation. Capital expenditures were $46 million, which was up from $28 million in the December quarter. We ended the quarter with approximately 7,300 regular full-time employees, which was flat with December.
Looking ahead now, I'd like to provide a non-GAAP guidance for the June quarter. We expect shipments of $1,575,000,000 plus or minus $75 million. We expect revenue of $1,525,000,000, again, plus or minus $75 million. We expect gross margin of 46% plus or minus 1 percentage point. I do expect that -- excuse me, the September quarter gross margin will be a little bit softer than in June due to customer concentration and product mix, and we forecast operating margins of 22% plus or minus 1 percentage point. And finally, we're forecasting earnings per share of $1.63 plus or minus $0.10 based on a share count of approximately 173 million shares.
We're pleased with our performance this quarter and with the guidance we've just shared for the June quarter. We're delivering financial results coming from the strategic focus of the company on creating differentiated product and service offerings that enable success of our customers. As we sit here today, I continue to expect the second half of the year will have a stronger top line than the first half due to investments in leading-edge foundry and logic.
And just one last item I'd like to share with you. We will not be doing our normal Investor Day at SEMICON West this year. Our plans will be to do something later in the year, likely in the month of November. We will announce exact dates and venue later in the year as we finalize our plans.
That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, Martin and I would now like to open up the call for questions."

I mean, the kind of balance of payment, motivation from my point of view at least is very intuitive. As Doug outlined in his prepared comments today, the majority of today's investment is the international companies. And so clearly, there is upside to the extent that there are indigenous company investments made, which to your point require access to technology one way or the other, either it's acquired, partnered or developed internally. My instinct is that in the long term, the investment that's available to our industry, the investments in WFE, naturally balances around supply and demand. And so is there a spike at the beginning of a geographic commitment to an investment like China? Probably yes. And exactly how much, to be determined in my opinion. But I think at least perhaps if not more important question is what are the opportunities for incremental IC unit demand to be created from these investments, and what's capital equipment additions would prevail in that context. And I think we all recognize that incremental IC unit growth only occurs when there are outperformance or cost benefits above and beyond the baseline. And certainly, the partnerships that emerge in China between design houses, semiconductor companies, electronics companies and ultimately semiconductor manufacturers create opportunities for partnerships to be a catalyst demand. And whether performance benefits prevail is to be determined, and cost benefits obviously capture the government incentives and agenda that are relevant particularly in China in the next several years. So I do expect a bump to be determined how big. I do think it's somewhat authentic [ph] agenda. I do think it will be executed with discipline. And I think in the long term, it's all about the cost and the performance of a chip."

Probably 1/3 of that is being qualified at the end of the year, so it will take some time to get production ready. There are, I think, 1.3 million wafer starts per month of capacity in the nonvolatile memory space. So the headline is less than 25% of it is capable of making a 3D device by the end of this year. I think your question obviously is specifically unanswerable because at the end of the day, the pace at which the customer transitions is a byproduct of success in the marketplace on performance and cost, but the momentum is clearly there. It is the device, and our customers have made that commitment. So I think 70% [ph], 95% of spending this year is 3D device architecture and they will, as best I can tell, execute that over a 4-year period plus or minus a bit.

So that's probably a company-specific commentary that you're going to have to kind of absorb and digest from a modeling point of view, but the real swing factor in terms of WFE was PC units and the consequence in DRAM.

And the headline was the most important selection decision is the production tool of record position, and that's true for us as it is anybody else in the industry and we all work really hard to get a development tool of record position. But the only way you actually extend that into a production tool of record position, which is where the money gets spent, is by demonstrating an ability to meet the specifications that you sold or positions and making a productive and repeatable and having kind of consistency of high-volume manufacturing production for our customers. So that's a continuum, and all of a sudden it's not just, ""Oh, we're done. We never have to worry about it anymore."" We have to work really hard every single day to make sure that the advantage that we've been able to present that has legitimized our participation in staircase selections is something that sustains itself over multiple years, and that's clearly the objective for the company. So it's really about just the natural passing of time and transitioning from D2R [ph] and P2R [ph] staircase is an important application. It's not the most critical. I think you recollect that we have about 90% market share in the critical etch after [ph] the critical etch and deposition applications in the 3D NAND transition, and that's the kind of foundation of competitive strength for the company. And the staircase is something we work hard to position in the HVM selections, and we're very pleased with the results, although we've got more work to do and more upside, of course."

I think it's a commentary on more capability, more dependability, higher barriers of entry around the critical applications focus that we have in our company and the position of strength we have in etch. So for me, as the technology road map of the customer gets more challenging, the bigger the proportion of etch-related differentiation will be occupied by atomic level control. In the deposition etch [ph], there might be slightly difference, and again, this is clearly a commentary for Lam Research because we don't have the comprehensive deposition product portfolio. We have at least one sizable gap in the product portfolio compared to others. And so the atomic level deposition product road map for us has an opportunity to be disruptive more holistically and creates growth potentials for Lam Research above and beyond what might be available for a generic deposition kind of baseline."

This afternoon, I will share highlights from the March quarter, provide some perspective on how we're performing relative to our growth objectives and share commentary on the industry environment so far this year. Prior to turning the call over to Doug, I will conclude my prepared remarks with a status update on our planned business combination with KLA-Tencor.
Lam Research is off to a very solid beginning in 2016 with our March quarter results providing evidence of continued strong execution against our longer-term outperformance ambition. 2016 is a year where, connected with the device architecture and process flow decisions of our customers also with our decisions several years to back to invest for the long term in enabling key technology inflections, we actively compete for more than 30% of WFE.
In the quarter just ended, we delivered revenues and shipments above the midpoint of our guidance and gross margin, operating income and non-GAAP EPS that were all above the high end of our guidance range. We demonstrated business model flexibility by managing core operating expenses to a level last reported a year ago, while growing investments in R&D over the same period.
Importantly, the results this quarter reflect a healthy balance of leadership focus on both our short term and long term, most important, of course, is our long-term commitment to the success of our customers. Overall, our performance is a testament to the high-quality focus, the teamwork and execution of Lam employees throughout the company and for that, I would like to thank them all sincerely.
As we evaluate the performance of Lam currently and develop strategies to support our vision for the combined company, we are driven by the opportunity for compelling value creation. Stand-alone and combined with KLA-Tencor, we model robust and predictable cash generation supplemented by growth outperformance and over time, more opportunities for investing in profitable growth and returning excess cash to shareholders.
The growth thesis for Lam over the next several years is rooted in our strategy to partner closely with our customers to enable key technology inflections, such as 3D device architecture and multi-patterning process flows and is validated by our performance in the last several years. As our results reveal, this strategy is working and is enabling the increased strategic relevance of Lam Research in our industry. Calendar 2016 is a year where industry spending trends are increasingly biased to disciplined and strategic investments across most device segments, which lends further supports to our conviction in a multiyear company outperformance opportunity. This spending bias we contend also is a driver for continued healthy WFE spending levels for the foreseeable future despite somewhat tepid macro conditions.
Now looking at our progress across the inflection. First with 3D NAND. We see increasing adoption rates of this technology, strong traction for our products and service offerings and a growing clarity around next-generation device industry road maps. First-generation 3D NAND production involves etching through 30 or more stacked pairs of films, but these are growing to 60 or more pairs for next-generation devices, resulting in increased challenges for critical high aspect ratio dielectric etch and also staircase conductor etch. Our Flex F and G series dielectric products featuring proprietary ion energy control and high selectivity have tripled their installed base in the last year and established Lam as the market leader in dielectric etch segments.
Our Kiyo conductor etch platform with industry leading etch selectivity has enabled more than a 2x improvement in the number of layers that can be etched in-situ for staircase applications with the results that a majority of 3D NAND customers have now included Lam in their staircase etch HVM purchases. Our VECTOR ALD platform offers differentiated processing capability, allowing expansion of our SAM for multi-patterning to now include 3D NAND gap fill applications also.
Turning to FinFETs and multi-patterning. During the quarter, we continued to build on the momentum of our differentiated Kiyo with Hydra conductor etch and Flex dielectric etch platforms for critical front-end-of-line FinFET transistor solutions for 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer technology nodes. As we communicated at the recent SPIE lithography conference, atomic-level processing to control variability is increasingly critical for multiple patterning, and that need will persist in an EUV-enabled environment. Our customers at the conference continued to affirm their strategy of levering improved -- leveraging improvements in both EUV and multi-patterning to address their needs. And together with our peer group, we have conviction that deposition and etch multi-patterning applications will grow for many years to come.
Fundamental to enabling our share gains has been the performance of our 35,000-plus process module installed base and in calendar '15, a 10-point improvement in our customer satisfaction indexes. On this last point, it was extremely satisfying that our logic segment capabilities and partnership have progressed to a point where we were one of very few companies recognized recently as preferred quality supplier to Intel.
The focus we explained at SEMICON West 2015 of developing new value-added products and services is intended to provide our customers productivity, utilization and reuse benefits in addition to creating new SAM growth opportunities across leading edge and mature technology nodes for our company. As planned, over a multiyear period, we are on schedule for our installed base business revenues to outgrow materially our installed base units expansion. In calendar '16, our emphasis includes implementing systemic improvements in customer satisfaction, increasing our spares market share with new products differentiated by Lam-specific OEM knowledge and learning and building upon the early adoption successes of new installed base advanced services and productivity solutions achieved last year.
Now I would like to provide a brief update on demand and WFE trends. Expectations of the experts for global economic growth have been revised slightly lower since our last report. End market demand trends for technology products remained mixed with additional weaknesses in the PC market and relatively stable although lower-than-expected growth rates in mobile. Meanwhile, we continue to expect solid demand for leading-edge silicon in the enterprise market driven by the long-term move to the cloud, storage and computation applications both.
More importantly perhaps, we believe that Lam and the equipment industry broadly have an opportunity and responsibility to innovate for and with our customers to create a catalyst for the high levels of IC unit demand. Certainly, that is our conviction and thinking, both as a stand-alone process company and combined with KLA-Tencor.
Our outlook for the memory market continues to reflect the offsetting factors of strong 3D NAND spending and meaningful declines in DRAM spending driven largely by PC weakness year-over-year. The latter has resulted in now well publicized and rational response from our DRAM customers, which should continue to help improve the IC unit supply/demand balance. We expect DRAM capacity to remain essentially flat to slightly down this year.
DRAM WFE, we estimate to represent mid to high $5 billion spending this year, focused almost exclusively on 20-nanometer and 1x nanometer upgrade investments to improve cost competitiveness and device performance. We expect nonvolatile memory industry WFE to exceed $9 billion in 2016 with every industry participant committed to the 3D road map.
Spending patterns and the strategic actions by our customers in 2016 offer the clearest evidence yet that 3D NAND and new nonvolatile memories are evolving to have a transformational influence on the compute and storage industry as device and system architectures evolve for consumer and enterprise cloud applications. 3D NAND, in particular, has an integration scheme that is heavily biased towards deposition and etch, a statement that is increasingly true as the customers transition from building greenfield 3D fabs to conversions from 2D to 3D and eventually from first-generation 3D through subsequent vertical scaling.
We assess that the equipment industry remains on track to ship a cumulative 350,000 to 400,000 wafer starts per month of 3D NAND capacity by the end of 2016, which includes around 2/3 by year-end production qualified. The headline for Lam is that with just under a quarter of global capacity 3D NAND-capable by the end of this year, we are in a very early stages of a multiyear growth opportunity. There is much for us to be excited about.
We continue to expect flat to slightly better WFE in Foundry and Logic where the majority of the spending is focused on a strategic investments to enable 10-nanometer technology. Although as stated previously, IoT applications, automotive, wearables and low-end phones, et cetera, are driving a healthy resurgence of 28-nanometer capital expenditure.
Doug will provide more details in our financial guidance, but our shipments outlook in a flattish WFE environment is consistent with our ongoing outperformance commentary and prior long-term models. We ended this quarter with our strongest backlog and deferred revenue balance combined in the recent history of Lam, and we expect stronger shipments in June with sequential growth of approximately 9%. We retain our 2016 WFE outlook of $33 billion plus or minus $2 billion, and from a momentum perspective, guide the first half '16 shipments stronger than our second half '15. And although slightly muted perhaps from our more conservative DRAM outlook today and some first half, second half rebalancing, we're still encouraged by the potential for slightly stronger shipments second half '16 over our first half '16.
Now I will conclude with some comments on the planned combination of Lam Research with KLA-Tencor. As a reminder, with continued execution and our priority on being #1 in customer trust, we have the confidence that stand-alone Lam Research has a continuing growth outperformance opportunity over the next several years. We have elected to use this recent period of strength and an exciting outlook to pursue an even more strategic agenda to innovate beyond what is possible in 2 great companies separately for the benefit of all stakeholders. We invested a number of years developing this strategy with our customers and believe with all subsequent interactions, they are materially invested in the success of our vision. They trust our genuine commitments to the broad ecosystem, and they are increasingly motivated by the opportunity for new joint development projects together.
As we move through the early stages of integration planning, our conviction in the business combination and the opportunities it will drive for the customer and combined company is only getting stronger. The integration planning team has been focused on understanding the organizational design and business processes of the 2 companies in order to ensure a seamless transition for our customers, suppliers and employees. We have announced internally and introduced to our customers a very strong global leadership team with balanced representation from both companies. Although we remain 2 separate companies until the date of the deal closing, and until that time our most fundamental responsibility is to deliver on preexisting commitments made to our customers, comprehensive integration activities have reinforced our confidence in achieving both the stated cost and revenue synergies.
In recent weeks, we received approval from both KT and Lam stockholders and have received regulatory approvals in Israel, Taiwan and Ireland. We are actively engaged with all required -- all other required agencies and remain confident that we will close the transaction sometime around midyear. Our best estimate is June, July plus or minus a couple of months.
With that, let me turn the call over to Doug, who will provide an update on the March quarter and our guidance for June."

Our results for the March quarter came in above the midpoint",1200,"Okay. Great. Thank you, Martin. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today in what I know is a busy earnings day.
We're pleased with the momentum to be starting the year with. Our results for the March quarter came in above the midpoint of guidance for all metrics. Shipments for the quarter were $1,446,000,000, which was up 12% sequentially and above the midpoint of the guided range. Memory shipments were strong in the quarter with the combined memory segment making up 70% of total system level shipments, and that compares with 65% in the prior quarter.
Memory shipments were made -- were weighted heavily toward the nonvolatile segment, which represented 43% of system shipments in the March quarter. This was up from 23% in the prior quarter driven by ongoing customer investments in 3D NAND wafer capacity as well as increasing layer counts. We continue to see 3D NAND spending focused on both new wafers as well as technology conversions. DRAM made up 27% of the shipments, which was down from 42% in the December quarter. We're seeing continued disciplined spending in the DRAM segment with a focus on 20-nanometer technology conversions to both reduce cost per bit and to enable improved performance.
The Foundry segment was up slightly in dollar terms in the March quarter, accounting for 23% of system shipments. Foundry spending is focused on both leading-edge 10-nanometer investments as well as continued spending at 28-nanometer and above. The Logic and Other segment contributed 7% of system shipments.
Shipments into the China region were particularly strong in March, representing 27% of total shipments. The majority of the spending in China continues to be spent by global multinational customers putting capacity in place within the country.
Revenue came in at $1,314,000,000 in the March quarter, which was down roughly 8% from the December quarter. This revenue result was consistent with our expectations for the quarter. Gross margin for the period came in at 45.1%, somewhat stronger than we expected. Better field and factory utilization and favorable product mix benefited gross margin in the quarter. And as I've shared with you before, our gross margins are a function of a number of factors, such as overall business volumes, product mix and customer concentration, and you should expect to see some variability quarter-to-quarter. I'd like to remind you that our financial model is still the best way to think about our ongoing performance.
Operating expenses in the quarter were roughly flat at $350 million, and this compares to $352 million in the December quarter. The majority of our spending continues to be allocated to funding our critical R&D programs. These investments are important in preparing for the current and next-generation technology inflections, enabling us to take full advantage of the opportunities ahead of us.
Operating income in the March quarter came in at $242 million, and that compares to $296 million in the prior quarter. Operating margin was 18.4%, above the high-end of the guided range due to both the higher revenue as well as the stronger gross margin. The tax rate for the quarter was 14%, and that compares with 7% last quarter. That, by the way, was about what we expected. A tax rate in the low to mid-teens for the remainder of 2016 would be reasonable for you to use in your earnings models.
Based on a share count of approximately 172 million shares, earnings per share for the March quarter were $1.18, above the guidance range. This share count includes dilution on a non-GAAP basis from both the 2016 and 2041 convertible notes with the total dilutive impact of about 11 million shares. Dilution schedules for the 2016, 2018 and 2041 convertible notes are available on our Investor Relations website for your reference.
We returned $48 million in dividend distributions to our shareholders. This equated to $0.30 on a per share basis. We did not repurchase any shares in the open market in the March quarter, consistent with our stated plans ahead of closing the proposed KLA-Tencor transaction.
So now let me turn to the balance sheet. We continue to have a healthy cash position. Cash and short-term investments, including restricted cash, increased to $4.8 billion at the end of the quarter. Cash from operations was $183 million, and that compares to $295 million in December. The March shipment profile was biased toward the back end of the quarter, resulting in an increase in both accounts receivable and days sales outstanding quarter-over-quarter. DSO increased to 86 days in March. I expect this will reduce in the June quarter as linearity is less back-end weighted. The quality of our receivable balance continues to be very strong. We've got a blue-chip set of customers.
Inventory turns declined to 3.2x due to the inventory build for the growth in the June quarter. Days payable outstanding extended to 46 days as a result of the timing of purchases within the quarter. Cash generation was partially offset by dividends paid as well as capital expenditures.
We exited the quarter with deferred revenues of $511 million, which was up from $395 million in December. This amount excludes $121 million in shipments to customers in Japan, which will revenue in future quarters. These Japanese shipments remained on our balance sheet as inventory carried at cost. Company noncash expenses for the quarter included $35 million for equity comp, $39 million for amortization and $35 million for depreciation. Capital expenditures were $46 million, which was up from $28 million in the December quarter. We ended the quarter with approximately 7,300 regular full-time employees, which was flat with December.
Looking ahead now, I'd like to provide our non-GAAP guidance for the June quarter. We expect shipments of $1,575,000,000 plus or minus $75 million. We expect revenue of $1,525,000,000, again, plus or minus $75 million. We expect gross margin of 46% plus or minus 1 percentage point. I do expect that -- excuse me, the September quarter gross margin will be a little bit softer than in June due to customer concentration and product mix, and we forecast operating margins of 22% plus or minus 1 percentage point. And finally, we're forecasting earnings per share of $1.63 plus or minus $0.10 based on a share count of approximately 173 million shares.
We're pleased with our performance this quarter and with the guidance we've just shared for the June quarter. We're delivering financial results coming from the strategic focus of the company on creating differentiated product and service offerings that enable the success of our customers. As we sit here today, I continue to expect the second half of the year will have a stronger top line than the first half due to investments in leading-edge foundry and logic.
And just one last item I'd like to share with you. We will not be doing our normal Investor Day at SEMICON West this year. Our plans will be to do something later in the year, likely in the month of November. We will announce exact dates and venue later in the year as we finalize our plans.
That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, Martin and I would now like to open up the call for questions."

I mean, the kind of balance of payments motivation from my point of view at least is very intuitive. As Doug outlined in his prepared comments today, the majority of today's investment is the international companies. And so clearly, there is upside to the extent that there are indigenous company investments made, which to your point require access to technology one way or the other, either it's acquired, partnered or developed internally. My instinct is that in the long term, the investment that's available to our industry, the investments in WFE, naturally balances around supply and demand. And so is there a spike at the beginning of a geographic commitment to an investment like China? Probably yes. And exactly how much, to be determined in my opinion. But I think at least perhaps if not more important question is what are the opportunities for incremental IC unit demand to be created from these investments, and what capital equipment additions would prevail in that context. And I think we all recognize that incremental IC unit growth only occurs when there are performance or cost benefits above and beyond the baseline. And certainly, the partnerships that emerge in China between design houses, semiconductor companies, electronics companies and ultimately semiconductor manufacturers create opportunities for partnerships to be a catalyst demand. And whether performance benefits prevail is to be determined, and cost benefits obviously capture the government incentives and agenda that are relevant particularly in China in the next several years. So I do expect a bump, to be determined how big. I do think it's somewhat authentic [ph] agenda. I do think it will be executed with discipline. And I think in the long term, it's all about the cost and the performance of a chip."

Probably 1/3 of that is being qualified at the end of the year, so it will take some time to get production ready. There are, I think, 1.3 million wafer starts per month of capacity in the nonvolatile memory space. So the headline is less than 25% of it is capable of making a 3D device by the end of this year. I think your question obviously is specifically unanswerable because at the end of the day, the pace at which the customer transitions is a byproduct of success in the marketplace on performance and cost, but the momentum is clearly there. It is the device, and our customers have made that commitment. So I think 70% [ph], 95% of spending this year is 3D device architecture and they will, as best I can tell, execute that over a 4-year period plus or minus a bit.

So that's probably a company-specific commentary that you're going to have to kind of absorb and digest from a modeling point of view, but the real swing factor in terms of WFE was PC units and the consequence in DRAM.

So that's a continuum, and all of a sudden it's not just, ""Oh, we're done. We never have to worry about it anymore."" We have to work really hard every single day to make sure that the advantage that we've been able to present that has legitimized our participation in staircase selections is something that sustains itself over multiple years, and that's clearly the objective for the company. So it's really about just the natural passing of time and transitioning from D2R [ph] and P2R [ph] staircase is an important application. It's not the most critical. I think you recollect that we have about 90% market share in the critical etch after [ph] the critical etch and deposition applications in the 3D NAND transition, and that's the kind of foundation of competitive strength for the company.

So for me, as the technology road map of the customer gets more challenging, the bigger the proportion of etch-related differentiation will be occupied by atomic level control. The deposition answer might be slightly difference, and again, this is clearly a commentary for Lam Research because we don't have the comprehensive deposition product portfolio. We have at least one sizable gap in the product portfolio compared to others. And so the atomic level deposition product road map for us has an opportunity to be disruptive more holistically and creates growth potentials for Lam Research above and beyond what might be available for a generic deposition kind of baseline."

I mean, the segments of the industry are trending and tracking differently. This is a very strategic year. Best counsel I can give you relative to modeling Lam is what we said. The long-term financial model is the best calibration for kind of profitability and performance of a given WFE. And you've heard us described an expectation that our second half revenues are higher than first half revenues this year, and we got a decent shot at having some upside in shipments as well, second half over first half.

The headline is that we delivered strong results that continue to reinforce our increasingly strong presence in the industry as the enabling technology reflections continue to intensify around etch and deposition processes. In addition, the quality of our earnings rises as a higher proportion of our market share occurs in critical applications, which are characterized by extreme technical complexity and multiyear cycles of learning for the company. Lastly, our expectations for performance in second half of calendar '16 are stronger than previously articulated. We believe that with sustained focus on execution and partnership with our customers, multiyear outperformance opportunity is set to continue.
Lam's shipments, revenue and non-GAAP gross margins were above the midpoints and non-GAAP earnings above the high-end of our guided ranges for the recent quarter. I would like to take a moment to acknowledge the support of our customers and the contributions of all Lam employees, without whom, our performance without be possible. I would also like to recognize the support we've received from our suppliers, who have helped us to ramp our capacity, increase responsiveness to customers, increase localization and support our rapid product development cycles. Thank you, all.
At the core of Lam's outperformance is our culture and values, our close partnership with our customers and our ability to deliver innovative products, service and capabilities at scale, which directly address key semiconductor manufacturing technology and market inflections such as 3D NANDs multi-patterning FinFETs and advanced packaging. Our predominant focus is always on increasing the probability of success for our customers, contributing to their stated business objectives. 
In that context, the importance of these technology inflections and their enabling of new industry growth factors has never been stronger. Our leading customers are moving to capitalize on the acceleration in innovation centered on the next wave of industry application drivers such as virtual reality, artificial intelligence and connected devices and automobiles. They articulate aspirations to change the world.
Realizing the potential of these application drivers will demand unprecedented scaling and performance, power and costs for compute, storage and networking, significantly beyond what is possible with traditional scaling and shrink and Moore's law. In essence, this reenergizing of our industry demands a more holistic approach to systems architecture through the entire semiconductor ecosystem. 
In cloud server storage and networking devices, this revolution is driving significant semiconductor demand for DRAM, NAND, new memory technologies and overtime, additional logic chip demand for advance computation necessary for converting data into actionable information. Growth in semiconductor content for DRAM, NAND and leading and trailing edge logic is a strong theme also client's devices like smart phones, IOT and connected automobiles, to deliver the power of new industry application drivers and enrich the end-consumer experience.
We believe that Lam is in an outstanding position to help drive needed innovation and capitalize on the opportunities presented by current and future inflections. The foundation of the last several years: Great employees, strong ecosystem trust and the increasing quality of product and technology roadmaps, delivered an execution track record, proven financial outperformance and leads to our recognize market leadership position. 
Lam's etch and deposition products and their on way for performance are vital to our customer success no doubt. In partnership, we are enabling multi-patterning driven scaling in logic and DRAM, we are facilitating cost reduction and density scaling for 3D NAND and new memory technologies, and supporting increased compute performance and memory bandwidth with FinFET and advanced packaging technology inflections.
One characterization of our strategic relevance is in our expanding market opportunity. As a result of our strategic and operational executions through the last several years, Lam's addressable market as a share of WFE has increased from 26.5% in 2013 to over 30% last year and is on track once again to exceed the performance of overall WFE in 2016.
The 3D NAND inflection in particular has accelerated and is driving a greater than 30% growth in 2016 NAND's WFE year-over-year. As our customers target probably the single largest growth opportunity in all of semis over the next few years. NAND is still in the early stages of penetration with its share of total bps [ph] addressable at under 20% of the overall flash and spinning media storage market combined.
Underpinning the strong product cycle for NAND and the storage is the visibility provided by the technology roadmap of our customers, which extends well into the next decade. Etch and deposition are the key process technology enablers of 3D NAND, a fact that is perhaps best illustrated by the greater than 2x growth in our non-volatile memory markets over the last 2 years and exciting multiyear growth outlook going forward.
In addition to the demand and requirements for high aspect ratio etch and cost and technology enabling, multi-fax scaling gaming in 3D, atomic level processing is growing increasingly important as storage layer counts scale from 40 plus today to over 60 next year and eventually, to more than 100 layers in the next few years. Lam has prepared its product portfolio for this trend. 
Our latest ALTUS system with low fluorine, tungsten atomic layer deposition or ALT capability is being qualified at multiple customers. This system enables the next generation 3D NAND and DRAM by delivering an innovative ALD solution with lower fluorine impurities, differentiated stress control and void free-fill properties.
Our VECTOR Strata with deposition product is seeing very strong momentum with its industry-leading productivity and film property control for old [ph] stock deposition and is now processed all of record at the significant majority of the global 3D NAND customers. Our dielectric etch install base for high aspect ratio applications in 3D NAND and DRAM has more than doubled over the last year. This strong performance of the portfolio of our VECTOR Strata and ALTUS deposition and Flex and Kiyo etch products have allowed us to remain on track with our objective first shared with SEMICON West a year ago of 7 to 10 percentage points of share gain from the 2D to the 3D NAND's transition.
Another important elements of the value we bring to our customers and enabling the growth of our systems market share is our customer support business group, which is leading value creation across the entirety of our 40,000 process modules in the install base. This organization inside our company is providing world-class support for our new systems during integrated circuit production ramp and addressing our customer's ongoing and critical operational needs for spares and services over lifetime. But increasingly, this organization is also contributing highly innovative, differentiated technology, productivity and lifecycle solutions resulting in substantial served market growth and an increase in revenue stream annuity that supports our investments in our future.
Now turning to Lam and KLA-Tencor merger update. To reemphasize the points made many times before, the outperformance potential of Lam is set to continue for multiple years, we believe. This spirit of strength we have chosen to harness strategically through the planed business combination of 2 great companies. We continue to make progress with anti-Trust agency reviews. We are pleased with the overall tone and support from our customers for these investments and without compromising the focus on execution in 2 standalone companies, the integration planning is in better shape today than what is true for Lam and Novellus at the same point in the process. Excitement and substance internally and with our customers is building. 
We continue to work diligently to receive the necessary approvals and now targets completion of our merger in the coming few months. We have no doubt this is a value creating transaction for our customers and company, for our employees and suppliers worldwide. 
The opportunity remains. We are 100% committed to innovate beyond what is possible for the 2 standalone companies separately to the benefit of the overall semi ecosystem and add to the potential of Lam as currently defined.
Now turning to an overview of capital equipment spending patterns in 2016. Expectations for global economic growth have remained generally stable since our last report. Although there have been some increase in certainty with the possible effects of Brexit. End market demand expectations for PCs has been relatively stable and there's evidence of solid growth in low-end smart phones and slightly slower units but stronger content expectations today in high-end smartphones. We continue to expect solid and long-term demand for leading-edge silicon in the enterprise market driven by the move to the cloud. 
WFE for 2016 continues to track to $33 billion, plus or minus $1 billion. Our bottoms up analytics imply at or slightly above the midpoint is most likely. 
By segments, memory WFE tracks to approximately $15 billion with spending more biased to NAND than DRAM this year, and for sure, since our last update. We now expect NAND CapEx to be up over 30%, offset by DRAM CapEx, which we now expect to be down approximately 40%.
Logic and foundry CapEx is tracking slightly better than our prior expectations. Spending in these segments is weighted primarily to an addition of 10-nanometer and some pilots 7-nanometer as well as additions at the mature 28-nanometer and 40-nanometer technology nodes with China featuring prominently driven by strength in low-end and mid-end smartphones and IOT devices.
Despite a flattish WFE year with some segment mix headwinds for our company, including a substantial decline in DRAM CapEx this year, Lam once again is poised to outperform WFE in calendar 2016. We are confident that calendar year-over-year revenues and second half '16 versus first half '16 trends are very positive. Currently, we anticipate second half shipments will be up mid to high single digits sequentially.
Momentum continues to build in 3D NAND with total 3D NAND shipped capacity at the end of calendar '16 now tracking to the higher end of the 350,000 to 400,000 wafer starts per month outlook that we provided earlier. In DRAM, spending remains focused on the 2D nanometer and 1x nanometer conversions with about 50% of industry capacity converted to 20-nanometer and amidst [ph] mid-single digits converted to 1x, we believe, by the end of this calendar year. We remain optimistic on content demand drivers for DRAM in clients and service, which combined with our customer's prudent response to managing supply in response to PC demand weak first earlier in the year, are already pointing to early signs of improving supply and demand balance. This sentiment biases us positively for a recovery in DRAM CapEx as we look into the next calendar year.
As we enter the second half of 2016, we are excited by the inflection driven long-term outperformance opportunities for Lam. Also our strong installed market share positions across all geographies and when combined with KT, further increased strategic relevance to our customers by providing them more valuable innovation, trusted productivity and fast solutions.
With that, let me now hand the call over to Doug."
30655,372626441,1014379,"Lam Research Corporation, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2016",2016-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Lam Research Corporation","Executives","Okay, great. Thank you, Martin. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us on the call today during what I know is a busy earnings time.The June quarter was also reported a solid conclusion to the 2016 fiscal year. In the quarter, we performe",1514,"Okay, great. Thank you, Martin. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us on the call today during what I know is a busy earnings time.
The June quarter was also reported a solid conclusion to the 2016 fiscal year. In the quarter, we performed above the midpoint of guidance for all metrics with operating margin and earnings per share above the high end of the range. For the fiscal year, shipments, revenues, operating income dollars and earnings per share were all at record high levels. We delivered double-digit revenue growth fiscal year over fiscal year grew at twice the rate of revenue growth.
Moving now to the specifics for the June quarter. Shipments were $1,587,000,000, up approximately 10% compared to the March quarter and just slightly below the record high level that we saw in the June 2015 quarter. The combined memory segment made up 66% of system shipments and that was down from 70% in the prior quarter. 
Nonvolatile memory shipments contributed 51% of the system shipments and this was up from 43% in the March quarter. The nonvolatile shipment dollars represent record levels for Lam Research. As we progress through the first half of the year, 3D NAND investments have accelerated with multiple customers moving forward in their 3D NAND ramp plans. We are continuing to see the expansion of our SAM and this combined with our success in winning critical applications in the 3D NAND process flows of our customers is driving the financial performance we're delivering. 
3D NAND represent over 95% of NAND shipments for 2016. As we expected, DRAM shipments decreased to 15% from 27% in the prior quarter. Investment is pacing at a rational reduced level in response to market conditions. 
DRAM spending was predominantly focused on 20-nanometer conversions with a continued the objective of lowering cost per bit. PC DRAM pricing seems to have bottomed as the market shifts to server and mobile DRAM.
Server and mobile represents roughly 2/3 of the market bit growth this year. System shipments into the foundry segment increased to 27%, which is up from 23% in March quarter. And as Martin mentioned, foundry spending continues to be broad based with an increasing contributing from 10-nanometer capacity additions augmented by the ongoing investment at 28-nanometer and above nodes, primarily China. The logic and other segment held steady at 7% of system shipments which was a level similar to that we saw in the March quarter.
From a geographic standpoint. China continues to be strong, representing 17% of total shipments and 22% of total revenue. June quarter revenues came in at $1,546,000,000, a sequential increase of 18% and above the midpoint of our guidance. Gross margin was strong in the period at 46.6%, which was a 150 basis point improvement from the 45.1 that we saw in the March quarter. The strength in gross margin was a result of higher business volumes as well as favorable product mix.
And as we've described previously, you should expect to see variability quarter to quarter in our gross margins. And I'd just like to remind you that our financial model is the best reference to help you think about margins over time.
Our operating expense for the quarter were within our expectations at $361 million, which was an increase on an absolute basis from the $350 million in the March quarter, but decreasing to 22% of revenue in the June quarter versus 27% in March.
In the June quarter, our spending allocated to R&D was 63% of total spending. During the quarter, we completed construction on our new R&D lab in Fremont, California. This lab will put us at the state-of-the-art in terms of capability and flexibility to continue to develop leading edge profitability and productivity solutions.
Operating income for the quarter was very strong at $359 million. It was an increase of 48% compared to the $242 million in the March quarter. Operating margin increased from 18.4% to 23.2% above the high end of the guidance range due to both the higher revenue as well as the stronger gross margin. This operating margin percentage is the second highest level since our acquisition of Novellus in 2012.
Our tax rate came in at 10%, which was lower than 14% rate last quarter, primarily due to more income from lower tax jurisdictions. The rate in the low teens for the remainder of 2016 would be a reasonable number for you to use in your modeling.
Earnings per share for the June quarter were $1.80 based on a share count of approximately 175 million shares. The share count includes dilution from both the 2018 and 2041 convertible notes and the outstanding 2016 warrants with a total dilutive impact of about 13 million shares on a non-GAAP basis.
In the June quarter, our $450 million 2016 convertible note matured and was settled for both cash and stock. The stock issuance was offset by the corresponding bond hedge that we had in place.
Dilution schedules for the remaining convertible notes are available on our Investor Relations website for your reference. We returned $0.30 per share for a total of $47 million in dividend distributions to our shareholders in the quarter. There were no share repurchases in the quarter in line with our previously announced plans around the business combination with KLA-Tencor.
Let me now turn to the balance sheet. We have a very solid cash position of $7.1 billion on the balance sheet, reflecting both the strong performance of the business as well as steps we have taken to increase the cash position of the company during the quarter. We generated a strong cash from operations of $424 million, which was an increase of 132% sequentially in the quarter. Cash from operations for the fiscal year came in at $1,350,000,000, a record high level. As expected, day sales outstanding for the period improved 74 days from 86 days with the shipment profile more linear than in the March quarter.
Inventory turns improved to 3.5x. We completed the issuance of $2.4 billion in principle value of investment-grade senior notes in May. This issuance together with $1.5 million in term loans completes the required financing for the KLA-Tencor transaction.
The net interest expense associated with the $2.4 billion financing is $4 million and is excluded from our non-GAAP results in this quarter. On a full quarter basis, the net interest expense from this new debt will be approximately $18 million. The deferred revenue balance at the end of the June quarter stood at $566 million and 11% increase quarter-over-quarter. That number excludes approximately $132 million from shipments to customers in Japan, which will convert to revenue in future quarters.
And recall that those Japan shipments remain as inventory carried at cost on the balance sheet. Expect that deferred revenue will again roll in the September quarter. The company noncash tax expenses during the quarter include the following: $39 million for equity comp; $39 million for amortization and $36 million for depreciation.
Capital expenditures were $52 million, which is up from $46 million in the March quarter. CapEx projects included investment in infrastructure expansion from an additional engineering lab space to support the growth of the company. 
During the quarter, we sold our sample for net proceeds of approximately $80 million and a gain of $15 million. This gain is excluded from our non-GAAP results. This transaction is part of our R&D consolidation in the Fremont site. We exited the quarter with approximately 7,500 regular full-time employees. The growth in headcount was primarily related to growth in factory resources to support the growing business level. Additionally, we added some R&D heads.
So now looking ahead, I'd like to provide our non-GAAP guidance for the September quarter. We're expect shipments of $1,700,000,000, plus or minus $75 million. This midpoint would represent a record level of shipments for Lam Research.
We expect revenue of $1,625,000,000, again, plus or minus $75 million. This good point would also represent a record level of revenue. We expect gross margin of 45.5%, plus or minus one percentage point. Gross margin is down sequentially due to higher customer concentration in September. 
Before cash, operating margins of 22.5%, plus or minus one percentage point. And finally, we forecast earnings per share of $1.77, plus or minus $0.10, based on a share count of approximately 176 million shares.
This earnings per share number excludes the $18 million associated with the $2.4 billion KLA-Tencor financing. The net interest expense will be excluded from our non-GAAP results until such time as the deal closes. We expect full shipments and revenue to be stronger in the second half than the first half with mid-to high single-digit growth in shipments in the second half of the calendar year compared to the first half. We expect revenue growth in the second half to outpace shipment growth half over half. We expect to deplete some of the deferred revenue balance by the end of the calendar year.
And that concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, Martin and I would like now to open the call for questions."

There are very strategic actions, sometimes involving global companies, sometimes the domestic community. We are tracking at least 20 different fab level kind of ambition statements. And there's a full spectrum of kind of probability associated with each one of those. There clearly is over a multiple year timeframe, more than 1 million wafer starts per month out there is kind of a reference points for installed base capacity in China relative to it being incremental for me, that's all about performance and cost of devices and if the performance and cost of devices out of China can be a catalyst and a trigger for incremental demand. It's kind of positive for noble kind of industry, including Lam. So time will tell clearly the commitment appears to be there.

Other forward-looking topics that we expect to cover are included in the slide deck accompanying our remarks.

The headline is that we delivered strong results that continue to reinforce our increasingly strong presence in the industry as the enabling technology in",1819,"Thank you, Satya, and thank you all for joining us today for our quarterly earnings conference call. The headline is that we delivered strong results that continue to reinforce our increasingly strong presence in the industry as the enabling technology inflections continue to intensify around etch and deposition processes. In addition, the quality of our earnings rises as a higher proportion of our market share occurs in critical applications, which are characterized by extreme technical complexity and multiyear cycles of learning for the company. 
Lastly, our expectations for performance in the second half of calendar '16 are stronger than previously articulated. We believe that with sustained focus on execution, in partnership with our customers, multiyear outperformance opportunity is set to continue.
Lam's shipments, revenue and non-GAAP gross margins were above the midpoints and non-GAAP earnings above the high end of our guided ranges for the recent quarter. I would like to take a moment to acknowledge the support of our customers and the contributions of all Lam employees, without whom, our performance would not be possible. I would also like to recognize the support we've received from our suppliers, who have helped us to ramp our capacity, increase responsiveness to customers, increase localization and support our rapid product development cycles. Thank you, all.
At the core of Lam's outperformance is our culture and values, our close partnership with our customers and our ability to deliver innovative products, service and capabilities at scale which directly address key semiconductor manufacturing technology and market inflections, such as 3D NANDs multi-patterning FinFETs and advanced packaging. Our predominant focus is always on increasing the probability of success for our customers, contributing to their stated business objectives. 
In that context, the importance of these technology inflections and their enabling of new industry growth vectors has never been stronger. Our leading customers are moving to capitalize on the acceleration in innovation centered on the next wave of industry application drivers, such as virtual reality, artificial intelligence and connected devices and automobiles. They articulate aspirations to change the world.
Realizing the potential of these application drivers will demand unprecedented scaling of performance, power and costs for compute, storage and networking significantly beyond what is possible with traditional scaling and shrink and Moore's law. In essence, this reenergizing of our industry demands a more holistic approach to systems architecture through the entire semiconductor ecosystem. 
In cloud server storage and networking devices, this revolution is driving significant semiconductor demand for DRAM, NAND, new memory technologies and, over time, additional logic chip demand for advanced computation necessary for converting data into actionable information. Growth in semiconductor content for DRAM, NAND, and leading- and trailing-edge logic is a strong theme also in clients' devices like smart phones, IOT and connected automobiles to deliver the power of new industry application drivers and enrich the end-consumer experience.
We believe that Lam is in an outstanding position to help drive needed innovation and capitalize on the opportunities presented by current and future inflections. The foundation of the last several years -- great employees, strong ecosystem trust and the increasing quality of product and technology road maps -- delivers an execution track record, proven financial outperformance and leads to our recognized market leadership position. 
Lam's etch and deposition products and their on-wafer performance are vital to our customer success, no doubt. In partnership, we are enabling multipatterning-driven scaling in logic and DRAM. We are facilitating cost-reduction and density scaling for 3D NAND and new memory technologies and supporting increased compute performance and memory bandwidth with FinFET and advanced packaging technology inflections.
One characterization of our strategic relevance is in our expanding market opportunity. As a result of our strategic and operational executions through the last several years, Lam's addressable market as a share of WFE has increased from 26.5% in 2013 to over 30% last year and is on track once again to exceed the performance of overall WFE in 2016.
The 3D NAND inflection, in particular, has accelerated and is driving a greater than 30% growth in 2016 NAND's WFE year-over-year as our customers target probably the single-largest growth opportunity in all of semis over the next few years. NAND is still in the early stages of penetration with its share of total bits addressable at under 20% of the overall Flash and spinning media storage market combined.
Underpinning the strong product cycle for NAND in storage is the visibility provided by the technology road map of our customers, which extends well into the next decade. Etch and deposition are the key process technology enablers of 3D NAND, a fact that is perhaps best illustrated by the greater than 2x growth in our nonvolatile memory markets over the last 2 years and exciting multiyear growth outlook going forward.
In addition to the demanding requirements for high-aspect ratio etch and cost and technology enabling, mold-stack [ph] scaling in 3D, atomic-level processing is growing increasingly important as storage layer counts scale from 40-plus today to over 60 next year and eventually to more than 100 layers in the next few years. Lam has prepared its product portfolio for this trend. 
Our latest ALTUS system with low-fluorine tungsten atomic layer deposition or ALD capability is being qualified at multiple customers. This system enables the next-generation 3D NAND and DRAM by delivering an innovative ALD solution with lower fluorine impurities, differentiated stress control and void-free fill properties.
Our VECTOR Strata PECVD deposition product is seeing very strong momentum with its industry-leading productivity and film property control for mold-stack [ph] deposition and is now process tool of record at the significant majority of global 3D NAND customers. Our dielectric etch install base for high-aspect ratio applications in 3D NAND and DRAM has more than doubled over the last year. This strong performance of the portfolio of our VECTOR Strata and ALTUS deposition and Flex and Kiyo etch products have allowed us to remain on track with our objective first shared with you at SEMICON West a year ago of 7 to 10 percentage points of share gain from the 2D to 3D NAND's transition.
Another important element of the value we bring to our customers and enabling the growth of our systems market share is our customer support business group, which is leading value creation across the entirety of our 40,000 process modules in the install base. This organization inside of our company is providing world-class support for our new systems during integrated circuit production ramp and addressing our customers' ongoing and critical operational needs for spares and services over lifetime. 
But increasingly, this organization is also contributing highly innovative, differentiated technology, productivity and life-cycle solutions resulting in substantial served market growth and an increasing revenue stream annuity that supports our investments in our future.
Now turning to a Lam and KLA-Tencor merger update. To reemphasize the points made many times before, the outperformance potential of Lam is set to continue for multiple years, we believe, this period of strength we have chosen to harness strategically through the planned business combination of 2 great companies. We continue to make progress with antitrust agency reviews. We are pleased with the overall tone of support from our customers for these investments, and without compromising the focus on execution in 2 stand-alone companies, the integration planning is in better shape today than was true for Lam and Novellus at this same point in the process. Excitement and substance internally and with our customers is building. 
We continue to work diligently to receive the necessary approvals and now target completion of our merger in the coming few months. We have no doubt this is a value-creating transaction for our customers and company, for our employees and suppliers worldwide. 
The opportunity remains. We are 100% committed to innovate beyond what is possible for the 2 stand-alone companies separately to the benefit of the overall semi ecosystem and add to the potential of Lam as currently defined.
Now turning to an overview of capital equipment spending patterns in 2016. Expectations for global economic growth have remained generally stable since our last report. Although there have been some increased uncertainty with the possible effects of Brexit, end market demand expectations for PCs has been relatively stable, and there's evidence of solid growth in low-end smartphones and slightly slower units but stronger content expectations today in high-end smartphones. We continue to expect solid and long-term demand for leading-edge silicon in the enterprise markets driven by the move to the cloud. 
WFE for 2016 continues to track to $33 billion, plus or minus $1 billion. Our bottoms-up analytics imply at or slightly above the midpoint is most likely. 
By segments, memory WFE tracks to approximately $15 billion with spending more biased to NAND than DRAM this year and, for sure, since our last update. We now expect NAND CapEx to be up over 30% offset by DRAM CapEx, which we now expect to be down approximately 40%.
Logic and foundry CapEx is tracking slightly better than our prior expectations. Spending in these segments is weighted primarily to an addition of 10-nanometer and some pilot 7-nanometer capacity as well as additions at the mature 28-nanometer and 40-nanometer technology nodes with China featuring prominently, driven by strength in low- and mid-end smartphones and IOT devices.
Despite a flattish WFE year with some segment mix headwinds for our company, including a substantial decline in DRAM CapEx this year, Lam once again is poised to outperform WFE in calendar 2016. We are confident that calendar year-over-year revenues and second half '16 versus first half '16 trends are very positive. Currently, we anticipate second half shipments will be up mid- to high single digits sequentially.
Momentum continues to build in 3D NAND with total 3D NAND shipped capacity at the end of calendar '16 now tracking to the higher end of the 350,000 to 400,000 wafer starts per month outlook that we provided earlier. In DRAM, spending remains focused on the 2z [ph] nanometer and 1x nanometer conversions with about 50% of industry capacity converted to 20-nanometer and MEMS mid-single digits converted to 1x, we believe, by the end of this calendar year. We remain optimistic on content demand drivers for DRAM in clients and servers, which combined with our customers' prudent responses to managing supply in response to the PC demand weak first -- earlier in the year, are already pointing to early signs of improving supply and demand balance. This sentiment biases us positively for a recovery in DRAM CapEx as we look into the next calendar year.
As we enter the second half of 2016, we are excited by the inflection-driven long-term outperformance opportunities for Lam. Also our strong install base market share positions across all geographies and when combined with KT, further increased strategic relevance to our customers by providing them more valuable innovation, trusted productivity and fast solutions.
With that, let me hand the call over to Doug."
30655,372626441,1014753,"Lam Research Corporation, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2016",2016-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Lam Research Corporation","Executives","Okay, great. Thank you, Martin. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today during what I know is a busy earnings time.The June quarter results represented a solid conclusion to the 2016 fiscal year. In the quarter, we perfo",1519,"Okay, great. Thank you, Martin. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today during what I know is a busy earnings time.
The June quarter results represented a solid conclusion to the 2016 fiscal year. In the quarter, we performed above the midpoint of guidance for all metrics with operating margin and earnings per share above the high end of the range. For the fiscal year, shipments, revenues, operating income dollars and earnings per share were all at record-high levels. We delivered double-digit revenue growth fiscal year over fiscal year at twice the rate of revenue growth.
Moving now to the specifics for the June quarter. Shipments were $1,587,000,000, up approximately 10% compared to the March quarter and just slightly below the record-high level that we saw in the June 2015 quarter. The combined memory segment made up 66% of system shipments, and that was down from 70% in the prior quarter. 
Nonvolatile memory shipments contributed 51% of the system shipments, and this was up from 43% in the March quarter. The nonvolatile shipment dollars represent record levels for Lam Research. As we progressed through the first half of the year, 3D NAND investments have accelerated with multiple customers moving forward in their 3D NAND ramp plans. 
We are continuing to see the expansion of our SAM, and this, combined with our success in winning critical applications in the 3D NAND process flows of our customers, is driving the financial performance we're delivering. 
3D NAND will represent over 95% of NAND shipments for 2016. As we expected, DRAM shipments decreased to 15% from 27% in the prior quarter. Investment is pacing at a rational reduced level in response to market conditions. 
DRAM spending was predominantly focused on 20-nanometer conversions with a continued objective of lowering cost per bit. PC DRAM pricing seems to have bottomed as the market shifts to server and mobile DRAM.
Server and mobile represents roughly 2/3 of the market bit growth this year. System shipments into the foundry segment increased to 27%, which is up from 23% in the March quarter. And as Martin mentioned, foundry spending continues to be broad based with an increasing contribution from 10-nanometer capacity additions augmented by the ongoing investment at 28-nanometer and above nodes, primarily in China. The logic and other segment held steady at 7% of system shipments, which was a level similar to that we saw in the March quarter. From a geographic standpoint. China continued to be strong, representing 17% of total shipments and 22% of total revenue. 
June quarter revenues came in at $1,546,000,000, a sequential increase of 18% and above the midpoint of our guidance. Gross margin was strong in the period at 46.6%, which was a 150 basis point improvement from the 45.1% that we saw in the March quarter. The strength in gross margin was a result of higher business volumes as well as favorable product mix. And as we've described previously, you should expect to see variability quarter to quarter in our gross margins. And I'd just like to remind you that our financial model is the best reference to help you think about margins over time.
Our operating expenses for the quarter were within our expectations at $361 million, which was an increase on an absolute basis from the $350 million in the March quarter but decreasing to 23% of revenue in the June quarter versus 27% in March.
In the June quarter, our spending allocated to R&D was 63% of total spending. During the quarter, we completed construction on our new R&D lab in Fremont, California. This lab will put us at the state of the art in terms of capability and flexibility to continue to develop leading-edge process capability and productivity solutions.
Operating income for the quarter was very strong at $359 million. It was an increase of 48% compared to the $242 million in the March quarter. Operating margin increased from 18.4% to 23.2%, above the high end of the guidance [ph] range due to both the higher revenue as well as the stronger gross margin. This operating margin percentage is the second-highest level since our acquisition of Novellus in 2012.
Our tax rate came in at 10%, which was lower than the 14% rate last quarter primarily due to more income from lower tax jurisdictions. A rate in the low teens for the remainder of 2016 would be a reasonable number for you to use in your modeling.
Earnings per share for the June quarter were $1.80 based on a share count of approximately 175 million shares. The share count includes dilution from both the 2018 and 2041 convertible notes and the outstanding 2016 warrants with a total dilutive impact of about 13 million shares on a non-GAAP basis.
In the June quarter, our $450 million 2016 convertible note matured and was settled for both cash and stock. The stock issuance was offset by the corresponding bond hedge that we had in place.
Dilution schedules for the remaining convertible notes are available on our Investor Relations website for your reference. We returned $0.30 per share for a total of $47 million in dividend distributions to our shareholders in the quarter. There were no share repurchases in the quarter in line with our previously announced plans around the business combination with KLA-Tencor.
Let me now turn to the balance sheet. We have a very solid cash position of $7.1 billion on the balance sheet, reflecting both the strong performance of the business as well as steps we've taken to increase the cash position of the company during the quarter. We generated a strong cash from operations of $424 million, which was an increase of 132% sequentially in the quarter. Cash from operations for the fiscal year came in at $1,350,000,000, a record-high level. As expected, day sales outstanding for the period improved to 74 days from 86 days with the shipment profile more linear than in the March quarter. Inventory turns improved to 3.5x. 
We completed the issuance of $2.4 billion in principal value of investment-grade senior notes in May. This issuance, together with $1.5 million in term loans, completes the required financing for the KLA-Tencor transaction.
The net interest expense associated with the $2.4 billion financing is $4 million and is excluded from our non-GAAP results in this quarter. On a full quarter basis, the net interest expense from this new debt will be approximately $18 million. The deferred revenue balance at the end of the June quarter stood at $566 million, an 11% increase quarter-over-quarter. That number excludes approximately $132 million from shipments to customers in Japan, which will convert to revenue in future quarters.
And recall that those Japan shipments remain as inventory carried at cost on the balance sheet. I expect that deferred revenue will again roll in the September quarter. 
Company noncash tax expenses during the quarter included the following: $39 million for equity comp; $39 million for amortization and $36 million for depreciation.
Capital expenditures were $52 million, which is up from $46 million in the March quarter. CapEx projects included investment in infrastructure expansion from an additional engineering lab space to support the growth of the company. 
During the quarter, we sold our sample [ph] as a campus for net proceeds of approximately $80 million and a gain of $15 million. This gain is excluded from our non-GAAP results. This transaction is part of our R&D consolidation into the Fremont site. We exited the quarter with approximately 7,500 regular full-time employees. The growth in headcount was primarily related to growth in factory resources to support the growing business level. Additionally, we added some R&D heads.
So now looking ahead, I'd like to provide our non-GAAP guidance for the September quarter. We're expecting shipments of $1,700,000,000, plus or minus $75 million. This midpoint would represent a record level of shipments for Lam Research.
We expect revenue of $1,625,000,000, again, plus or minus $75 million. This midpoint would also represent a record level of revenue. Expect gross margin of 45.5%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. Gross margin is down sequentially due to higher customer concentration in September. 
We forecast operating margins of 22.5%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. And finally, we forecast earnings per share of $1.77 plus or minus $0.10, based on a share count of approximately 176 million shares.
This earnings per share number excludes the $18 million associated with the $2.4 billion KLA-Tencor financing. The net interest expense will be excluded from our non-GAAP results until such time as the deal closes. We expect full shipments and revenue to be stronger in the second half than the first half with mid- to high single-digit growth in shipments in the second half of the calendar year compared to the first half. We expect revenue growth in the second half to outpace shipment growth half over half. We expect to deplete some of the deferred revenue balance by the end of the calendar year.
And that concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, Martin and I would like now to open up the call for questions."

There are very strategic actions, sometimes involving global companies, sometimes the domestic community. We're tracking at least 20 different fab-level kind of ambition statements. And there's a full spectrum of kind of probability associated with each one of those. There clearly is over a multiple-year time frame more than 1 million wafer starts per month out there as a kind of reference point for installed base capacity in China relative to it being incremental. For me, that's all about performance and cost of devices, and if the performance and cost of devices out of China can be a catalyst and a trigger for incremental demand, it's kind of positive for a global kind of industry, including Lam. So time will tell, but clearly, the commitment appears to be there. And as Doug said in his prepared comments, China is not an insignificant part of the revenues for the industry and the company."

So I would say, watch this space, and if we see anything of value to communicate, we will. Again, to reemphasize what I said in my prepared comments that the 2D to 3D transition for us was very strong with a 7 to 10 percentage point share gain for the company. Another kind of couple of data points that I would give you on 3D NAND for the company from a market share perspective, in general, the development tool of record decisions that translated to production tool of record decisions actually got stronger for us. And the other reference I would give you is that, obviously, our presence in critical applications, which is really a commentary on quality of earnings, is very, very strong.

The headline is that we delivered strong results that continue to reinforce our increasingly strong presence in the industry as the enabling technology inflections continue to intensify around etch and deposition processes. In addition, the quality of our earnings rises as a higher proportion of our market share occurs in critical applications, which are characterized by extreme technical complexity and multiyear cycles of learning for the company. 
Lastly, our expectations for performance in the second half of calendar '16 are stronger than previously articulated. We believe that with sustained focus on execution, in partnership with our customers, multiyear outperformance opportunity is set to continue.
Lam's shipments, revenue and non-GAAP gross margins were above the midpoints and non-GAAP earnings above the high end of our guided ranges for the recent quarter. I would like to take a moment to acknowledge the support of our customers and the contributions of all Lam employees, without whom, our performance would not be possible. I would also like to recognize the support we've received from our suppliers, who have helped us to ramp our capacity, increase responsiveness to customers, increase localization and support our rapid product development cycles. Thank you, all.
At the core of Lam's outperformance is our culture and values, our close partnership with our customers and our ability to deliver innovative products, service and capabilities at scale which directly address key semiconductor manufacturing technology and market inflections, such as 3D NANDs multi-patterning FinFETs and advanced packaging. Our predominant focus is always on increasing the probability of success for our customers, contributing to their stated business objectives. 
In that context, the importance of these technology inflections and their enabling of new industry growth vectors has never been stronger. Our leading customers are moving to capitalize on the acceleration in innovation centered on the next wave of industry application drivers, such as virtual reality, artificial intelligence and connected devices and automobiles. They articulate aspirations to change the world.
Realizing the potential of these application drivers will demand unprecedented scaling of performance, power and costs for compute, storage and networking significantly beyond what is possible with traditional scaling and shrink and Moore's law. In essence, this reenergizing of our industry demands a more holistic approach to systems architecture through the entire semiconductor ecosystem. 
In cloud server storage and networking devices, this revolution is driving significant semiconductor demand for DRAM, NAND, new memory technologies and, over time, additional logic chip demand for advanced computation necessary for converting data into actionable information. Growth in semiconductor content for DRAM, NAND, and leading- and trailing-edge logic is a strong theme also in clients' devices like smart phones, IoT and connected automobiles to deliver the power of new industry application drivers and enrich the end-consumer experience.
We believe that Lam is in an outstanding position to help drive needed innovation and capitalize on the opportunities presented by current and future inflections. The foundation of the last several years -- great employees, strong ecosystem trust and the increasing quality of product and technology road maps -- delivers an execution track record, proven financial outperformance and leads to our recognized market leadership position. 
Lam's etch and deposition products and their on-wafer performance are vital to our customer success, no doubt. In partnership, we are enabling multipatterning-driven scaling in logic and DRAM. We are facilitating cost-reduction and density scaling for 3D NAND and new memory technologies and supporting increased compute performance and memory bandwidth with FinFET and advanced packaging technology inflections.
One characterization of our strategic relevance is in our expanding market opportunity. As a result of our strategic and operational executions through the last several years, Lam's addressable market as a share of WFE has increased from 26.5% in 2013 to over 30% last year and is on track once again to exceed the performance of overall WFE in 2016.
The 3D NAND inflection, in particular, has accelerated and is driving a greater than 30% growth in 2016 NAND's WFE year-over-year as our customers target probably the single-largest growth opportunity in all of semis over the next few years. NAND is still in the early stages of penetration with its share of total bits addressable at under 20% of the overall Flash and spinning media storage market combined.
Underpinning the strong product cycle for NAND in storage is the visibility provided by the technology road map of our customers, which extends well into the next decade. Etch and deposition are the key process technology enablers of 3D NAND, a fact that is perhaps best illustrated by the greater than 2x growth in our nonvolatile memory markets over the last 2 years and exciting multiyear growth outlook going forward.
In addition to the demanding requirements for high-aspect ratio etch and cost and technology enabling, mold-stack scaling in 3D, atomic-level processing is growing increasingly important as storage layer counts scale from 40-plus today to over 60 next year and eventually to more than 100 layers in the next few years. Lam has prepared its product portfolio for this trend. 
Our latest ALTUS system with low-fluorine tungsten atomic layer deposition or ALD capability is being qualified at multiple customers. This system enables the next-generation 3D NAND and DRAM by delivering an innovative ALD solution with lower fluorine impurities, differentiated stress control and void-free fill properties.
Our VECTOR Strata PECVD deposition product is seeing very strong momentum with its industry-leading productivity and film property control for mold-stack deposition and is now process tool of record at the significant majority of global 3D NAND customers. Our dielectric etch install base for high-aspect ratio applications in 3D NAND and DRAM has more than doubled over the last year. This strong performance of the portfolio of our VECTOR Strata and ALTUS deposition and Flex and Kiyo etch products have allowed us to remain on track with our objective first shared with you at SEMICON West a year ago of 7 to 10 percentage points of share gain from the 2D to 3D NAND's transition.
Another important element of the value we bring to our customers and enabling the growth of our systems market share is our customer support business group, which is leading value creation across the entirety of our 40,000 process modules in the install base. This organization inside of our company is providing world-class support for our new systems during integrated circuit production ramp and addressing our customers' ongoing and critical operational needs for spares and services over lifetime. 
But increasingly, this organization is also contributing highly innovative, differentiated technology, productivity and life-cycle solutions resulting in substantial served market growth and an increasing revenue stream annuity that supports our investments in our future.
Now turning to a Lam and KLA-Tencor merger update. To reemphasize the points made many times before, the outperformance potential of Lam is set to continue for multiple years, we believe, this period of strength we have chosen to harness strategically through the planned business combination of 2 great companies. We continue to make progress with antitrust agency reviews. We are pleased with the overall tone of support from our customers for this investment, and without compromising the focus on execution in 2 stand-alone companies, the integration planning is in better shape today than was true for Lam and Novellus at this same point in the process. Excitement and substance internally and with our customers is building. 
We continue to work diligently to receive the necessary approvals and now target completion of our merger in the coming few months. We have no doubt this is a value-creating transaction for our customers and company, for our employees and suppliers worldwide. 
The opportunity remains. We are 100% committed to innovate beyond what is possible for the 2 stand-alone companies separately to the benefit of the overall semi ecosystem and add to the potential of Lam as currently defined.
Now turning to an overview of capital equipment spending patterns in 2016. Expectations for global economic growth have remained generally stable since our last report. Although there have been some increased uncertainty with the possible effects of Brexit, end market demand expectations for PCs has been relatively stable, and there's evidence of solid growth in low-end smartphones and slightly slower units but stronger content expectations today in high-end smartphones. We continue to expect solid and long-term demand for leading-edge silicon in the enterprise markets driven by the move to the cloud. 
WFE for 2016 continues to track to $33 billion, plus or minus $1 billion. Our bottoms-up analytics imply at or slightly above the midpoint is most likely. 
By segments, memory WFE tracks to approximately $15 billion with spending more biased to NAND than DRAM this year and, for sure, since our last update. We now expect NAND CapEx to be up over 30% offset by DRAM CapEx, which we now expect to be down approximately 40%.
Logic and foundry CapEx is tracking slightly better than our prior expectations. Spending in these segments is weighted primarily to an addition of 10-nanometer and some pilot 7-nanometer capacity as well as additions at the mature 28-nanometer and 40-nanometer technology nodes with China featuring prominently, driven by strength in low- and mid-end smartphones and IOT devices.
Despite a flattish WFE year with some segment mix headwinds for our company, including a substantial decline in DRAM CapEx this year, Lam once again is poised to outperform WFE in calendar 2016. We are confident that calendar year-over-year revenues and second half '16 versus first half '16 trends are very positive. Currently, we anticipate second half shipments will be up mid- to high single digits sequentially.
Momentum continues to build in 3D NAND with total 3D NAND shipped capacity at the end of calendar '16 now tracking to the higher end of the 350,000 to 400,000 wafer starts per month outlook that we provided earlier. In DRAM, spending remains focused on the 2z nanometer and 1x nanometer conversions with about 50% of industry capacity converted to 20-nanometer and MEMS mid-single digits converted to 1x, we believe, by the end of this calendar year. We remain optimistic on content demand drivers for DRAM in clients and service, which combined with our customers' prudent responses to managing supply in response to the PC demand weak first -- earlier in the year, are already pointing to early signs of improving supply and demand balance. This sentiment biases us positively for a recovery in DRAM CapEx as we look into the next calendar year.
As we enter the second half of 2016, we are excited by the inflection-driven long-term outperformance opportunities for Lam. Also our strong install base market share positions across all geographies and when combined with KT, further increased strategic relevance to our customers by providing them more valuable innovation, trusted productivity and fast solutions.
With that, let me hand the call over to Doug."

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today during what I know is a busy earnings time.The June quarter results represented a solid conclusion to the 2016 fiscal year. In the quarter, we perfo",1516,"Okay, great. Thank you, Martin. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today during what I know is a busy earnings time.
The June quarter results represented a solid conclusion to the 2016 fiscal year. In the quarter, we performed above the midpoint of guidance for all metrics with operating margin and earnings per share above the high end of the range. For the fiscal year, shipments, revenues, operating income dollars and earnings per share were all at record-high levels. We delivered double-digit revenue growth fiscal year over fiscal year at twice the rate of revenue growth.
Moving now to the specifics for the June quarter. Shipments were $1,587,000,000, up approximately 10% compared to the March quarter and just slightly below the record-high level that we saw in the June 2015 quarter. The combined memory segment made up 66% of system shipments, and that was down from 70% in the prior quarter. 
Nonvolatile memory shipments contributed 51% of the system shipments, and this was up from 43% in the March quarter. The nonvolatile shipment dollars represent record levels for Lam Research. As we progressed through the first half of the year, 3D NAND investments have accelerated with multiple customers moving forward in their 3D NAND ramp plans. 
We are continuing to see the expansion of our SAM, and this, combined with our success in winning critical applications in the 3D NAND process flows of our customers, is driving the financial performance we're delivering. 
3D NAND will represent over 95% of NAND shipments for 2016. As we expected, DRAM shipments decreased to 15% from 27% in the prior quarter. Investment is pacing at a rational reduced level in response to market conditions. 
DRAM spending was predominantly focused on 20-nanometer conversions with a continued objective of lowering cost per bit. PC DRAM pricing seems to have bottomed as the market shifts to server and mobile DRAM.
Server and mobile represents roughly 2/3 of the market bit growth this year. System shipments into the foundry segment increased to 27%, which is up from 23% in the March quarter. And as Martin mentioned, foundry spending continues to be broad based with an increasing contribution from 10-nanometer capacity additions augmented by the ongoing investment at 28-nanometer and above nodes, primarily in China. The logic and other segment held steady at 7% of system shipments, which was a level similar to that we saw in the March quarter. From a geographic standpoint. China continued to be strong, representing 17% of total shipments and 22% of total revenue. 
June quarter revenues came in at $1,546,000,000, a sequential increase of 18% and above the midpoint of our guidance. Gross margin was strong in the period at 46.6%, which was a 150 basis point improvement from the 45.1% that we saw in the March quarter. The strength in gross margin was a result of higher business volumes as well as favorable product mix. And as we've described previously, you should expect to see variability quarter to quarter in our gross margins. And I'd just like to remind you that our financial model is the best reference to help you think about margins over time.
Our operating expenses for the quarter were within our expectations at $361 million, which was an increase on an absolute basis from the $350 million in the March quarter but decreasing to 23% of revenue in the June quarter versus 27% in March.
In the June quarter, our spending allocated to R&D was 63% of total spending. During the quarter, we completed construction on our new R&D lab in Fremont, California. This lab will put us at the state of the art in terms of capability and flexibility to continue to develop leading-edge process capability and productivity solutions.
Operating income for the quarter was very strong at $359 million. It was an increase of 48% compared to the $242 million in the March quarter. Operating margin increased from 18.4% to 23.2%, above the high end of the guidance range due to both the higher revenue as well as the stronger gross margin. This operating margin percentage is the second-highest level since our acquisition of Novellus in 2012.
Our tax rate came in at 10%, which was lower than the 14% rate last quarter primarily due to more income from lower tax jurisdictions. A rate in the low teens for the remainder of 2016 would be a reasonable number for you to use in your modeling.
Earnings per share for the June quarter were $1.80 based on a share count of approximately 175 million shares. The share count includes dilution from both the 2018 and 2041 convertible notes and the outstanding 2016 warrants with a total dilutive impact of about 13 million shares on a non-GAAP basis.
In the June quarter, our $450 million 2016 convertible note matured and was settled for both cash and stock. The stock issuance was offset by the corresponding bond hedge that we had in place.
Dilution schedules for the remaining convertible notes are available on our Investor Relations website for your reference. We returned $0.30 per share for a total of $47 million in dividend distributions to our shareholders in the quarter. There were no share repurchases in the quarter in line with our previously announced plans around the business combination with KLA-Tencor.
Let me now turn to the balance sheet. We have a very solid cash position of $7.1 billion on the balance sheet, reflecting both the strong performance of the business as well as steps we've taken to increase the cash position of the company during the quarter. We generated a strong cash from operations of $424 million, which was an increase of 132% sequentially in the quarter. Cash from operations for the fiscal year came in at $1,350,000,000, a record-high level. As expected, day sales outstanding for the period improved to 74 days from 86 days with the shipment profile more linear than in the March quarter. Inventory turns improved to 3.5x. 
We completed the issuance of $2.4 billion in principal value of investment-grade senior notes in May. This issuance, together with $1.5 million in term loans, completes the required financing for the KLA-Tencor transaction.
The net interest expense associated with the $2.4 billion financing is $4 million and is excluded from our non-GAAP results in this quarter. On a full quarter basis, the net interest expense from this new debt will be approximately $18 million. The deferred revenue balance at the end of the June quarter stood at $566 million, an 11% increase quarter-over-quarter. That number excludes approximately $132 million from shipments to customers in Japan, which will convert to revenue in future quarters.
And recall that those Japan shipments remain as inventory carried at cost on the balance sheet. I expect that deferred revenue will again grow in the September quarter. 
Company noncash expenses during the quarter included the following: $39 million for equity comp; $39 million for amortization and $36 million for depreciation.
Capital expenditures were $52 million, which is up from $46 million in the March quarter. CapEx projects included investment in infrastructure expansion from an additional engineering lab space to support the growth of the company. 
During the quarter, we sold our sample as a campus for net proceeds of approximately $80 million and a gain of $15 million. This gain is excluded from our non-GAAP results. This transaction is part of our R&D consolidation into the Fremont site. We exited the quarter with approximately 7,500 regular full-time employees. The growth in headcount was primarily related to growth in factory resources to support the growing business level. Additionally, we added some R&D heads.
So now looking ahead, I'd like to provide our non-GAAP guidance for the September quarter. We're expecting shipments of $1,700,000,000, plus or minus $75 million. This midpoint would represent a record level of shipments for Lam Research.
We expect revenue of $1,625,000,000, again, plus or minus $75 million. This midpoint would also represent a record level of revenue. Expect gross margin of 45.5%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. Gross margin is down sequentially due to higher customer concentration in September. 
We forecast operating margins of 22.5%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. And finally, we forecast earnings per share of $1.77 plus or minus $0.10, based on a share count of approximately 176 million shares.
This earnings per share number excludes the $18 million associated with the $2.4 billion KLA-Tencor financing. The net interest expense will be excluded from our non-GAAP results until such time as the deal closes. We expect full shipments and revenue to be stronger in the second half than the first half with mid- to high single-digit growth in shipments in the second half of the calendar year compared to the first half. We expect revenue growth in the second half to outpace shipment growth half over half. We expect to deplete some of the deferred revenue balance by the end of the calendar year.
And that concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, Martin and I would like now to open up the call for questions."

And what we said I think fairly consistently is that the conviction to an IC 2020 and '25 agenda appears very solid and robust. There are very strategic actions, sometimes involving global companies, sometimes the domestic community. We're tracking at least 20 different fab-level kind of ambition statements. And there's a full spectrum of kind of probability associated with each one of those. There clearly is over a multiple-year time frame more than 1 million wafer starts per month out there as a kind of reference point for installed base capacity in China relative to it being incremental. For me, that's all about performance and cost of devices, and if the performance and cost of devices out of China can be a catalyst and a trigger for incremental demand, it's kind of positive for a global kind of industry, including Lam. So time will tell, but clearly, the commitment appears to be there. And as Doug said in his prepared comments, China is not an insignificant part of the revenues for the industry and the company."

There are plenty of examples now in our industry where people are employing similar strategies. If your question maybe more relates to the competitive dynamic between e-beam and optical, our sense is that the industry consensus is very complementary technologies. We're not, obviously, in a position to speak to KLA's business. But from the seat that we have with limited knowledge of the details, the latest generation optical inspection capabilities that KLA has brought to the market appear very robust and getting pretty solid traction. So no real change in how we think about it. Perhaps further validation of the vision, and to kind of restate what I said before, we're targeting to close this thing. And we're working diligently with agencies to get that done.

The headline is that we delivered strong results that continue to reinforce our increasingly strong presence in the industry as the enabling technology inflections continue to intensify around etch and deposition processes. In addition, the quality of our earnings rises as a higher proportion of our market share occurs in critical applications, which are characterized by extreme technical complexity and multiyear cycles of learning for the company. 
Lastly, our expectations for performance in the second half of calendar '16 are stronger than previously articulated. We believe that with sustained focus on execution, in partnership with our customers, multiyear outperformance opportunity is set to continue.
Lam's shipments, revenue and non-GAAP gross margins were above the midpoints and non-GAAP earnings above the high end of our guided ranges for the recent quarter. I would like to take a moment to acknowledge the support of our customers and the contributions of all Lam employees, without whom, our performance would not be possible. I would also like to recognize the support we've received from our suppliers, who have helped us to ramp our capacity, increase responsiveness to customers, increase localization and support our rapid product development cycles. Thank you, all.
At the core of Lam's outperformance is our culture and values, our close partnership with our customers and our ability to deliver innovative products, service and capabilities at scale which directly address key semiconductor manufacturing technology and market inflections, such as 3D NANDs multi-patterning FinFETs and advanced packaging. Our predominant focus is always on increasing the probability of success for our customers, contributing to their stated business objectives. 
In that context, the importance of these technology inflections and their enabling of new industry growth vectors has never been stronger. Our leading customers are moving to capitalize on the acceleration in innovation centered on the next wave of industry application drivers, such as virtual reality, artificial intelligence and connected devices and automobiles. They articulate aspirations to change the world.
Realizing the potential of these application drivers will demand unprecedented scaling of performance, power and costs for compute, storage and networking significantly beyond what is possible with traditional scaling and shrink and Moore's law. In essence, this reenergizing of our industry demands a more holistic approach to systems architecture through the entire semiconductor ecosystem. 
In cloud server storage and networking devices, this revolution is driving significant semiconductor demand for DRAM, NAND, new memory technologies and, over time, additional logic chip demand for advanced computation necessary for converting data into actionable information. Growth in semiconductor content for DRAM, NAND, and leading- and trailing-edge logic is a strong theme also in clients' devices like smart phones, IoT and connected automobiles to deliver the power of new industry application drivers and enrich the end-consumer experience.
We believe that Lam is in an outstanding position to help drive needed innovation and capitalize on the opportunities presented by current and future inflections. The foundation of the last several years -- great employees, strong ecosystem trust and the increasing quality of product and technology road maps -- delivers an execution track record, proven financial outperformance and leads to our recognized market leadership position. 
Lam's etch and deposition products and their on-wafer performance are vital to our customer success, no doubt. In partnership, we are enabling multipatterning-driven scaling in logic and DRAM. We are facilitating cost-reduction and density scaling for 3D NAND and new memory technologies and supporting increased compute performance and memory bandwidth with FinFET and advanced packaging technology inflections.
One characterization of our strategic relevance is in our expanding market opportunity. As a result of our strategic and operational executions through the last several years, Lam's addressable market as a share of WFE has increased from 26.5% in 2013 to over 30% last year and is on track once again to exceed the performance of overall WFE in 2016.
The 3D NAND inflection, in particular, has accelerated and is driving a greater than 30% growth in 2016 NAND's WFE year-over-year as our customers target probably the single-largest growth opportunity in all of semis over the next few years. NAND is still in the early stages of penetration with its share of total bits addressable at under 20% of the overall Flash and spinning media storage market combined.
Underpinning the strong product cycle for NAND in storage is the visibility provided by the technology road map of our customers, which extends well into the next decade. Etch and deposition are the key process technology enablers of 3D NAND, a fact that is perhaps best illustrated by the greater than 2x growth in our nonvolatile memory markets over the last 2 years and exciting multiyear growth outlook going forward.
In addition to the demanding requirements for high-aspect ratio etch and cost and technology enabling, mold-stack scaling in 3D, atomic-level processing is growing increasingly important as storage layer counts scale from 40-plus today to over 60 next year and eventually to more than 100 layers in the next few years. Lam has prepared its product portfolio for this trend. 
Our latest ALTUS system with low-fluorine tungsten atomic layer deposition or ALD capability is being qualified at multiple customers. This system enables the next-generation 3D NAND and DRAM by delivering an innovative ALD solution with lower fluorine impurities, differentiated stress control and void-free fill properties.
Our VECTOR Strata PECVD deposition product is seeing very strong momentum with its industry-leading productivity and film property control for mold-stack deposition and is now process tool of record at the significant majority of global 3D NAND customers. Our dielectric etch install base for high-aspect ratio applications in 3D NAND and DRAM has more than doubled over the last year. This strong performance of the portfolio of our VECTOR Strata and ALTUS deposition and Flex and Kiyo etch products have allowed us to remain on track with our objective first shared with you at SEMICON West a year ago of 7 to 10 percentage points of share gain from the 2D to 3D NAND's transition.
Another important element of the value we bring to our customers and enabling the growth of our systems market share is our customer support business group, which is leading value creation across the entirety of our 40,000 process modules in the install base. This organization inside of our company is providing world-class support for our new systems during integrated circuit production ramp and addressing our customers' ongoing and critical operational needs for spares and services over lifetime. 
But increasingly, this organization is also contributing highly innovative, differentiated technology, productivity and life-cycle solutions resulting in substantial served market growth and an increasing revenue stream annuity that supports our investments in our future.
Now turning to a Lam and KLA-Tencor merger update. To reemphasize the points made many times before, the outperformance potential of Lam is set to continue for multiple years, we believe, this period of strength we have chosen to harness strategically through the planned business combination of 2 great companies. We continue to make progress with antitrust agency reviews. We are pleased with the overall tone of support from our customers for this investment, and without compromising the focus on execution in 2 stand-alone companies, the integration planning is in better shape today than was true for Lam and Novellus at this same point in the process. Excitement and substance internally and with our customers is building. 
We continue to work diligently to receive the necessary approvals and now target completion of our merger in the coming few months. We have no doubt this is a value-creating transaction for our customers and company, for our employees and suppliers worldwide. 
The opportunity remains. We are 100% committed to innovate beyond what is possible for the 2 stand-alone companies separately to the benefit of the overall semi ecosystem and add to the potential of Lam as currently defined.
Now turning to an overview of capital equipment spending patterns in 2016. Expectations for global economic growth have remained generally stable since our last report. Although there have been some increased uncertainty with the possible effects of Brexit, end market demand expectations for PCs has been relatively stable, and there's evidence of solid growth in low-end smartphones and slightly slower units but stronger content expectations today in high-end smartphones. We continue to expect solid and long-term demand for leading-edge silicon in the enterprise markets driven by the move to the cloud. 
WFE for 2016 continues to track to $33 billion, plus or minus $1 billion. Our bottoms-up analytics imply at or slightly above the midpoint is most likely. 
By segments, memory WFE tracks to approximately $15 billion with spending more biased to NAND than DRAM this year and, for sure, since our last update. We now expect NAND CapEx to be up over 30% offset by DRAM CapEx, which we now expect to be down approximately 40%.
Logic and foundry CapEx is tracking slightly better than our prior expectations. Spending in these segments is weighted primarily to an addition of 10-nanometer and some pilot 7-nanometer capacity as well as additions at the mature 28-nanometer and 40-nanometer technology nodes with China featuring prominently, driven by strength in low- and mid-end smartphones and IOT devices.
Despite a flattish WFE year with some segment mix headwinds for our company, including a substantial decline in DRAM CapEx this year, Lam once again is poised to outperform WFE in calendar 2016. We are confident that calendar year-over-year revenues and second half '16 versus first half '16 trends are very positive. Currently, we anticipate second half shipments will be up mid- to high single digits sequentially.
Momentum continues to build in 3D NAND with total 3D NAND shipped capacity at the end of calendar '16 now tracking to the higher end of the 350,000 to 400,000 wafer starts per month outlook that we provided earlier. In DRAM, spending remains focused on the 2z nanometer and 1x nanometer conversions with about 50% of industry capacity converted to 20-nanometer and MEMS mid-single digits converted to 1x, we believe, by the end of this calendar year. We remain optimistic on content demand drivers for DRAM in clients and service, which combined with our customers' prudent responses to managing supply in response to the PC demand weak first -- earlier in the year, are already pointing to early signs of improving supply and demand balance. This sentiment biases us positively for a recovery in DRAM CapEx as we look into the next calendar year.
As we enter the second half of 2016, we are excited by the inflection-driven long-term outperformance opportunities for Lam. Also our strong install base market share positions across all geographies and when combined with KT, further increased strategic relevance to our customers by providing them more valuable innovation, trusted productivity and fast solutions.
With that, let me hand the call over to Doug."

The June quarter results represented a solid conclusion to the 2016 fiscal year. In the quarter, we performed above the midpoint of guidance for all metrics with operating margin and earnings per share above the high end of the range. For the fiscal year, shipments, revenues, operating income dollars and earnings per share were all at record-high levels. We delivered double-digit revenue growth fiscal year over fiscal year at twice the rate of revenue growth.
Moving now to the specifics for the June quarter. Shipments were $1,587,000,000, up approximately 10% compared to the March quarter and just slightly below the record-high level that we saw in the June 2015 quarter. The combined memory segment made up 66% of system shipments, and that was down from 70% in the prior quarter. 
Nonvolatile memory shipments contributed 51% of the system shipments, and this was up from 43% in the March quarter. The nonvolatile shipment dollars represent record levels for Lam Research. As we progressed through the first half of the year, 3D NAND investments have accelerated with multiple customers moving forward in their 3D NAND ramp plans. 
We are continuing to see the expansion of our SAM, and this, combined with our success in winning critical applications in the 3D NAND process flows of our customers, is driving the financial performance we're delivering. 
3D NAND will represent over 95% of NAND shipments for 2016. As we expected, DRAM shipments decreased to 15% from 27% in the prior quarter. Investment is pacing at a rational reduced level in response to market conditions. 
DRAM spending was predominantly focused on 20-nanometer conversions with a continued objective of lowering cost per bit. PC DRAM pricing seems to have bottomed as the market shifts to server and mobile DRAM.
Server and mobile represents roughly 2/3 of the market bit growth this year. System shipments into the foundry segment increased to 27%, which is up from 23% in the March quarter. And as Martin mentioned, foundry spending continues to be broad based with an increasing contribution from 10-nanometer capacity additions augmented by the ongoing investment at 28-nanometer and above nodes, primarily in China. The logic and other segment held steady at 7% of system shipments, which was a level similar to that we saw in the March quarter. From a geographic standpoint. China continued to be strong, representing 17% of total shipments and 22% of total revenue. 
June quarter revenues came in at $1,546,000,000, a sequential increase of 18% and above the midpoint of our guidance. Gross margin was strong in the period at 46.6%, which was a 150 basis point improvement from the 45.1% that we saw in the March quarter. The strength in gross margin was a result of higher business volumes as well as favorable product mix. And as we've described previously, you should expect to see variability quarter to quarter in our gross margins. And I'd just like to remind you that our financial model is the best reference to help you think about margins over time.
Our operating expenses for the quarter were within our expectations at $361 million, which was an increase on an absolute basis from the $350 million in the March quarter but decreasing to 23% of revenue in the June quarter versus 27% in March.
In the June quarter, our spending allocated to R&D was 63% of total spending. During the quarter, we completed construction on our new R&D lab in Fremont, California. This lab will put us at the state of the art in terms of capability and flexibility to continue to develop leading-edge process capability and productivity solutions.
Operating income for the quarter was very strong at $359 million. It was an increase of 48% compared to the $242 million in the March quarter. Operating margin increased from 18.4% to 23.2%, above the high end of the guidance range due to both the higher revenue as well as the stronger gross margin. This operating margin percentage is the second-highest level since our acquisition of Novellus in 2012.
Our tax rate came in at 10%, which was lower than the 14% rate last quarter primarily due to more income from lower tax jurisdictions. A rate in the low teens for the remainder of 2016 would be a reasonable number for you to use in your modeling.
Earnings per share for the June quarter were $1.80 based on a share count of approximately 175 million shares. The share count includes dilution from both the 2018 and 2041 convertible notes and the outstanding 2016 warrants with a total dilutive impact of about 13 million shares on a non-GAAP basis.
In the June quarter, our $450 million 2016 convertible note matured and was settled for both cash and stock. The stock issuance was offset by the corresponding bond hedge that we had in place.
Dilution schedules for the remaining convertible notes are available on our Investor Relations website for your reference. We returned $0.30 per share for a total of $47 million in dividend distributions to our shareholders in the quarter. There were no share repurchases in the quarter in line with our previously announced plans around the business combination with KLA-Tencor.
Let me now turn to the balance sheet. We have a very solid cash position of $7.1 billion on the balance sheet, reflecting both the strong performance of the business as well as steps we've taken to increase the cash position of the company during the quarter. We generated a strong cash from operations of $424 million, which was an increase of 132% sequentially in the quarter. Cash from operations for the fiscal year came in at $1,350,000,000, a record-high level. As expected, day sales outstanding for the period improved to 74 days from 86 days with the shipment profile more linear than in the March quarter. Inventory turns improved to 3.5x. 
We completed the issuance of $2.4 billion in principal value of investment-grade senior notes in May. This issuance, together with $1.5 million in term loans, completes the required financing for the KLA-Tencor transaction.
The net interest expense associated with the $2.4 billion financing is $4 million and is excluded from our non-GAAP results in this quarter. On a full quarter basis, the net interest expense from this new debt will be approximately $18 million. The deferred revenue balance at the end of the June quarter stood at $566 million, an 11% increase quarter-over-quarter. That number excludes approximately $132 million from shipments to customers in Japan, which will convert to revenue in future quarters.
And recall that those Japan shipments remain as inventory carried at cost on the balance sheet. I expect that deferred revenue will again grow in the September quarter. 
Company noncash expenses during the quarter included the following: $39 million for equity comp; $39 million for amortization and $36 million for depreciation.
Capital expenditures were $52 million, which is up from $46 million in the March quarter. CapEx projects included investment in infrastructure expansion from an additional engineering lab space to support the growth of the company. 
During the quarter, we sold our sample as a campus for net proceeds of approximately $80 million and a gain of $15 million. This gain is excluded from our non-GAAP results. This transaction is part of our R&D consolidation into the Fremont site. We exited the quarter with approximately 7,500 regular full-time employees. The growth in headcount was primarily related to growth in factory resources to support the growing business level. Additionally, we added some R&D heads.
So now looking ahead, I'd like to provide our non-GAAP guidance for the September quarter. We're expecting shipments of $1,700,000,000, plus or minus $75 million. This midpoint would represent a record level of shipments for Lam Research.
We expect revenue of $1,625,000,000, again, plus or minus $75 million. This midpoint would also represent a record level of revenue. Expect gross margin of 45.5%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. Gross margin is down sequentially due to higher customer concentration in September. 
We forecast operating margins of 22.5%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. And finally, we forecast earnings per share of $1.77 plus or minus $0.10, based on a share count of approximately 176 million shares.
This earnings per share number excludes the $18 million associated with the $2.4 billion KLA-Tencor financing. The net interest expense will be excluded from our non-GAAP results until such time as the deal closes. We expect full shipments and revenue to be stronger in the second half than the first half with mid- to high single-digit growth in shipments in the second half of the calendar year compared to the first half. We expect revenue growth in the second half to outpace shipment growth half over half. We expect to deplete some of the deferred revenue balance by the end of the calendar year.
And that concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, Martin and I would like now to open up the call for questions."

There are very strategic actions, sometimes involving global companies, sometimes the domestic community. We're tracking at least 20 different fab-level kind of ambition statements. And there's a full spectrum of kind of probability associated with each one of those. There clearly is over a multiple-year time frame more than 1 million wafer starts per month out there as a kind of reference point for installed base capacity in China relative to it being incremental. For me, that's all about performance and cost of devices, and if the performance and cost of devices out of China can be a catalyst and a trigger for incremental demand, it's kind of positive for a global kind of industry, including Lam. So time will tell, but clearly, the commitment appears to be there. And as Doug said in his prepared comments, China is not an insignificant part of the revenues for the industry and the company."

I will tell you that we believe this transaction is fundamentally different than the conversation and the transaction that you just referred to. There is no overlap whatsoever. We strongly believe in the merits of this transaction. We believe it's pro-competitive. We believe that Lam and KT together can innovate and deliver value to our customers beyond what we can do as independent companies. We are, as you know, from prior disclosure, codifying kind of the behavior that will be relevant to the company with the consent decree conversation, and I think we're on records in prior earnings calls on that point. One part of that, obviously, is describing our commitment to the entire semiconductor ecosystem relative to availability, supply and support kind of KT products. And that's just kind of part of this process, and we're stepping through and working diligently and collaboratively with agencies. We respect their work products. And as you likely anticipate, the crystal ball of Lam Research doesn't extend beyond the precision that we're kind of currently articulating. So we're doing the best we can to give you our best knowledge, and we'll continue to make that commitment."

There's always an ebb and a flow, and I'm sure every one customer has a slightly different characterization of this.

So we all have some version of the same vision, I think, to deliver more predictable process to our customers to open up process windows, to deliver their road maps with higher-quality, lower-cost IC devices. And whether we call that holistic litho or holistic etch or holistic dep or holistic process -- we've all got our nomenclature, but I think the strategy and the model of collaboration for our company is set to continue, I hope, for many years."

Anticipating our upcoming Investor and Analyst Meeting planned for New York on November 18, I will keep my prepared comments shorter than usual. The focus today will include financial, operational and market highlights for the September quarter and calendar year 2016, an update on recent changes in the industry environments and initial perspectives we have on calendar '17. Doug will then provide details of our financials and summarize guidance for the December quarter before we open the call for questions.
Demonstrating the constancy of our focus, quality of alignment in the company and commitments to invest in the future of the company for these last several years, Lam delivers another outstanding quarter, reporting record shipments, including a record high foundry shipments, record total company revenues and non-GAAP net income. As is always the case, how you do something is at least as important as what you do, more so in the context of our multi-year growth and value aspirations. Accordingly, we have a permanent focus on customer-oriented core values and culture and an extraordinary commitment to operational execution and company scaling.
Our supply chain, our factories, our field service organizations, once again, delivered terrific performance. We achieved a new record for shipments in the quarter. We are on track to deliver our customers a combination of schedule flexibility and on-time performance for the year that is a significant enhancements of capabilities. And as shown by our guidance today, we are gearing up for an additional growth in December.
Our differentiated product pipeline momentum continues at pace, most recently with metal ALD in 3D NAND and atomic-level etch in dielectric foundry applications. In addition, our business teams are achieving more than 90% success in critical defenses and new market application penetrations combined, which is extremely rewarding. This is an exciting time to be part of the semiconductor ecosystem, no doubt. In the world of foundry/logic, the demonstrated performance benefits of 10-nanometer technology and commitments of our customers and reportedly more than 20 of their customers to the near-term 7-nanometer roadmap are strong endorsements of the diversity of cloud mobility and high-performance computing-enabled consumer and enterprise applications.
What is clear in this segment also is the importance of 3D architecture at both the chip and systems integration level. Innovation in our technology and product roadmap for the transistor, interconnect and also advanced packaging applications is a critical priority for systematically strengthening our strategic relevance. We believe Lam is one of very few companies gaining share through these rounds of foundry/logic technology node transitions. Our segment exposure continues to be more balanced and objective and results we are particularly pleased with.
Worthy of note, in a world where we estimate foundry wafer fabrication equipment spending grows 25% year-over-year 2016 compared to 2015, we are communicating to you today with our presented results and December guidance, a view that our founding shipments for the year increased by approximately 40%.
Illustratively, 48 layer 3D NAND is enabling the 256 gigabyte high density storage that is required to power high-resolution image capture in dual cameras in smartphone devices. Similarly, in the data center, 3D NAND-based SSDs allow for hundreds of terabytes of high-speed storage to be located within the server itself, enabling cost-efficient scale from cloud-based services. 
Looking ahead, the roadmap is well-defined and looks very promising for 3D NAND. At the recent Flash Memory Summit in Santa Clara, our customers highlighted the numerous design and integration options not previously available with planar technology such as scaling layer counts. And the ability to transition from 3-level cells to quad-level cells and leveraging pitch and density scaling to target different storage end markets.
Lam was privileged to be the only major semiconductor equipment maker invited to present to the conference. Independent recognition of our critical role in the 3D NAND inflection and the commentary boost on the opportunity and responsibility for Lam that is shared with our customers. Long-term WFE growth is only made possible with end market demand catalysts and process technology inflections.
Combined with these 2 drivers, our roadmap and multi-year execution make possible the fifth consecutive year in 2016 where our SAM has outperformed WFE. Looking forward, we have targets and strategies that we will specifically discuss in November to enable and participate in these outperformance trends for many years to come. Our ability to capitalize on this extraordinary opportunity is all about leadership, execution, and is measured ultimately by customer trust and competitive differentiation. 
As illustrations, in conductor etch, our Kiyo family with its Hydra multi-zone temperature control technology provides the most technically advanced production-proven etching performance critical for logic and DRAM multi-patterning in the industry. Lam has the broadest and strongest conductor etch position, especially in 3D NAND where Kiyo has now been qualified for 4 production at all NAND customers for a majority of applications, which we believe achieved position in more than 2/3 of the available market.
In dielectric etch, we continue to make several technology and productivity enhancements to our Flex family, including most recently, the release of atomic-level etch capability. Our ALE innovation features a proprietary Advanced Mixed Mode Pulsing capability, delivers a 2x improvement in selectivity versus conventional etching while providing atomic-level control over variability, critical to address issues like RC delay for advanced foundry and logic process nodes. The Flex series products are seeing substantial momentum in 3D NAND and are now qualified as production tool of record for critical high aspect ratio applications at all major customers.
In deposition, our ALTUS tungsten fill and VECTOR dielectric deposition systems are seeing very few momentum that is set to continue into next year. 2017 will be the year of 64-layer 3D NANDs. And Lam's product innovations and application share momentum position us well to improve our market share as we head into next year.
Complementing our leading-edge and critical application strength, the performance of more than 40,000 Lam process modules installed provides a strong platform for overall business momentum and is a key focus of our customer support business group. This business is on track for another record year. More important than reported growth in any 1 year, however, is the increased confidence of sustaining long-term profitable growth trajectory of the company. In the last several years, we have fundamentally improved our capability to support our customers through local manufacturing and warehousing, innovative technology and productivity upgrade solutions, refurbished equipment sales and service and product solutions to overall fab productivity improvements. These investments are paying dividends. Again, more to follow at our investor event.
Now let me provide a short overview of customer equipment spending trends for calendar 2016 and our preliminary expectations for 2017. Outlook for global economic growth and unit shipments for PCs and smartphones have remained stable since our last report. Increasingly more important than unit demand for traditional consumer computing devices, however, is the significant growth in content for leading-edge memory and logic devices in smartphones and servers. This dynamic is being driven by the high end -- by the end market demand inflections I spoke of earlier, and is powering our SAM growth outperformance opportunity. WFE spending for 2016 is now tracking slightly above the high end of our previously communicated range, driven by stronger foundry and 3D NAND CapEx investments. Sequentially, for calendar '16, NAND WFE is now on track to grow over 40%, foundry over 20%, and expectations for DRAM CapEx remain unchanged at down approximately 40% year-over-year.
Momentum and commitments continues to build for 3D NAND where we now expect total industry shipped capacity to reach approximately 425,000 wafer starts per month by the end of this calendar year. We are confident of sustainable, positive, long-term trends in this segment.
At the same time, our strength in foundry logic continues to build where we are realizing the benefits of multiyear efforts through customer spending associated with additional qualifications and PTOR wins for 10 and 7-nanometer devices. Despite the challenges of DRAM and certain pockets of logic spending in 2016, despite also the memory versus logic segment headwinds for the company relative to our peers this year, we are on track to grow several shipments meaningfully for the fifth straight calendar year at a CAGR of approximately 18% over that extended period. 
As we look into 2017, we are encouraged by the strong momentum in 3D NAND. For numerous reasons, we are also more convinced and convicted in our belief that DRAM supply and DRAM -- sorry, DRAM supply and demand conditions will continue to improve, as we previously indicated. As a result, we have an upward bias to spending expectations for DRAM and NAND in 2017.
We expect flat to a modest pullback in logic foundry spending as customers digest the 10-nanometer investments made in 2016 and commence initial 7-nanometer roadmaps. Overall, we are modeling slightly higher total WFE spend in 2017, with memory versus logic segments tailwinds for the company once more. Again, our objective will be to outgrow WFE in 2017.
To summarize, fundamental to our strong performance has been our strategy to partner closely with our customers to help address their most tough and difficult challenges. Despite, as we conveyed a couple of weeks ago, the disappointments at not being able to deliver to our customers the potential of unmatched capability and innovation from Lam and KLA-Tencor combined, we're very excited by the demonstrated multi-year strength and inflection-driven outperformance future opportunity for Lam Research. With continued execution, a robust product pipeline, overall stronger installed base and market share positions and increased strategic relevance to our customers, we believe the innovation to support long-term value creation for all stakeholders is a valid ambition for Lam Research.
Before turning the call over for additional details on our financial performance and outlook, I would like to extend my genuine thanks to our customers and employees who together make the exciting story of Lam Research possible, their support and encouragement inspires us each day to achieve our full potential. Doug?"

The September quarter results reflect another quarter of solid execution and record results. In the quarter, shipments, revenue, net income and cash from operations were at the highest level we delivered in the history of Lam Research. We're obviously very pleased with what we achieved this quarter.
Shipments in the September quarter were $1,708,000,000, up approximately 8% compared to the June quarter, and at a record level for the company. The combined memory segment made up 56% of system shipments, and that was down from 66% in the prior quarter. Nonvolatile memory shipments contributed 43% of the system shipments and this was down from 51% in the June quarter. 3D NAND investments are continuing at a healthy level with customers committed to their plans for scaling the technology to reduce costs, enhanced performance and increased output in response to strong customer demand. Our deposition net products are critical to enabling the scaling for our customers. We're extremely well-positioned with the PTOR decision made by our customers in what may be the largest multi-year growth opportunity in semiconductors.
Customer discipline remains intact in the DRAM segment, with shipments making up 13% of total system shipments compared to 15% in the prior quarter. There appears to be a stabilization of the supply/demand balance and we're seeing positive momentum in the marketplace as a result. Demand is strengthening, led by content growth in both smartphones and servers. Spot pricing is showing improvement. System shipments into the foundry segment was a bright spot as margin -- as Martin mentioned, and increased to 36%, which was up from 27% in the June quarter. The system shipment dollars in foundry represented a record high level for Lam Research. Foundry spend was biased toward investments to execute 10-nanometer RAM and 7-nanometer pilot projects. We also saw continued spend predominantly in the China region at the 28-nanometer and above nodes. And finally, the logic and other segment came in at 8% of system shipments, up from 7% in the June quarter. Logic spending was largely in support of conversions to the 10-nanometer node. 
We set a new record for revenue in the September quarter. Revenue came in at $1,632,000,000, which was a sequential increase of 6% and a little bit above the midpoint of our guidance. Gross margin was a little lower than the midpoint of guidance at 45.2%. As I've previously stated, we expect to see some quarter-to-quarter variability in our gross margin due to factors like business volumes and mix. And I'll remind you, the financial model is the best reference to help you analyze our ongoing financial performance. And I look forward to sharing an update to the financial model with you at our Investor Day in November.
Our operating expenses for the quarter were $372 million, which was an increase of 3% from the $361 million in the June quarter, and it held steady at about 23% of revenue. OpEx spending allocated to R&D was again at benchmark levels of 63% of total spending in the quarter.
Operating income for the quarter was again strong at $366 million, an increase of 2% compared to the $359 million in the June quarter. Operating margin decreased slightly to 22.4%, down from 23.2% in the prior quarter, primarily due to the lower gross margins. The September quarter tax rate came in at approximately 12%, which was a little bit higher than the 10% rate last quarter, primarily due to changes in the level and mix of jurisdictional income. Our rate in the low to mid-teens for the December quarter would be a reasonable number figure to use in your modeling.
Earnings per share for the September quarter were $1.81 based on a share count of approximately 178 million shares. The share count includes dilution from both the 2018 and 2041 convertible notes and the remaining 2016 convertible note warrants, with a total dilutive impact of about 15 million shares on a non-GAAP basis. As the stock price continues to rise, the convertible notes will continue to add to the diluted share count, albeit at a decreasing rate of increase. Dilution schedules for the convertible notes are available on our Investor Relations website to help you with your modeling.
We returned $0.30 per share for a total of $48 million in dividend distributions to our shareholders in the quarter. There were no share repurchases during the quarter.
Let me now turn to the balance sheet. At the end of the September quarter, we had $7,470,000,000 in cash on the balance sheet. In line with the plans we stated during our call earlier this month, at this point, we have redeemed the $600 million 2023 senior notes and the $1 billion 2026 senior notes under the Special Mandatory Redemption provision of those notes. The $800 million 2021 senior notes will remain outstanding and will be used for general corporate purposes and other purposes, as can be found in the prospectus. If I pro forma for the cash we returned to bondholders in October, we would have finished the quarter with $5,830,000,000 on the balance sheet. Roughly 40% of this cash is currently domestically available. And I remind you, we continue to generate between 20% and 25% of cash domestically on an ongoing basis.
Cash generation continues to be healthy at the company. In the September quarter, we generated $473 million in cash from operations, which was an increase of 12% sequentially and an all-time quarterly high for the company. Days sales outstanding for the period improved to 72 days from 74 days, with the shipment profile slightly more linear than it was in June. Inventory turns improved from 3.5x to 3.9x. At the end of the September quarter, the deferred revenue balance was $704 million, a 27 -- or excuse me, a 24% increase quarter-over-quarter. That number excludes approximately $65 million from shipments to customers in Japan that will convert to revenue in future quarters. And I'll remind you that those Japan shipments remain as inventory carried at costs on the balance sheet.
Company noncash expenses during the quarter include the following: $39 million for equity compensation; $39 million for amortization; and $36 million for depreciation. Capital expenditures were $42 million, which was down from $52 million in the June quarter. We exited the quarter with approximately 7,800 regular full-time employees. We added headcount during the quarter primarily to meet customer needs for additional factory output and field support. Additionally, we added resources to continue our investment in product development.
Let me now turn to our outlook for the December quarter. I'd like to provide the following non-GAAP guidance. We expect shipments of $1,850,000,000, plus or minus $75 million. We expect revenue of $1,840,000,000, again, plus or minus $75 million. We expect gross margin of 46%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. We're forecasting operating margins of 25%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. And finally, we forecast earnings per share of $2.18, plus or minus $0.10, based on a share count of approximately 179 million shares. This earnings per share number excludes roughly $37 million associated with the interest expense, one-time fees and accelerated costs associated with the retirement of the 2023 and 2026 notes as well as the term loan commitments.
With our year-to-date results and the strong guidance I just provided for the December quarter, we anticipate that calendar year 2016 will be another record year of financial outperformance for the company, a fifth consecutive year of growth outpacing that of the industry as a whole.
Before transitioning to the Q&A session, I wanted to pick up on Martin's earlier comment regarding our Investor Day, which is now on November 18. We've decided to host the event in New York to make the event more convenient for a larger group of investors and analysts that are following the company. We look forward to seeing you in New York on the 18th.

And there's also a commentary on SAM expansion. And the headline for the company, if you go back to a 2012 reference point, is we had a portfolio of products that was competing for about 25% or so of wafer fabrication equipment spending. That's in the 33, 34 percentage range probably this year, and we expect in excess of 35% to be the competitive reference point for us, the proportion of WFE that we're competing for with our portfolio next year.

And as also true, the 1x world for DRAM is just beginning in calendar '16, and we think will be kind of the primary change to the installed base in calendar '17. And if I would guess, I would guess that at the end of next year, about half of the installed base in DRAM is 20-nanometer, maybe a 1/4 of the installed base is 1x and a 1/4 of the installed base is about 25 or above.

Anticipating our upcoming Investor and Analyst Meeting planned for New York on November 18, I will keep my prepared comments shorter than usual. The focus today will include financial, operational and market highlights for the September quarter and calendar year 2016, an update on recent changes in the industry environments and initial perspectives we have on calendar '17. Doug will then provide details of our financials and summarize guidance for the December quarter before we open the call for questions.
Demonstrating the constancy of our focus, quality of alignment in the company and commitments to invest in the future of the company for these last several years, Lam delivers another outstanding quarter, reporting record shipments, including a record high foundry shipments, record total company revenues and non-GAAP net income. As is always the case, how you do something is at least as important as what you do, more so in the context of our multi-year growth and value aspirations. Accordingly, we have a permanent focus on customer-oriented core values and culture and an extraordinary commitment to operational execution and company scaling.
Our supply chain, our factories, our field service organizations, once again, delivered terrific performance. We achieved a new record for shipments in the quarter. We are on track to deliver our customers a combination of schedule flexibility and on-time performance for the year that is a significant enhancements of capabilities. And as shown by our guidance today, we are gearing up for an additional growth in December.
Our differentiated product pipeline momentum continues at pace, most recently with metal ALD in 3D NAND and atomic-level etch in dielectric foundry applications. In addition, our business teams are achieving more than 90% success in critical defenses and new market application penetrations combined, which is extremely rewarding. This is an exciting time to be part of the semiconductor ecosystem, no doubt. In the world of foundry/logic, the demonstrated performance benefits of 10-nanometer technology and commitments of our customers and reportedly more than 20 of their customers to the near-term 7-nanometer roadmap are strong endorsements of the diversity of cloud mobility and high-performance computing-enabled consumer and enterprise applications.
What is clear in this segment also is the importance of 3D architecture at both the chip and systems integration level. Innovation in our technology and product roadmap for the transistor, interconnect and also advanced packaging applications is a critical priority for systematically strengthening our strategic relevance. We believe Lam is one of very few companies gaining share through these rounds of foundry/logic technology node transitions. Our segment exposure continues to be more balanced and objective and results we are particularly pleased with.
Worthy of note, in a world where we estimate foundry wafer fabrication equipment spending grows 25% year-over-year 2016 compared to 2015, we are communicating to you today with our presented results and December guidance, a view that our founding shipments for the year increased by approximately 40%.
Illustratively, 48 layer 3D NAND is enabling the 256 gigabyte high density storage that is required to power high-resolution image capture in dual cameras in smartphone devices. Similarly, in the data center, 3D NAND-based SSDs allow for hundreds of terabytes of high-speed storage to be located within the server itself, enabling cost-efficient scale from cloud-based services. 
Looking ahead, the roadmap is well-defined and looks very promising for 3D NAND. At the recent Flash Memory Summit in Santa Clara, our customers highlighted the numerous design and integration options not previously available with planar technology such as scaling layer counts. And the ability to transition from 3-level cells to quad-level cells and leveraging pitch and density scaling to target different storage end markets.
Lam was privileged to be the only major semiconductor equipment maker invited to present to the conference. Independent recognition of our critical role in the 3D NAND inflection and the commentary boost on the opportunity and responsibility for Lam that is shared with our customers. Long-term WFE growth is only made possible with end market demand catalysts and process technology inflections.
Combined with these 2 drivers, our roadmap and multi-year execution make possible the fifth consecutive year in 2016 where our SAM has outperformed WFE. Looking forward, we have targets and strategies that we will specifically discuss in November to enable and participate in these outperformance trends for many years to come. Our ability to capitalize on this extraordinary opportunity is all about leadership, execution, and is measured ultimately by customer trust and competitive differentiation. 
As illustrations, in conductor etch, our Kiyo family with its Hydra multi-zone temperature control technology provides the most technically advanced production-proven etching performance critical for logic and DRAM multi-patterning in the industry. Lam has the broadest and strongest conductor etch position, especially in 3D NAND where Kiyo has now been qualified for 4 production at all NAND customers for a majority of applications, which we believe achieved position in more than 2/3 of the available market.
In dielectric etch, we continue to make several technology and productivity enhancements to our Flex family, including most recently, the release of atomic-level etch capability. Our ALE innovation features a proprietary Advanced Mixed Mode Pulsing capability, delivers a 2x improvement in selectivity versus conventional etching while providing atomic-level control over variability, critical to address issues like RC delay for advanced foundry and logic process nodes. The Flex series products are seeing substantial momentum in 3D NAND and are now qualified as production tool of record for critical high aspect ratio applications at all major customers.
In deposition, our ALTUS tungsten fill and VECTOR dielectric deposition systems are seeing very few momentum that is set to continue into next year. 2017 will be the year of 64-layer 3D NANDs. And Lam's product innovations and application share momentum position us well to improve our market share as we head into next year.
Complementing our leading-edge and critical application strength, the performance of more than 40,000 Lam process modules installed provides a strong platform for overall business momentum and is a key focus of our customer support business group. This business is on track for another record year. More important than reported growth in any 1 year, however, is the increased confidence of sustaining long-term profitable growth trajectory of the company. In the last several years, we have fundamentally improved our capability to support our customers through local manufacturing and warehousing, innovative technology and productivity upgrade solutions, refurbished equipment sales and service and product solutions to overall fab productivity improvements. These investments are paying dividends. Again, more to follow at our investor event.
Now let me provide a short overview of customer equipment spending trends for calendar 2016 and our preliminary expectations for 2017. Outlook for global economic growth and unit shipments for PCs and smartphones have remained stable since our last report. Increasingly more important than unit demand for traditional consumer computing devices, however, is the significant growth in content for leading-edge memory and logic devices in smartphones and servers. This dynamic is being driven by the high end -- by the end market demand inflections I spoke of earlier, and is powering our SAM growth outperformance opportunity. WFE spending for 2016 is now tracking slightly above the high end of our previously communicated range, driven by stronger foundry and 3D NAND CapEx investments. Sequentially, for calendar '16, NAND WFE is now on track to grow over 40%, foundry over 20%, and expectations for DRAM CapEx remain unchanged at down approximately 40% year-over-year.
Momentum and commitments continues to build for 3D NAND where we now expect total industry shipped capacity to reach approximately 425,000 wafer starts per month by the end of this calendar year. We are confident of sustainable, positive, long-term trends in this segment.
At the same time, our strength in foundry logic continues to build where we are realizing the benefits of multiyear efforts through customer spending associated with additional qualifications and PTOR wins for 10 and 7-nanometer devices. Despite the challenges of DRAM and certain pockets of logic spending in 2016, despite also the memory versus logic segment headwinds for the company relative to our peers this year, we are on track to grow several shipments meaningfully for the fifth straight calendar year at a CAGR of approximately 18% over that extended period. 
As we look into 2017, we are encouraged by the strong momentum in 3D NAND. For numerous reasons, we are also more convinced and convicted in our belief that DRAM supply and DRAM -- sorry, DRAM supply and demand conditions will continue to improve, as we previously indicated. As a result, we have an upward bias to spending expectations for DRAM and NAND in 2017.
We expect flat to a modest pullback in logic foundry spending as customers digest the 10-nanometer investments made in 2016 and commence initial 7-nanometer roadmaps. Overall, we are modeling slightly higher total WFE spend in 2017, with memory versus logic segments tailwinds for the company once more. Again, our objective will be to outgrow WFE in 2017.
To summarize, fundamental to our strong performance has been our strategy to partner closely with our customers to help address their most tough and difficult challenges. Despite, as we conveyed a couple of weeks ago, the disappointments at not being able to deliver to our customers the potential of unmatched capability and innovation from Lam and KLA-Tencor combined, we're very excited by the demonstrated multi-year strength and inflection-driven outperformance future opportunity for Lam Research. With continued execution, a robust product pipeline, overall stronger installed base and market share positions and increased strategic relevance to our customers, we believe the innovation to support long-term value creation for all stakeholders is a valid ambition for Lam Research.
Before turning the call over for additional details on our financial performance and outlook, I would like to extend my genuine thanks to our customers and employees who together make the exciting story of Lam Research possible, their support and encouragement inspires us each day to achieve our full potential. Doug?"

The September quarter results reflect another quarter of solid execution and record results. In the quarter, shipments, revenue, net income and cash from operations were at the highest level we delivered in the history of Lam Research. We're obviously very pleased with what we achieved this quarter.
Shipments in the September quarter were $1,708,000,000, up approximately 8% compared to the June quarter, and at a record level for the company. The combined memory segment made up 56% of system shipments, and that was down from 66% in the prior quarter. Nonvolatile memory shipments contributed 43% of the system shipments and this was down from 51% in the June quarter. 3D NAND investments are continuing at a healthy level with customers committed to their plans for scaling the technology to reduce costs, enhanced performance and increased output in response to strong customer demand. Our deposition net products are critical to enabling the scaling for our customers. We're extremely well-positioned with the PTOR decision made by our customers in what may be the largest multi-year growth opportunity in semiconductors.
Customer discipline remains intact in the DRAM segment, with shipments making up 13% of total system shipments compared to 15% in the prior quarter. There appears to be a stabilization of the supply/demand balance and we're seeing positive momentum in the marketplace as a result. Demand is strengthening, led by content growth in both smartphones and servers. Spot pricing is showing improvement. System shipments into the foundry segment was a bright spot as margin -- as Martin mentioned, and increased to 36%, which was up from 27% in the June quarter. The system shipment dollars in foundry represented a record high level for Lam Research. Foundry spend was biased toward investments to execute 10-nanometer RAM and 7-nanometer pilot projects. We also saw continued spend predominantly in the China region at the 28-nanometer and above nodes. And finally, the logic and other segment came in at 8% of system shipments, up from 7% in the June quarter. Logic spending was largely in support of conversions to the 10-nanometer node. 
We set a new record for revenue in the September quarter. Revenue came in at $1,632,000,000, which was a sequential increase of 6% and a little bit above the midpoint of our guidance. Gross margin was a little lower than the midpoint of guidance at 45.2%. As I've previously stated, we expect to see some quarter-to-quarter variability in our gross margin due to factors like business volumes and mix. And I'll remind you, the financial model is the best reference to help you analyze our ongoing financial performance. And I look forward to sharing an update to the financial model with you at our Investor Day in November.
Our operating expenses for the quarter were $372 million, which was an increase of 3% from the $361 million in the June quarter, and it held steady at about 23% of revenue. OpEx spending allocated to R&D was again at benchmark levels of 63% of total spending in the quarter.
Operating income for the quarter was again strong at $366 million, an increase of 2% compared to the $359 million in the June quarter. Operating margin decreased slightly to 22.4%, down from 23.2% in the prior quarter, primarily due to the lower gross margins. The September quarter tax rate came in at approximately 12%, which was a little bit higher than the 10% rate last quarter, primarily due to changes in the level and mix of jurisdictional income. Our rate in the low to mid-teens for the December quarter would be a reasonable number figure to use in your modeling.
Earnings per share for the September quarter were $1.81 based on a share count of approximately 178 million shares. The share count includes dilution from both the 2018 and 2041 convertible notes and the remaining 2016 convertible note warrants, with a total dilutive impact of about 15 million shares on a non-GAAP basis. As the stock price continues to rise, the convertible notes will continue to add to the diluted share count, albeit at a decreasing rate of increase. Dilution schedules for the convertible notes are available on our Investor Relations website to help you with your modeling.
We returned $0.30 per share for a total of $48 million in dividend distributions to our shareholders in the quarter. There were no share repurchases during the quarter.
Let me now turn to the balance sheet. At the end of the September quarter, we had $7,470,000,000 in cash on the balance sheet. In line with the plans we stated during our call earlier this month, at this point, we have redeemed the $600 million 2023 senior notes and the $1 billion 2026 senior notes under the Special Mandatory Redemption provision of those notes. The $800 million 2021 senior notes will remain outstanding and will be used for general corporate purposes and other purposes, as can be found in the prospectus. If I pro forma for the cash we returned to bondholders in October, we would have finished the quarter with $5,830,000,000 on the balance sheet. Roughly 40% of this cash is currently domestically available. And I remind you, we continue to generate between 20% and 25% of cash domestically on an ongoing basis.
Cash generation continues to be healthy at the company. In the September quarter, we generated $473 million in cash from operations, which was an increase of 12% sequentially and an all-time quarterly high for the company. Days sales outstanding for the period improved to 72 days from 74 days, with the shipment profile slightly more linear than it was in June. Inventory turns improved from 3.5x to 3.9x. At the end of the September quarter, the deferred revenue balance was $704 million, a 27 -- or excuse me, a 24% increase quarter-over-quarter. That number excludes approximately $65 million from shipments to customers in Japan that will convert to revenue in future quarters. And I'll remind you that those Japan shipments remain as inventory carried at costs on the balance sheet.
Company noncash expenses during the quarter include the following: $39 million for equity compensation; $39 million for amortization; and $36 million for depreciation. Capital expenditures were $42 million, which was down from $52 million in the June quarter. We exited the quarter with approximately 7,800 regular full-time employees. We added headcount during the quarter primarily to meet customer needs for additional factory output and field support. Additionally, we added resources to continue our investment in product development.
Let me now turn to our outlook for the December quarter. I'd like to provide the following non-GAAP guidance. We expect shipments of $1,850,000,000, plus or minus $75 million. We expect revenue of $1,840,000,000, again, plus or minus $75 million. We expect gross margin of 46%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. We're forecasting operating margins of 25%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. And finally, we forecast earnings per share of $2.18, plus or minus $0.10, based on a share count of approximately 179 million shares. This earnings per share number excludes roughly $37 million associated with the interest expense, one-time fees and accelerated costs associated with the retirement of the 2023 and 2026 notes as well as the term loan commitments.
With our year-to-date results and the strong guidance I just provided for the December quarter, we anticipate that calendar year 2016 will be another record year of financial outperformance for the company, a fifth consecutive year of growth outpacing that of the industry as a whole.
Before transitioning to the Q&A session, I wanted to pick up on Martin's earlier comment regarding our Investor Day, which is now on November 18. We've decided to host the event in New York to make the event more convenient for a larger group of investors and analysts that are following the company. We look forward to seeing you in New York on the 18th.
That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, Martin and I would now like to open up the call for questions."

Some part of that is a commentary on the product portfolio of the company as we invest and make available more products to our customers and some part of it is the technology inflection in patterning and 3D NAND, which has a natural bias to the etch and deposition segments of WFE."

And I think, demonstrated performance and cost benefits kind of showing up there. It's 1 of 4 technology inflections that we identified 3 or 4 years ago now that are relevant to the future of our company. It was then and still is the smaller of the 4, but as time passes, the through-silicon via etch position strength that we have becomes more valuable. And obviously, the presence of the company in interconnect, copper position is also very strong. So over time, I would expect these advanced packaging SAMs to be more relevant.

And if I were to place a bet, I would say we'd probably end next year at or about the same in terms of wafer starts that we began the year. But as you know, this has been a year of significantly reduced spending. Our estimate is the DRAM investments is down 40% this year. By the end of this year, we believe that approximately 50% of the installed base is 20-nanometer capable. So there's a pretty significant opportunity for value creation for the customers in terms of cost reduction and performance from continued conversion. And as is also true, the 1x world for DRAM is just beginning in calendar '16, and we think will be kind of the primary change to the installed base in calendar '17. And if I would guess, I would guess that at the end of next year, about half of the installed base in DRAM is 20-nanometer, maybe 1/4 of the installed base is 1x, and 1/4 of the installed base is 25 or above. So I think that approximate segmentation of the 1 million or 1.1 million wafer starts, depending on how you calculate it, is kind of what we're looking at right now."

In terms of targeted profitability levels, which includes gross margin and the investments and operating expenses, and as we said many times, our focus more is on OpEx and gross margin, our long-term model said we were targeting 22 percentage points operating income and the sum of the results and guidance we've just given are 23%. The long-term model, I also said, there was a range of EPS target between $6 and $6.75 on by the way, a lower share count because when we put the model out, we weren't signaling to you that we would be in essentially a blackout period for 12 months because of the KLA transaction. But again, that $6 to $6.75 EPS reference, the sum of our results and guidance today are about $7. So I kind of would like it in context if I may ask for that, I think, the company's performance financially is really nicely balancing growth and profitability. And the trick here is balance. It is super easy to drive profitability up and not grow. It is really hard to architect a vision and then perform consistent with delivering profitable growth. That's our vision.

Anticipating our upcoming Investor and Analyst Meeting planned for New York on November 18, I will keep my prepared comments shorter than usual. The focus today will include financial, operational and market highlights for the September quarter and calendar year 2016, an update on recent changes in the industry environments and initial perspectives we have on calendar '17. Doug will then provide details of our financials and summarize guidance for the December quarter before we open the call for questions.
Demonstrating the constancy of our focus, quality of alignment in the company and commitments to invest in the future of the company for these last several years, Lam delivers another outstanding quarter, reporting record shipments, including a record high foundry shipments, record total company revenues and non-GAAP net income. As is always the case, how you do something is at least as important as what you do, more so in the context of our multi-year growth and value aspirations. Accordingly, we have a permanent focus on customer-oriented core values and culture and an extraordinary commitment to operational execution and company scaling.
Our supply chain, our factories, our field service organizations, once again, delivered terrific performance. We achieved a new record for shipments in the quarter. We are on track to deliver our customers a combination of schedule flexibility and on-time performance for the year that is a significant enhancements of capabilities. And as shown by our guidance today, we are gearing up for an additional growth in December.
Our differentiated product pipeline momentum continues at pace, most recently with metal ALD in 3D NAND and atomic-level etch in dielectric foundry applications. In addition, our business teams are achieving more than 90% success in critical defenses and new market application penetrations combined, which is extremely rewarding. This is an exciting time to be part of the semiconductor ecosystem, no doubt. In the world of foundry/logic, the demonstrated performance benefits of 10-nanometer technology and commitments of our customers and reportedly more than 20 of their customers to the near-term 7-nanometer roadmap are strong endorsements of the diversity of cloud mobility and high-performance computing-enabled consumer and enterprise applications.
What is clear in this segment also is the importance of 3D architecture at both the chip and systems integration level. Innovation in our technology and product roadmap for the transistor, interconnect and also advanced packaging applications is a critical priority for systematically strengthening our strategic relevance. We believe Lam is one of very few companies gaining share through these rounds of foundry/logic technology node transitions. Our segment exposure continues to be more balanced and objective and results we are particularly pleased with.
Worthy of note, in a world where we estimate foundry wafer fabrication equipment spending grows 25% year-over-year 2016 compared to 2015, we are communicating to you today with our presented results and December guidance, a view that our founding shipments for the year increased by approximately 40%.
Illustratively, 48 layer 3D NAND is enabling the 256 gigabyte high density storage that is required to power high-resolution image capture in dual cameras in smartphone devices. Similarly, in the data center, 3D NAND-based SSDs allow for hundreds of terabytes of high-speed storage to be located within the server itself, enabling cost-efficient scale from cloud-based services. 
Looking ahead, the roadmap is well-defined and looks very promising for 3D NAND. At the recent Flash Memory Summit in Santa Clara, our customers highlighted the numerous design and integration options not previously available with planar technology such as scaling layer counts. And the ability to transition from 3-level cells to quad-level cells and leveraging pitch and density scaling to target different storage end markets.
Lam was privileged to be the only major semiconductor equipment maker invited to present to the conference. Independent recognition of our critical role in the 3D NAND deflection and the commentary both on the opportunity and responsibility for Lam that is shared with our customers. Long-term WFE growth is only made possible with end market demand catalysts and process technology inflections.
Combined with these 2 drivers, our roadmap and multi-year execution make possible the fifth consecutive year in 2016 where our SAM has outperformed WFE. Looking forward, we have targets and strategies that we will specifically discuss in November to enable and participate in these outperformance trends for many years to come. Our ability to capitalize on this extraordinary opportunity is all about leadership, execution, and is measured ultimately by customer trust and competitive differentiation. 
As illustrations, in conductor etch, our Kiyo family with its Hydra multi-zone temperature control technology provides the most technically advanced production-proven etching performance critical for logic and DRAM multi-patterning in the industry. Lam has the broadest and strongest conductor etch position, especially in 3D NAND where Kiyo has now been qualified for 4 production at all NAND customers for a majority of applications, which we believe achieved position in more than 2/3 of the available market.
In dielectric etch, we continue to make several technology and productivity enhancements to our Flex family, including most recently, the release of atomic-level etch capability. Our ALE innovation features a proprietary Advanced Mixed Mode Pulsing capability, delivers a 2x improvement in selectivity versus conventional etching while providing atomic-level control over variability, critical to address issues like RC delay for advanced foundry and logic process nodes. The Flex series products are seeing substantial momentum in 3D NAND and are now qualified as production tool of record for critical high aspect ratio applications at all major customers.
In deposition, our ALTUS tungsten fill and VECTOR dielectric deposition systems are seeing very few momentum that is set to continue into next year. 2017 will be the year of 64-layer 3D NANDs. And Lam's product innovations and application share momentum position us well to improve our market share as we head into next year.
Complementing our leading-edge and critical application strength, the performance of more than 40,000 Lam process modules installed provides a strong platform for overall business momentum and is a key focus of our customer support business group. This business is on track for another record year. More important than reported growth in any 1 year, however, is the increased confidence of sustaining long-term profitable growth trajectory of the company. In the last several years, we have fundamentally improved our capability to support our customers through local manufacturing and warehousing, innovative technology and productivity upgrade solutions, refurbished equipment sales and service and product solutions to overall fab productivity improvements. These investments are paying dividends. Again, more to follow at our investor event.
Now let me provide a short overview of customer equipment spending trends for calendar 2016 and our preliminary expectations for 2017. Outlook for global economic growth and unit shipments for PCs and smartphones have remained stable since our last report. Increasingly more important than unit demand for traditional consumer computing devices, however, is the significant growth in content for leading-edge memory and logic devices in smartphones and servers. This dynamic is being driven by the high end -- by the end market demand inflections I spoke of earlier, and is powering our SAM growth outperformance opportunity. WFE spending for 2016 is now tracking slightly above the high end of our previously communicated range, driven by stronger foundry and 3D NAND CapEx investments. Sequentially, for calendar '16, NAND WFE is now on track to grow over 40%, foundry over 20%, and expectations for DRAM CapEx remain unchanged at down approximately 40% year-over-year.
Momentum and commitments continues to build for 3D NAND where we now expect total industry shipped capacity to reach approximately 425,000 wafer starts per month by the end of this calendar year. We are confident of sustainable, positive, long-term trends in this segment.
At the same time, our strength in foundry logic continues to build where we are realizing the benefits of multiyear efforts through customer spending associated with additional qualifications and PTOR wins for 10 and 7-nanometer devices. Despite the challenges of DRAM and certain pockets of logic spending in 2016, despite also the memory versus logic segment headwinds for the company relative to our peers this year, we are on track to grow several shipments meaningfully for the fifth straight calendar year at a CAGR of approximately 18% over that extended period. 
As we look into 2017, we are encouraged by the strong momentum in 3D NAND. For numerous reasons, we are also more convinced and convicted in our belief that DRAM supply and DRAM -- sorry, DRAM supply and demand conditions will continue to improve, as we previously indicated. As a result, we have an upward bias to spending expectations for DRAM and NAND in 2017.
We expect flat to a modest pullback in logic foundry spending as customers digest the 10-nanometer investments made in 2016 and commence initial 7-nanometer roadmaps. Overall, we are modeling slightly higher total WFE spend in 2017, with memory versus logic segments tailwinds for the company once more. Again, our objective will be to outgrow WFE in 2017.
To summarize, fundamental to our strong performance has been our strategy to partner closely with our customers to help address their most tough and difficult challenges. Despite, as we conveyed a couple of weeks ago, the disappointments at not being able to deliver to our customers the potential of unmatched capability and innovation from Lam and KLA-Tencor combined, we're very excited by the demonstrated multi-year strength and inflection-driven outperformance future opportunity for Lam Research. With continued execution, a robust product pipeline, overall stronger installed base and market share positions and increased strategic relevance to our customers, we believe the innovation to support long-term value creation for all stakeholders is a valid ambition for Lam Research.
Before turning the call over for additional details on our financial performance and outlook, I would like to extend my genuine thanks to our customers and employees who together make the exciting story of Lam Research possible, their support and encouragement inspires us each day to achieve our full potential. Doug?"

The September quarter results reflect another quarter of solid execution and record results. In the quarter, shipments, revenue, net income and cash from operations were at the highest level we delivered in the history of Lam Research. We're obviously very pleased with what we achieved this quarter.
Shipments in the September quarter were $1,708,000,000, up approximately 8% compared to the June quarter, and at a record level for the company. The combined memory segment made up 56% of system shipments, and that was down from 66% in the prior quarter. Nonvolatile memory shipments contributed 43% of the system shipments and this was down from 51% in the June quarter. 3D NAND investments are continuing at a healthy level with customers committed to their plans for scaling the technology to reduce costs, enhanced performance and increased output in response to strong customer demand. Our deposition net products are critical to enabling the scaling for our customers. We're extremely well-positioned with the PTOR decision made by our customers in what may be the largest multi-year growth opportunity in semiconductors.
Customer discipline remains intact in the DRAM segment, with shipments making up 13% of total system shipments compared to 15% in the prior quarter. There appears to be a stabilization of the supply/demand balance and we're seeing positive momentum in the marketplace as a result. Demand is strengthening, led by content growth in both smartphones and servers. Spot pricing is showing improvement. System shipments into the foundry segment was a bright spot as margin -- as Martin mentioned, and increased to 36%, which was up from 27% in the June quarter. The system shipment dollars in foundry represented a record high level for Lam Research. Foundry spend was biased toward investments to execute 10-nanometer RAM and 7-nanometer pilot projects. We also saw continued spend predominantly in the China region at the 28-nanometer and above nodes. And finally, the logic and other segment came in at 8% of system shipments, up from 7% in the June quarter. Logic spending was largely in support of conversions to the 10-nanometer node. 
We set a new record for revenue in the September quarter. Revenue came in at $1,632,000,000, which was a sequential increase of 6% and a little bit above the midpoint of our guidance. Gross margin was a little lower than the midpoint of guidance at 45.2%. As I've previously stated, we expect to see some quarter-to-quarter variability in our gross margin due to factors like business volumes and mix. And I'll remind you, the financial model is the best reference to help you analyze our ongoing financial performance. And I look forward to sharing an update to the financial model with you at our Investor Day in November.
Our operating expenses for the quarter were $372 million, which was an increase of 3% from the $361 million in the June quarter, and it held steady at about 23% of revenue. OpEx spending allocated to R&D was again at benchmark levels of 63% of total spending in the quarter.
Operating income for the quarter was again strong at $366 million, an increase of 2% compared to the $359 million in the June quarter. Operating margin decreased slightly to 22.4%, down from 23.2% in the prior quarter, primarily due to the lower gross margins. The September quarter tax rate came in at approximately 12%, which was a little bit higher than the 10% rate last quarter, primarily due to changes in the level and mix of jurisdictional income. Our rate in the low to mid-teens for the December quarter would be a reasonable number figure to use in your modeling.
Earnings per share for the September quarter were $1.81 based on a share count of approximately 178 million shares. The share count includes dilution from both the 2018 and 2041 convertible notes and the remaining 2016 convertible note warrants, with a total dilutive impact of about 15 million shares on a non-GAAP basis. As the stock price continues to rise, the convertible notes will continue to add to the diluted share count, albeit at a decreasing rate of increase. Dilution schedules for the convertible notes are available on our Investor Relations website to help you with your modeling.
We returned $0.30 per share for a total of $48 million in dividend distributions to our shareholders in the quarter. There were no share repurchases during the quarter.
Let me now turn to the balance sheet. At the end of the September quarter, we had $7,470,000,000 in cash on the balance sheet. In line with the plans we stated during our call earlier this month, at this point, we have redeemed the $600 million 2023 senior notes and the $1 billion 2026 senior notes under the Special Mandatory Redemption provision of those notes. The $800 million 2021 senior notes will remain outstanding and will be used for general corporate purposes and other purposes, as can be found in the prospectus. If I pro forma for the cash we returned to bondholders in October, we would have finished the quarter with $5,830,000,000 on the balance sheet. Roughly 40% of this cash is currently domestically available. And I remind you, we continue to generate between 20% and 25% of cash domestically on an ongoing basis.
Cash generation continues to be healthy at the company. In the September quarter, we generated $473 million in cash from operations, which was an increase of 12% sequentially and an all-time quarterly high for the company. Days sales outstanding for the period improved to 72 days from 74 days, with the shipment profile slightly more linear than it was in June. Inventory turns improved from 3.5x to 3.9x. At the end of the September quarter, the deferred revenue balance was $704 million, a 27 -- or excuse me, a 24% increase quarter-over-quarter. That number excludes approximately $65 million from shipments to customers in Japan that will convert to revenue in future quarters. And I'll remind you that those Japan shipments remain as inventory carried at costs on the balance sheet.
Company noncash expenses during the quarter include the following: $39 million for equity compensation; $39 million for amortization; and $36 million for depreciation. Capital expenditures were $42 million, which was down from $52 million in the June quarter. We exited the quarter with approximately 7,800 regular full-time employees. We added headcount during the quarter primarily to meet customer needs for additional factory output and field support. Additionally, we added resources to continue our investment in product development.
Let me now turn to our outlook for the December quarter. I'd like to provide the following non-GAAP guidance. We expect shipments of $1,850,000,000, plus or minus $75 million. We expect revenue of $1,840,000,000, again, plus or minus $75 million. We expect gross margin of 46%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. We're forecasting operating margins of 25%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. And finally, we forecast earnings per share of $2.18, plus or minus $0.10, based on a share count of approximately 179 million shares. This earnings per share number excludes roughly $37 million associated with the interest expense, one-time fees and accelerated costs associated with the retirement of the 2023 and 2026 notes as well as the term loan commitments.
With our year-to-date results and the strong guidance I just provided for the December quarter, we anticipate that calendar year 2016 will be another record year of financial outperformance for the company, a fifth consecutive year of growth outpacing that of the industry as a whole.
Before transitioning to the Q&A session, I wanted to pick up on Martin's earlier comment regarding our Investor Day, which is now on November 18. We've decided to host the event in New York to make the event more convenient for a larger group of investors and analysts that are following the company. We look forward to seeing you in New York on the 18th.
That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, Martin and I would now like to open up the call for questions."

We've got the long-term market share growth, the 3 to 5 percentage point references we've talked about many times. 1 to 2 percentage points through technology nodes. And there's also a commentary on SAM expansion. And the headline for the company, if you go back to a 2012 reference point, is we had a portfolio of products that was competing for about 25% or so of wafer fabrication equipment spending. That's in the 33, 34 percentage range probably this year, and we expect in excess of 35% to be the competitive reference point for us, the proportion of WFE that we're competing for with our portfolio next year.

Really, on cash, it seems like there's maybe $1 billion worth of excess onshore cash today. And if I look at your free cash flow, you're going to probably generate $1.5 billion roughly a year, and that would imply maybe another $350 million to $400 million of onshore coming per year and only half of that is being consumed by your dividend.

The sum of our quarter results and guidance were at $6.3 billion. So at a revenue level, as the commentary on SAM and share, we're performing higher than we indicated in our long-term financial model. In terms of targeted profitability levels, which includes gross margin and the investments in operating expenses, and as we said many times, our focus more is on OpInc than gross margin, our long-term model said we were targeting 22 percentage points operating income and the sum of the results and guidance we've just given are 23%. The long-term model, I also said, there was a range of EPS target between $6 and $6.75 on by the way, a lower share count because when we put the model out, we weren't signaling to you that we would be in essentially a blackout period for 12 months because of the KLA transaction. But again, that $6 to $6.75 EPS reference, the sum of our results and guidance today are about $7. So I kind of would like it in context if I may ask for that, I think, the company's performance financially is really nicely balancing growth and profitability. And the trick here is balance. It is super easy to drive profitability up and not grow. It is really hard to architect a vision and then perform consistent with delivering profitable growth. That's our vision. And that is what we believe we're executing and delivering. And of course, if you're a member of Lam Research, long that may continue."

Anticipating our upcoming Investor and Analyst Meeting planned for New York on November 18, I will keep my prepared comments shorter than usual. The focus today will include financial, operational and market highlights for the September quarter and calendar year 2016, an update on recent changes in the industry environments and initial perspectives we have on calendar '17. Doug will then provide details of our financials and summarize guidance for the December quarter before we open the call for questions.
Demonstrating the constancy of our focus, quality of alignment in the company and commitments to invest in the future of the company for these last several years, Lam delivers another outstanding quarter, reporting record shipments, including a record high foundry shipments, record total company revenues and non-GAAP net income. As is always the case, how you do something is at least as important as what you do, more so in the context of our multi-year growth and value aspirations. Accordingly, we have a permanent focus on customer-oriented core values and culture and an extraordinary commitment to operational execution and company scaling.
Our supply chain, our factories, our field service organizations, once again, delivered terrific performance. We achieved a new record for shipments in the quarter. We are on track to deliver our customers a combination of schedule flexibility and on-time performance for the year that is a significant enhancements of capabilities. And as shown by our guidance today, we are gearing up for an additional growth in December.
Our differentiated product pipeline momentum continues at pace, most recently with metal ALD in 3D NAND and atomic-level etch in dielectric foundry applications. In addition, our business teams are achieving more than 90% success in critical defenses and new market application penetrations combined, which is extremely rewarding. This is an exciting time to be part of the semiconductor ecosystem, no doubt. In the world of foundry/logic, the demonstrated performance benefits of 10-nanometer technology and commitments of our customers and reportedly more than 20 of their customers to the near-term 7-nanometer roadmap are strong endorsements of the diversity of cloud mobility and high-performance computing-enabled consumer and enterprise applications.
What is clear in this segment also is the importance of 3D architecture at both the chip and systems integration level. Innovation in our technology and product roadmap for the transistor, interconnect and also advanced packaging applications is a critical priority for systematically strengthening our strategic relevance. We believe Lam is one of very few companies gaining share through these rounds of foundry/logic technology node transitions. Our segment exposure continues to be more balanced and objective and results we are particularly pleased with.
Worthy of note, in a world where we estimate foundry wafer fabrication equipment spending grows 25% year-over-year 2016 compared to 2015, we are communicating to you today with our presented results and December guidance, a view that our founding shipments for the year increased by approximately 40%.
Illustratively, 48 layer 3D NAND is enabling the 256 gigabyte high density storage that is required to power high-resolution image capture in dual cameras in smartphone devices. Similarly, in the data center, 3D NAND-based SSDs allow for hundreds of terabytes of high-speed storage to be located within the server itself, enabling cost-efficient scale from cloud-based services. 
Looking ahead, the roadmap is well-defined and looks very promising for 3D NAND. At the recent Flash Memory Summit in Santa Clara, our customers highlighted the numerous design and integration options not previously available with planar technology such as scaling layer counts. And the ability to transition from 3-level cells to quad-level cells and leveraging pitch and density scaling to target different storage end markets.
Lam was privileged to be the only major semiconductor equipment maker invited to present to the conference. Independent recognition of our critical role in the 3D NAND deflection and the commentary both on the opportunity and responsibility for Lam that is shared with our customers. Long-term WFE growth is only made possible with end market demand catalysts and process technology inflections.
Combined with these 2 drivers, our roadmap and multi-year execution make possible the fifth consecutive year in 2016 where our SAM has outperformed WFE. Looking forward, we have targets and strategies that we will specifically discuss in November to enable and participate in these outperformance trends for many years to come. Our ability to capitalize on this extraordinary opportunity is all about leadership, execution, and is measured ultimately by customer trust and competitive differentiation. 
As illustrations, in conductor etch, our Kiyo family with its Hydra multi-zone temperature control technology provides the most technically advanced production-proven etching performance critical for logic and DRAM multi-patterning in the industry. Lam has the broadest and strongest conductor etch position, especially in 3D NAND where Kiyo has now been qualified for 4 production at all NAND customers for a majority of applications, which we believe achieved position in more than 2/3 of the available market.
In dielectric etch, we continue to make several technology and productivity enhancements to our Flex family, including most recently, the release of atomic-level etch capability. Our ALE innovation features a proprietary Advanced Mixed Mode Pulsing capability, delivers a 2x improvement in selectivity versus conventional etching while providing atomic-level control over variability, critical to address issues like RC delay for advanced foundry and logic process nodes. The Flex series products are seeing substantial momentum in 3D NAND and are now qualified as production tool of record for critical high aspect ratio applications at all major customers.
In deposition, our ALTUS tungsten fill and VECTOR dielectric deposition systems are seeing very few momentum that is set to continue into next year. 2017 will be the year of 64-layer 3D NANDs. And Lam's product innovations and application share momentum position us well to improve our market share as we head into next year.
Complementing our leading-edge and critical application strength, the performance of more than 40,000 Lam process modules installed provides a strong platform for overall business momentum and is a key focus of our customer support business group. This business is on track for another record year. More important than reported growth in any 1 year, however, is the increased confidence of sustaining long-term profitable growth trajectory of the company. In the last several years, we have fundamentally improved our capability to support our customers through local manufacturing and warehousing, innovative technology and productivity upgrade solutions, refurbished equipment sales and service and product solutions to overall fab productivity improvements. These investments are paying dividends. Again, more to follow at our investor event.
Now let me provide a short overview of customer equipment spending trends for calendar 2016 and our preliminary expectations for 2017. Outlook for global economic growth and unit shipments for PCs and smartphones have remained stable since our last report. Increasingly more important than unit demand for traditional consumer computing devices, however, is the significant growth in content for leading-edge memory and logic devices in smartphones and servers. This dynamic is being driven by the high end -- by the end market demand inflections I spoke of earlier, and is powering our SAM growth outperformance opportunity. WFE spending for 2016 is now tracking slightly above the high end of our previously communicated range, driven by stronger foundry and 3D NAND CapEx investments. Sequentially, for calendar '16, NAND WFE is now on track to grow over 40%, foundry over 20%, and expectations for DRAM CapEx remain unchanged at down approximately 40% year-over-year.
Momentum and commitments continues to build for 3D NAND where we now expect total industry shipped capacity to reach approximately 425,000 wafer starts per month by the end of this calendar year. We are confident of sustainable, positive, long-term trends in this segment.
At the same time, our strength in foundry logic continues to build where we are realizing the benefits of multiyear efforts through customer spending associated with additional qualifications and PTOR wins for 10 and 7-nanometer devices. Despite the challenges of DRAM and certain pockets of logic spending in 2016, despite also the memory versus logic segment headwinds for the company relative to our peers this year, we are on track to grow several shipments meaningfully for the fifth straight calendar year at a CAGR of approximately 18% over that extended period. 
As we look into 2017, we are encouraged by the strong momentum in 3D NAND. For numerous reasons, we are also more convinced and convicted in our belief that DRAM supply and DRAM -- sorry, DRAM supply and demand conditions will continue to improve, as we previously indicated. As a result, we have an upward bias to spending expectations for DRAM and NAND in 2017.
We expect flat to a modest pullback in logic foundry spending as customers digest the 10-nanometer investments made in 2016 and commence initial 7-nanometer roadmaps. Overall, we are modeling slightly higher total WFE spend in 2017, with memory versus logic segments tailwinds for the company once more. Again, our objective will be to outgrow WFE in 2017.
To summarize, fundamental to our strong performance has been our strategy to partner closely with our customers to help address their most tough and difficult challenges. Despite, as we conveyed a couple of weeks ago, the disappointments at not being able to deliver to our customers the potential of unmatched capability and innovation from Lam and KLA-Tencor combined, we're very excited by the demonstrated multi-year strength and inflection-driven outperformance future opportunity for Lam Research. With continued execution, a robust product pipeline, overall stronger installed base and market share positions and increased strategic relevance to our customers, we believe the innovation to support long-term value creation for all stakeholders is a valid ambition for Lam Research.
Before turning the call over for additional details on our financial performance and outlook, I would like to extend my genuine thanks to our customers and employees who together make the exciting story of Lam Research possible, their support and encouragement inspires us each day to achieve our full potential.

The September quarter results reflect another quarter of solid execution and record results. In the quarter, shipments, revenue, net income and cash from operations were at the highest level we delivered in the history of Lam Research. We're obviously very pleased with what we achieved this quarter.
Shipments in the September quarter were $1,708,000,000, up approximately 8% compared to the June quarter, and at a record level for the company. The combined memory segment made up 56% of system shipments, and that was down from 66% in the prior quarter. Nonvolatile memory shipments contributed 43% of the system shipments and this was down from 51% in the June quarter. 3D NAND investments are continuing at a healthy level with customers committed to their plans for scaling the technology to reduce costs, enhanced performance and increased output in response to strong customer demand. Our deposition net products are critical to enabling the scaling for our customers. We're extremely well-positioned with the PTOR decision made by our customers in what may be the largest multi-year growth opportunity in semiconductors.
Customer discipline remains intact in the DRAM segment, with shipments making up 13% of total system shipments compared to 15% in the prior quarter. There appears to be a stabilization of the supply/demand balance and we're seeing positive momentum in the marketplace as a result. Demand is strengthening, led by content growth in both smartphones and servers. Spot pricing is showing improvement. System shipments into the foundry segment was a bright spot as margin -- as Martin mentioned, and increased to 36%, which was up from 27% in the June quarter. The system shipment dollars in foundry represented a record high level for Lam Research. Foundry spend was biased toward investments to execute 10-nanometer RAM and 7-nanometer pilot projects. We also saw continued spend predominantly in the China region at the 28-nanometer and above nodes. And finally, the logic and other segment came in at 8% of system shipments, up from 7% in the June quarter. Logic spending was largely in support of conversions to the 10-nanometer node. 
We set a new record for revenue in the September quarter. Revenue came in at $1,632,000,000, which was a sequential increase of 6% and a little bit above the midpoint of our guidance. Gross margin was a little lower than the midpoint of guidance at 45.2%. As I've previously stated, we expect to see some quarter-to-quarter variability in our gross margin due to factors like business volumes and mix. And I'll remind you, the financial model is the best reference to help you analyze our ongoing financial performance. And I look forward to sharing an update to the financial model with you at our Investor Day in November.
Our operating expenses for the quarter were $372 million, which was an increase of 3% from the $361 million in the June quarter, and it held steady at about 23% of revenue. OpEx spending allocated to R&D was again at benchmark levels of 63% of total spending in the quarter.
Operating income for the quarter was again strong at $366 million, an increase of 2% compared to the $359 million in the June quarter. Operating margin decreased slightly to 22.4%, down from 23.2% in the prior quarter, primarily due to the lower gross margins. The September quarter tax rate came in at approximately 12%, which was a little bit higher than the 10% rate last quarter, primarily due to changes in the level and mix of jurisdictional income. Our rate in the low to mid-teens for the December quarter would be a reasonable number figure to use in your modeling.
Earnings per share for the September quarter were $1.81 based on a share count of approximately 178 million shares. The share count includes dilution from both the 2018 and 2041 convertible notes and the remaining 2016 convertible note warrants, with a total dilutive impact of about 15 million shares on a non-GAAP basis. As the stock price continues to rise, the convertible notes will continue to add to the diluted share count, albeit at a decreasing rate of increase. Dilution schedules for the convertible notes are available on our Investor Relations website to help you with your modeling.
We returned $0.30 per share for a total of $48 million in dividend distributions to our shareholders in the quarter. There were no share repurchases during the quarter.
Let me now turn to the balance sheet. At the end of the September quarter, we had $7,470,000,000 in cash on the balance sheet. In line with the plans we stated during our call earlier this month, at this point, we have redeemed the $600 million 2023 senior notes and the $1 billion 2026 senior notes under the Special Mandatory Redemption provision of those notes. The $800 million 2021 senior notes will remain outstanding and will be used for general corporate purposes and other purposes, as can be found in the prospectus. If I pro forma for the cash we returned to bondholders in October, we would have finished the quarter with $5,830,000,000 on the balance sheet. Roughly 40% of this cash is currently domestically available. And I remind you, we continue to generate between 20% and 25% of cash domestically on an ongoing basis.
Cash generation continues to be healthy at the company. In the September quarter, we generated $473 million in cash from operations, which was an increase of 12% sequentially and an all-time quarterly high for the company. Days sales outstanding for the period improved to 72 days from 74 days, with the shipment profile slightly more linear than it was in June. Inventory turns improved from 3.5x to 3.9x. At the end of the September quarter, the deferred revenue balance was $704 million, a 27 -- or excuse me, a 24% increase quarter-over-quarter. That number excludes approximately $65 million from shipments to customers in Japan that will convert to revenue in future quarters. And I'll remind you that those Japan shipments remain as inventory carried at costs on the balance sheet.
Company noncash expenses during the quarter include the following: $39 million for equity compensation; $39 million for amortization; and $36 million for depreciation. Capital expenditures were $42 million, which was down from $52 million in the June quarter. We exited the quarter with approximately 7,800 regular full-time employees. We added headcount during the quarter primarily to meet customer needs for additional factory output and field support. Additionally, we added resources to continue our investment in product development.
Let me now turn to our outlook for the December quarter. I'd like to provide the following non-GAAP guidance. We expect shipments of $1,850,000,000, plus or minus $75 million. We expect revenue of $1,840,000,000, again, plus or minus $75 million. We expect gross margin of 46%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. We're forecasting operating margins of 25%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. And finally, we forecast earnings per share of $2.18, plus or minus $0.10, based on a share count of approximately 179 million shares. This earnings per share number excludes roughly $37 million associated with the interest expense, one-time fees and accelerated costs associated with the retirement of the 2023 and 2026 notes as well as the term loan commitments.
With our year-to-date results and the strong guidance I just provided for the December quarter, we anticipate that calendar year 2016 will be another record year of financial outperformance for the company, a fifth consecutive year of growth outpacing that of the industry as a whole.
Before transitioning to the Q&A session, I wanted to pick up on Martin's earlier comment regarding our Investor Day, which is now on November 18. We've decided to host the event in New York to make the event more convenient for a larger group of investors and analysts that are following the company. We look forward to seeing you in New York on the 18th.
That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, Martin and I would now like to open up the call for questions."

We've got the long-term market share growth, the 3 to 5 percentage point references we've talked about many times. 1 to 2 percentage points through technology nodes. And there's also a commentary on SAM expansion. And the headline for the company, if you go back to a 2012 reference point, is we had a portfolio of products that was competing for about 25% or so of wafer fabrication equipment spending. That's in the 33, 34 percentage range probably this year, and we expect in excess of 35% to be the competitive reference point for us, the proportion of WFE that we're competing for with our portfolio next year. Some part of that is a commentary on the product portfolio of the company as we invest and make available more products to our customers and some part of it is the technology inflection in patterning and 3D NAND, which has a natural bias to the etch and deposition segments of WFE."

One of them is the proportion of WFE that we're competing for, which to my earlier answer, has kind of transitioned from the 25% level to the 35% level since 2012, so we're competing for $3 billion more business each year if you just want to pick a $30 billion WFE reference. We're competing for $3.5 billion if you want to pick a $35 billion reference. And some part of that is the product portfolio message for the company and some part of it is the technology inflections, the patterning and 3D NAND or 3D device architecture transitions for the industry. That's kind of message #1. And message #2 is share gain, and we've had some pretty significant messages on share gain. We talked to you on our last earnings call, if my memory serves me right, about double-digit share gain in the planar to 3D NAND transition. And we've talked today about a fairly unique story, we think, in the industry in the logic and foundry space, at least as best we can analyze, we're one of very few companies that has demonstrated share gain in logic/foundry combined in recent technology node transitions, and we're just beginning to see the evidence of that show up in our financial statements."

By the end of this year, we believe that approximately 50% of the installed base is 20-nanometer capable. So there's a pretty significant opportunity for value creation for the customers in terms of cost reduction and performance from continued conversion. And as is also true, the 1x world for DRAM is just beginning in calendar '16, and we think will be kind of the primary change to the installed base in calendar '17. And if I would guess, I would guess that at the end of next year, about half of the installed base in DRAM is 20-nanometer, maybe 1/4 of the installed base is 1x, and 1/4 of the installed base is 25 or above.

And obviously, I'll give you an update on that when we get to the 18th of November. I'm not going to apologize for a 30 basis point slight below midpoint on gross margin. It's really hard with all the moving parts and different customer mix, things you have going on. There's always going to be variability and we've been pretty consistently in that 45 to mid-46 gross margin range and that's kind of where the business runs and it runs pretty effectively."

The sum of our quarter results and guidance were at $6.3 billion. So at a revenue level, as the commentary on SAM and share, we're performing higher than we indicated in our long-term financial model. In terms of targeted profitability levels, which includes gross margin and the investments in operating expenses, and as we said many times, our focus more is on OpInc than gross margin, our long-term model said we were targeting 22 percentage points operating income and the sum of the results and guidance we've just given are 23%. The long-term model, I also said, there was a range of EPS target between $6 and $6.75 on by the way, a lower share count because when we put the model out, we weren't signaling to you that we would be in essentially a blackout period for 12 months because of the KLA transaction. But again, that $6 to $6.75 EPS reference, the sum of our results and guidance today are about $7. So I kind of would like it in context if I may ask for that, I think, the company's performance financially is really nicely balancing growth and profitability. And the trick here is balance. It is super easy to drive profitability up and not grow. It is really hard to architect a vision and then perform consistent with delivering profitable growth. That's our vision. And that is what we believe we're executing and delivering. And of course, if you're a member of Lam Research, long that may continue."
