National Oilwell Varco faced deteriorating market conditions during the fourth quarter to cap off a very challenging year. The company reported fourth quarter net income of $85 million or $0.23 per fully diluted share, excluding other it",2552,"Thank you, Loren. National Oilwell Varco faced deteriorating market conditions during the fourth quarter to cap off a very challenging year. The company reported fourth quarter net income of $85 million or $0.23 per fully diluted share, excluding other items down from $0.61 per fully diluted share in the third quarter of 2015 on a comparable basis. Other items included pretax charges of $1.6 billion and goodwill and intangible asset impairments, $139 million in restructuring inventory write-downs, severance and facilities closures and $7 million in FX losses in Argentina. GAAP net loss for the quarter was $1.5 billion, or $4.06 per fully diluted share. Fourth quarter 2015 revenues were $2.7 billion, down 18% from the third quarter of 2015. Operating profit for the quarter was $141 million or 5.2% of sales, and EBITDA was $308 million or 11.3% of sales, excluding other items from both. Decremental operating leverage was 35% from the third quarter to the fourth. 
Our management teams across our business units are responding quickly to lower revenues which fell further than we expected in the fourth quarter. By reducing costs and accelerating restructuring plans, which enabled us to hold decremental leverage to 35% x charges despite the sharp volume decline and renewed intense pricing pressure we are seeing. As we have stated for the past few quarters, our focus is to manage what we can, namely cost, while continuing to advance our longer term strategic goals. It, nevertheless, remains a very challenging time for everyone in the oil and gas industry, and our visibility remains limited. 
For its full year 2015, National Oilwell Varco posted a GAAP loss of $1.99 per fully diluted share, including restructuring, asset impairments, facility closure costs and other charges at $2 billion pretax. Excluding these items, earnings were $2.80 per fully diluted share, down 54% from $6.07 per fully diluted share earned in 2014. Operating profit was $1.6 billion or 11.1% of revenue and EBITDA was $2.3 billion or 15.5% of revenue for the full year excluding charges. Decremental operating leverage was 32% from 2014 to 2015, excluding charges from both years, a commendable result in view of the severe downturn and pricing pressures we faced throughout the year. Cash flow from operations for 2015 totaled $1.3 billion, with $614 million of that coming in the fourth quarter, with improving capital liquidation. We continue to invest in our future closing 7 acquisitions through the year, which, among other benefits, enhanced our presence in Saudi Arabia, our wellsite services offering in Asia and brought in new composites technology. We continue developing new products with our new test rig which we spudded at the beginning of the year. We also continue investments in the world's most promising regions adding new facilities in Saudi Arabia,  Abu Dabhi, Russia and West Texas. We returned $2.9 billion to shareholders in 2015 through dividends and share purchases. 
With regards to costs, we were able to manage to good decremental operating leverage on our 31% decline in revenues x charges by close attention to costs and efficiency. We insourced tens of thousands of hours from outside suppliers to our own workforce to preserve our team wherever possible. Nevertheless, our global workforce, including contract labor, declined 21% through the year and we closed 75 facilities since mid 2014 to retrench to a smaller, more efficient footprint. We expect restructuring will continue to the first half of 2016, perhaps longer in view of the challenging market. 
A second major decline in oil prices last year deepened and intensified late during the fourth quarter and continued throughout January while oil traded into the high $20 range, levels not seen since 2003. This combined with hedges rolling off for EMPs and term contracts expiring for drilling contractors, ratcheted up financial stress on our customers and increased pricing pressure on NOV. We believe the present level of activity is insufficient to supply the longer-term demand for oil, and note that unlike the 3 most recent downturns through the past 20 years, OPEC has not curtailed production to defend pricing. This has made the present downturn far more severe, but will perhaps lead to a sharper, eventual recovery. With producers pumping furiously to maximize their cash flow, the relentless margin depletion, the deferral of 68 projects representing 3 million barrels of oil per day of planned future production and the unfolding of severe capital austerity will help bring supply and demand into balance, but we are not planning for a recovery in 2016. Instead, we will continue to manage costs to the reality of the market place in the short term. Even with a rebound in oil prices, it will take time for our customers to repair balance sheets, reactivate crews and to ramp up the activity that drives our business. Each day that passes means we are a day closer to the inevitable rebound. Our plan is to emerge with new products, new business models and new efficiencies. 
Our Completion & Production Solutions segment fell 7% sequentially in the fourth quarter and posted 56% sequential decremental operating leverage, excluding restructuring and other items. Orders declined from 99% book-to-bill in the third quarter to 59% in the fourth, which led backlog down to $969 million at year-end. Strong sequential improvements in our XL Systems conductor pipe connections unit in the fourth quarter capped off a solid year for this unit, with higher year-over-year margins. Fully offset sequential double-digit declines in our other products within the segment. In North America, customers delayed picking up well stimulation equipment previously ordered, and some are now buying frac spreads at distressed pricing to use for spare parts, which further reduced sales but will ultimately help erode the equipment overhang. In North America, sales of spares and consumables like coiled tubing declined with reduced activity, but the FX unit in the Middle East remain comparably strong. Sales of composite oilfield pipe declined as the costs of competing steel flowlines have plummeted 35% or more. And our sales into the Marine construction markets slowed. Our value proposition for the composite pipe that we manufacture is much lower lifetime cost due to its corrosion resistance but EMPs under duress are opting for the lowest investment option to bring on wells and their associated cash flow.  About 20% of the segment's mix is in production equipment. Pumps, separators and artificial lift, which also fell in the quarter as distributors slowed purchases. We have 6 major facility consolidations underway within this business unit, which will drive better efficiency going forward. 
Within our offshore production-related businesses, we saw rising pricing pressure on flexible pipe, but we're pleased to post 111% book-to-bill as we landed some significant orders for pre-salt applications in Brazil. Our floating production vessel unit continues to pioneer new business models we launched a few years ago that leverage NOV's unique vessel construction capabilities to improve construction costs and reduce risk. Our new vessel concepts, which seek to accelerate production from certain types of deepwater fields, are being met with high enthusiasm from our customers so far. We are encouraged by new designs that are steadily whittling costs, but operators remains slow to sanction major Deepwater projects. It is nevertheless, a promising target with 400 discoveries in the offshore. 
Our Wellbore Technologies segment revenues fell 9% sequentially in the fourth quarter and posted 69% sequential decremental operating leverage, which resulted in a negative 4.1% operating margin, excluding restructuring and other items. EBITDA margins were 9% for the segment x other items.  2/3 of the sequential decline in revenue came from North America where operators stacked major drilling programs, intensifying pricing pressures and reducing volumes. Rentals of solids control equipment, rig instrumentation and downhole equipment declined at high variable margins. Nevertheless, we were able to increase share in our bits business owing to new tectonic designs, which we are successfully packaging with our ERT drilling motors. In the FSU, we expect to begin production in our downhole tools facility at our new customer plant within a few weeks to supply the local market, which, along with Asia, posted higher sequential revenues in the fourth quarter. Latin America saw a significant decline for the segment across Brazil, Mexico and Argentina. 
Our Tuboscope pipe coating business held up well for the quarter on drill pipe strength in China but pipe mill inspection activity in North America declined, with 9 months of pacing on the ground, the highest level of inventory seen since the 1980s. Rising activity around tubing, pipeline and line pipe helped offset this somewhat, but we are even seeing workover activity fall in West Texas, which is unusual. Prior downturns have seen workover activity hold up better owing to quick paybacks. Drill pipe sales increased modestly from the third quarter into the fourth quarter, but still remain low and under price pressure. Growing operator interest in close loop automated drilling technology drove higher revenues for IntelliServ wire drill pipe unit in the fourth quarter to produce solid year-over-year improvements for the group. This innovative service grew sixfold in 2015 as compared to 2014, and we have lots of interest from EMPs, as well as drilling contractors eager to differentiate their rigs by enabling high-speed data transmission from the bottom of the hole through their drill pipe. 
Our Rig Aftermarket segment posted flat sequential revenues, but margins fell due to mix. A decline is spare parts sales was offset by higher repair revenues, which came in at lower margins partly due to rising discounts to win repair work. As rigs come down, particularly onshore, they are being cannibalized for parts, impacting our spares business for the quarter. 
SPS activity on offshore rigs rolled over in the fourth quarter, but remains active nonetheless. The Rig Aftermarket segment is actively working on about 40 projects either underway or on the bidding stage, but these are fluid as drilling contractors are curtailing scope or, in some instances, electing not to proceed with an SPS without a clear line of sight on a contract for the rig. Service and repair work in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico improved sequentially for rig aftermarket and BOP repair work in the Middle East remains strong. Rig Systems revenues fell 32% at 24% decrementals in the fourth quarter, driven by sharply lower shipments at a backlog. Customers are delaying acceptance of uncontracted new-builds to avoid stacking cost and to slow their CapEx as they face falling day rates and utilization as their contracts roll-off. Revenues from new offshore rig construction fell to about 20% of our consolidated revenue mix in the fourth quarter. We are working closely with our shipyard customers to navigate challenges and requests for delays and to improve our collections, but these situations remain fluid. At this point we expect revenues out of backlog for all of 2016 to total about $2.1 billion or $2.2 billion. Rig Systems saw a 76% decline in new orders in the fourth quarter which fell to $89 million and totaled $1 billion for the full year. Coating activity plummeted late in the year and while we still see interest for new land rigs for the Middle East and some other selected markets, we expect orders to again be very low for the first quarter. Importantly, we expect the land rig market to eventually resume its efforts to retool to more efficient AC technology, but the fourth quarter downturn and day rates for Tier 1 rigs will certainly delay that trend. 
As we disclosed in December, we reached a confidential settlement with one of our shipyard customers in Brazil to cancel 7 floating rigs being constructed there, which reduced our backlog by nearly $1.2 billion and led to a year end backlog of $6.1 billion for all of Rig Solutions segment. At year-end, that backlog includes $1.75 billion for the remaining 15 rigs across 3 shipyards in Brazil. I would stress that the situation in Brazil with regards to these remains uncertain and continues to evolve owing to the failure of our shipyard customers -- customer to secure long-term financing for these projects. We suspended work within 2 of these remaining 3 shipyards early last year, and we are in discussions with all 3 yards regarding the resolution of their programs. We recognize only $10 million in revenues for the remaining new-build rigs in Brazil during the fourth quarter of 2015. 
As we ramp up a challenging year in 2015, we recognize we are facing increasing headwinds in 2016, but we also recognize that extraordinary opportunities will arise as a result of the stress our industry is under. I am pleased with the execution of our experienced leaders who are cutting costs and improving efficiency, but also continuing to advance our long-term strategic initiatives by closed loop automated drilling opportunities which we expect to grow in 2016, new FPSO business models and designs to improve Deepwater economics and new products to improve drilling operations, completion techniques and more profitable production. Our EMP customers' business models simply don't work in this low oil price environment, and therein lies the opportunity for NOV to once again pioneer new, more efficient ways of extracting oil and gas to reduce their cost. 
Importantly, NOV represents a diverse portfolio of market leaders that participate in many major oilfield market around the world. We examine the major global sources of oil which make up the 90-plus million barrels of oil per day global industry. We see 10 million barrels of oil per day coming out of each of Saudi Arabia and Russia, both areas where we have invested heavily through the past few years, with our investments continuing to support relatively high levels of activity. Another 10 million barrels of oil per day comes from the Gulf states, where, again, we are expanding our presence and the oilfield remains comparatively busy. Nearly 10 million barrels per day has been achieved from Deepwater production, where we have benefited disproportionately from the Deepwater and offshore rigs we have built and expect to pioneer better methods of production in the future. Another 10 million barrels per day roughly comes from North America, which is dominated by shale production techniques. Each of these major productive areas has been enabled by NOV technology, and we continue to help our customers adapt to lower oil prices across them all. NOV remains well-positioned globally for when the eventual recovery comes, wherever it shows up first. Our leading market positions has been assembled through a combination of organic investments and acquisitions, and we're actively pursuing several targets now. It has been challenging and sometimes frustrating to reach agreement with potential sellers, but as the downturn lengthens, everybody in the space is becoming a lot more realistic. We remain patient and disciplined on values and realistic in our outlook, as the option value of our capital flexibility steadily rises. 
I am pleased that NOV has the balance sheet and financial resources to pursue these, but I am more pleased that we have tough, capable, experienced managers who can skillfully integrate acquisitions and execute our business plans. To all the NOV employees, I congratulate you for navigating such a challenging year in 2015, and I thank you for your contributions in building such a strong enterprise. We have a tough road ahead, but we are laying the groundwork for our future success.

31900,315624280,925331,"National Oilwell Varco, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2016",2016-02-03,"Earnings Calls","NOV Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Clay. I'll next provide some additional detail on our segment operating results for the fourth quarter and full year 2015 and provide some commentary on the near-term outlook. Our Rig Systems segment generated revenue of $1.0 billion, down 32%",2211,"Thank you, Clay. I'll next provide some additional detail on our segment operating results for the fourth quarter and full year 2015 and provide some commentary on the near-term outlook. Our Rig Systems segment generated revenue of $1.0 billion, down 32% from the $1.5 billion earned last quarter and down 60% from the $2.6 billion generated in the fourth quarter of 2014. For the fourth quarter, the split between offshore and land-related revenue was 73% and 27% respectively. Revenue out of backlog was $843 million, down 35% sequentially. As Clay indicated, slide delivery schedules and limited new order intake have contributed to the decline in revenue. You may recall that in the first quarter of 2015, we announced we were negotiating certain customer requested delivery delays for offshore new-build rigs. Although not our first choice, modifying delivery schedules allowed us to better manage our cost structure and level loading across our operations as we began sizing our business to support reduced levels of demand. The success of our cost management measures are seen in our decremental operating profit margins which were 23.9% on a 32% sequential revenue decline, and which were 22.7% on a 60% year-over-year revenue decline. Fourth quarter operating profit for the Rig Systems segment was $160 million [ph], yielding operating margins of 15.8% down 260 [ph] basis points from Q3. EBITDA was $184 million or 18.1% of sales, and EBITDA margins decreased 200 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2015. 
During the fourth quarter, we received $89 million in new orders resulting in a book-to-bill of 10%. Q4 bookings were composed entirely of discrete pieces of capital equipment as we receive known new rig orders in the quarter. Bookings included top drives and block preventers for international land rigs and cranes for offshore construction vessels. We ended the quarter with a backlog of $6.1 billion, down 24% sequentially of which approximately 89% is for the offshore market and 92% is destined for international markets. 
As Clay mentioned in his commentary, our customers are under increasing pressures related to falling day rates and utilization associated with a cyclical downturn. Our global portfolio of offshore rig equipment contracts typically incorporate significant down payment and progress payments, which minimize our working capital investments throughout the life of the agreement. While we do not expect meaningful charges from potential future breaches of contracts, cancellations or other similar issues, the impact would vary dependent upon the specific contract, timing of the event and other circumstances. 
For full year 2015, Rig Systems generated revenue of $7 billion, down 29% in comparison to 2014 as slowing project progress and declining orders drove revenue out of backlog down $2.6 billion from the $8.7 billion earned in 2014. With a resolute focus on execution and a commitment to continued cost reductions, Rig Systems generated $1.4 billion in full year EBITDA and maintained EBITDA margins just over 20% despite revenues declining almost 30% over the same period. Full year 2015 operating profit was $1.3 billion or 18.9% of revenue, down 140 basis points from the previous year, representing decremental leverage at 23.5%. 
As we move into the first quarter of 2016, at this point, we expect Rig Systems revenue to decline in the high single-digit percentage range and revenue out of backlog to decrease to around $775 million. But I'll stress that our visibility remains limited We plan to deliver on our current backlog while continuing to resize the business aggressively to meet a much lower level of demand. We're actively scaling facilities to single ships, consolidating locations and implementing other cost control initiatives. Despite these efforts, reduced volumes will work against us and we anticipate some margin erosion on lower activity levels and continued delays in the range of 2 to 300 basis points. 
Declining energy prices will negatively impact our order book for the foreseeable future, and we expect new orders for large equipment packages, both on and offshore to remain low. We continue to win in the marketplace due to our commitment to technology, capacity and operational service and support, but orders are scarce. As such, we do not expect this quarter's bookings to improve materially from the fourth quarter. 
Our Rig Aftermarket segment generated $569 million [ph] of revenue during the fourth quarter 2015, roughly flat sequentially and down 33% year-over-year from a record $850 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Customers curtailed spending as regularization declined in both land and offshore markets. Land-related sales were approximately 21% of total segment revenue down slightly from 22% in Q3, but up on a percentage basis from 18% in the fourth quarter of 2014. EBITDA for the segment was $135 million or 23.7% of sales and operating profit was $127 million or 22.3% of sales, down 330 basis points from last quarter on higher portion of lower margin service and repair work, as well as incremental pricing pressure on repair and selected spare parts. 
Overall, 2015 results reflected an increasingly uncertain environment in which our drilling contractor customers reduced spending in effort to preserve liquidity. Throughout the year, our customers shows deplete existing spares inventories, rather than pursue new and did de minimis repair work and maintenance on the rig fleets, deferring more expansive work except where absolutely necessary.  For the full year, Rig Aftermarket generated revenue of $2.5 billion down 22% from a record at 2014. For full year, EBITDA was $647 million or 25.7% of revenue, down 250 basis points from 2014, and 2015 operating profit was $617 million or 24.5% of sales, down 290 basis points from the prior year. 
Looking into the first quarter of 2016 [ph] we expect Rig Aftermarket will see revenues decline in the mid- to upper teens percent range. Due to the seasonal nature of the aftermarket business, we typically expect lower activity with the better mix of spares to service and repair work in the first quarter than in the fourth. However, we anticipate a steeper than usual decline in Q1, reflecting current market conditions. Although reducing costs will be at the forefront of our response efforts, pricing pressure may push margins around 100 basis points lower in the first quarter.  Longer term, we believe our Rig Aftermarket segment will be a strong through early cycle beneficiary of the eventual recovery. We believe drillers will rush to return and suboptimally maintain stacked partially cannibalize rigs to proper operating condition, once they gain confidence that the market has reached a bottom and they see early indications of a recovery. 
For the fourth quarter of 2015, the Wellbore Technologies segment generated revenues of $757 million, down 9% sequentially from $834 million and down 50% from a record $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014. Reduced drilling activity negatively impacted all of our businesses within the segment. Average rig counts declined by 13% sequentially in the U.S., 9% in Canada and 2%, internationally. And segment revenue by geography closely mirrored the sequential fall in rig count. Pricing pressure continued into the fourth quarter across most all product lines. For the fourth quarter of 2015, EBITDA was $68 million or 9% of revenue, down 530 basis points from last quarter and the segment posted an operating loss of $31 million. For the full year 2015, Wellbore Technologies generated revenue of $3.7 billion, down 35% in comparison to 2014. Consistent with the year-over-year average decline in global rig count, 2015 EBITDA for the segment was $562 million or 15.1% of revenue down from 26% in 2014, and operating profit was $162 million for 2015 or 4.4% of sales, as the speed of activity and revenue declined outpaced our reduction efforts. 
Like our Rig Aftermarket business, we expect our Wellbore Technologies segment to be an early cycle beneficiary of the eventual recovery. However, near-term, we have limited visibility and the activity-driven nature of the business contributes to variability. Just 4 weeks into 2016, U.S. rig count is down 18% from the average in Q4 of 2015. So we expect revenues to fall 8% to 10% with decremental margins in the 40% range. We continue our efforts to optimize our Wellbore Technologies segment, resizing our business to meet lower level of demand, improving our manufacturing processes to become more efficient on a lower cost base and shortening our commercialization processes to bring new value-adding technologies to market. 
Our Completion & Production Solutions segment generated revenues of $746 million for the fourth quarter of 2015, down 7% sequentially and 44% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. Businesses related to onshore completion and production were some of the most negatively impacted, with customers delaying receipt of finished orders as operators inventory of drilled but uncompleted wells rose in response to commodity price declines. EBITDA for the segment was $86 million or 11.5% of sales and operating profit for the segment was $34 million resulting in operating margins of 4.6%, down 330 basis points sequentially at 1,160 basis points year-over-year as a result of lower volumes and pricing pressure. 
During the quarter, Completion & Production Solutions received orders of $272 million, down $194 million or 42% sequentially as the substantial flexible pipe order won in the third quarter did not repeat. We recognized $460 million of revenue out of backlog, resulting in a book-to-bill of 59%. Segment ended the quarter with a backlog balance of $959 million, of which approximately 75% is offshore and 87% is destined for international markets. For the full year 2015, the segment generated revenue of $3.4 billion, down 28% in comparison to 2014 as revenue out of backlog declined $501 million or 20% and non-backlog revenue decreased 37% from 2014 to $1.3 billion. Full year EBITDA was $507 million or 15.1% of revenue, down 480 basis points from 2014. Operating profit was $286 million or 8.5% of revenue in comparison to $700 million and 15.1% in 2014, representing decremental leverage of 32.3%. Record or near record margin in some of our offshore production-related businesses including flexibles and large diameter XL Systems conductor pipe connections were overshadowed by lower year-over-year contributions from our higher-margin intervention and stimulation equipment businesses given reduced demand for hydraulic stimulations, coiled tubing and wireline capital equipment and consumables. 
With oil at 12-year lows, orders for new capital equipment will remain challenged as we move into the first quarter of 2016. Opportunities that do emerge will face continued pricing pressure. As a result, we anticipate revenues will decrease by approximately 15% and expect revenue out of backlog to fall to the $350 million to $370 million range. We anticipate  decremental operating leverage in the 30% to 35% range. 
Now let's discuss some additional detail regarding our consolidated financial results. Working down the consolidated statement of income for the fourth quarter of 2015, gross margin declined 210 basis points to 19.1%. SG&A increased $25 million or 7% sequentially due in large part to increases in bad debt and other year end related items, which more than offset overheads reductions. Despite the slight sequential increase, we reduced SG&A 28% year-over-year, which translates into an annualized cost savings of approximately $600 million. Other items for the quarter equaled $1.8 billion and resulted primarily from goodwill and indefinite live intangible asset write-downs of $1.6 billion and restructuring and other charges of $139 million. 
EBITDA was $308 million or 11.3% of sales. Net interest expense remained flat for the third quarter, and equity income was a loss of $3 million as demand for OCTGs or green tubing associated with our Alpine joint venture remains muted given the low demand for new drill pipe. Other expense for the quarter decreased $3 million sequentially to $17 million and the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter, excluding the impact of other items, was 18.7% affected by a taxable loss in the U.S. and taxable income and foreign jurisdictions and other things. Net income, excluding other items, was $85 million or $0.23 per fully diluted share. Working capital, excluding cash and debt, totaled $5.5 billion at December 31, 2015, down $422 million from the prior quarter. We generated a total of $614 million in cash flow from operations. After dividend, payments of $173 million, investments in our business of $136 million and FX impact on our cash balances and other items totaling $18 million, we were able to decrease our net debt position by $287 million during the quarter. 
We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.1 billion, $4 billion in debt and our net debt to capitalization was 11.2%. We also have $3.6 billion of undrawn capacity on our revolving credit facility. Overall, 2015 was a challenging year under the backdrop of market uncertainty, falling energy prices, declining drilling activity and reduced customer spending. In spite these conditions, NOV generated $1.3 billion cash flow from operations, bought back 2.2 billion in our shares, paid out cash dividends of $710 million to our shareholders, invested over $450 million in organic growth opportunities and completed 7 acquisitions for approximately $85 million, all while preserving a very strong balance sheet. 2016 will prove to be another challenging year. However, the actions we took during 2015 have positioned us well to weather the storm and capitalize on opportunities that we identified during the down cycle. 
Now let me turn it back to Clay."

We were hoping to find stability early 2016 and then it will hit down another $10 and all the EMPs are coming up with a sharply lower Capex forecast than we had been planning for. So things remain fluid. But to your original question, what's the right balance, I got to tell you one of the really necessary skill sets in oilfield services for those of us that have been in it a while is the ability to flex up sharply when called upon and flex down sharply when called upon. And the good news for NOV is we have a very experienced management team running our business units around the globe. They know how to do this. We've been called on in the past to double and triple and quadruple production over a short period of time and we successfully navigated that very well and maximized profitability returns through that. This is the flip side of that. As orders fall away, as spending comes to a screeching halt, we have to cut costs in lockstep. So we have an abundance of confidence in the capabilities of this team to do both, to respond to this market that's slowing down dramatically, as well as speed up and flex upwards when we're eventually called upon to do that."

So we have a lot of capital flexibility. We stepped up our efforts as we talked about in prior calls to be very vigorous in looking for opportunities to deploy capital, and what we see is becoming more of a buyers market. And so we're pretty, pretty excited about that and have a lot of flexibility to pursue those. As you know, we really fundamentally pursue competitive advantage and really fundamentally pursue evolving trends that we see in the oilfield as attractive areas to deploy capital. So specifically, I think my comments just a moment ago, I mentioned places like Saudi Arabia, which is committed to increasing activity. They want more local content. We talked a lot in the past about areas like the FSU where we've done more organic investment than acquisitions. But that's an area of interest. Argentina, the excitement around the shale which was down in Q4, but longer-term, we're pretty excited about the potential there.

We were disappointed in the fourth quarter that revenue out of backlog fell so sharply. It fell about $460 million sequentially out of Rig Systems, a couple of hundred million short of where our expectations were for the fourth quarter. And that's due precisely to what you highlighted with regards to drilling contractors really getting more aggressive on trying to delay acceptance of rigs and pushing back. As you know, the food chain that we work within drilling contractors sign-up for the construction of these new rigs, the shipyards or their customers and then we work for the shipyards. We've been very diligent over the years about demanding very strong contracts, very strong downpayments, progress billings and the like, but given our focus on monetizing the profit in that backlog, we had slowed our progress on revenue out of backlog to sort of better match payments and to minimize our working capital exposure on those programs. That's kind of what you saw in the fourth quarter. We slowed down that revenue recognition out of backlog. And ultimately it's really caused by a lot of drillers trying to delay acceptance of rigs. A couple of situations I think have been made public and a couple of situations remain a little tense. Contributing to that was the 1 shipyard we continued working for in Brazil, often slow in the fourth quarter. I mentioned in my call that we only did $10 million of revenue out of Brazil. And so progress on that particular program slowed as well. So really across the board, things have slowed down. It remains fluid, we've hair cut our guidance for revenue out of backlog into Q1 and are working to respond to the market kind of week by week as we things unfolding."

And we certainly saw that during the year -- during the quarter, offset by continued decline in orders for higher-margin spare parts. As we go into Q1, essentially during the course of Q4, we saw, obviously quick deterioration in a number of other product offerings, spare parts included. And so we're expecting a good fall off, not only in that sort of seasonal associated service and repair work, but also continuing falloff in spares. As I mentioned in my commentary, this is a business that we're certainly excited about in the future as it is tightly tied to the front end of the cycle, and we really do believe that once there are some glimmers of hope out there, things stabilize a little bit, our customers can call bottom and start seeing any sort of optimism to gain some confidence. There will be a rush to deliver new orders which will result in a nice pickup for us. The exact timing of that is really difficult to say.

They slowed down spare parts purchases, as we've talked about before, cannibalizing, deferring maintenance wherever possible. I think it's safe to say that no piece of capital equipment across the oilfield globally is being well-maintained right now. And with that said, so for the future is when activity does turn and we find bottom and then it starts to go up, is a lot of work for our Rig Aftermarket folks to repair, to maintain, to replenish spare parts. The deeper this goes, the longer this goes, I think, the sharper the rebound and the more positive the rebound."

Where can we offer a better package of products and services for our customers, and it's really a little more granular than trying to globally arrive at some sort of diversified portfolio mix. I think we ended up at a very diversified portfolio mix already, but at the end of the day, business is about making money, right.

31900,315624280,925626,"National Oilwell Varco, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2016",2016-02-03,"Earnings Calls","NOV Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Loren. National Oilwell Varco faced deteriorating market conditions during the fourth quarter to cap off a very challenging year. The company reported fourth quarter net income of $85 million or $0.23 per fully diluted share, excluding other it",2556,"Thank you, Loren. National Oilwell Varco faced deteriorating market conditions during the fourth quarter to cap off a very challenging year. The company reported fourth quarter net income of $85 million or $0.23 per fully diluted share, excluding other items, down from $0.61 per fully diluted share in the third quarter of 2015 on a comparable basis. Other items included pretax charges of $1.6 billion and goodwill and intangible asset impairments, $139 million in restructuring inventory writedowns, severance and facilities closures and $7 million in FX losses in Argentina. GAAP net loss for the quarter was $1.5 billion or $4.06 per fully diluted share. 
Fourth quarter 2015 revenues were $2.7 billion, down 18% from the third quarter of 2015. Operating profit for the quarter was $141 million or 5.2% of sales, and EBITDA was $308 million or 11.3% of sales, excluding other items from both. Decremental operating leverage was 35% from the third quarter to the fourth. 
Our management teams across our business units are responding quickly to lower revenues, which fell further than we expected in the fourth quarter. By reducing costs and accelerating restructuring plans, which enabled us to hold decremental leverage to 35% x charges despite the sharp volume decline and renewed intense pricing pressure we are seeing. As we have stated for the past few quarters, our focus is to manage what we can, namely cost, while continuing to advance our longer-term strategic goals. It, nevertheless, remains a very challenging time for everyone in the oil and gas industry, and our visibility remains limited. 
For its full year 2015, National Oilwell Varco posted a GAAP loss of $1.99 per fully diluted share, including restructuring, asset impairments, facility closure costs and other charges of $2 billion pretax. Excluding these items, earnings were $2.80 per fully diluted share, down 54% from $6.07 per fully diluted share earned in 2014. Operating profit was $1.6 billion or 11.1% of revenue, and EBITDA was $2.3 billion or 15.5% of revenue for the full year excluding charges. Decremental operating leverage was 32% from 2014 to 2015, excluding charges from both years, a commendable result in view of the severe downturn and pricing pressures we faced throughout the year. 
Cash flow from operations for 2015 totaled $1.3 billion, with $614 million of that coming in the fourth quarter, with improving working capital liquidation. We continue to invest in our future, closing 7 acquisitions through the year, which, among other benefits, enhanced our presence in Saudi Arabia, our wellsite services offering in Asia and brought in new composites technology. We continue developing new products with our new test rig, which we spudded at the beginning of the year. We also continued investments in the world's most promising regions, adding new facilities in Saudi Arabia,  Abu Dabhi, Russia and West Texas. We returned $2.9 billion to shareholders in 2015 through dividends and share purchases. 
With regards to cost, we were able to manage the good decremental operating leverage on our 31% decline in revenues x charges by close attention to cost and efficiency. We insourced tens of thousands of hours from outside suppliers to our own workforce to preserve our team wherever possible. Nevertheless, our global workforce, including contract labor, declined 21% through the year, and we closed 75 facilities since mid-2014 to retrench to a smaller, more efficient footprint. We expect restructuring will continue to the first half of 2016, perhaps longer in view of the challenging market. 
A second major decline in oil prices last year deepened and intensified late during the fourth quarter and continued throughout January when oil traded into the high $20 range, levels not seen since 2003. This, combined with hedges rolling off for E&Ps and term contracts expiring for drilling contractors, ratcheted up financial stress on our customers and increased pricing pressure on NOV. 
We believe the present level of activity is insufficient to supply the longer-term demand for oil, and note that unlike the 3 most recent downturns through the past 20 years, OPEC has not curtailed production to defend pricing. This has made the present downturn far more severe, but will perhaps lead to a sharper, eventual recovery. 
With producers pumping furiously to maximize their cash flow, the relentless march of depletion, the deferral of 68 projects, representing 3 million barrels of oil per day of planned future production, and the unfolding of severe capital austerity will help bring supply and demand into balance, but we are not planning for a recovery in 2016. Instead, we will continue to manage costs to the reality of the marketplace in the short term. Even with a rebound in oil prices, it will take time for our customers to repair balance sheets, reactivate crews and to ramp up the activity that drives our business. Each day that passes means we are a day closer to the inevitable rebound. Our plan is to emerge with new products, new business models and new efficiencies. 
Our Completion & Production Solutions segment fell 7% sequentially in the fourth quarter and posted 56% sequential decremental operating leverage, excluding restructuring and other items. Orders declined from 99% book-to-bill in the third quarter to 59% in the fourth, which led backlog down to $969 million at year-end. Strong sequential improvements in our XL Systems conductor pipe connections unit in the fourth quarter capped off a solid year for this unit, with higher year-over-year margins. However, these failed to fully offset sequential double-digit declines in our other products within the segment. 
In North America, customers delayed picking up well stimulation equipment previously ordered, and some are now buying frac spreads at distressed pricing to use for spare parts, which further reduced sales but will ultimately help erode the equipment overhang. 
In North America, sales of spares and consumables like coiled tubing declined with reduced activity, but the FSU in the Middle East remain comparably strong. 
Sales of composite oilfield pipe declined as the costs of competing steel flowlines have plummeted 35% or more. And our sales into the Marine construction markets slowed. Our value proposition for the composite pipe that we manufacture is much lower lifetime cost due to its corrosion resistance but E&Ps under duress are opting for the lowest investment option to bring on wells and their associated cash flow.  About 20% of the segment's mix is in production equipment, pumps, separators and artificial lift, which also fell in the quarter as distributors slowed purchases. We have 6 major facility consolidations underway within this business unit, which will drive better efficiency going forward. 
Within our offshore production-related businesses, we saw rising pricing pressure on flexible pipe, but we're pleased to post 111% book-to-bill as we landed some significant orders for pre-salt applications in Brazil. Our floating production vessel unit continues to pioneer new business models we launched a few years ago that leverage NOV's unique vessel construction capabilities to improve construction costs and reduce risks. 
Our new vessel concepts, which seek to accelerate production from certain types of deepwater fields, are being met with high enthusiasm from our customers so far. We are encouraged by new designs that are steadily whittling costs, but operators remain slow to sanction major deepwater projects. It is nevertheless, a promising target with 400 discoveries in the offshore. 
Our Wellbore Technologies segment revenues fell 9% sequentially in the fourth quarter and posted 69% sequential decremental operating leverage, which resulted in a negative 4.1% operating margin, excluding restructuring and other items. EBITDA margins were 9% for the segment x other items.  2/3 of the sequential decline in revenue came from North America where operators stacked major drilling programs, intensifying pricing pressures and reducing volumes. Rentals of solids control equipment, rig instrumentation and downhole equipment declined at high-variable margins. Nevertheless, we were able to increase share in our bits business owing to new tectonic designs, which we are successfully packaging with our ERT drilling motors. 
In the FSU, we expect to begin production in our downhole tools facility at our new Kostroma plant within a few weeks to supply the local market, which, along with Asia, posted higher sequential revenues in the fourth quarter. Latin America saw a significant decline for the segment across Brazil, Mexico and Argentina. 
Our Tuboscope pipe coating business held up well through the quarter on drill pipe strength in China, but pipe mill inspection activity in North America declined, with 9 months of casing on the ground, the highest level of inventory seen since the 1980s. Rising activity around tubing, pipeline and line pipe helped to offset this somewhat, but we are even seeing working -- workover activity fall in West Texas, which is unusual. Prior downturns have seen workover activity hold up better owing to quick paybacks. Drill pipe sales increased modestly from the third quarter into the fourth quarter, but still remain low and under price pressure. 
Growing operator interest in closed-loop automated drilling technology drove higher revenues for our IntelliServ wire drill pipe unit in the fourth quarter to produce solid year-over-year improvements for the group. This innovative service grew sixfold in 2015 as compared to 2014, and we have lots of interest from E&Ps, as well as drilling contractors eager to differentiate their rigs by enabling high-speed data transmission from the bottom of the hole through their drill pipe. 
Our Rig Aftermarket segment posted flat sequential revenues, but margins fell due to mix. A decline in spare parts sales was offset by higher repair revenues, which came in at lower margins partly due to rising discounts to win repair work. As rigs come down, particularly onshore, they are being cannibalized for parts, impacting our spares business for the quarter. 
SPS activity on offshore rigs rolled over in the fourth quarter, but remains active nonetheless. The Rig Aftermarket segment is actively working on about 40 projects either underway or on the bidding stage, but these are fluid as drilling contractors are curtailing scope or, in some instances, electing not to proceed with an SPS without a clear line of sight on a contract for the rig. Service and repair work in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico improved sequentially for Rig Aftermarket, and BOP repair work in the Middle East remains strong. 
Rig Systems revenues fell 32% at 24% decrementals in the fourth quarter, driven by sharply lower shipments at a backlog. Customers are delaying acceptance of uncontracted new-builds to avoid stacking cost and to slow their CapEx as they face falling day rates and utilization as their contracts roll off. Revenues from new offshore rig construction fell to about 20% of our consolidated revenue mix in the fourth quarter. We are working closely with our shipyard customers to navigate challenges and requests for delays and to improve our collections, but these situations remain fluid. At this point we expect revenues out of backlog for all of 2016 to total of about $2.1 billion or $2.2 billion. Rig Systems saw a 76% decline in new orders in the fourth quarter which fell to $89 million and totaled $1 billion for the full year. 
Coating activity plummeted late in the year, and while we still see interest for new land rigs for the Middle East and some other selected markets, we expect orders to again be very low for the first quarter. Importantly, we expect the land rig market to eventually resume its efforts to retool to more efficient AC technology, but the fourth quarter downturn and day rates for Tier 1 rigs will certainly delay that trend. 
As we disclosed in December, we reached a confidential settlement with 1 of our shipyard customers in Brazil to cancel 7 floating rigs being constructed there, which reduced our backlog by nearly $1.2 billion and led to a year-end backlog of $6.1 billion for all of Rig Solutions segment. At year-end, that backlog includes $1.75 billion for the remaining 15 rigs across 3 shipyards in Brazil. I would stress that the situation in Brazil with regards to these remains uncertain and continues to evolve, owing to the failure of our shipyard customers -- customer to secure long-term financing for these projects. 
We suspended work within 2 of these remaining 3 shipyards early last year, and we are in discussions with all 3 yards regarding the resolution of their programs. We recognized only $10 million in revenues from the remaining newbuild rigs in Brazil during the fourth quarter of 2015. 
As we ramp up a challenging year in 2015, we recognize we are facing increasing headwinds in 2016, but we also recognize that extraordinary opportunities will arise as a result of the stress our industry is under. I'm pleased with the execution of our experienced leaders who are cutting costs and improving efficiency, but also continuing to advance our long-term strategic initiatives by closed-loop automated drilling opportunities which we expect to grow in 2016, new FPSO business models and designs to improve deepwater economics, and new products to improve drilling operations, completion techniques and more profitable production. Our E&P customers' business models simply don't work in this low oil price environment, and therein lies the opportunity for NOV to once again pioneer new, more efficient ways of extracting oil and gas to reduce their cost. 
Importantly, NOV represents a diverse portfolio of market leaders that participate in every major oilfield market around the globe. We examine the major global sources of oil, which make up the 90-plus million barrels of oil per day global industry. We see 10 million barrels of oil per day coming out of each of Saudi Arabia and Russia, both areas where we have invested heavily through the past few years, with our investments continuing to support relatively high levels of activity. Another 10 million barrels of oil per day comes from the Gulf States, where, again, we are expanding our presence and the oilfield remains comparatively busy. Nearly 10 million barrels per day has been achieved from deepwater production, where we have benefited disproportionately from the deepwater and offshore rigs we have built, and expect to pioneer better methods of production in the future. Another 10 million barrels per day roughly comes from North America, which is dominated by shale production techniques. Each of these major productive areas has been enabled by NOV technology, and we continue to help our customers adapt to lower oil prices across them all. 
NOV remains well positioned globally for when the eventual recovery comes, wherever it shows up first. Our leading market positions have been assembled through a combination of organic investments and acquisitions, and we're actively pursuing several targets now. It has been challenging and sometimes frustrating to reach agreement with potential sellers, but as the downturn lengthens, everybody in the space is becoming a lot more realistic. We remain patient and disciplined on values and realistic in our outlook, as the option value of our capital flexibility steadily rises. 
I am pleased that NOV has the balance sheet and financial resources to pursue these, but I am more pleased that we have tough, capable, experienced managers who can skillfully integrate acquisitions and execute our business plans. To all the NOV employees, I congratulate you for navigating such a challenging year in 2015, and I thank you for your contributions in building such a strong enterprise. We have a tough road ahead, but we are laying the groundwork for our future success. José?"
31900,315624280,925626,"National Oilwell Varco, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2016",2016-02-03,"Earnings Calls","NOV Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Clay. I'll next provide some additional detail on our segment operating results for the fourth quarter and full year 2015, and provide some commentary on the near-term outlook. Our Rig Systems segment generated a revenue of $1.0 billion, down",2209,"Thank you, Clay. I'll next provide some additional detail on our segment operating results for the fourth quarter and full year 2015, and provide some commentary on the near-term outlook. 
Our Rig Systems segment generated a revenue of $1.0 billion, down 32% from the $1.5 billion earned last quarter and down 60% from the $2.6 billion generated in the fourth quarter of 2014. For the fourth quarter, the split between offshore and land-related revenue was 73% and 27% respectively. Revenue out of backlog was $843 million, down 35% sequentially. 
As Clay indicated, sliding delivery schedules and limited new order intake have contributed to the decline in revenue. You may recall that in the first quarter of 2015, we announced we were negotiating certain customer requested delivery delays for offshore newbuild rigs. Although not our first choice, modifying delivery schedules allowed us to better manage our cost structure and level loading across our operations as we began sizing our business to support reduced levels of demand. The success of our cost management measures are seen in our decremental operating profit margins which were 23.9% on a 32% sequential revenue decline, and which were 22.7% on a 60% year-over-year revenue decline. 
Fourth quarter operating profit for the Rig Systems segment was $160 million, yielding operating margins of 15.8% down 260 basis points from Q3. EBITDA was $184 million or 18.1% of sales, and EBITDA margins decreased 200 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2015. 
During the fourth quarter, we received $89 million in new orders resulting in a book-to-bill of 10%. Q4 bookings were composed entirely of discrete pieces of capital equipment as we receive no new rig orders in the quarter. 
Bookings included top drives and blowout preventers for international land rigs and cranes for offshore construction vessels. We ended the quarter with a backlog of $6.1 billion, down 24% sequentially, of which approximately 89% is for the offshore market and 92% is destined for international markets. 
As Clay mentioned in his commentary, our customers are under increasing pressures related in the falling day rates and utilization associated with the cyclical downturn. Our global portfolio of offshore rig equipment contracts typically incorporate a significant down payment and progress payments, which minimize our working capital investments throughout the life of the agreement. While we do not expect meaningful charges from potential future breaches of contracts, cancellations or other similar issues, the impact would vary dependent upon the specific contract, timing of the event and other circumstances. 
For full year 2015, Rig Systems generated revenue of $7 billion, down 29% in comparison to 2014 as slowing project progress and declining orders drove revenue out of backlog down $2.6 billion from the $8.7 billion earned in 2014. With a resolute focus on execution and a commitment to continued cost reductions, Rig Systems generated $1.4 billion in full year EBITDA and maintained EBITDA margins just over 20% despite revenues declining almost 30% over the same period. Full year 2015 operating profit was $1.3 billion or 18.9% of revenue, down 140 basis points from the previous year, representing decremental leverage at 23.5%. 
As we move into the first quarter of 2016, at this point, we expect Rig Systems revenue to decline in the high single-digit percentage range and revenue out of backlog to decrease to around $775 million, but I'll stress that our visibility remains limited. We plan to deliver on our current backlog while continuing to resize the business aggressively to meet a much lower level of demand. We're actively scaling facilities to single ships, consolidating locations and implementing other cost control initiatives. Despite these efforts, reduced volumes will work against us, and we anticipate some margin erosion on lower activity levels and continued delays in the range of 2 to 300 basis points. 
Declining energy prices will negatively impact our order book for the foreseeable future, and we expect new orders for large equipment packages, both on and offshore to remain low. We continue to win in the marketplace due to our commitment to technology, capacity and operational service and support, but orders are scarce. As such, we do not expect this quarter's bookings to improve materially from the fourth quarter. 
Our Rig Aftermarket segment generated $569 million of revenue during the fourth quarter of 2015, roughly flat sequentially and down 33% year-over-year from a record $850 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Customers curtailed spending as rig utilization declined in both land and offshore markets. Land-related sales were approximately 21% of total segment revenue, down slightly from 22% in Q3, but up on a percentage basis from 18% in the fourth quarter of 2014. EBITDA for the segment was $135 million or 23.7% of sales and operating profit was $127 million or 22.3% of sales, down 330 basis points from last quarter on higher portion of lower margin service and repair work as well as incremental pricing pressure on repair and selected spare parts. 
Overall, 2015 results reflected an increasingly uncertain environment in which our drilling contractor customers reduced spending in an effort to preserve liquidity. Throughout the year, our customer chose to deplete existing spares inventories rather than pursue new and did de minimis repair work and maintenance on the rig fleets, deferring more expansive work except where absolutely necessary.  
For the full year, Rig Aftermarket generated revenue of $2.5 billion, down 22% from a record 2014. For full year, EBITDA was $647 million or 25.7% of revenue, down 250 basis points from 2014. And 2015 operating profit was $617 million or 24.5% of sales, down 290 basis points from the prior year. 
Looking into the first quarter of 2016, we expect Rig Aftermarket will see revenues decline in the mid- to upper teens percent range. Due to the seasonal nature of the aftermarket business, we typically expect lower activity with a better mix of spares to service and repair work in the first quarter than in the fourth. However, we anticipate a steeper than usual decline in Q1, reflecting current market conditions. Although reducing costs will be at the forefront of our response efforts, pricing pressure may push margins around 100 basis points lower in the first quarter. Longer term, we believe our Rig Aftermarket segment will be a strong early-cycle beneficiary of the eventual recovery. We believe drillers will rush to return suboptimally maintained stacked, partially cannibalized rigs to proper operating condition once they gain confidence that the market has reached a bottom and they see an early indications of recovery. 
For the fourth quarter of 2015, the Wellbore Technologies segment generated revenues of $757 million, down 9% sequentially from $834 million and down 50% from a record $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014. Reduced drilling activity negatively impacted all of our businesses within the segment. Average rig counts declined by 13% sequentially in the U.S.; 9% in Canada; and 2%, internationally. And segment revenue by geography closely mirrored the sequential fall in rig count. 
Pricing pressure continued into the fourth quarter across most all product lines. For the fourth quarter of 2015, EBITDA was $68 million or 9% of revenue, down 530 basis points from last quarter and the segment posted an operating loss of $31 million. For the full year 2015, Wellbore Technologies generated revenue of $3.7 billion, down 35% in comparison to 2014. Consistent with the year-over-year average decline in global rig count, 2015 EBITDA for the segment was $562 million or 15.1% of revenue down from 26% in 2014, and operating profit was $162 million for 2015 or 4.4% of sales, as the speed of activity and revenue decline outpaced our reduction efforts. 
Like our Rig Aftermarket business, we expect our Wellbore Technologies segment to be an early-cycle beneficiary of the eventual recovery. However, near term, we have limited visibility, and the activity-driven nature of the business contributes to variability. Just 4 weeks into 2016, U.S. rig count is down 18% from the average in Q4 of 2015. So we expect revenues to fall 8% to 10% with decremental margins in the 40% range. We continue our efforts to optimize our Wellbore Technologies segment, resizing our business to meet lower levels of demand, improving our manufacturing processes to become more efficient on a lower cost base and shortening our commercialization processes to bring new value-adding technologies to market. 
Our Completion & Production Solutions segment generated revenues of $746 million for the fourth quarter of 2015, down 7% sequentially and 44% compared in the fourth quarter of 2014. Businesses related to onshore completion and production were some of the most negatively impacted, with customers delaying receipt of finished orders as operators' inventory of drilled but uncompleted wells rose in response to commodity price declines. EBITDA for the segment was $86 million or 11.5% of sales and operating profit for the segment was $34 million resulting in operating margins of 4.6%, down 330 basis points sequentially at 1,160 basis points year-over-year as a result of lower volumes and pricing pressure. 
During the quarter, Completion & Production Solutions received orders of $272 million, down $194 million or 42% sequentially as the substantial flexible pipe order won in the third quarter did not repeat. We recognized $460 million of revenue out of backlog, resulting in a book-to-bill of 59%. Segment ended the quarter with a backlog balance of $959 million, of which approximately 75% is offshore and 87% is destined for international markets. For full year 2015, the segment generated revenue of $3.4 billion, down 28% in comparison to 2014 as revenue out of backlog declined $501 million or 20% and nonbacklog revenue decreased 37% from 2014 to $1.3 billion. Full year EBITDA was $507 million or 15.1% of revenue, down 480 basis points from 2014. Operating profit was $286 million or 8.5% of revenue in comparison to $700 million and 15.1% in 2014, representing decremental leverage of 32.3%. Record or near record margins in some of our offshore production-related businesses, including flexibles and large diameter XL Systems conductor pipe connections, were overshadowed by lower year-over-year contributions from our higher-margin intervention and stimulation equipment businesses given reduced demand for hydraulic stimulations, coiled tubing and wireline capital equipment and consumables. 
With oil at 12-year lows, orders for new capital equipment will remain challenged as we move into the first quarter of 2016. Opportunities that do emerge will face continued pricing pressure. As a result, we anticipate revenues will decrease by approximately 15% and expect revenue out of backlog to fall to the $350 million to $370 million range. We anticipate  decremental operating leverage in the 30% to 35% range. 
Now let's discuss some additional detail regarding our consolidated financial results. Working down the consolidated statement of income for the fourth quarter of 2015, gross margin declined 210 basis points to 19.1%. SG&A increased $25 million or 7% sequentially due in large part to increases in bad debt and other year-end related items, which more than offset overhead reductions. Despite the slight sequential increase, we reduced SG&A 28% year-over-year, which translates into an annualized cost savings of approximately $600 million. Other items for the quarter equaled $1.8 billion and resulted primarily from goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset writedowns of $1.6 billion, and restructuring and other charges of $139 million. 
EBITDA was $308 million or 11.3% of sales. Net interest expense remained flat for the third quarter, and equity income was a loss of $3 million as demand for OCTGs or green tubing, associated with our Voest-Alpine joint venture, remains muted given the low demand for new drill pipe. 
Other expense for the quarter decreased $3 million sequentially to $17 million, and the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter, excluding the impact of other items, was 18.7% affected by a taxable loss in the U.S. and taxable income in foreign jurisdictions, among other things. 
Net income, excluding other items, was $85 million or $0.23 per fully diluted share. Working capital, excluding cash and debt, totaled $5.5 billion at December 31, 2015, down $422 million from the prior quarter. We generated a total of $614 million in cash flow from operations. After dividend payments of $173 million, investments in our business of $136 million and FX impact on our cash balances and other items totaling $18 million, we were able to decrease our net debt position by $287 million during the quarter. 
We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.1 billion, $4 billion in debt, and our net debt to capitalization was 11.2%. We also have $3.6 billion of undrawn capacity on our revolving credit facility. Overall, 2015 was a challenging year under the backdrop of market uncertainty, falling energy prices, declining drilling activity and reduced customer spending. In spite of these conditions, NOV generated $1.3 billion cash flow from operations, bought back 2.2 billion in our shares, paid out cash dividends of $710 million to our shareholders, invested over $450 million in organic growth opportunities and completed 7 acquisitions for approximately $85 million, all while preserving a very strong balance sheet. 2016 will prove to be another challenging year. However, the actions we took during 2015 have positioned us well to weather the storm and capitalize on opportunities that we identified during this down cycle. 
Now let me turn it back to Clay."

We were hoping to find stability early 2016, and then oil headed down another $10 and all the E&Ps are coming out with a sharply lower Capex forecast than we had been planning for. So things remain fluid. But to your original question, what's the right balance, I got to tell you one of the really necessary skill sets in oilfield services for those of us that had been in it a while is the ability to flex up sharply when called upon and flex down sharply when called upon. And the good news for NOV is we have a very experienced management team running our business units around the globe. They know how to do this. We've been called on in the past to double and triple and quadruple production over a short period of time, and we successfully navigated that very well and maximized profitability returns through that. This is the flip side of that. As orders fall away, as spending comes to the screeching halt, we have to cut costs in lockstep. So I have an abundance of confidence in the capabilities of this team to do both, to respond to this market that's slowing down dramatically, as well as speed up and flex upwards when we're eventually called upon to do that."

So we have a lot of capital flexibility. We stepped up our efforts as we talked about in prior calls to be very vigorous in looking for opportunities to deploy capital, and what we see is becoming more of a buyers market. And so we're pretty, pretty excited about that and have a lot of flexibility to pursue those. As you know, we really fundamentally pursue competitive advantage and really fundamentally pursue evolving trends that we see in the oilfield as attractive areas to deploy capital. So specifically, I think in my comments just a moment ago, I mentioned places like Saudi Arabia, which is committed to increasing activity. They want more local content. We've talked a lot in the past about areas like the FSU, where we've done more organic investment than acquisitions. But that's an area of interest. Argentina, the excitement around the Vaca Muerta shale, which was down in Q4, but longer term, we're pretty excited about the potential there. Those are the sorts of things that we look to, to be potentially interesting when it comes to potential M&A targets."

We were disappointed in the fourth quarter that our revenue out of backlog fell so sharply. It fell about $460 million sequentially out of Rig Systems, a couple of hundred million short of where our expectations were for the fourth quarter. And that's due precisely to what you highlighted with regards to drilling contractors really getting more aggressive on trying to delay acceptance of rigs and pushing back. As you know, the food chain that we work within, drilling contractors sign up for the construction of these new rigs, the shipyards or their customers, and then we work for the shipyards. We've been very diligent over the years about demanding very strong contracts, very strong down payments, progress billings and the like, but given our focus on monetizing the profit in that backlog, we have slowed our progress on revenue out of backlog to sort of match -- better match payments and to minimize our working capital exposure on those programs. So that's kind of what you saw in the fourth quarter. We slowed down that revenue recognition out of backlog. And ultimately, it's really caused by a lot of drillers trying to delay acceptance of rigs. A couple of situations I think have been made public and a couple of situations remain a little tense. Contributing to that was the one shipyard we continued working for in Brazil also slowed in the fourth quarter. I mentioned in my call that we only did $10 million in revenue out of Brazil. And so progress on that particular program slowed as well. So really across the board, things have slowed down. It remains fluid. We've haircut our guidance for revenue out of backlog into Q1 and are working to respond to the market kind of week by week as we see things unfolding."

And we certainly saw that during the quarter, offset by continued decline in orders for higher-margin spare parts. As we go into Q1, essentially during the course of Q4, we saw, obviously, quick deterioration in a number of other product offerings, spare parts included. And so we're expecting a good falloff, not only in that sort of seasonal associated service and repair work, but also continuing falloff in spares. As I mentioned in my commentary, this is a business that we're certainly excited about for the future as it is tightly tied to the front end of the cycle, and we really do believe that once there are some glimmers of hope out there, things stabilize a little bit, our customers can call bottom and start seeing any sort of optimism to gain some confidence. There will be a rush to deliver new orders, which will result in a nice pickup for us. The exact timing of that is really difficult to say. We're obviously in an environment where there's very little near-term visibility. But, again, we are confident about the prospects for that business when things rebound."

Well, their lower costs equal our lower Rig Aftermarket revenues. They've slowed down spare parts purchases or as we talked about before, cannibalizing, deferring maintenance wherever possible. I think it's safe to say that no piece of capital equipment across the oilfield globally is being well maintained right now. And what that sets up for the future is when activity does turn, when we find bottom and then it starts to go up, is a lot of work for our Rig Aftermarket folks to repair, to maintain, to replenish spare parts. So the deeper this goes and the longer this goes, I think, the sharper the rebound and the more positive to rebound."

But also elsewhere around the globe where they're more interested in being involved in the selection of the bottom hole assemblies that go into their complex directional drilling.

So as we think about capital allocation, for us, it's really all about ultimately driving maximum value to the shareholders. So obviously, historically, organic investment has been a very good use of capital, that current environment when we're overcapacitized. M&A tends to be front and center in our minds. And everything is going to be opportunity-specific, outlook-dependent in terms of how we think about using the capital structure related to M&A and our other capital requirements.

What are the trends in the oilfield? Where can we drive better industry structure? Where can we offer a better package of products and services for our customers?

We're not the only one seeing this. I would tell you on down cycles, having been through a few, it's really hard to get the bit and the ask to converge on the way down because the seller is looking backwards and saying, ""Hey, a quarter ago, 2 quarters ago, a year ago, we did much better financially."" And as a buyer, you're looking forward into a deteriorating P&L, wondering where's bottom and trying to discount appropriate. So the bid and the ask tend to widen early in the down cycle. I think if we're -- I don't know, well, I'm not calling bottom, I don't know if we're there yet. But as you start to get closer to the bottom, time passes, reality sets in, folks recognize this may go -- be lower for longer, and I think that's kind of where the industry is coming to now. I think it brings a much more sober, realistic outlook on the part of potential sellers, and I think we're starting to approach that kind of world."

31900,315624280,925755,"National Oilwell Varco, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2016",2016-02-03,"Earnings Calls","NOV Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Loren. National Oilwell Varco faced deteriorating market conditions during the fourth quarter to cap off a very challenging year. The company reported fourth quarter net income of $85 million or $0.23 per fully diluted share, excluding other it",2552,"Thank you, Loren. National Oilwell Varco faced deteriorating market conditions during the fourth quarter to cap off a very challenging year. The company reported fourth quarter net income of $85 million or $0.23 per fully diluted share, excluding other items, down from $0.61 per fully diluted share in the third quarter of 2015 on a comparable basis. Other items included pretax charges of $1.6 billion in goodwill and intangible asset impairments, $139 million in restructuring inventory writedowns, severance and facilities closures, and $7 million in FX losses in Argentina. GAAP net loss for the quarter was $1.5 billion or $4.06 per fully diluted share. 
Fourth quarter 2015 revenues were $2.7 billion, down 18% from the third quarter of 2015. Operating profit for the quarter was $141 million or 5.2% of sales, and EBITDA was $308 million or 11.3% of sales, excluding other items from both. Decremental operating leverage was 35% from the third quarter to the fourth. 
Our management teams across our business units are responding quickly to lower revenues, which fell further than we expected in the fourth quarter, by reducing costs and accelerating restructuring plans, which enabled us to hold decremental leverage to 35% ex charges despite the sharp volume decline and renewed intense pricing pressure we are seeing. As we have stated for the past few quarters, our focus is to manage what we can, namely costs, while continuing to advance our longer-term strategic goals. It, nevertheless, remains a very challenging time for everyone in the oil and gas industry, and our visibility remains limited. 
For its full year 2015, National Oilwell Varco posted a GAAP loss of $1.99 per fully diluted share, including restructuring, asset impairments, facility closure costs and other charges of $2 billion pretax. Excluding these items, earnings were $2.80 per fully diluted share, down 54% from $6.07 per fully diluted share earned in 2014. Operating profit was $1.6 billion or 11.1% of revenue, and EBITDA was $2.3 billion or 15.5% of revenue for the full year, excluding charges. Decremental operating leverage was 32% from 2014 to 2015, excluding charges from both years, a commendable result in view of the severe downturn and pricing pressures we faced throughout the year. 
Cash flow from operations for 2015 totaled $1.3 billion with $614 million of that coming in the fourth quarter with improving working capital liquidation. We continued to invest in our future, closing 7 acquisitions through the year, which, among other benefits, enhanced our presence in Saudi Arabia, our wellsite services offering in Asia and brought in new composites technology. We continued developing new products with our new test rig, which we spudded at the beginning of the year. We also continued investments in the world's most promising regions, adding new facilities in Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi, Russia and West Texas. We returned $2.9 billion to shareholders in 2015 through dividends and share repurchases. 
With regards to cost, we were able to manage to good decremental operating leverage on our 31% decline in revenues, ex charges, by close attention to costs and efficiency. We insourced tens of thousands of hours from outside suppliers to our own workforce to preserve our team wherever possible. Nevertheless, our global workforce, including contract labor, declined 21% through the year, and we closed 75 facilities since mid-2014 to retrench to a smaller, more efficient footprint. We expect restructuring will continue through the first half of 2016, perhaps longer in view of the challenging market. 
A second major decline in oil prices last year deepened and intensified late during the fourth quarter and continued throughout January when oil traded into the high $20 range, levels not seen since 2003. This, combined with hedges rolling off for E&Ps and term contracts expiring for drilling contractors, ratcheted up financial stress on our customers and increased pricing pressure on NOV. 
We believe the present level of activity is insufficient to supply the longer-term demand for oil, and note that unlike the 3 most recent downturns through the past 20 years, OPEC has not curtailed production to defend pricing. This has made the present downturn far more severe but will perhaps lead to a sharper eventual recovery. 
With producers pumping furiously to maximize their cash flow; the relentless march of depletion; the deferral of 68 projects, representing 3 million barrels of oil per day of planned future production; and the unfolding of severe capital austerity will help bring supply and demand into balance, but we are not planning for a recovery in 2016. Instead, we will continue to manage costs to the reality of the marketplace in the short term. Even with a rebound in oil prices, it will take time for our customers to repair balance sheets, reactivate crews and to ramp up the activity that drives our business. But each day that passes means we are a day closer to the inevitable rebound. Our plan is to emerge with new products, new business models and new efficiencies. 
Our Completion & Production Solutions segment fell 7% sequentially in the fourth quarter and posted 56% sequential decremental operating leverage, excluding restructuring and other items. Orders declined from 99% book-to-bill in the third quarter to 59% in the fourth, which led backlog down to $969 million at year-end. Strong sequential improvements in our XL Systems conductor pipe connections unit in the fourth quarter capped off a solid year for this unit with higher year-over-year margins. However, these failed to fully offset sequential double-digit declines in our other products within the segment. 
In North America, customers delayed picking up well stimulation equipment previously ordered, and some are now buying frac spreads at distressed pricing to use for spare parts, which further reduced sales but will ultimately help erode the equipment overhang. 
In North America, sales of spares and consumables like coiled tubing declined with reduced activity, but the FSU and the Middle East remain comparably strong. 
Sales of composite oilfield pipe declined as the costs of competing steel flowlines have plummeted 35% or more. And our sales into the marine construction markets slowed. Our value proposition for the composite pipe that we manufacture is much lower lifetime costs due to its corrosion resistance but E&Ps under duress are opting for the lowest investment option to bring on wells and their associated cash flow. About 20% of the segment's mix is in production equipment -- pumps, separators and artificial lift -- which also fell in the quarter as distributors slowed purchases. We have 6 major facility consolidations underway within this business unit, which will drive better efficiency going forward. 
Within our offshore production-related businesses, we saw rising pricing pressure on flexible pipe, but we're pleased to post 111% book-to-bill as we landed some significant orders for pre-salt applications in Brazil. Our floating production vessel unit continues to pioneer new business models we launched a few years ago that leverage NOV's unique vessel construction capabilities to improve construction costs and reduce risk. 
Our new vessel concepts, which seek to accelerate production from certain types of deepwater fields, are being met with high enthusiasm from our customers so far. We are encouraged by new designs that are steadily whittling costs, but operators remain slow to sanction major deepwater projects. It is, nevertheless, a promising target with 400 discoveries in the offshore. 
Our Wellbore Technologies segment revenues fell 9% sequentially in the fourth quarter and posted 69% sequential decremental operating leverage, which resulted in a negative 4.1% operating margin, excluding restructuring and other items. EBITDA margins were 9% for the segment ex other items. 2/3 of the sequential decline in revenue came from North America, where operators stacked major drilling programs, intensifying pricing pressures and reducing volumes. Rentals of solids control equipment, rig instrumentation and downhole equipment declined at high variable margins. Nevertheless, we were able to increase share in our bits business owing to new Tektonic designs, which we are successfully packaging with our ERT drilling motors. 
In the FSU, we expect to begin production in our downhole tools facility at our new Kostroma plant within a few weeks to supply the local market, which, along with Asia, posted higher sequential revenues in the fourth quarter. Latin America saw a significant decline for the segment across Brazil, Mexico and Argentina. 
Our Tuboscope pipe coating business held up well through the quarter on drillpipe strength in China, but pipe-mill inspection activity in North America declined with 9 months of casing on the ground, the highest level of inventory seen since the 1980s. Rising activity around tubing, pipeline and linepipe helped offset this somewhat, but we are even seeing working -- workover activity fall in West Texas, which is unusual. Prior downturns have seen workover activity hold up better owing to quick paybacks. Drillpipe sales increased modestly from the third quarter into the fourth quarter but still remain low and under price pressure. 
Growing operator interest in closed-loop automated drilling technology drove higher revenues for our IntelliServ wire drillpipe unit in the fourth quarter to produce solid year-over-year improvements for the group. This innovative service grew sixfold in 2015 as compared to 2014, and we have lots of interest from E&Ps as well as drilling contractors eager to differentiate their rigs by enabling high-speed data transmission from the bottom of the hole through their drillpipe. 
Our Rig Aftermarket segment posted flat sequential revenues, but margins fell due to mix. A decline in spare parts sales was offset by higher repair revenues, which came in at lower margins partly due to rising discounts to win repair work. As rigs come down, particularly onshore, they're being cannibalized for parts, impacting our spares business for the quarter. 
SPS activity on offshore rigs rolled over in the fourth quarter but remains active nonetheless. The Rig Aftermarket segment is actively working on about 40 projects either underway or in the bidding stage, but these are fluid as drilling contractors are curtailing scope or, in some instances, electing not to proceed with an SPS without a clear line of sight on a contract for the rig. Service and repair work in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico improved sequentially for Rig Aftermarket, and BOP repair work in the Middle East remains strong. 
Rig Systems revenues fell 32% at 24% decrementals in the fourth quarter driven by sharply lower shipments at a backlog. Customers are delaying acceptance of uncontracted newbuilds to avoid stacking costs and to slow their CapEx as they face falling day rates and utilization as their contracts roll off. Revenues from new offshore rig construction fell to about 20% of our consolidated revenue mix in the fourth quarter. We are working closely with our shipyard customers to navigate challenges and requests for delays and to improve our collections, but these situations remain fluid. At this point we expect revenues out of backlog for all of 2016 to total about $2.1 billion or $2.2 billion. Rig Systems saw a 76% decline in new orders in the fourth quarter, which fell to $89 million and totaled $1 billion for the full year. 
Quoting activity plummeted late in the year, and while we still see interest for new land rigs for the Middle East and some other selected markets, we expect orders to again be very low for the first quarter. Importantly, we expect the land rig market to eventually resume its efforts to retool to more efficient AC technology, but the fourth quarter downturn in day rates for Tier 1 rigs will certainly delay that trend. 
As we disclosed in December, we reached a confidential settlement with one of our shipyard customers in Brazil to cancel 7 floating rigs being constructed there, which reduced our backlog by nearly $1.2 billion and led to a year-end backlog of $6.1 billion for all of Rig Solutions segment. At year-end, that backlog includes $1.75 billion for the remaining 15 rigs across 3 shipyards in Brazil. I would stress that the situation in Brazil with regards to these remains uncertain and continues to evolve owing to the failure of our shipyard customers -- customer to secure long-term financing for these projects. 
We suspended work within 2 of these remaining 3 shipyards early last year, and we are in discussions with all 3 yards regarding the resolution of their programs. We recognized only $10 million in revenues from the remaining newbuild rigs in Brazil during the fourth quarter of 2015. 
As we wrap up a challenging year in 2015, we recognize we are facing increasing headwinds in 2016, but we also recognize that extraordinary opportunities will arise as a result of the stress our industry is under. I'm pleased with the execution of our experienced leaders, who are cutting costs and improving efficiency but also continuing to advance our long-term strategic initiatives like closed-loop automated drilling opportunities, which we expect to grow in 2016; new FPSO business models and designs to improve deepwater economics; and new products to improve drilling operations, completion techniques and more profitable production. Our E&P customers' business models simply don't work in this low oil price environment, and therein lies the opportunity for NOV to once again pioneer new, more efficient ways of extracting oil and gas to reduce their cost. 
Importantly, NOV represents a diverse portfolio of market leaders that participate in every major oilfield market around the globe. If we examine the major global sources of oil which make up the 90-plus million barrels of oil per day global industry, we see 10 million barrels of oil per day coming out of each of Saudi Arabia and Russia, both areas where we have invested heavily through the past few years with our investments continuing to support relatively high levels of activity. Another 10 million barrels of oil per day comes from the Gulf States, where, again, we are expanding our presence and the oilfield remains comparatively busy. Nearly 10 million barrels per day has been achieved from deepwater production, where we have benefited disproportionately from the deepwater and offshore rigs we have built and expect to pioneer better methods of production in the future. Another 10 million barrels per day, roughly, comes from North America, which is dominated by shale production techniques. Each of these major productive areas has been enabled by NOV technology, and we continue to help our customers adapt to lower oil prices across them all. 
NOV remains well positioned globally for when the eventual recovery comes, wherever it shows up first. Our leading market positions have been assembled through a combination of organic investments and acquisitions, and we're actively pursuing several targets now. It has been challenging and sometimes frustrating to reach agreement with potential sellers, but as the downturn lengthens, everybody in this space is becoming a lot more realistic. We remain patient and disciplined on values and realistic in our outlook as the option value of our capital flexibility steadily rises. 
I am pleased that NOV has the balance sheet and financial resources to pursue these, but I am more pleased that we have tough, capable, experienced managers who can skillfully integrate acquisitions and execute our business plans. To all the NOV employees, I congratulate you for navigating such a challenging year in 2015, and I thank you for your contributions in building such a strong enterprise. We have a tough road ahead, but we are laying the groundwork for our future success. Jose?"
31900,315624280,925755,"National Oilwell Varco, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2016",2016-02-03,"Earnings Calls","NOV Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Clay. I'll next provide some additional detail on our segment operating results for the fourth quarter and full year 2015 and provide some commentary on the near-term outlook. Our Rig Systems segment generated revenue of $1.0 billion, down 32",2203,"Thank you, Clay. I'll next provide some additional detail on our segment operating results for the fourth quarter and full year 2015 and provide some commentary on the near-term outlook. 
Our Rig Systems segment generated revenue of $1.0 billion, down 32% from the $1.5 billion earned last quarter and down 60% from the $2.6 billion generated in the fourth quarter of 2014. For the fourth quarter, the split between offshore and land-related revenue was 73% and 27%, respectively. Revenue out of backlog was $843 million, down 35% sequentially. 
As Clay indicated, sliding delivery schedules and limited new-order intake have contributed to the decline in revenue. You may recall that in the first quarter of 2015 we announced we were negotiating certain customer-requested delivery delays for offshore newbuild rigs. Although not our first choice, modifying delivery schedules allowed us to better manage our cost structure and level loading across our operations as we began sizing our business to support reduced levels of demand. The success of our cost management measures are seen in our decremental operating profit margins, which were 23.9% on a 32% sequential revenue decline, and which were 22.7% on a 60% year-over-year revenue decline. 
Fourth quarter operating profit for the Rig Systems segment was $160 million, yielding operating margins of 15.8%, down 260 basis points from Q3. EBITDA was $184 million or 18.1% of sales, and EBITDA margins decreased 200 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2015. 
During the fourth quarter, we received $89 million in new orders resulting in a book-to-bill of 10%. Q4 bookings were composed entirely of discrete pieces of capital equipment as we received no new rig orders in the quarter. 
Bookings included top drives and blowout preventers for international land rigs and cranes for offshore construction vessels. We ended the quarter with a backlog of $6.1 billion, down 24% sequentially, of which approximately 89% is for the offshore market and 92% is destined for international markets. 
As Clay mentioned in his commentary, our customers are under increasing pressures related to falling day rates and utilization associated with the cyclical downturn. Our global portfolio of offshore rig equipment contracts typically incorporate a significant down payment and progress payments, which minimize our working capital investments throughout the life of the agreement. While we do not expect meaningful charges from potential future breaches of contracts, cancellations or other similar issues, the impact would vary dependent upon the specific contract, timing of the event and other circumstances. 
For full year 2015, Rig Systems generated revenue of $7 billion, down 29% in comparison to 2014 as slowing project progress and declining orders drove revenue out of backlog down $2.6 billion from the $8.7 billion earned in 2014. With a resolute focus on execution and a commitment to continued cost reductions, Rig Systems generated $1.4 billion in full year EBITDA and maintained EBITDA margins just over 20% despite revenues declining almost 30% over the same period. Full year 2015 operating profit was $1.3 billion or 18.9% of revenue, down 140 basis points from the previous year, representing decremental leverage of 23.5%. 
As we move into the first quarter of 2016, at this point, we expect Rig Systems revenue to decline in the high single-digit percentage range and revenue out of backlog to decrease to around $775 million, but I'll stress that our visibility remains limited. We plan to deliver on our current backlog while continuing to resize the business aggressively to meet a much lower level of demand. We're actively scaling facilities to single shifts, consolidating locations and implementing other cost control initiatives. Despite these efforts, reduced volumes will work against us, and we anticipate some margin erosion on lower activity levels and continued delays in the range of 200 to 300 basis points. 
Declining energy prices will negatively impact our order book for the foreseeable future, and we expect new orders for large equipment packages, both on and offshore, to remain low. We continue to win in the marketplace due to our commitment to technology, capacity, and operational service and support, but orders are scarce. As such, we do not expect this quarter's bookings to improve materially from the fourth quarter. 
Our Rig Aftermarket segment generated $569 million of revenue during the fourth quarter of 2015, roughly flat sequentially and down 33% year-over-year from a record $850 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Customers curtailed spending as rig utilization declined in both land and offshore markets. Land-related sales were approximately 21% of total segment revenue, down slightly from 22% in Q3 but up on a percentage basis from 18% in the fourth quarter of 2014. EBITDA for the segment was $135 million or 23.7% of sales, and operating profit was $127 million or 22.3% of sales, down 330 basis points from last quarter on higher proportion [ph] of lower-margin service and repair work as well as incremental pricing pressure on repair and select spare parts. 
Overall, 2015 results reflected an increasingly uncertain environment in which our drilling contractor customers reduced spending in an effort to preserve liquidity. Throughout the year, our customers chose to deplete existing spares inventories rather than pursue new and did de minimis repair work and maintenance on their rig fleets, deferring more expansive work except where absolutely necessary.  
For the full year, Rig Aftermarket generated revenue of $2.5 billion, down 22% from a record 2014. For full year, EBITDA was $647 million or 25.7% of revenue, down 250 basis points from 2014. And 2015 operating profit was $617 million or 24.5% of sales, down 290 basis points from the prior year. 
Looking into the first quarter of 2016, we expect Rig Aftermarket will see revenues decline in the mid- to upper teens percent range. Due to the seasonal nature of the aftermarket business, we typically expect lower activity with a better mix of spares to service and repair work in the first quarter than in the fourth. However, we anticipate a steeper-than-usual decline in Q1, reflecting current market conditions. Although reducing costs will be at the forefront of our response efforts, pricing pressure may push margins around 100 basis points lower in the first quarter. Longer term, we believe our Rig Aftermarket segment will be a strong early cycle beneficiary of the eventual recovery. We believe drillers will rush to return suboptimally maintained, stacked, partially cannibalized rigs to proper operating condition once they gain confidence that the market has reached a bottom and they see early indications of a recovery. 
For the fourth quarter of 2015, the Wellbore Technologies segment generated revenues of $757 million, down 9% sequentially from $834 million and down 50% from a record $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014. Reduced drilling activity negatively impacted all of our businesses within the segment. Average rig counts declined by 13% sequentially in the U.S., 9% in Canada, and 2%, internationally. And segment revenue by geography closely mirrored the sequential fall in rig count. 
Pricing pressure continued into the fourth quarter across most all product lines. For the fourth quarter of 2015, EBITDA was $68 million or 9% of revenue, down 530 basis points from last quarter, and the segment posted an operating loss of $31 million. 
For the full year 2015, Wellbore Technologies generated revenue of $3.7 billion, down 35% in comparison to 2014. Consistent with the year-over-year average decline in global rig count, 2015 EBITDA for the segment was $562 million or 15.1% of revenue, down from 26% in 2014, and operating profit was $162 million for 2015 or 4.4% of sales as the speed of activity and revenue decline outpaced our reduction efforts. 
Like our Rig Aftermarket business, we expect our Wellbore Technologies segment to be an early cycle beneficiary of the eventual recovery. However, near term, we have limited visibility, and the activity-driven nature of the business contributes to variability. Just 4 weeks into 2016, U.S. rig count is down 18% from the average in Q4 of 2015. So we expect revenues to fall 8% to 10% with decremental margins in the 40% range. 
We continue our efforts to optimize our Wellbore Technologies segment, resizing our business to meet lower levels of demand, improving our manufacturing processes to become more efficient on a lower cost base and shortening our commercialization processes to bring new value-adding technologies to market. 
Our Completion & Production Solutions segment generated revenues of $746 million for the fourth quarter of 2015, down 7% sequentially and 44% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. Businesses related to onshore completion and production were some of the most negatively impacted with customers delaying receipt of finished orders as operators' inventory of drilled but uncompleted wells rose in response to commodity price declines. EBITDA for the segment was $86 million or 11.5% of sales, and operating profit for the segment was $34 million resulting in operating margins of 4.6%, down 330 basis points sequentially at 1,160 basis points year-over-year as a result of lower volumes and pricing pressure. 
During the quarter, Completion & Production Solutions received orders of $272 million, down $194 million or 42% sequentially as a substantial flexible pipe order won in the third quarter did not repeat. We recognized $460 million of revenue out of backlog, resulting in a book-to-bill of 59%. Segment ended the quarter with a backlog balance of $969 million, of which approximately 75% is offshore and 87% is destined for international markets. 
For full year 2015, the segment generated revenue of $3.4 billion, down 28% in comparison to 2014 as revenue out of backlog declined $501 million or 20%, and nonbacklog revenue decreased 37% from 2014 to $1.3 billion. Full year EBITDA was $507 million or 15.1% of revenue, down 480 basis points from 2014. Operating profit was $286 million or 8.5% of revenue in comparison to $700 million and 15.1% in 2014, representing decremental leverage of 32.3%. Record or near-record margins in some of our offshore production-related businesses, including flexibles and large-diameter XL Systems conductor pipe connections, were overshadowed by lower year-over-year contributions from our higher-margin intervention and stimulation equipment businesses, given reduced demand for hydraulic stimulation, coiled tubing and wireline capital equipment and consumables. 
With oil at 12-year lows, orders for new capital equipment will remain challenged as we move into the first quarter of 2016. Opportunities that do emerge will face continued pricing pressure. As a result, we anticipate revenues will decrease by approximately 15% and expect revenue out of backlog to fall to the $350 million to $370 million range. We anticipate decremental operating leverage in the 30% to 35% range. 
Now let's discuss some additional detail regarding our consolidated financial results. Working down the consolidated statement of income for the fourth quarter of 2015, gross margin declined 210 basis points to 19.1%. SG&A increased $25 million or 7% sequentially due in large part to increases in bad debt and other year-end related items, which more than offset overhead reductions. Despite the slight sequential increase, we reduced SG&A 28% year-over-year, which translates into an annualized cost savings of approximately $600 million. Other items for the quarter equaled $1.8 billion and resulted primarily from goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset writedowns of $1.6 billion, and restructuring and other charges of $139 million. 
EBITDA was $308 million or 11.3% of sales. Net interest expense remained flat for the third quarter, and equity income was a loss of $3 million as demand for OCTGs or Green Tubing associated with our Voest-Alpine joint venture remains muted given the low demand for new drillpipe. 
Other expense for the quarter decreased $3 million sequentially to $17 million, and the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter, excluding the impact of other items, was 18.7%, affected by a taxable loss in the U.S. and taxable income in foreign jurisdictions, among other things. 
Net income, excluding other items, was $85 million or $0.23 per fully diluted share. Working capital, excluding cash and debt, totaled $5.5 billion at December 31, 2015, down $422 million from the prior quarter. We generated a total of $614 million in cash flow from operations. After dividend payments of $173 million, investments in our business of $136 million, and FX impact on our cash balances and other items totaling $18 million, we were able to decrease our net debt position by $287 million during the quarter. 
We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.1 billion, $4 billion in debt, and our net debt to capitalization was 11.2%. We also have $3.6 billion of undrawn capacity on our revolving credit facility. 
Overall, 2015 was a challenging year under the backdrop of market uncertainty, falling energy prices, declining drilling activity and reduced customer spending. In spite of these conditions, NOV generated $1.3 billion in cash flow from operations, bought back 2.2 billion in our shares, paid out cash dividends of $710 million to our shareholders, invested over $450 million in organic growth opportunities and completed 7 acquisitions for approximately $85 million all while preserving a very strong balance sheet. 2016 will prove to be another challenging year. However, the actions we took during 2015 have positioned us well to weather the storm and capitalize on opportunities that we identify during this down cycle. 
Now let me turn it back to Clay."

So things remain fluid. But to your original question, what's the right balance. I got to tell you one of the really necessary skillsets oilfield services for those of us that have been in it a while is the ability to flex up sharply when called upon and flex down sharply when called upon. And good news for NOV is we have a very experienced management team running our business units around the globe. They know how to do this. We've been called on in the past to double and triple and quadruple production over a short period of time, and we successfully navigated that very well and maximized profitability and returns through that. This is the flip side of that. As orders fall away, as spending comes to the screeching halt, we have to cut costs in lockstep. So I have an abundance of confidence in the capabilities of this team to do both, to respond to this market that's slowing down dramatically as well as speed up and flex upwards when we're eventually called upon to do that."

To recap some of the liquidity items that Jose mentioned just a moment ago: $2.1 billion cash balance; $5.5 billion of working capital, which has begun liquidating; a $3.6 billion revolving line of credit. So we have a lot of capital flexibility. We stepped up our efforts as we talked about on prior calls to be very vigorous in looking for opportunities to deploy capital in what we see is becoming more of a buyers market. And so we're pretty, pretty excited about that and have a lot of flexibility to pursue those. As you know, we really fundamentally pursue competitive advantage and really fundamentally pursue evolving trends that we see in the oilfield as attractive areas to deploy capital. So specifically, I think in my comments just a moment ago, I mentioned places like Saudi Arabia, which is committed to increasing activity. They want more local content. We've talked a lot in the past about areas like the FSU, where we've done more organic investment than acquisitions. But that's an area of interest. Argentina. The excitement around the Vaca Muerta shale, which was down in Q4, but longer term, we're pretty excited about the potential there.

We were disappointed in the fourth quarter that our revenue out of backlog fell so sharply. It fell about $460 million sequentially out of Rig Systems, a couple hundred million short of what our expectations were for the fourth quarter. And that's due precisely to what you highlighted with regards to drilling contractors really getting more aggressive on trying to delay acceptance of rigs and push them back. As you know, the food chain that we work within, drilling contractors sign up for the construction of these new rigs, the shipyards are their customers, and then we work for the shipyards. We've been very diligent over the years about demanding very strong contracts, very strong down payments, progress billings and the like, but given our focus on monetizing the profit in that backlog, we have slowed our progress on revenue out of backlog to sort of match -- better match payments and to minimize our working capital exposure in those programs. So that's kind of what you saw in the fourth quarter is we slowed down that revenue recognition out of backlog. Ultimately, it's really caused by a lot of drillers trying to delay acceptance of rigs. A couple of situations I think have been made public and a couple of situations remain a little tense. Contributing to that was the one shipyard we continued working for in Brazil also slowed in the fourth quarter. I mentioned in my call that we only did $10 million in revenue out of Brazil. And so progress on that particular program slowed as well. So really across the board, things have slowed down. It remains fluid. We've haircut our guidance for revenue out of backlog into Q1 and are working to respond to the market kind of week by week as we see things unfolding."

And we certainly saw that during the quarter offset by continued decline in orders for higher-margin spare parts. As we go into Q1, essentially, during the course of Q4, we saw, obviously, quick deterioration in a number of the other product offerings, spare parts included. And so we're expecting a good falloff, not only in that sort of seasonal associated service and repair work but also continuing falloff in spares. As I mentioned in my commentary, this is a business that we're certainly excited about for the future as it is tightly tied to the front end of the cycle, and we really do believe that once there are some glimmers of hope out there, things stabilize a little bit, our customers can call bottom and start seeing any sort of optimism to gain some confidence, there'll be a rush to deliver new orders, which will result in a nice pickup for us. The exact timing of that is really difficult to say. We're obviously in an environment where there's very little near-term visibility.

Well, their lower costs equal our lower Rig Aftermarket revenues. They've slowed down spare parts purchases, or as we talked about before, cannibalizing. They're deferring maintenance wherever possible. I think it's safe to say that no piece of capital equipment across the oilfield globally is being well maintained right now. And what that sets up for the future is when activity does turn, when we find bottom and then it starts to go up, is a lot of work for our Rig Aftermarket folks to repair, to maintain, to replenish spare parts. And so the deeper this goes and the longer this goes, I think, the sharper the rebound and the more positive the rebound."

But also elsewhere around the globe where they're more interested in being involved in the selection of the bottom-hole assemblies that go into their complex directional drilling.

Having optionality in the capital structure in this current environment is becoming more and more valuable day-by-day, and we're also seeing a narrowing of the bid-and-ask spreads on some compelling acquisition opportunities coming forward. So as we think about capital allocation, for us, it's really all about ultimately driving maximum value to the shareholders. So obviously, historically, organic investment has been a very good use of capital in the current environment when we're overcapacitized. M&A tends to be front and center in our minds. And everything is going to be opportunity specific, outlook dependent in terms of how we think about using the capital structure related to M&A and our other capital requirements. So I don't want to get into any sort of specifics on ratios, et cetera. But I think the company has historically maintained a fairly conservative balance sheet, and we intend to keep it that way.

What are the trends in the oilfield? Where can we drive better industry structure? Where can we offer a better package of products and services for our customers? And it's really a little more granular than trying to globally arrive at some sort of diversified portfolio mix. I think we've ended up at a very diversified portfolio mix already, but at the end of the day, this is a -- business is about making money, right. So where can we put capital in into an opportunity, get that capital back as quickly as possible, i.e., get a quick payback and a good return and really do something different to drive higher capital returns in an industry where we've all spent our careers, and I think have a lot of insight into, which is global oilfield services at-large. So that's kind of our approach to M&A and looking for those sorts of opportunities. And honestly, Jose and Loren, I wish we could tell you more this morning, but as you understand, these things are never a deal until they're a deal. We are enthusiastic about what we're starting to see out there, and again, great to have a lot of balance sheet flexibility and capacity. And I think there's a lot of optionality right now embedded in NOV."

31900,315624280,926029,"National Oilwell Varco, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2016",2016-02-03,"Earnings Calls","NOV Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Loren. National Oilwell Varco faced deteriorating market conditions during the fourth quarter to cap off a very challenging year. The company reported fourth quarter net income of $85 million or $0.23 per fully diluted share, excluding other it",2552,"Thank you, Loren. National Oilwell Varco faced deteriorating market conditions during the fourth quarter to cap off a very challenging year. The company reported fourth quarter net income of $85 million or $0.23 per fully diluted share, excluding other items, down from $0.61 per fully diluted share in the third quarter of 2015 on a comparable basis. Other items included pretax charges of $1.6 billion in goodwill and intangible asset impairments, $139 million in restructuring inventory write-downs, severance and facilities closures, and $7 million in FX losses in Argentina. GAAP net loss for the quarter was $1.5 billion or $4.06 per fully diluted share. 
Fourth quarter 2015 revenues were $2.7 billion, down 18% from the third quarter of 2015. Operating profit for the quarter was $141 million or 5.2% of sales, and EBITDA was $308 million or 11.3% of sales, excluding other items from both. Decremental operating leverage was 35% from the third quarter to the fourth. 
Our management teams across our business units are responding quickly to lower revenues, which fell further than we expected in the fourth quarter, by reducing costs and accelerating restructuring plans, which enabled us to hold decremental leverage to 35% ex charges despite the sharp volume decline and renewed intense pricing pressure we are seeing. As we have stated for the past few quarters, our focus is to manage what we can, namely costs, while continuing to advance our longer-term strategic goals. It, nevertheless, remains a very challenging time for everyone in the oil and gas industry, and our visibility remains limited. 
For its full year 2015, National Oilwell Varco posted a GAAP loss of $1.99 per fully diluted share, including restructuring, asset impairments, facility closure costs and other charges of $2 billion pretax. Excluding these items, earnings were $2.80 per fully diluted share, down 54% from $6.07 per fully diluted share earned in 2014. Operating profit was $1.6 billion or 11.1% of revenue, and EBITDA was $2.3 billion or 15.5% of revenue for the full year, excluding charges. Decremental operating leverage was 32% from 2014 to 2015, excluding charges from both years, a commendable result in view of the severe downturn and pricing pressures we faced throughout the year. 
Cash flow from operations for 2015 totaled $1.3 billion with $614 million of that coming in the fourth quarter with improving working capital liquidation. We continued to invest in our future, closing 7 acquisitions through the year, which, among other benefits, enhanced our presence in Saudi Arabia, our wellsite services offering in Asia and brought in new composites technology. We continued developing new products with our new test rig, which we spudded at the beginning of the year. We also continued investments in the world's most promising regions, adding new facilities in Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi, Russia and West Texas. We returned $2.9 billion to shareholders in 2015 through dividends and share repurchases. 
With regards to cost, we were able to manage to good decremental operating leverage on our 31% decline in revenues, ex charges, by close attention to costs and efficiency. We insourced tens of thousands of hours from outside suppliers to our own workforce to preserve our team wherever possible. Nevertheless, our global workforce, including contract labor, declined 21% through the year, and we closed 75 facilities since mid-2014 to retrench to a smaller, more efficient footprint. We expect restructuring will continue through the first half of 2016, perhaps longer in view of the challenging market. 
A second major decline in oil prices last year deepened and intensified late during the fourth quarter and continued throughout January when oil traded into the high $20 range, levels not seen since 2003. This, combined with hedges rolling off for E&Ps and term contracts expiring for drilling contractors, ratcheted up financial stress on our customers and increased pricing pressure on NOV. 
We believe the present level of activity is insufficient to supply the longer-term demand for oil, and note that unlike the 3 most recent downturns through the past 20 years, OPEC has not curtailed production to defend pricing. This has made the present downturn far more severe but will perhaps lead to a sharper eventual recovery. 
With producers pumping furiously to maximize their cash flow; the relentless march of depletion; the deferral of 68 projects, representing 3 million barrels of oil per day of planned future production; and the unfolding of severe capital austerity will help bring supply and demand into balance, but we are not planning for a recovery in 2016. Instead, we will continue to manage costs to the reality of the marketplace in the short term. Even with a rebound in oil prices, it will take time for our customers to repair balance sheets, reactivate crews and to ramp up the activity that drives our business. But each day that passes means we are a day closer to the inevitable rebound. Our plan is to emerge with new products, new business models and new efficiencies. 
Our Completion & Production Solutions segment fell 7% sequentially in the fourth quarter and posted 56% sequential decremental operating leverage, excluding restructuring and other items. Orders declined from 99% book-to-bill in the third quarter to 59% in the fourth, which led backlog down to $969 million at year-end. Strong sequential improvements in our XL Systems conductor pipe connections unit in the fourth quarter capped off a solid year for this unit with higher year-over-year margins. However, these failed to fully offset sequential double-digit declines in our other products within the segment. 
In North America, customers delayed picking up well stimulation equipment previously ordered, and some are now buying frac spreads at distressed pricing to use for spare parts, which further reduced sales but will ultimately help erode the equipment overhang. 
In North America, sales of spares and consumables like coiled tubing declined with reduced activity, but the FSU and the Middle East remain comparably strong. 
Sales of composite oilfield pipe declined as the costs of competing steel flowlines have plummeted 35% or more. And our sales into the marine construction markets slowed. Our value proposition for the composite pipe that we manufacture is much lower lifetime costs due to its corrosion resistance but E&Ps under duress are opting for the lowest investment option to bring on wells and their associated cash flow. About 20% of the segment's mix is in production equipment -- pumps, separators and artificial lift -- which also fell in the quarter as distributors slowed purchases. We have 6 major facility consolidations underway within this business unit, which will drive better efficiency going forward. 
Within our offshore production-related businesses, we saw rising pricing pressure on flexible pipe, but we're pleased to post 111% book-to-bill as we landed some significant orders for pre-salt applications in Brazil. Our floating production vessel unit continues to pioneer new business models we launched a few years ago that leverage NOV's unique vessel construction capabilities to improve construction costs and reduce risk. 
Our new vessel concepts, which seek to accelerate production from certain types of deepwater fields, are being met with high enthusiasm from our customers so far. We are encouraged by new designs that are steadily whittling costs, but operators remain slow to sanction major deepwater projects. It is, nevertheless, a promising target with 400 discoveries in the offshore. 
Our Wellbore Technologies segment revenues fell 9% sequentially in the fourth quarter and posted 69% sequential decremental operating leverage, which resulted in a negative 4.1% operating margin, excluding restructuring and other items. EBITDA margins were 9% for the segment ex other items. 2/3 of the sequential decline in revenue came from North America, where operators stacked major drilling programs, intensifying pricing pressures and reducing volumes. Rentals of solids control equipment, rig instrumentation and downhole equipment declined at high variable margins. Nevertheless, we were able to increase share in our bits business owing to new Tektonic designs, which we are successfully packaging with our ERT drilling motors. 
In the FSU, we expect to begin production in our downhole tools facility at our new Kostroma plant within a few weeks to supply the local market, which, along with Asia, posted higher sequential revenues in the fourth quarter. Latin America saw a significant decline for the segment across Brazil, Mexico and Argentina. 
Our Tuboscope pipe coating business held up well through the quarter on drillpipe strength in China, but pipe-mill inspection activity in North America declined with 9 months of casing on the ground, the highest level of inventory seen since the 1980s. Rising activity around tubing, pipeline and linepipe helped offset this somewhat, but we are even seeing working -- workover activity fall in West Texas, which is unusual. Prior downturns have seen workover activity hold up better owing to quick paybacks. Drillpipe sales increased modestly from the third quarter into the fourth quarter but still remain low and under price pressure. 
Growing operator interest in closed-loop automated drilling technology drove higher revenues for our IntelliServ wire drillpipe unit in the fourth quarter to produce solid year-over-year improvements for the group. This innovative service grew sixfold in 2015 as compared to 2014, and we have lots of interest from E&Ps as well as drilling contractors eager to differentiate their rigs by enabling high-speed data transmission from the bottom of the hole through their drillpipe. 
Our Rig Aftermarket segment posted flat sequential revenues, but margins fell due to mix. A decline in spare parts sales was offset by higher repair revenues, which came in at lower margins partly due to rising discounts to win repair work. As rigs come down, particularly onshore, they're being cannibalized for parts, impacting our spares business for the quarter. 
SPS activity on offshore rigs rolled over in the fourth quarter but remains active nonetheless. The Rig Aftermarket segment is actively working on about 40 projects either underway or in the bidding stage, but these are fluid as drilling contractors are curtailing scope or, in some instances, electing not to proceed with an SPS without a clear line of sight on a contract for the rig. Service and repair work in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico improved sequentially for Rig Aftermarket, and BOP repair work in the Middle East remains strong. 
Rig Systems revenues fell 32% at 24% decrementals in the fourth quarter driven by sharply lower shipments at a backlog. Customers are delaying acceptance of uncontracted newbuilds to avoid stacking costs and to slow their CapEx as they face falling day rates and utilization as their contracts roll off. Revenues from new offshore rig construction fell to about 20% of our consolidated revenue mix in the fourth quarter. We are working closely with our shipyard customers to navigate challenges and requests for delays and to improve our collections, but these situations remain fluid. At this point we expect revenues out of backlog for all of 2016 to total about $2.1 billion or $2.2 billion. Rig Systems saw a 76% decline in new orders in the fourth quarter, which fell to $89 million and totaled $1 billion for the full year. 
Quoting activity plummeted late in the year, and while we still see interest for new land rigs for the Middle East and some other selected markets, we expect orders to again be very low for the first quarter. Importantly, we expect the land rig market to eventually resume its efforts to retool to more efficient AC technology, but the fourth quarter downturn in day rates for Tier 1 rigs will certainly delay that trend. 
As we disclosed in December, we reached a confidential settlement with one of our shipyard customers in Brazil to cancel 7 floating rigs being constructed there, which reduced our backlog by nearly $1.2 billion and led to a year-end backlog of $6.1 billion for all of Rig Solutions segment. At year-end, that backlog includes $1.75 billion for the remaining 15 rigs across 3 shipyards in Brazil. I would stress that the situation in Brazil with regards to these remains uncertain and continues to evolve owing to the failure of our shipyard customers -- customer to secure long-term financing for these projects. 
We suspended work within 2 of these remaining 3 shipyards early last year, and we are in discussions with all 3 yards regarding the resolution of their programs. We recognized only $10 million in revenues from the remaining newbuild rigs in Brazil during the fourth quarter of 2015. 
As we wrap up a challenging year in 2015, we recognize we are facing increasing headwinds in 2016, but we also recognize that extraordinary opportunities will arise as a result of the stress our industry is under. I'm pleased with the execution of our experienced leaders, who are cutting costs and improving efficiency but also continuing to advance our long-term strategic initiatives like closed-loop automated drilling opportunities, which we expect to grow in 2016; new FPSO business models and designs to improve deepwater economics; and new products to improve drilling operations, completion techniques and more profitable production. Our E&P customers' business models simply don't work in this low oil price environment, and therein lies the opportunity for NOV to once again pioneer new, more efficient ways of extracting oil and gas to reduce their cost. 
Importantly, NOV represents a diverse portfolio of market leaders that participate in every major oilfield market around the globe. If we examine the major global sources of oil which make up the 90-plus million barrels of oil per day global industry, we see 10 million barrels of oil per day coming out of each of Saudi Arabia and Russia, both areas where we have invested heavily through the past few years with our investments continuing to support relatively high levels of activity. Another 10 million barrels of oil per day comes from the Gulf States, where, again, we are expanding our presence and the oilfield remains comparatively busy. Nearly 10 million barrels per day has been achieved from deepwater production, where we have benefited disproportionately from the deepwater and offshore rigs we have built and expect to pioneer better methods of production in the future. Another 10 million barrels per day, roughly, comes from North America, which is dominated by shale production techniques. Each of these major productive areas has been enabled by NOV technology, and we continue to help our customers adapt to lower oil prices across them all. 
NOV remains well positioned globally for when the eventual recovery comes, wherever it shows up first. Our leading market positions have been assembled through a combination of organic investments and acquisitions, and we're actively pursuing several targets now. It has been challenging and sometimes frustrating to reach agreement with potential sellers, but as the downturn lengthens, everybody in this space is becoming a lot more realistic. We remain patient and disciplined on values and realistic in our outlook as the option value of our capital flexibility steadily rises. 
I am pleased that NOV has the balance sheet and financial resources to pursue these, but I am more pleased that we have tough, capable, experienced managers who can skillfully integrate acquisitions and execute our business plans. To all the NOV employees, I congratulate you for navigating such a challenging year in 2015, and I thank you for your contributions in building such a strong enterprise. We have a tough road ahead, but we are laying the groundwork for our future success. Jose?"
31900,315624280,926029,"National Oilwell Varco, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2016",2016-02-03,"Earnings Calls","NOV Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Clay. I'll next provide some additional detail on our segment operating results for the fourth quarter and full year 2015 and provide some commentary on the near-term outlook. Our Rig Systems segment generated revenue of $1.0 billion, down 32",2203,"Thank you, Clay. I'll next provide some additional detail on our segment operating results for the fourth quarter and full year 2015 and provide some commentary on the near-term outlook. 
Our Rig Systems segment generated revenue of $1.0 billion, down 32% from the $1.5 billion earned last quarter and down 60% from the $2.6 billion generated in the fourth quarter of 2014. For the fourth quarter, the split between offshore and land-related revenue was 73% and 27%, respectively. Revenue out of backlog was $843 million, down 35% sequentially. 
As Clay indicated, sliding delivery schedules and limited new-order intake have contributed to the decline in revenue. You may recall that in the first quarter of 2015 we announced we were negotiating certain customer-requested delivery delays for offshore newbuild rigs. Although not our first choice, modifying delivery schedules allowed us to better manage our cost structure and level loading across our operations as we began sizing our business to support reduced levels of demand. The success of our cost management measures are seen in our decremental operating profit margins, which were 23.9% on a 32% sequential revenue decline, and which were 22.7% on a 60% year-over-year revenue decline. 
Fourth quarter operating profit for the Rig Systems segment was $160 million, yielding operating margins of 15.8%, down 260 basis points from Q3. EBITDA was $184 million or 18.1% of sales, and EBITDA margins decreased 200 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2015. 
During the fourth quarter, we received $89 million in new orders resulting in a book-to-bill of 10%. Q4 bookings were composed entirely of discrete pieces of capital equipment as we received no new rig orders in the quarter. 
Bookings included top drives and blowout preventers for international land rigs and cranes for offshore construction vessels. We ended the quarter with a backlog of $6.1 billion, down 24% sequentially, of which approximately 89% is for the offshore market and 92% is destined for international markets. 
As Clay mentioned in his commentary, our customers are under increasing pressures related to falling day rates and utilization associated with the cyclical downturn. Our global portfolio of offshore rig equipment contracts typically incorporate a significant down payment and progress payments, which minimize our working capital investments throughout the life of the agreement. While we do not expect meaningful charges from potential future breaches of contracts, cancellations or other similar issues, the impact would vary dependent upon the specific contract, timing of the event and other circumstances. 
For full year 2015, Rig Systems generated revenue of $7 billion, down 29% in comparison to 2014 as slowing project progress and declining orders drove revenue out of backlog down $2.6 billion from the $8.7 billion earned in 2014. With a resolute focus on execution and a commitment to continued cost reductions, Rig Systems generated $1.4 billion in full year EBITDA and maintained EBITDA margins just over 20% despite revenues declining almost 30% over the same period. Full year 2015 operating profit was $1.3 billion or 18.9% of revenue, down 140 basis points from the previous year, representing decremental leverage of 23.5%. 
As we move into the first quarter of 2016, at this point, we expect Rig Systems revenue to decline in the high single-digit percentage range and revenue out of backlog to decrease to around $775 million, but I'll stress that our visibility remains limited. We plan to deliver on our current backlog while continuing to resize the business aggressively to meet a much lower level of demand. We're actively scaling facilities to single shifts, consolidating locations and implementing other cost control initiatives. Despite these efforts, reduced volumes will work against us, and we anticipate some margin erosion on lower activity levels and continued delays in the range of 200 to 300 basis points. 
Declining energy prices will negatively impact our order book for the foreseeable future, and we expect new orders for large equipment packages, both on and offshore, to remain low. We continue to win in the marketplace due to our commitment to technology, capacity, and operational service and support, but orders are scarce. As such, we do not expect this quarter's bookings to improve materially from the fourth quarter. 
Our Rig Aftermarket segment generated $569 million of revenue during the fourth quarter of 2015, roughly flat sequentially and down 33% year-over-year from a record $850 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Customers curtailed spending as rig utilization declined in both land and offshore markets. Land-related sales were approximately 21% of total segment revenue, down slightly from 22% in Q3 but up on a percentage basis from 18% in the fourth quarter of 2014. EBITDA for the segment was $135 million or 23.7% of sales, and operating profit was $127 million or 22.3% of sales, down 330 basis points from last quarter on higher proportion [ph] of lower-margin service and repair work as well as incremental pricing pressure on repair and select spare parts. 
Overall, 2015 results reflected an increasingly uncertain environment in which our drilling contractor customers reduced spending in an effort to preserve liquidity. Throughout the year, our customers chose to deplete existing spares inventories rather than pursue new and did de minimis repair work and maintenance on their rig fleets, deferring more expansive work except where absolutely necessary. 
For the full year, Rig Aftermarket generated revenue of $2.5 billion, down 22% from a record 2014. For full year, EBITDA was $647 million or 25.7% of revenue, down 250 basis points from 2014. And 2015 operating profit was $617 million or 24.5% of sales, down 290 basis points from the prior year. 
Looking into the first quarter of 2016, we expect Rig Aftermarket will see revenues decline in the mid- to upper teens percent range. Due to the seasonal nature of the aftermarket business, we typically expect lower activity with a better mix of spares to service and repair work in the first quarter than in the fourth. However, we anticipate a steeper-than-usual decline in Q1, reflecting current market conditions. Although reducing costs will be at the forefront of our response efforts, pricing pressure may push margins around 100 basis points lower in the first quarter. Longer term, we believe our Rig Aftermarket segment will be a strong early cycle beneficiary of the eventual recovery. We believe drillers will rush to return suboptimally maintained, stacked, partially cannibalized rigs to proper operating condition once they gain confidence that the market has reached a bottom and they see early indications of a recovery. 
For the fourth quarter of 2015, the Wellbore Technologies segment generated revenues of $757 million, down 9% sequentially from $834 million and down 50% from a record $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014. Reduced drilling activity negatively impacted all of our businesses within the segment. Average rig counts declined by 13% sequentially in the U.S., 9% in Canada, and 2%, internationally. And segment revenue by geography closely mirrored the sequential fall in rig count. 
Pricing pressure continued into the fourth quarter across most all product lines. For the fourth quarter of 2015, EBITDA was $68 million or 9% of revenue, down 530 basis points from last quarter, and the segment posted an operating loss of $31 million. 
For the full year 2015, Wellbore Technologies generated revenue of $3.7 billion, down 35% in comparison to 2014. Consistent with the year-over-year average decline in global rig count, 2015 EBITDA for the segment was $562 million or 15.1% of revenue, down from 26% in 2014, and operating profit was $162 million for 2015 or 4.4% of sales as the speed of activity and revenue decline outpaced our reduction efforts. 
Like our Rig Aftermarket business, we expect our Wellbore Technologies segment to be an early cycle beneficiary of the eventual recovery. However, near term, we have limited visibility, and the activity-driven nature of the business contributes to variability. Just 4 weeks into 2016, U.S. rig count is down 18% from the average in Q4 of 2015. So we expect revenues to fall 8% to 10% with decremental margins in the 40% range. 
We continue our efforts to optimize our Wellbore Technologies segment, resizing our business to meet lower levels of demand, improving our manufacturing processes to become more efficient on a lower cost base and shortening our commercialization processes to bring new value-adding technologies to market. 
Our Completion & Production Solutions segment generated revenues of $746 million for the fourth quarter of 2015, down 7% sequentially and 44% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. Businesses related to onshore completion and production were some of the most negatively impacted with customers delaying receipt of finished orders as operators' inventory of drilled but uncompleted wells rose in response to commodity price declines. EBITDA for the segment was $86 million or 11.5% of sales, and operating profit for the segment was $34 million resulting in operating margins of 4.6%, down 330 basis points sequentially at 1,160 basis points year-over-year as a result of lower volumes and pricing pressure. 
During the quarter, Completion & Production Solutions received orders of $272 million, down $194 million or 42% sequentially as a substantial flexible pipe order won in the third quarter did not repeat. We recognized $460 million of revenue out of backlog, resulting in a book-to-bill of 59%. Segment ended the quarter with a backlog balance of $969 million, of which approximately 75% is offshore and 87% is destined for international markets. 
For full year 2015, the segment generated revenue of $3.4 billion, down 28% in comparison to 2014 as revenue out of backlog declined $501 million or 20%, and nonbacklog revenue decreased 37% from 2014 to $1.3 billion. Full year EBITDA was $507 million or 15.1% of revenue, down 480 basis points from 2014. Operating profit was $286 million or 8.5% of revenue in comparison to $700 million and 15.1% in 2014, representing decremental leverage of 32.3%. Record or near-record margins in some of our offshore production-related businesses, including flexibles and large-diameter XL Systems conductor pipe connections, were overshadowed by lower year-over-year contributions from our higher-margin intervention and stimulation equipment businesses, given reduced demand for hydraulic stimulation, coiled tubing and wireline capital equipment and consumables. 
With oil at 12-year lows, orders for new capital equipment will remain challenged as we move into the first quarter of 2016. Opportunities that do emerge will face continued pricing pressure. As a result, we anticipate revenues will decrease by approximately 15% and expect revenue out of backlog to fall to the $350 million to $370 million range. We anticipate decremental operating leverage in the 30% to 35% range. 
Now let's discuss some additional detail regarding our consolidated financial results. Working down the consolidated statement of income for the fourth quarter of 2015, gross margin declined 210 basis points to 19.1%. SG&A increased $25 million or 7% sequentially due in large part to increases in bad debt and other year-end related items, which more than offset overhead reductions. Despite the slight sequential increase, we reduced SG&A 28% year-over-year, which translates into an annualized cost savings of approximately $600 million. Other items for the quarter equaled $1.8 billion and resulted primarily from goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset write-downs of $1.6 billion, and restructuring and other charges of $139 million. 
EBITDA was $308 million or 11.3% of sales. Net interest expense remained flat for the third quarter, and equity income was a loss of $3 million as demand for OCTGs or Green Tubing associated with our Voest-Alpine joint venture remains muted given the low demand for new drillpipe. 
Other expense for the quarter decreased $3 million sequentially to $17 million, and the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter, excluding the impact of other items, was 18.7%, affected by a taxable loss in the U.S. and taxable income in foreign jurisdictions, among other things. 
Net income, excluding other items, was $85 million or $0.23 per fully diluted share. Working capital, excluding cash and debt, totaled $5.5 billion at December 31, 2015, down $422 million from the prior quarter. We generated a total of $614 million in cash flow from operations. After dividend payments of $173 million, investments in our business of $136 million, and FX impact on our cash balances and other items totaling $18 million, we were able to decrease our net debt position by $287 million during the quarter. 
We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.1 billion, $4 billion in debt, and our net debt to capitalization was 11.2%. We also have $3.6 billion of undrawn capacity on our revolving credit facility. 
Overall, 2015 was a challenging year under the backdrop of market uncertainty, falling energy prices, declining drilling activity and reduced customer spending. In spite of these conditions, NOV generated $1.3 billion in cash flow from operations, bought back 2.2 billion in our shares, paid out cash dividends of $710 million to our shareholders, invested over $450 million in organic growth opportunities and completed 7 acquisitions for approximately $85 million all while preserving a very strong balance sheet. 2016 will prove to be another challenging year. However, the actions we took during 2015 have positioned us well to weather the storm and capitalize on opportunities that we identify during this down cycle. 
Now let me turn it back to Clay."

We were hoping to find stability early 2016, and then oil headed down another $10, and all the E&Ps are coming out with sharply lower Capex forecasts than we had been planning for. So things remain fluid. But to your original question, what's the right balance. I got to tell you one of the really necessary skillsets oilfield services for those of us that have been in it a while is the ability to flex up sharply when called upon and flex down sharply when called upon. And good news for NOV is we have a very experienced management team running our business units around the globe. They know how to do this. We've been called on in the past to double and triple and quadruple production over a short period of time, and we successfully navigated that very well and maximized profitability and returns through that. This is the flip side of that. As orders fall away, as spending comes to the screeching halt, we have to cut costs in lockstep. So I have an abundance of confidence in the capabilities of this team to do both, to respond to this market that's slowing down dramatically as well as speed up and flex upwards when we're eventually called upon to do that."

To recap some of the liquidity items that Jose mentioned just a moment ago: $2.1 billion cash balance; $5.5 billion of working capital, which has begun liquidating; a $3.6 billion revolving line of credit. So we have a lot of capital flexibility. We stepped up our efforts as we talked about on prior calls to be very vigorous in looking for opportunities to deploy capital in what we see is becoming more of a buyers’ market. And so we're pretty, pretty excited about that and have a lot of flexibility to pursue those. As you know, we really fundamentally pursue competitive advantage and really fundamentally pursue evolving trends that we see in the oilfield as attractive areas to deploy capital. So specifically, I think in my comments just a moment ago, I mentioned places like Saudi Arabia, which is committed to increasing activity. They want more local content. We've talked a lot in the past about areas like the FSU, where we've done more organic investment than acquisitions. But that's an area of interest. Argentina. The excitement around the Vaca Muerta shale, which was down in Q4, but longer term, we're pretty excited about the potential there.

We were disappointed in the fourth quarter that our revenue out of backlog fell so sharply. It fell about $460 million sequentially out of Rig Systems, a couple hundred million short of what our expectations were for the fourth quarter. And that's due precisely to what you highlighted with regards to drilling contractors really getting more aggressive on trying to delay acceptance of rigs and push them back. As you know, the food chain that we work within, drilling contractors sign up for the construction of these new rigs, the shipyards are their customers, and then we work for the shipyards. We've been very diligent over the years about demanding very strong contracts, very strong down payments, progress billings and the like, but given our focus on monetizing the profit in that backlog, we have slowed our progress on revenue out of backlog to sort of match -- better match payments and to minimize our working capital exposure in those programs. So that's kind of what you saw in the fourth quarter is we slowed down that revenue recognition out of backlog. Ultimately, it's really caused by a lot of drillers trying to delay acceptance of rigs. A couple of situations I think have been made public and a couple of situations remain a little tense. Contributing to that was the one shipyard we continued working for in Brazil also slowed in the fourth quarter. I mentioned in my call that we only did $10 million in revenue out of Brazil. And so progress on that particular program slowed as well. So really across the board, things have slowed down. It remains fluid. We've haircut our guidance for revenue out of backlog into Q1 and are working to respond to the market kind of week by week as we see things unfolding."

And we certainly saw that during the quarter offset by continued decline in orders for higher-margin spare parts. As we go into Q1, essentially, during the course of Q4, we saw, obviously, quick deterioration in a number of the other product offerings, spare parts included. And so we're expecting a good falloff, not only in that sort of seasonal associated service and repair work but also continuing falloff in spares. As I mentioned in my commentary, this is a business that we're certainly excited about for the future as it is tightly tied to the front end of the cycle, and we really do believe that once there are some glimmers of hope out there, things stabilize a little bit, our customers can call bottom and start seeing any sort of optimism to gain some confidence, there'll be a rush to deliver new orders, which will result in a nice pickup for us. The exact timing of that is really difficult to say. We're obviously in an environment where there's very little near-term visibility.

Well, their lower costs equal our lower Rig Aftermarket revenues. They've slowed down spare parts purchases, or as we talked about before, cannibalizing. They're deferring maintenance wherever possible. I think it's safe to say that no piece of capital equipment across the oilfield globally is being well maintained right now. And what that sets up for the future is when activity does turn, when we find bottom and then it starts to go up, is a lot of work for our Rig Aftermarket folks to repair, to maintain, to replenish spare parts. And so the deeper this goes and the longer this goes, I think, the sharper the rebound and the more positive the rebound."

But also elsewhere around the globe where they're more interested in being involved in the selection of the bottom-hole assemblies that go into their complex directional drilling.

Having optionality in the capital structure in this current environment is becoming more and more valuable day-by-day, and we're also seeing a narrowing of the bid-and-ask spreads on some compelling acquisition opportunities coming forward. So as we think about capital allocation, for us, it's really all about ultimately driving maximum value to the shareholders. So obviously, historically, organic investment has been a very good use of capital in the current environment when we're overcapacitized. M&A tends to be front and center in our minds. And everything is going to be opportunity specific, outlook dependent in terms of how we think about using the capital structure related to M&A and our other capital requirements. So I don't want to get into any sort of specifics on ratios, et cetera. But I think the company has historically maintained a fairly conservative balance sheet, and we intend to keep it that way.

Two of those 15 build new rigs, 1 for land, 1 for offshore, but 13 of our business units do other things. So we do a lot across the oilfield, probably more than we get credit for and already have sort of -- more sort of diverse exposure. What I would say is the thinking here with regards to M&A and corporate development, which I think that the company has a lot of that in its DNA, really is focused on identifying opportunities to make money. What are the trends in the oilfield? Where can we drive better industry structure? Where can we offer a better package of products and services for our customers? And it's really a little more granular than trying to globally arrive at some sort of diversified portfolio mix. I think we've ended up at a very diversified portfolio mix already, but at the end of the day, this is a -- business is about making money, right. So where can we put capital in into an opportunity, get that capital back as quickly as possible, i.e., get a quick payback and a good return and really do something different to drive higher capital returns in an industry where we've all spent our careers, and I think have a lot of insight into, which is global oilfield services at-large. So that's kind of our approach to M&A and looking for those sorts of opportunities. And honestly, Jose and Loren, I wish we could tell you more this morning, but as you understand, these things are never a deal until they're a deal. We are enthusiastic about what we're starting to see out there, and again, great to have a lot of balance sheet flexibility and capacity. And I think there's a lot of optionality right now embedded in NOV."

National Oilwell Varco's first quarter 2016 financial results reflect the painful financial stress that our oil and gas customers are operating in. As WTI prices marked steadily downward at the bottom at $26 per barrel in mid-February, c",1790,"Thank you, Loren. National Oilwell Varco's first quarter 2016 financial results reflect the painful financial stress that our oil and gas customers are operating in. As WTI prices marked steadily downward at the bottom at $26 per barrel in mid-February, customers simply stoped spending and oilfield activity plummeted further. Consequently, our first quarter revenues fell 20% sequentially to $2.2 billion and are down 62% from the fourth quarter of 2014 when the current down cycle started. The company posted a $0.06 per fully diluted share loss for the first quarter of 2016 excluding severance, restructuring and other items totaling $0.26 per fully diluted share. 
EBITDA was $127 million for the quarter or 5.8% of revenue, and operating loss was $48 million or negative 2.2% of revenue, excluding restructuring and other items from both. 
Sequential EBITDA decremental leverage was 37% on a 20% revenue decline. And year-over-year EBITDA decremental leverage was 29% on a 55% revenue decline, excluding restructuring and other items from all quarters. In a moment, José will take you through a more detailed discussion of operating results. 
Our restructuring efforts accelerated during the quarter as we continue to aggressively manage cost downward. We have closed or are closing 200 facilities since the downturn began, and we reduced our workforce by nearly 6,000 employees during the first quarter of 2016. 
SG&A expenses declined $31 million in the quarter sequentially and is down $180 million or 34% from late 2014. Importantly, while we downsize, we are also mentioning our investment in the future, including $110 million invested in the first quarter on engineering, research and development into emerging technologies and products, which will further reduce production costs, increase access to reserves and crew safety and reducing impact on the environment for our customers. 
We closed 4 small acquisitions in the quarter, which collectively bring new technology to our portfolio, specifically surface rig instrumentation, downhole measurement while drilling technologies and drillpipe asset tracking utilizing RFID chip technology. Each of these acquisitions complement our own internal organic investments that advance our long-term strategic plans. 
I'd like to take a moment this morning and share with you just how we see our future unfolding and how these investments in our long-term strategic plan articulate with that future. 
First, horizontal drilling and geo steering are key enabling technologies in the shale revolution. 90% of U.S. land rigs drilling today are drilling horizontally or at least directionally, a share which has actually increased from 79% since the downturn began in the fourth quarter of 2014. Horizontal drilling, which opens up much more of the reservoir to the wellbore will expand globally and be applied more widely in the inevitable upturn. Therefore, NOV has developed a new low-cost road tool, which will be run commercially in our customer's hole for the first time next week. This new product our compressive bottom hole assembly or BHA offering to the directional drilling industry. 
Our Tektonic family of abrasion-resistant fix cutter bits are gaining market share, as is our new ERT downhole drilling motor. And we added new products through an acquisition in the first quarter as well. These tools work with our jars, shock subs, drill collars and premium drill pipe, engineered to withstand the considerable rigors of horizontal drilling. Our long-term strategic plan in this area is built on our view that the next up cycle will see even greater demand for drilling tools for horizontal drilling, which will be provided by directional drilling service industry that NOV will continue to equip. 
Second, North American shale plays endured lengthy gestation periods before they evolved to profitability. As the E&P experimented with drilling techniques to arrive at the most cost-effective methods to drive marginal cost per barrel sufficiently low to be financially attractive investments. In the next up cycle, NOV can help short-circuit that technique. Using our closed-loop automated drilling service, which has proven it can materially reduced drilling cost by making microsecond level adjustments to the drilling rig through our proprietary rig control system and software. We are bidding or executing over a dozen closed-loop automated drilling projects currently, utilizing our proprietary and drill pipe. We are also seeing more interest from drilling contractors wishing to differentiate their rigs by outfitting them with IntelliServ wire drill pipe. In fact, we know of an idled rig that was recently put back to work solely because it was outfitted with IntelliServ pipe, a big win for its owner. Our long-term strategic plan is built on the view that E&P companies will prospect new shale plays globally using rigs capable of closed-loop automated drilling, Tier 1 AC rigs, wired IntelliServ drillpipe, bottom hole assembly components and software, all of which NOV can provide today. 
During the first quarter, NOV was awarded a major 5-year project in North Africa for a real-time technology center to track drilling rig operations and we are currently building other similar projects. NOV has provided real-time remote monitoring of equipment for many years. a few weeks ago, we announced the industry's first predictive capabilities for monitoring BOP components through our rig century remote condition-based monitoring services. We believe that condition-based remote monitoring of oilfield equipment and predictive data analytics will grow in importance in the next upturn as the industry increasingly employs more sophisticated equipment in more demanding environments. 
The Internet of Things is coming to the oilfield and NOV will continue to lead the way, and we'll benefit from the largest installed base of drilling equipment and drilling control systems in the world. 
Hydraulic stimulation is another enabling technology with proven value to the industry. We're investing in technologies, which we believe can reduce the capital equipment on-site, the number of truckloads required, the power requirements and the operating costs of conventional frac fleets. Our long-term strategic plan has us investing in better ways to our hydraulically stimulate reservoirs. Again, the next upturn will see more widespread application of fracture stimulation, and we plan to provide the next generation of tools. 
The oil and gas industry has invested billions of deepwater exploration, chalking up more than 400 undeveloped discoveries and our strategic plan targets improving floating production technologies to lower the development cost of these reserves. We are targeting a new fully concussed production solution to offer to owners of marginal deepwater fields by early 2017. Preliminary discussions with IOCs around our new innovative concepts have been met with high levels of enthusiasm. Specifically, these are smaller standardized units which can operate efficiently across a broader range of production, which utilize standardized disconnectable turrets to increase asset utilization and efficiency. 
On the C4, we are expanding our offering in flexible pipe, connectors and other hardware, along with sea water treatment technologies for subsea seawater injection, which increases the ultimate recovery from reservoirs through pressure maintenance, ultimately lowering cost per barrel. 
We continue -- we are continuing to expand our offering of composite materials into both offshore and land markets, partly through an acquisition we closed in the first quarter. Composite materials offer superior corrosion resistence in the 4 lines we supply and lighter weights, which drive down offshore vessel construction costs. 
Our long-term plan continues to advance these technologies, which will see increased uptake in the recovery.  As the largest provider of fiberglass and composite tubulars to the oilfield in the world, NOV is well positioned to continue to drive corrosion-resistant solutions. 
Onshore, we are focused on other technologies which help our customers reduce their cost of production. The U.S. is really a 60 million-barrel per day industry that produces 9 million barrels a day of oil as a byproduct. Our water technology offers superior oil water separation and complements our proprietary sand separation technologies in the extensive production pump business. 
Our long-term plan also invest strategically in key productive regions like Saudi Arabia and Russia where we began fabricating our first land rig and downhole tools at a new plant we opened in the first quarter. 
NOV is an innovative organization resolutely focused on improving the cost per barrel position of our customers through technology, improved supply chain, standardization and industrialization. Our experience is that business models such as these, built on sound fundamentals that focus on our customers needs, are long-term winners. Bearing contrasting to new business models, which seem to arise during downturns, which focus on either providing our customers with increasingly valuable capital they cannot access elsewhere or business models wherein we shoulder more of our customers risks. 
Prior cycles that demonstrated that these models frequently do not turn out so well. As we approach the bottom of this chart down cycle, our customers are struggling to make money right now and the oilfield services industry is being radically disassembled, to quote, with commodity prices far below levels required to return to production growth. This is not sustainable and will change. 
Investors are understandably focused on optionality enterprises in an eventual recovery. The handful of strategic plans I just outlined rest on specific, promising technologies our customers can apply across the globe. They will continue to evolve the industry to higher levels of efficiency and safety and lower cost of production. NOV is positioning itself to capitalize on the inevitable upturn, and I'm excited about the optionality embedded in our initiatives. And more so, the creativity and ingenuity that our teammates here at NOV continue to apply to our customer's challenges. 
While we are not planning for a recovery in 2016, we are encouraged by reports from some customers that they are beginning to think about a potential upturn in the second half of the year, as oil production has finally begun to roll over and demand continues to march upward. We will continue to manage costs to the reality of the marketplace in the short term, which is becoming more challenging as very low volumes present rising absorption challenges for us. 
Even with a rebound in oil prices, it will take time for our customers to repair balance sheets to complete their drilled but uncompleted wells, to work down oil inventories and access capital to resume drilling. But the industry will navigate these challenges and NOV will be here with an enhanced offering and greater levels of efficiency. 
I'm grateful to be part of such an smart organization with deep financial resources and diverse business models and bright opportunities in our future. This has always been a deeply cyclical industry, and our leaders have been through many downturns before and they will again lead us through the present storm. Oilfield services is not much fun right now, and I want to let all of our employees know that José, Loren and I appreciate you suiting up everyday and fighting the good fight. Hang in there, better days lie ahead. Jose?"
31900,326268360,965606,"National Oilwell Varco, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2016",2016-04-28,"Earnings Calls","NOV Inc.","Executives","As Clay mentioned, NOV posted a $0.06 per share loss for the quarter, excluding severance, restructuring and other items, which totaled $147 million pretax or $0.26 per share after tax. Consolidated revenues were $2.2 billion for the first quarter of 2016",3134,"As Clay mentioned, NOV posted a $0.06 per share loss for the quarter, excluding severance, restructuring and other items, which totaled $147 million pretax or $0.26 per share after tax. Consolidated revenues were $2.2 billion for the first quarter of 2016, down 20% from the fourth quarter of '15 and 55% year-over-year. The sharp decline during the quarter was a result of significant E&P spending as oil prices reach new lows. Average U.S. land rig count fell 27% sequentially, exiting the quarter at 450, the lowest count since the 1940s. And the average international rig count fell 8%, hitting a decade low at 985 rigs, with declines seen across all major regions of the globe. 
All of NOV's business units and global regions were negatively impacted, and all reporting segments saw revenue declines during the quarter. EBITDA decreased to $127 million or 5.8% of sales, resulting in sequential EBITDA decremental leverage of 37% and year-over-year decremental leverage of 29%. Operating loss, excluding other items, was $48 million. 
Looking at some of the other line items in the P&L, SG&A decreased by $31 million or 8% sequentially and by $138 million or 28% year-over-year as we continue to execute cost control measures necessary to size our business with current market environment. 
Interest and other financial costs decreased $2 million sequentially and $1 million year-over-year, primarily due to banking -- lower banking fees associated with the reduction of letter of credit outstanding. We reported a $3 million higher loss sequentially in unconsolidated affiliates related to our Voest-Alpine joint venture, where demand for OCTV or green tubing remain low, given the of drillpipe demand. 
Other expenses for the quarter increased $4 million sequentially, driven primarily by greater loss on disposals of fixed assets. 
Our GAAP effective tax rate was 50% for the quarter. The unusually high rate was a result of combining losses in higher tax jurisdictions, namely the U.S., with income from lower rate international jurisdictions. Additionally, we received a tax benefit associated with reversing reserves or tax audits which concluded with favorable outcomes. With the relatively low levels of pretax income and losses that we are currently experiencing, relatively small changes in the slip between domestic and international result can have a disproportionate impact on our effective tax rate. Notwithstanding this uncertainty and anticipated volatility, our current estimate for the effective tax rate is 35% for the remainder of the year. 
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Working capital decreased $528 million from the fourth quarter of 2015 to $4.9 billion at March 31, 2016. The decrease in working capital is primarily the result of the $714 million reduction in accounts receivable, $144 million reduction in inventory levels and an $84 million decrease in customer financing, which is the net of prepayment and billings in excess of cost against cost in excess of billings. The reductions in working capital were partially offset by decreases in accrued liabilities and accounts payable. 
Our focus on collections yielded strong results during the quarter, although inventory is not liquidating as quickly as we'd like, reflecting lower current levels of demand. We anticipate working capital will continue to be a source of cash as our revenues move lower, but we expect the pace of cash flow generation to slow relative to the past 2 quarters. The reduction in working capital helped to contribute to an exceptional quarter of cash flow generation relative to the current market environment. 
NOV generated $621 million in cash flow from operations during the first quarter. After paying $173 million in dividends, $84 million for non-acquisition-related capital expenditure investments, $21 million for acquisitions and adding a foreign exchange benefit and other items totaling $20 million, we netted $363 million in free cash flow. 
Additionally, we successfully repatriated another $637 million in cash from overseas at very low cost, allowing us to reduce our commercial paper balances by $683 million to a quarter end balance of $210 million. This pay-down of debt was partially offset by a capital lease associated with the large new facility which came onto our books during the quarter. The building will allow us to consolidate approximately 1,600 personnel from 12 existing NOV facilities, of which 10 will be fully vacated after we finish moving into the new facility. 
At March 31, we had cash balance of $1.8 billion, total debt of $3.4 billion and our debt to capitalization was 17.1%, down from 19.2% at year-end. 
As Loren mentioned in the introductory remarks, we made a few changes to the presentation of certain information in our release this morning, which we hope will enhance our reader's ability to understand NOV and its financial performance. One of the changes relate to the presentation of our segment results. In order to provide a clear measurement of our reporting segments, we are no longer allocating certain corporate overhead cost to our segment results and we are now capturing these costs in the line item Eliminations and Corporate Costs. We have revised prior period amount to make the segment performance comparable. And when we speak to segment results this morning, we'll be referring to the reclassified results presented in our earnings release. 
In today's release, we also provided the specific amounts now deemed corporate cost for each period presented. However, we do not anticipate breaking these costs out in the future. 
Our Rig Systems segment generated first quarter revenue of $926 million, down 9% from $1 billion earned last quarter. For the first quarter, the split between offshore and land-related revenue was 75% and 25%, respectively. New construction of offshore rigs accounted for $431 million in revenues or 20% of NOV's consolidated revenues. 
First quarter EBITDA for the Rig Systems segment was $137 million. After 4 quarters of exceptional decremental margin management, our Rig Systems segment saw a significant decline in margins in the first quarter. Margins fell 630 basis points or 14.8% of sales, representing 87% decrements or 9% lower sequential revenues. Operating profit was $119 million or 12.8% of sales. 
Lower margins arose from the much stronger than anticipated fall in spare parts sales in our Aftermarket business, meaningfully impacting absorption within Rig Systems segments, facilities that manufacture those products. Additionally, while cost reductions are under way, their pace simply can't always keep up with sharp volume declines, particularly when you are try to be thoughtful in your actions while treating people as well as you reasonably can during difficult times. Bottom line is that the lower anticipated margins for the result of lower throughput in our manufacturing facilities, combined with a slowdown in cost reduction efforts relative to the fall-off in volumes. 
On a year-over-year basis, first quarter revenue was down 63% at only 25% decremental margins. The solid year-over-year decrements in the face of a nearly 2/3 revenue decline have been accomplished by significant in-sourcing from our external supply chain, but these opportunities are diminishing. 
New orders were $97 million in the first quarter, representing a book-to-bill of only 13% when compared to the $770 million shipped out of backlog. Q1 bookings were composed entirely of discrete capital equipment, including cranes, pressure control and jacking systems. For the second straight quarter, we received no new rig orders. 
As we note in our press release, effective March 31, 2016, we have deducted the backlog we previously disclosed for rigs being constructed in Brazil to reflect Sete's shareholder approval to file for bankruptcy section last week, along with other orders for which we have not been paid in over a year, totaling approximately $2.1 billion. Although our contracts with the 3 yards remain in place and are enforceable, work on all these projects has been suspended pending payment and will remain so until customers make funds available to advance the projects, leading us to report backlog more conservatively. Therefore, ending backlog was $3.3 billion for Rig Systems, and we expect $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion of this backlog to be converted to revenue in the remainder of 2016 for a full year revenue from backlog number of about $2 billion to $2.1 billion. 
Working at the second quarter, we anticipate a much sharper, up to 30% fall-off in revenue, as we continue to work our backlog on existing projects. We anticipate much improved decremental margins, approximately 30% of standings from our latest cost-cutting efforts are fully realized but are more than offset by declining volumes. 
Our Rig Aftermarket segment generated $391 million of revenue during the first quarter of 2016, down 31% from the $569 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 and down 46% from the $719 million in the first quarter of 2015. Revenue declines were anticipated in the first quarter due to deteriorating market condition and the normal fall-of of year-end service and repair work. However, sharper fall off and activity levels versus expectations amplify the decline and further eroded demand for spare parts, as our drilling contracts for customers, offshore in particular, cut their expenditures on repairs, services and spare parts dramatically across the board. 
EBITDA was $82 million, down 43% sequentially and down 62% from the prior year. Decrementals were 35%, driving EBITDA margins down to 21%. While our mix shift from spares to service and repair and some pricing pressure contributed to the profitability decline, the largest driver was reduced volumes, which resulted in lower absorption in our facilities and lower utilization of our service and repair personnel. 
Operating profit was $77 million or 19.7% of sales. Special periodic survey were continuous, but we are seeing significant reduction in the scope of these surveys and other long plan SPS projects are being canceled lately in view of grim prospects for these offshore rigs winning contracts anytime soon. Additionally, we are seeing pricing pressures continuing Looking forward, we expect revenues to come down in the mid-single-digit percentage point range, with sequentially EBITDA decrementals in line with Q1's results. 
Thinking longer term, we believe Rig Aftermarket will be an early beneficiary of activity recovery, as we work with our customers necessary parts and service repair and maintenance required to put rigs back to work. Additionally, we believe new U.S. offshore DOB regulations will drive additional demand for condition-based monitoring services, which we have provided for over 5 years.
Our Wellbore Technologies segment generated revenues of $631 million during the first quarter of 2016, down 17% sequentially from $757 million and down 46% from the $1.2 billion posted in the first quarter of 2015. Revenue mix by destination was 46% North America and 54% international. 70% of the segment decline came from international markets, which declined 22% sequentially, most acutely in Asia and Latin America. The U.S. declined 16% sequentially, better than the 26% decline in the U.S. rig count, indicating that despite intense pricing pressures, revenue per rig improved on market share gains. EBITDA for the segment was $43 million or 6.8% of sales, down 44% from the previous quarter and 82% from the prior year. Sequentially, EBITDA decremental leverage was limited to 27% on $126 million in revenue decline. As the group experienced the full benefits of cost reductions made last quarter and continues to eliminate substantial portions of this cost structure, including the closure of more than 20 facilities during the first quarter of 2016, operating loss for the segment was $53 million. 
activity from the downhole tools segment is increasing, and we believe that even a leveling of activity will bring more work as customers are depleting their stocks of equipment and tools coming in from jobs not being repaired. Therefore, we expect -- we, therefore, expect to prepare work and mortar to begin to rise through the years as customers run out of tools. We began manufacturing downhole tools in new plants in Saudi Arabia and Russia during the first quarter. Drill pipe demand remains very low, and we have much of our capacity as a result. The Q2 benefited from a high mix of large diameter premium threaded drillpipe. Our Tuboscope unit saw a pipe mill and processor activity fall owing to 12 months of inventory on the ground in North America. 5 to 6 months have been normalized on average. However, we are beginning to see some interest in completion and workover activity, which may drive demand for coding and inspection work in the back half of the year, along with higher demand for rod services for artificial lift. 
services saw a significant decline in revenues tied to lower recounts, but aggressive cost control enabled the group to post higher EBITDA sequentially. We the number of wins in our press release and in Clay's remarks, but I'd like to further highlight some of the recent successes and market share gains, particularly related to our downhole tool and drilling optimization businesses. Or drill designs continue to set new performance records globally. Most recently in Oman when operator set 3 new field records using our Tektonic fit to drill 8,000-plus feet in any single run. Since their introduction in October, 2015, Tektonic bits have logged 22 field records in 10 countries around the globe. Additionally, our dynamic drilling solutions business continued to gain traction with optimization and drilling authorization services. 
In our release, we highlighted the completion of an 18-month project in the Norwegian North Sea with a major integrated oil company and developing the business of oil reservoir and several deeper structurally complex high-pressure gas and condensate reservoirs. Well drilled in this field have a narrow pressure window that requires a comprehensive understanding of the conditions and that leaves little room for error in order to optimize economic associated with the development of the field. 
Our suite of tools provided the customer with high-speed streaming downhole data used to activity analyze wellbore conditions, which enabled customers to have the data required to justify extending laterals well beyond originally planned pipe design. By extending the wellbore, the customer significantly increased production from the well drilled, therefore, eliminating the need for the final well included in the original project plan. Given the cost of drilling in the North Sea, you can appreciate how our technologies reduce the customer's development cost substantially. Additionally, we were recently awarded a contract for downhole drilling automation with independent customer in Western Canada. And as Clay mentioned, we were awarded a 5-year project by a national oilwell oil company in North Africa data acquisition and visualization optimization. 
Traction, we continue to gain with new technologies, indicate our customers persistent desire to seek new and better ways to drill, and we have positioned ourselves as the leading independent provider to help them achieve those goals. Notwithstanding the many positive ongoing developments occurring within our Wellbore Technologies segment, our business primarily driven by drilling-related activities. With Q2 global activity already sharply lower than the Q1 average, we anticipate second quarter revenues will be down approximately 15%. 
Additionally, while we continue to reduce our cost structure, we do not believe we will replicate the success we had in the first quarter managing our decremental margin and anticipate the segment to be at or near break even in EBITDA. 
The Completion & Production Solutions segment generated revenues of $585 million for the first quarter of 2016, down 25% sequentially and 41% compared to the first quarter of 2015. While all businesses experienced fewer sales, revenue declines were the sharpest within the offshore production-related which were coming off record or near record years Revenue out of backlog was $330 million, down 28% sequentially. EBITDA for the segment was $48 million or 8.6% of sales, down from 11.9% in Q4 and 18.2% in Q1 of 2015. 
The segment was able to hold decremental EBITDA leverage to 22%, as cost savings realized from facility consolidations and headcount reductions help soften the impact of declining revenues. Operating loss for the segment was $4 million. Revenues for intervention, stimulation and wireline equipment continued to decline, particularly across North America, while the Middle East has remained comparatively strong. Aftermarket spares and services equipment are facing considerable since customers aggressively cannibalize fleets, including acquiring auction spreads going for $0.20  on the dollar to 
However, we are encouraged by a recent pickup in quotations for possible orders in the second half of 2016, when some customers believe completion activity will pick up and by sequentially stronger order book rings. Our floating production group posted lower revenues as well, but had excellent decrementals due to aggressive downsizing. We continue to advance half a dozen FEED studies for FPSO-related projects, but final investment decisions have been nonexistent as customers recycle design and concepts to reduce costs. 
Our flexible pipe business fell sharply as our plant in Brazil ran out of orders in December. However, the group landed significant orders, which will lead to revenues growth in Q2 and should the plant through the remainder of the year. 
Our composite pipe business unit fell during the first quarter, but again, aggressive cost control lead to an improvement in EBITDA in the first quarter and orders improved. Process and flow technologies also posted higher EBITDA on flat revenues, owing to significant restructuring that went on last year and favorable mix as the group won record levels of orders for production chokes. New orders were $328 million, up $56 million or 26%, resulting in a 99% book-to-bill in the first quarter. Segment ended the quarter with a backlog balance of $994 million. 
While we experienced a sharp quarterly decline and industry activity levels continued to fall, we believe achieving a book-to-bill approaching 100% is and to the cap segment is rapidly approaching the bottom. But as those orders don't immediately convert to revenue, we expect segment revenue to decrease in the mid- to upper single-digit percentage range in the second quarter. Cost savings was positively impacted Q1 results are expected to continue but not to the same magnitude in decremental margins as we experienced in the first quarter, which should lead to decrementals in the mid-30% range. Visibility on new order intake remains cloudy, particularly in the offshore space, as industry continues its deepwater cost recalibration. That said, we anticipate that new orders will see a slight pick up during the second quarter. 
In summary, our first quarter results reflect that we are in extremely challenging market environment. Despite current conditions, we continue to generate substantial amounts of free cash flow, even while we make meaningful investments in our ability to continue delivering better technologies and solutions for our customers in the oil and gas space. We expect the near-term environment to remain difficult. However, we are growing more optimistic that we are nearing the bottom of the cycle and we are excited about the future value that the hard-working and dedicated people at NOV will deliver to our customers and our shareholders as the recovery takes hold. 
With that, we'd like to open it up for questions."

I think as you're aware, 97% of the acquisition capital we've deployed in the last decade plus areas outside of we have a great franchise in building rigs, and we're proud of that, have done a great job. But looking forward, I think as the cycle recovers, we're going to benefit from investments like that, drillpipe demand comes back that drives very high operating leverage and high levels of profitability, particularly for our offering, which rest on a lot of the premium technology and specialized drillpipe used to drill more complex well pads, for instance. As we noted in our comments, we expect to see rising demand in downhole tools. And we've been developing internally as well as through acquisition new offerings in that arena. And as recovery comes back, I think we'll see a response there. As José mentioned, our Rig Aftermarket business and our customers really have cut spending to bare bones and are relying on cannibalization of many of the fleets that are out there. That can't last forever, and so recovery I think we'll see in Rig Aftermarket. And finally, Completion & Production Solutions, through the last decade, we've added new products there to help our customers improve economics in the deepwater, so things like part that we referenced build out our offering composite offerings, so now we're the largest provider of flexible composite piping for instance and flow lines. It's all of these businesses, we expect in an upturn, to benefit pretty early.

We are downsizing in response to what we anticipate will be lower demand for at least the next few years and possibly beyond. But to clarify, Rig Systems business is composed of manufacturing operations that make drilling components that support both land and offshore, as well as spare parts to support the Rig Aftermarket business. And in reality is that although we break it out to enhance our disclosure to the investing public, the Rig Aftermarket and the Rig Systems segments, in many ways, really constitute one big global business and they support all aspects of drilling from offshore rigs to land rigs to the spare parts, maintenance, special-purpose survey, projects and repair that's out there. So we are moving our cost structure down, retrenching, as you know. In the past, we've relied on a balanced mix between internal manufacturing as well as outsourcing. And so kind of the first actions we took in 2015 was to minimize our outsourcing and bring more in-house. We're continue to do that, but also looking at continuing to kind of reduce our footprint to cope with lower volumes. What I would tell you is although orders are very, very slow down. Businesses is obviously down to systems levels, looking out in coming quarters, we expect to see a resumption of land rig projects. We have a number of conversations underway around the globe. We expect to see drilling contractors continuing to upgrade their equipment and make their rigs more competitive in a market that's a little tougher on them. We expect to see -- we're investing in some products, I don't think we mentioned on the call, but some mew products to upgrade those rigs that we're pretty excited about. So we will retrench down to fit the volume that we foresee out there for the next 2 years, as well as continuing to invest in our other 2 products -- 2 segments that have a lot of very bright prospects in the recovery."

So what I would say though is in terms of the second half recovery, my comments were more directed to Wellbore Technologies production services specifically, where we're getting very, very anecdotal but a few customers really talking explicitly about a second half recovery. And volumes around that potential scenario starting to go up. I'll stress, Bill, these are quotations, not POs. So we'll see how that plays out. But we're encouraged by that. In terms of sort of midcycle, peak cycle kind of EBITDA margins, we've always been attracted to sort of high operating leverage businesses and we have a lot of that in our mix. One, two, there's been an awful lot of cost reductions under way, both in our enterprise and around the industry. And early great thing about the recoveries, when they come, is it doesn't take much incremental volume to flow in. And you really have becomes sort of hyper efficient at generating profitability out of that. We've seen that in prior up cycles. So when the turn comes, you have a lean, mean fighting force out there executing very skillfully, very efficiently.

And I think I've disclosed quarter by quarter, our Brazilian revenue has been slowing dramatically as project by project we've been requested by shipyard customers due to the lack of payments had slowed work, so that's come down. But also I'd point out, Brazil is still the second largest deepwater drilling market in the world right now and we still have significant business in Brazil. So we've made investments down there to support the program. Our expectation is we're going to start of ship this support ongoing drilling activities in the future. But we've been trimming the cost position there along the way."

National Oilwell Varco's first quarter 2016 financial results reflect the painful financial stress that our oil and gas customers are operating under. As WTI prices marched steadily downward to bottom at $26 per barrel in mid-February, c",1799,"Thank you, Loren. National Oilwell Varco's first quarter 2016 financial results reflect the painful financial stress that our oil and gas customers are operating under. As WTI prices marched steadily downward to bottom at $26 per barrel in mid-February, customers simply stopped spending, and oilfield activity plummeted further. Consequently, our first quarter revenues fell 20% sequentially to $2.2 billion, and are down 62% from the fourth quarter of 2014, when the current down cycle started. The company posted a $0.06 per fully diluted share loss for the first quarter of 2016, excluding severance, restructuring and other items totaling $0.26 per fully diluted share. 
EBITDA was $127 million for the quarter or 5.8% of revenue, and operating loss was $48 million or negative 2.2% of revenue, excluding restructuring and other items from both. 
Sequential EBITDA decremental leverage was 37% on a 20% revenue decline. And year-over-year EBITDA decremental leverage was 29% on a 55% revenue decline, excluding restructuring and other items from all quarters. In a moment, Jose will take you through a more detailed discussion of operating results. 
Our restructuring efforts accelerated during the quarter as we continued to aggressively manage costs downward. We have closed or are closing 200 facilities since the downturn began, and we reduced our workforce by nearly 6,000 employees during the first quarter of 2016.  SG&A expenses declined $31 million in the quarter sequentially and is down $180 million or 34% from late 2014. 
Importantly, while we downsize, we are also maintaining our investment in the future, including $110 million invested in the first quarter on engineering, research and development into emerging technologies and products, which will further reduce production costs, increase access to reserves, improve safety and reduce the impact on the environment for our customers. 
We closed 4 small acquisitions in the quarter which collectively bring new technology to our portfolio: specifically, surface rig instrumentation; downhole measurement while drilling technologies; and drillpipe asset tracking utilizing RFID chip technology. Each of these acquisitions complement our own internal organic investments that advance our long-term strategic plans. 
I'd like to take a moment this morning and share with you just how we see our future unfolding and how these investments in our long-term strategic plan articulate with that future. 
First, horizontal drilling and geosteering are key enabling technologies of the shale revolution. 90% of U.S. land rigs drilling today are drilling horizontally, or at least directionally, a share which has actually increased from 79% since the downturn began in the fourth quarter of 2014. Horizontal drilling, which opens up much more of the reservoir to the wellbore, will expand globally and be applied more widely in the inevitable upturn. Therefore, NOV has developed a new low-cost rotarysteerable tool, which will be run commercially in our customer's hole for the first time next week. This new product complements our comprehensive bottom hole assembly or BHA offering to the directional drilling industry. 
Our Tektonic family of abrasion-resistant fixed cutter bits are gaining market share, as is our new ERT downhole drilling motor. And we added new MWD products through an acquisition in the first quarter as well. These tools work with our jars, shock subs, drill collars and premium drillpipe, engineered to withstand the considerable rigors of horizontal drilling. Our long-term strategic plan in this area is built on our view that the next upcycle will see even greater demand for drilling tools for horizontal drilling, which will be provided by directional drilling service industry that NOV will continue to equip. 
Second, North American shale plays endured lengthy gestation periods before they evolved to profitability, as the E&P's experimented with drilling techniques to arrive at the most cost-effective methods to drive marginal cost per barrel sufficiently low to be financially attractive investments. In the next upcycle, NOV can help short-circuit that empirical technique, using our closed-loop automated drilling service, which has proven it can materially reduce drilling costs by making microsecond level adjustments to the drilling rig through our proprietary rig control system and software. We are bidding or executing over a dozen closed-loop automated drilling projects currently, utilizing our proprietary and IntelliServ wired drill pipe. We are also seeing more interest from drilling contractors wishing to differentiate their rigs by outfitting them with IntelliServ wire drillpipe. In fact, we know of an idled rig that was recently put back to work solely because it was outfitted with IntelliServ pipe, a big win for its owner. Our long-term strategic plan is built on the view that E&P companies will prospect new shale plays globally using rigs capable of closed-loop automated drilling: Tier 1 AC rigs, wired IntelliServ drillpipe, bottom hole assembly components and NOVOS software, all of which NOV can provide today. 
During the first quarter, NOV was awarded a major 5-year project in North Africa for a real-time technology center to track drilling rig operations, and we are currently building other similar projects. NOV has provided real-time remote monitoring of equipment for many years. A few weeks ago, we announced the industry's first predictive capabilities for monitoring BOP components through our RigSentry remote condition-based monitoring services. We believe that condition-based remote monitoring of oilfield equipment and predictive data analytics will grow in importance in the next upturn, as the industry increasingly employs more sophisticated equipment in more demanding environments. 
The Internet of Things is coming to the oilfield, and NOV will continue to lead the way, and will benefit from the largest installed base of drilling equipment and drilling control systems in the world. 
Hydraulic fracture stimulation is another enabling technology with proven value to the industry. We're investing in new technologies which we believe can reduce the capital equipment on site, the number of truckloads required, the power requirements and the operating costs of conventional frac fleets. Our long-term strategic plan has us investing in better ways to our hydraulically stimulate reservoirs. Again, the next upturn will see more widespread application of fracture stimulation, and we plan to provide the next generation of tools. 
The oil and gas industry has invested billions in deepwater exploration, chalking up more than 400 undeveloped discoveries, and our strategic plan targets improving floating production technologies to lower the development cost of these reserves. We are targeting a new fully costed production solution to offer to owners of marginal deepwater fields by early 2017. Preliminary discussions with IOCs around our new, innovative concepts have been met with high levels of enthusiasm. Specifically, these are smaller standardized units which can operate efficiently across a broader range of production, which utilize standardized disconnectable turrets to increase asset utilization and efficiency. 
On the seafloor, we are expanding our offering in flexible pipe, connectors and other hardware, along with seawater treatment technologies for subsea seawater injection, which increases the ultimate recovery from reservoirs through pressure maintenance, ultimately lowering cost per barrel. 
We continue -- we are continuing to expand our offering of composite materials into both offshore and land markets, partly through an acquisition we closed in the fourth quarter. Composite materials offer superior corrosion resistance in the flow lines we supply and lighter weights which drive down offshore vessel construction costs. 
Our long-term plan continues to advance these technologies, which will see increased uptake in a recovery.  As the largest provider of fiberglass and composite tubulars to the oilfield in the world, NOV is well positioned to continue to drive corrosion-resistant solutions. 
Onshore, we are focused on other technologies which help our customers reduce their cost of production. The U.S. is really a 60 million-barrel per day water industry that produces 9 billion -- 9 million barrels a day of oil as a byproduct. Our Water Wolf technology offers superior oil/water separation and complements our proprietary sand separation technologies and extensive production pump business. 
Our long-term plan also invests strategically in key productive regions like Saudi Arabia and Russia, where we began fabricating our first land rig and downhole tools at a new plant we opened in the first quarter. 
NOV is an innovative, entrepreneurial organization resolutely focused on improving the cost per barrel position of our customers, through technology, improved supply chain, standardization and industrialization. Our experience is that business models such as these, built on sound fundamentals that focus on our customer's needs, are long-term winners. They are in contrast to new business models, which seem to arise during downturns, which focus on either providing our customers with increasingly valuable capital they cannot access elsewhere or business models wherein we shoulder more of our customer's risk. 
Prior cycles have demonstrated that these models frequently do not turn out so well. As we approach the bottom of this sharp downcycle, our customers are struggling to make money right now, and the oilfield services industry is being radically disassembled to cope with commodity prices far below levels required to return to production growth. This is not sustainable and will change. 
Investors are understandably focused on optionality of enterprises in an eventual recovery. The handful of strategic plans I just outlined rest on specific, promising technologies our customers can apply across the globe. They will continue to evolve the industry to higher levels of efficiency and safety and lower cost of production. NOV is positioning itself to capitalize on the inevitable upturn, and I'm excited about the optionality embedded in our initiatives, and more so, the creativity and ingenuity that our teammates here at NOV continue to apply to our customers' challenges. 
While we are not planning for a recovery in 2016, we are encouraged by reports from some customers that they are beginning to think about a potential upturn in the second half of the year, as oil production has finally begun to roll over and demand continues to march upward. We will continue to manage costs to the reality of the marketplace in the short term, which is becoming more challenging as very low volumes present rising absorption challenges for us. 
Even with a rebound in oil prices, it will take time for our customers to repair balance sheets, to complete their drilled but uncompleted wells, to work down oil inventories and access capital to resume drilling. But the industry will navigate these challenges, and NOV will be here with an enhanced offering and greater levels of efficiency. 
I'm grateful to be part of such an entrepreneurial, smart organization with deep financial resources and diverse business models and bright opportunities in our future. This has always been a deeply cyclical industry, and our leaders have been through many downturns before, and they will again lead us through the present storm. Oilfield services is not much fun right now, and I want to let all of our employees know that Jose, Loren and I appreciate you suiting up every day and fighting the good fight. Hang in there. Better days lie ahead. Jose?"

Consolidated revenues were $2.2 billion for the first quarter of 2016",3178,"As Clay mentioned, NOV posted a $0.06 per share loss for the quarter, excluding severance, restructuring and other items, which totaled $147 million pretax or $0.26 per share after tax. Consolidated revenues were $2.2 billion for the first quarter of 2016, down 20% from the fourth quarter of '15 and 55% year-over-year. The sharp decline during the quarter was a result of significant E&P spending curtailments as oil prices reach new lows. Average U.S. land rig count fell 27% sequentially, exiting the quarter at 450, the lowest count since the 1940s. And the average international rig count fell 8%, hitting a decade low at 985 rigs, with declines seen across all major regions of the globe. 
All of NOV's business units and global regions were negatively impacted, and all reporting segments saw revenue declines during the quarter. EBITDA decreased to $127 million or 5.8% of sales, resulting in sequential EBITDA decremental leverage of 37% and year-over-year decremental leverage of 29%. Operating loss, excluding other items, was $48 million. 
Looking at some of the other line items of the P&L, SG&A decreased by $31 million or 8% sequentially and by $138 million or 28% year-over-year as we continue to execute cost control measures necessary to size our business with current market environment. 
Interest and other financial costs decreased $2 million sequentially and $1 million year-over-year, primarily due to banking -- lower banking fees associated with a reduction in letters of credit outstanding. We reported a $3 million higher loss sequentially in unconsolidated affiliates related to our Voest-Alpine joint venture, where demand for OCTV or Green Tubing remained exceedingly low, given the dearth of drillpipe demand. 
Other expenses for the quarter increased $4 million sequentially, driven primarily by a greater loss on disposals of fixed assets. 
Our GAAP effective tax rate was 50% for the quarter. The unusually high rate was a result of combining losses in higher tax jurisdictions, namely the U.S., with income from lower rate international jurisdictions. Additionally, we received a tax benefit associated with reversing reserves or tax audits which concluded with favorable outcomes. With a relatively low levels of pretax income and losses that we are currently experiencing, relatively small changes in the split between domestic and international results can have a disproportionate impact on our effective tax rate. Notwithstanding this uncertainty and anticipated volatility, our current estimate for the effective tax rate is 35% for the remainder of the year. 
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Working capital decreased $528 million from the fourth quarter of 2015 to $4.9 billion at March 31, 2016. The decrease in working capital is primarily the result of the $714 million reduction in accounts receivable, $144 million reduction in inventory levels and an $84 million decrease in customer financing, which is the net of prepayment and billings in excess of cost against cost in excess of billings. The reductions in working capital were partially offset by decreases in accrued liabilities and accounts payable. 
Our focus on collections yielded strong results during the quarter, although inventory is not liquidating as quickly as we'd like, reflecting lower current levels of demand. We anticipate working capital will continue to be a source of cash as our revenues move lower, but we expect the pace of cash flow generation to slow relative to the past 2 quarters. The reduction in working capital helped contribute to an exceptional quarter of cash flow generation relative to the current market environment. 
NOV generated $621 million in cash flow from operations during the first quarter. After paying $173 million in dividends, $84 million for nonacquisition-related capital expenditure investments and $21 million for acquisitions and adding a foreign exchange benefit and other items totaling $20 million, we netted $363 million in free cash flow. 
Additionally, we successfully repatriated another $637 million in cash from overseas at very low cost, allowing us to reduce our commercial paper balances by $683 million to a quarter-end balance of $210 million. This paydown of debt was partially offset by a capital lease associated with a large new facility which came onto our books during the quarter. The building will allow us to consolidate approximately 1,600 personnel from 12 existing NOV facilities, of which 10 will be fully vacated after we finish moving into this new facility. 
At March 31, we had cash balance of $1.8 billion, total debt of $3.4 billion and our debt to capitalization was 17.1%, down from 19.2% at year-end. 
As Loren mentioned in his introductory remarks, we made a few changes to the presentation of certain information in our release this morning, which we hope will enhance our reader's ability to understand NOV and its financial performance. One of the changes relate to the presentation of our segment results. In order to provide a clear measurement of our reporting segments, we are no longer allocating certain corporate overhead cost to our segment results, and we are now capturing these costs in the line item Eliminations and Corporate Costs. We have revised prior period amounts to make the segment performance comparable. And when we speak to segment results this morning, we'll be referring to the reclassified results presented in our earnings release. 
In today's release, we also provided the specific amounts now deemed corporate costs for each period presented. However, we do not anticipate breaking these costs out in the future. 
Our Rig Systems segment generated first quarter revenue of $926 million, down 9% from $1 billion earned last quarter. For the first quarter, the split between offshore and land-related revenue was 75% and 25%, respectively. New construction of offshore rigs accounted for $431 million in revenues or 20% of NOV's consolidated revenues. 
First quarter EBITDA for the Rig Systems segment was $137 million. After 4 quarters of exceptional decremental margin management, our Rig Systems segment saw a significant decline in margins in the first quarter. Margins fell 630 basis points or 14.8% of sales, representing 87% of decrementals on 9% lower sequential revenues. Operating profit was $119 million or 12.8% of sales. 
Lower margins arose from the much sharper than anticipated fall in spare part sales in our aftermarket business, meaningfully impacting absorption within Rig Systems segment's facilities that manufacture those products. Additionally, while cost reductions are underway, their pace simply can't always keep up with sharp volume declines, particularly when you're trying to be thoughtful in your actions while treating people as well as you reasonably can during this difficult time. Bottom line is that the lower anticipated margins for the result of lower throughput in our manufacturing facilities combined with a slowdown in cost reduction efforts relative to the fall-off in volumes. 
On a year-over-year basis, first quarter revenue was down 63% at only 25% decremental margins. The solid year-over-year decrementals in the face of a nearly 2/3 revenue decline have been accomplished by significant in-sourcing from our external supply chain, but these opportunities are diminishing. 
New orders were $97 million in the first quarter, representing a book-to-bill of only 13% when compared to the $770 million shipped out of backlog. Q1 bookings were composed entirely of discrete capital equipment, including cranes, pressure control and jacking systems. For the second straight quarter, we received no new rig orders. 
As we note in our press release, effective March 31, 2016, we have deducted the backlog we previously disclosed for rigs being constructed in Brazil to reflect Sete's shareholder approval to file for bankruptcy protection last week, along with other orders for which we have not been paid in over a year, totaling approximately $2.1 billion. Although our contracts with the 3 yards remain in place and are enforceable, work on all these projects has been suspended pending payment and will remain so until customers make funds available to advance the projects, leading us to report backlog more conservatively. Therefore, ending backlog was $3.3 billion for Rig Systems, and we expect $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion of this backlog to be converted to revenue through the remainder of 2016 for a full year revenue from backlog number of about $2 billion to $2.1 billion. 
Looking at the second quarter, we anticipate a much sharper, up to 30% fall-off in revenue as we continue to work off backlog on existing projects. We anticipate much improved decremental margins, approximately 30% as savings from our latest cost-cutting efforts are fully realized but are more than offset by declining volumes. 
Our Rig Aftermarket segment generated $391 million of revenue during the first quarter of 2016, down 31% from the $569 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, and down 46% from the $719 million in the first quarter of 2015. Revenue declines were anticipated in the first quarter due to deteriorating market conditions and the normal fall-off of year-end service and repair work. However, sharper fall-off and activity levels versus expectations amplify the decline and further eroded demand for spare parts as our drilling contracts for customers, offshore in particular, cut their expenditures on repairs, services and spare parts dramatically across the board. 
EBITDA was $82 million, down 43% sequentially and down 62% from the prior year. Decrementals were 35%, driving EBITDA margins down to 21%. While a mix shift from spares to service and repair and some pricing pressure contributed to the profitability decline, the largest driver was reduced volumes, which resulted in lower absorption in our facilities and lower utilization of our service and repair personnel. 
Operating profit was $77 million or 19.7% of sales. Special Periodic Survey work continues, but we are seeing significant reductions in the scope on these surveys, and other long-planned SPS projects are being canceled lately in view of grim prospects for these offshore rigs winning contracts anytime soon. Additionally, we are seeing pricing pressures continue to mount. Looking forward, we expect revenues to come down in the mid-single-digit percentage point range, with sequential EBITDA decrementals in line with Q1's results. 
Thinking longer term, we believe Rig Aftermarket will be an early beneficiary of activity recovery, as we work with our customers to provide the necessary parts, service, repair and maintenance required to put their rigs back to work. 
Additionally, we believe new U.S. offshore BOP regulations will drive additional demand for condition-based monitoring services, which we have been providing for over 5 years.
Our Wellbore Technologies segment generated revenues of $631 million during the first quarter of 2016, down 17% sequentially from the $757 million and down 46% from the $1.2 billion posted in the first quarter of 2015. Revenue mix by destination was 46% North America and 54% international. 70% of the segment's decline came from international markets, which declined 22% sequentially, most acutely in Asia and Latin America. The U.S. declined 16% sequentially, better than the 26% decline in the U.S. rig count, indicating that despite intense pricing pressures, the group's revenue per rig improved on market share gains. EBITDA for the segment was $43 million or 6.8% of sales, down 44% from the previous quarter and 82% from the prior year. Sequentially, EBITDA decremental leverage was limited to 27% on $126 million in revenue decline, as the group experienced the full benefits of cost reductions made last quarter and continues to eliminate substantial portions of this cost structure, including the closure of more than 20 facilities during the first quarter of 2016. Operating loss for the segment was $53 million. 
Quotation activity from the downhole tools segment is increasing, and we believe that even a leveling of activity will bring more work as customers are depleting their stocks of equipment and tools coming in from jobs not being repaired. Therefore, we expect -- we, therefore, expect to repair work and motor relines to begin to rise through the year as customers run out of tools. We began manufacturing downhole tools in new plants in Saudi Arabia and Russia during the first quarter. Drillpipe demand remains very low, and we have mothballed much of our capacity as a result, but Q2 benefited from a high mix of large diameter, premium thread drillpipe. Our Tuboscope unit saw a pipe mill and processor activity fall owing to 12 months of OCTG inventory on the ground in North America, 5 to 6 months is the normalized average. However, we are beginning to see some interest in completion and workover activity, which may drive demand for coating and inspection work at the back half of the year, along with higher demand for sucker rod services for artificial lift. 
Wellsite Services saw a significant decline in revenues tied to rig counts, but aggressive cost control enabled the group to post higher EBITDA sequentially. We noted a number of wins in our press release and in Clay's remarks, but I'd like to further highlight some of the recent successes and market share gains, particularly related to our downhole tool and drilling and optimization businesses. 
Our drill bit designs continue to set new performance records globally, most recently in Oman, where an operator set 3 new field records using our Tektonic bits to drill 8,000-plus feet in any single run. Since their introduction in October 2015, Tektonic bits have logged 22 field records in 10 countries around the globe. Additionally, our Dynamic Drilling Solutions business continues to gain traction with its eVolve optimization and closed-loop drilling automation services. 
In our release, we highlighted the completion of an 18-month project in the Norwegian North Sea with a major integrated oil company in developing a field that consists of oil reservoir and several deeper, structurally complex, high-pressure gas and condensate reservoirs. Wells drilled in this field have a narrow pressure window that requires a comprehensive understanding of the conditions in the formation and that leaves little room for error in order to optimize economics associated with the development of the field. 
Our suite of tools provided the customer with high-speed streaming downhole data used to actively analyze wellbore conditions, which enabled a customer to have the data required to justify extending laterals well beyond their originally planned pipe design. By extending the wellbore, the customer significantly increased production from the wells drilled, therefore, eliminating the need for the final well included in the original project plan. Given the cost of drilling in the North Sea, you can appreciate how our technologies reduce the customer's development costs substantially. Additionally, we were recently awarded a contract for downhole drilling automation with an independent E&P customer in Western Canada. And as Clay mentioned, we were awarded a 5-year project by a national oilwell -- oil company in North Africa for real-time data acquisition, visualization and optimization. 
The traction we continue to gain with new technologies indicate our customers' persistent desire to seek new and better ways to drill, and we have positioned ourselves as the leading independent provider to help them achieve those goals. 
Notwithstanding the many positive ongoing developments occurring within our Wellbore Technologies segment, our business is primarily driven by drilling-related activities. With Q2 global activity already sharply lower than the Q1 average, we anticipate second quarter revenues will be down approximately 15%. 
Additionally, while we continue to reduce our cost structure, we do not believe we will replicate the success we had in the first quarter managing our decremental margins and anticipate the segment to be at or near breakeven EBITDA. 
The Completion & Production Solutions segment generated revenues of $585 million for the first quarter of 2016, down 25% sequentially and 41% compared to the first quarter of 2015. While all businesses experienced fewer sales, revenue declines were sharpest within the offshore production-related groups, which were coming off record or near record years in [indiscernible]. 
Revenue out of backlog was $330 million, down 28% sequentially. EBITDA for the segment was $48 million or 8.6% of sales, down from 11.9% in Q4 and 18.2% in Q1 of 2015. 
The segment was able to hold decremental EBITDA leverage to 22%, as cost savings realized from facility consolidations and headcount reductions helped soften the impact of declining revenues. Operating loss for the segment was $4 million. Revenues for intervention, stimulation and wireline equipment continued to decline, particularly across North America, while the Middle East has remained comparatively strong. Aftermarket spares and services for stimulation equipment are facing considerable headwinds as customers aggressively cannibalize fleets, including acquiring auctioned spreads going for $0.20 on the dollar to part out. 
However, we are encouraged by a recent pickup in quotations for possible orders in the second half of 2016, when some customers believe completion activity will pick up and by sequentially stronger order bookings. 
Our floating production group posted lower revenues as well, but had excellent decrementals due to aggressive downsizing. We continue to advance half a dozen FEED studies for FPSO-related projects, but final investment decisions have been nonexistent as customers recycle designs and concepts to reduce costs. 
Our flexible pipe business fell sharply as our plant in Brazil ran out of orders in December. However, the group landed significant orders which will lead to revenue growth in Q2 and should load the plant through the remainder of the year. 
Our composite pipe business unit fell during the first quarter, but again, aggressive cost control lead to an improvement in EBITDA in the first quarter and orders improved. Process and flow technologies also posted higher EBITDA on flat revenues, owing to significant restructuring that went on last year and favorable mix as the group won record levels of orders for production chokes. New orders were $328 million, up $56 million or 26%, resulting in a 99% book-to-bill in the first quarter. Segment ended the quarter with a backlog balance of $994 million. 
While we experienced a sharp quarterly decline and industry activity levels continue to fall, we believe achieving a book-to-bill approaching 100% is an indicator that the CAPS segment is rapidly approaching the bottom. But as those orders don't immediately convert to revenue, we expect segment revenue to decrease in the mid- to upper single-digit percentage range in the second quarter. Cost savings, which was positively impacted Q1 results, are expected to continue but not to the same magnitude on decremental margins as we experienced in the first quarter, which should lead to decrementals in the mid-30% range. Visibility on new order intake remains cloudy, particularly in the offshore space, as industry continues its deepwater cost recalibration. That said, we anticipate that new orders will see a slight pick up during the second quarter. 
In summary, our first quarter results reflect the fact that we are in an extremely challenging market environment. Despite current conditions, we continue to generate substantial amounts of free cash flow, even while we make meaningful investments in our ability to continue delivering better technologies and solutions for our customers in the oil and gas space. We expect the near-term environment to remain difficult. However, we are growing more optimistic that we are nearing the bottom of the cycle, and we're excited about the future value that the hard-working and innovative people of NOV will deliver to our customers and our shareholders as the recovery takes hold. 
With that, we'd like to open it up for questions."

But thinking about National Oilwell, there's clearly a division between the thought around your rig construction and that of your shorter cycle opportunity. And I kind of remember back in the mid- late 90s in Grant Prideco and how it surprised all of us by its kind of operating leverage and even National Oilwell before Varco and all its motors and downhole tools, et cetera and the early cycle characteristics of that. So I wonder if you could share your high-level thoughts on kind of the early cycle component of National Oilwell, how it's changed from those days, your philosophy and how you're building it out."

A lot -- it's been a systematic, steady application of capital over the years to very attractive businesses like Grant Prideco's drillpipe business. I think as you're aware, 97% of the acquisition capital we've deployed through the last decade-plus have been in areas outside of rigs. We have a great franchise in building rigs and very proud of that, have done a great job. But looking forward, I think as the cycle recovers, we're going to benefit from investments like that. Drillpipe demand comes back, that drives high -- very high operating leverage and high levels of profitability, particularly for our offering, which is -- which rest on a lot of our premium technology, especially at drillpipe, we used to drill more complex well pads, for instance. As we noted in our comments, we expect to see rising demand in downhole tools. And we've been developing internally, as well as through acquisition, new offerings in that arena. And as recovery comes back, I think we'll see a response there. As Jose mentioned, our Rig Aftermarket business, our customers really have cut spending to bare bones and are relying on cannibalization of many of the fleets that are out there. That can't last forever, and so recovery I think we'll see in Rig Aftermarket. And finally, Completion & Production Solutions, through the last decade, we've added new products there to help our customers improve economics in the deepwater, so things like [indiscernible] pipe that we referenced build out our offering, of composite offerings, so now we're the largest provider of flexible composite piping, for instance, and flow lines. So all of these businesses, we expect in an upturn, to benefit pretty early. And so we're well poised and positioned, I think, as activity starts to come back and our customer starts to invest more again to take advantage of that."

We are downsizing in response to what we anticipate will be lower demand for at least the next few years and possibly beyond. But to clarify, Rig Systems business is composed of manufacturing operations that make drilling components that support both land and offshore as well as spare parts to support the Rig Aftermarket business. And in reality is that although we break it out to enhance our disclosure to the investing public, the Rig Aftermarket and the Rig Systems segments, in many ways, really constitute one big global business, and they support all aspects of drilling from offshore rigs to land rigs to the spare parts, maintenance, special-purpose survey projects and repair that's out there. So we are moving our cost structure down, retrenching. As you know, in the past, we relied on a balanced mix between internal manufacturing as well as outsourcing. And so kind of the first actions we took in -- through 2015 was to minimize our outsourcing and bring more in-house. We're continuing to do that, but also looking at continuing to kind of reduce our footprint to cope with lower volumes. What I would tell you is although orders are very, very slowed down, business is obviously down to sort of subsystems levels. Looking out in coming quarters, we expect to see a resumption of land rig projects. We have a number of conversations underway around the globe. We expect to see drilling contractors continuing to upgrade their equipment and make their rigs more competitive in a market that's a little tougher on them. We expect to see -- we're investing in some new products. I don't think we mentioned on the call, but some mew products to upgrade those rigs that we're pretty excited about. So we will retrench down to fit the volume that we foresee out there for the next 2 years as well as continue to invest in our other 2 products -- 2 segments that have a lot of very bright prospects in a recovery."

So what I would say though is in terms of the second half recovery, my comments were more directed to Wellbore Technologies, Completion & Production Services specifically, where we're getting very, very anecdotal. But a few customers really talking explicitly about a second half recovery. And quotation volumes around that potential scenario is starting to go up. I'll stress, Bill, these are quotations, not POs. So we'll see how that plays out. But we're encouraged by that. In terms of sort of mid-cycle, peak cycle kind of EBITDA margins, we've always been attracted to sort of high operating leverage businesses, and we have a lot of that in our mix, one. Two, there's been an awful lot of cost reductions underway, both in our enterprise and around the industry. And the really great thing about the recoveries, when they come, is it doesn't take much incremental volume to flow in. And you really have become sort of hyper efficient at generating profitability out of that. We've seen that in prior upcycles. So when the turn comes, you have a lean, mean fighting force out there executing very skillfully, very efficiently. And when the volume comes beyond that, you start to get a little more pricing leverage. So you can start to undo some of the discounting that happened in the prior downturn.

But also I'd point out, Brazil is still the second largest deepwater drilling market in the world right now, and we still have significant business in Brazil. So we've made investments down there to support the program. Our expectation is we're going to sort of ship those -- more support ongoing drilling activity in the future. But we've been trimming the cost position there along the way."

National Oilwell Varco's first quarter 2016 financial results reflect the painful financial stress that our oil and gas customers are operating under. As WTI prices marched steadily downward to bottom at $26 per barrel in mid-February, c",1799,"Thank you, Loren. National Oilwell Varco's first quarter 2016 financial results reflect the painful financial stress that our oil and gas customers are operating under. As WTI prices marched steadily downward to bottom at $26 per barrel in mid-February, customers simply stopped spending, and oilfield activity plummeted further. Consequently, our first quarter revenues fell 20% sequentially to $2.2 billion, and are down 62% from the fourth quarter of 2014, when the current down cycle started. The company posted a $0.06 per fully diluted share loss for the first quarter of 2016, excluding severance, restructuring and other items totaling $0.26 per fully diluted share. 
EBITDA was $127 million for the quarter or 5.8% of revenue, and operating loss was $48 million or negative 2.2% of revenue, excluding restructuring and other items from both. 
Sequential EBITDA decremental leverage was 37% on a 20% revenue decline. And year-over-year EBITDA decremental leverage was 29% on a 55% revenue decline, excluding restructuring and other items from all quarters. In a moment, Jose will take you through a more detailed discussion of operating results. 
Our restructuring efforts accelerated during the quarter as we continued to aggressively manage costs downward. We have closed or are closing 200 facilities since the downturn began, and we reduced our workforce by nearly 6,000 employees during the first quarter of 2016. SG&A expenses declined $31 million in the quarter sequentially and is down $180 million or 34% from late 2014. 
Importantly, while we downsize, we are also maintaining our investment in the future, including $110 million invested in the first quarter on engineering, research and development into emerging technologies and products, which will further reduce production costs, increase access to reserves, improve safety and reduce the impact on the environment for our customers. 
We closed 4 small acquisitions in the quarter which collectively bring new technology to our portfolio: specifically, surface rig instrumentation; downhole measurement while drilling technologies; and drillpipe asset tracking utilizing RFID chip technology. Each of these acquisitions complement our own internal organic investments that advance our long-term strategic plans. 
I'd like to take a moment this morning and share with you just how we see our future unfolding and how these investments in our long-term strategic plan articulate with that future. 
First, horizontal drilling and geosteering are key enabling technologies of the shale revolution. 90% of U.S. land rigs drilling today are drilling horizontally, or at least directionally, a share which has actually increased from 79% since the downturn began in the fourth quarter of 2014. Horizontal drilling, which opens up much more of the reservoir to the wellbore, will expand globally and be applied more widely in the inevitable upturn. Therefore, NOV has developed a new low-cost rotarysteerable tool, which will be run commercially in our customer's hole for the first time next week. This new product complements our comprehensive bottom hole assembly or BHA offering to the directional drilling industry. 
Our Tektonic family of abrasion-resistant fixed cutter bits are gaining market share, as is our new ERT downhole drilling motor. And we added new MWD products through an acquisition in the first quarter as well. These tools work with our jars, shock subs, drill collars and premium drillpipe, engineered to withstand the considerable rigors of horizontal drilling. Our long-term strategic plan in this area is built on our view that the next upcycle will see even greater demand for drilling tools for horizontal drilling, which will be provided by directional drilling service industry that NOV will continue to equip. 
Second, North American shale plays endured lengthy gestation periods before they evolved to profitability, as the E&Ps experimented with drilling techniques to arrive at the most cost-effective methods to drive marginal cost per barrel sufficiently low to be financially attractive investments. In the next upcycle, NOV can help short-circuit that empirical technique, using our closed-loop automated drilling service, which has proven it can materially reduce drilling costs by making microsecond level adjustments to the drilling rig through our proprietary rig control system and software. We are bidding or executing over a dozen closed-loop automated drilling projects currently, utilizing our proprietary IntelliServ wired drill pipe. We are also seeing more interest from drilling contractors wishing to differentiate their rigs by outfitting them with IntelliServ wired drill pipe. In fact, we know of an idled rig that was recently put back to work solely because it was outfitted with IntelliServ pipe, a big win for its owner. Our long-term strategic plan is built on the view that E&P companies will prospect new shale plays globally using rigs capable of closed-loop automated drilling: Tier 1 AC rigs, wired IntelliServ drill pipe, bottom hole assembly components and NOVOS software, all of which NOV can provide today. 
During the first quarter, NOV was awarded a major 5-year project in North Africa for a real-time technology center to track drilling rig operations, and we are currently bidding other similar projects. NOV has provided real-time remote monitoring of equipment for many years. A few weeks ago, we announced the industry's first predictive capabilities for monitoring BOP components through our RIGSENTRY remote condition-based monitoring services. We believe that condition-based remote monitoring of oilfield equipment and predictive data analytics will grow in importance in the next upturn, as the industry increasingly employs more sophisticated equipment and more demanding environments. 
The Internet of Things is coming to the oilfield, and NOV will continue to lead the way, and will benefit from the largest installed base of drilling equipment and drilling control systems in the world. 
Hydraulic fracture stimulation is another enabling technology with proven value to the industry. We're investing in new technologies which we believe can reduce the capital equipment on site, the number of truckloads required, the power requirements and the operating costs of conventional frac fleets. Our long-term strategic plan has us investing in better ways to our hydraulically stimulate reservoirs. Again, the next upturn will see more widespread application of fracture stimulation, and we plan to provide the next generation of tools. 
The oil and gas industry has invested billions in deepwater exploration, chalking up more than 400 undeveloped discoveries, and our strategic plan targets improving floating production technologies to lower the development cost of these reserves. We are targeting a new fully costed production solution to offer to owners of marginal deepwater fields by early 2017. Preliminary discussions with IOCs around our new, innovative concepts have been met with high levels of enthusiasm. Specifically, these are smaller standardized units which can operate efficiently across a broader range of production, which utilize standardized disconnectable turrets to increase asset utilization and efficiency. 
On the seafloor, we are expanding our offering in flexible pipe, connectors and other hardware, along with seawater treatment technologies for subsea seawater injection, which increases the ultimate recovery from reservoirs through pressure maintenance, ultimately lowering cost per barrel. 
We continue -- we are continuing to expand our offering of composite materials into both offshore and land markets, partly through an acquisition we closed in the fourth quarter. Composite materials offer superior corrosion resistance in the flow lines we supply and lighter weights which drive down offshore vessel construction costs. 
Our long-term plan continues to advance these technologies, which will see increased uptake in a recovery. As the largest provider of fiberglass and composite tubulars to the oilfield in the world, NOV is well positioned to continue to drive corrosion-resistant solutions. 
Onshore, we are focused on other technologies which help our customers reduce their cost of production. The U.S. is really a 60 million barrel per day water industry that produces 9 billion -- 9 million barrels a day of oil as a byproduct. Our WaterWolf technology offers superior oil/water separation and complements our proprietary sand separation technologies and extensive production pump business. 
Our long-term plan also invests strategically in key productive regions like Saudi Arabia and Russia, where we began fabricating our first land rig and downhole tools at a new plant we opened in the first quarter. 
NOV is an innovative, entrepreneurial organization resolutely focused on improving the cost per barrel position of our customers, through technology, improved supply chain, standardization and industrialization. Our experience is that business models such as these, built on sound fundamentals that focus on our customers' needs, are long-term winners. They're in contrast to new business models, which seem to arise during downturns, which focus on either providing our customers with increasingly valuable capital they cannot access elsewhere or business models wherein we shoulder more of our customers' risk. Prior cycles have demonstrated that these models frequently do not turn out so well. 
As we approach the bottom of this sharp downcycle, our customers are struggling to make money right now, and the oilfield services industry is being radically disassembled to cope with commodity prices far below levels required to return to production growth. This is not sustainable and will change. 
Investors are understandably focused on optionality of enterprises in an eventual recovery. The handful of strategic plans I just outlined rest on specific, promising technologies our customers can apply across the globe. They will continue to evolve the industry to higher levels of efficiency and safety and lower cost of production. NOV is positioning itself to capitalize on the inevitable upturn, and I'm excited about the optionality embedded in our initiatives and, more so, the creativity and ingenuity that our teammates here at NOV continue to apply to our customers' challenges. 
While we are not planning for a recovery in 2016, we are encouraged by reports from some customers that they are beginning to think about a potential upturn in the second half of the year, as oil production has finally begun to roll over and demand continues to march upward. We will continue to manage costs to the reality of the marketplace in the short term, which is becoming more challenging as very low volumes present rising absorption challenges for us. 
Even with a rebound in oil prices, it will take time for our customers to repair balance sheets, to complete their drilled but uncompleted wells, to work down oil inventories and access capital to resume drilling. But the industry will navigate these challenges, and NOV will be here with an enhanced offering and greater levels of efficiency. 
I'm grateful to be part of such an entrepreneurial, smart organization with deep financial resources and diverse business models and bright opportunities in our future. This has always been a deeply cyclical industry, and our leaders have been through many downturns before, and they will again lead us through the present storm. Oilfield services is not much fun right now, and I want to let all of our employees know that Jose, Loren and I appreciate you suiting up every day and fighting the good fight. Hang in there. Better days lie ahead. 
Jose?"
31900,326268360,966302,"National Oilwell Varco, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2016",2016-04-28,"Earnings Calls","NOV Inc.","Executives","As Clay mentioned, NOV posted a $0.06 per share loss for the quarter, excluding severance, restructuring and other items, which totaled $147 million pretax or $0.26 per share after tax. Consolidated revenues were $2.2 billion for the first quarter of 20",3179,"As Clay mentioned, NOV posted a $0.06 per share loss for the quarter, excluding severance, restructuring and other items, which totaled $147 million pretax or $0.26 per share after tax. 
Consolidated revenues were $2.2 billion for the first quarter of 2016, down 20% from the fourth quarter of '15 and 55% year-over-year. The sharp decline during the quarter was a result of significant E&P spending curtailments as oil prices reached new lows. The average U.S. land rig count fell 27% sequentially, exiting the quarter at 450, the lowest count since the 1940s. And the average international rig count fell 8%, hitting a decade low at 985 rigs, with declines seen across all major regions of the globe. All of NOV's business units and global regions were negatively impacted, and all reporting segments saw revenue declines during the quarter. 
EBITDA decreased to $127 million or 5.8% of sales, resulting in sequential EBITDA decremental leverage of 37% and year-over-year decremental leverage of 29%. Operating loss, excluding other items, was $48 million. 
Looking at some of the other line items of the P&L. SG&A decreased by $31 million or 8% sequentially and by $138 million or 28% year-over-year as we continue to execute cost-control measures necessary to size our business with the current market environment. 
Interest and other financial costs decreased $2 million sequentially and $1 million year-over-year, primarily due to banking -- lower banking fees associated with a reduction in letters of credit outstanding. We reported a $3 million higher loss sequentially in unconsolidated affiliates related to our Voest-Alpine joint venture, where demand for OCTV or Green Tubing remains exceedingly low, given the dearth of drillpipe demand. 
Other expenses for the quarter increased $4 million sequentially, driven primarily by a greater loss on disposals of fixed assets. 
Our GAAP effective tax rate was 50% for the quarter. The unusually high rate was a result of combining losses in higher tax jurisdictions, namely the U.S., with income from lower rate international jurisdictions. Additionally, we received a tax benefit associated with reversing reserves for tax audits which concluded with favorable outcomes. With the relatively low levels of pretax income and losses that we are currently experiencing, relatively small changes in the split between domestic and international results can have a disproportionate impact on our effective tax rate. Notwithstanding this uncertainty and anticipated volatility, our current estimate for the effective tax rate is 35% for the remainder of the year. 
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Working capital decreased $528 million from the fourth quarter of 2015 to $4.9 billion at March 31, 2016. The decrease in working capital was primarily the result of a $714 million reduction in accounts receivable, $144 million reduction in inventory levels and an $84 million decrease in customer financing, which is the net of prepayment and billings in excess of costs against costs in excess of billings. The reductions in working capital were partially offset by decreases in accrued liabilities and accounts payable. 
Our focus on collections yielded strong results during the quarter, although inventory is not liquidating as quickly as we'd like, reflecting lower current levels of demand. We anticipate working capital will continue to be a source of cash as our revenues move lower, but we expect the pace of cash flow generation to slow relative to the past 2 quarters. The reduction in working capital helped contribute to an exceptional quarter of cash flow generation relative to the current market environment. 
NOV generated $621 million in cash flow from operations during the first quarter. After paying $173 million in dividends, $84 million for nonacquisition-related capital expenditure investments and $21 million for acquisitions, and adding a foreign exchange benefit and other items totaling $20 million, we netted $363 million in free cash flow. 
Additionally, we successfully repatriated another $637 million in cash from overseas at a very low cost, allowing us to reduce our commercial paper balances by $683 million to a quarter-end balance of $210 million. This paydown of debt was partially offset by a capital lease associated with a large new facility which came onto our books during the quarter. The building will allow us to consolidate approximately 1,600 personnel from 12 existing NOV facilities, of which 10 will be fully vacated after we finish moving into this new facility. 
At March 31, we had a cash balance of $1.8 billion, total debt of $3.4 billion and our debt to capitalization was 17.1%, down from 19.2% at year-end. 
As Loren mentioned in his introductory remarks, we made a few changes to the presentation of certain information in our release this morning, which we hope will enhance a reader's ability to understand NOV and its financial performance. One of the changes relates to the presentation of our segment results. 
In order to provide a clear measurement of our reporting segments, we are no longer allocating certain corporate overhead costs to our segment results, and we are now capturing these costs in the line item Eliminations and Corporate Costs. We have revised prior period amounts to make the segment performance comparable. And when we speak to segment results this morning, we'll be referring to the reclassified results presented in our earnings release. 
In today's release, we also provided the specific amounts now deemed corporate costs for each period presented. However, we do not anticipate breaking these costs out in the future. 
Our Rig Systems segment generated first quarter revenue of $926 million, down 9% from $1 billion earned last quarter. For the first quarter, the split between offshore and land-related revenue was 75% and 25%, respectively. New construction of offshore rigs accounted for $431 million in revenues or 20% of NOV's consolidated revenues. 
First quarter EBITDA for the Rig Systems segment was $137 million. After 4 quarters of exceptional decremental margin management, our Rig Systems segment saw a significant decline in margins in the first quarter. Margins fell 630 basis points to 14.8% of sales, representing 87% decrementals on 9% lower sequential revenues. Operating profit was $119 million or 12.8% of sales. 
Lower margins arose from the much sharper than anticipated fall in spare part sales in our aftermarket business, meaningfully impacting absorption within Rig Systems segment's facilities that manufacture those products. Additionally, while cost reductions are underway, their pace simply can't always keep up with sharp volume declines, particularly when you're trying to be thoughtful in your actions while treating people as well as you reasonably can during this difficult time. Bottom line is that the lower anticipated margins were the result of lower throughput in our manufacturing facilities combined with a slowdown in cost-reduction efforts relative to the fall-off in volumes. 
On a year-over-year basis, first quarter revenue was down 63% at only 25% decremental margins. The solid year-over-year decrementals in the face of a nearly 2/3 revenue decline have been accomplished by significant in-sourcing from our external supply chain, but these opportunities are diminishing. 
New orders were $97 million in the first quarter, representing a book-to-bill of only 13% when compared to the $770 million shipped out of backlog. Q1 bookings were composed entirely of discrete capital equipment, including cranes, pressure control and jacking systems. For the second straight quarter, we received no new rig orders. 
As we note in our press release, effective March 31, 2016, we have deducted the backlog we previously disclosed for rigs being constructed in Brazil to reflect Sete's shareholder approval to file for bankruptcy protection last week, along with other orders for which we have not been paid in over a year, totaling approximately $2.1 billion. Although our contracts with the 3 yards remain in place and are enforceable, work on all these projects has been suspended pending payment and will remain so until customers make funds available to advance the projects, leading us to report backlog more conservatively. Therefore, ending backlog was $3.3 billion for Rig Systems, and we expect $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion of this backlog to be converted to revenue through the remainder of 2016 for a full year revenue from backlog number of about $2 billion to $2.1 billion. 
Looking at the second quarter, we anticipate a much sharper, up to 30%, fall-off in revenue as we continue to work off backlog on existing projects. We anticipate much improved decremental margins of approximately 30% as savings from our latest cost-cutting efforts are fully realized but are more than offset by declining volumes. 
Our Rig Aftermarket segment generated $391 million of revenue during the first quarter of 2016, down 31% from the $569 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, and down 46% from the $719 million in the first quarter of 2015. Revenue declines were anticipated in the first quarter due to deteriorating market conditions and the normal fall-off of year-end service and repair work. However, sharper fall-off in activity levels versus expectations amplified the decline and further eroded demand for spare parts as our drilling contractor customers, offshore in particular, cut their expenditures on repairs, services and spare parts dramatically across the board. 
EBITDA was $82 million, down 43% sequentially and down 62% from the prior year. Decrementals were 35%, driving EBITDA margins down to 21%. While a mix shift from spares to service and repair and some pricing pressure contributed to the profitability decline, the largest driver was reduced volumes, which resulted in lower absorption in our facilities and lower utilization of our service and repair personnel. Operating profit was $77 million or 19.7% of sales. 
Special Periodic Survey work continues, but we are seeing significant reductions in the scope on these surveys, and other long-planned SPS projects are being canceled lately in view of grim prospects for these offshore rigs winning contracts anytime soon. Additionally, we are seeing pricing pressures continue to mount. 
Looking forward, we expect revenues to come down in the mid-single-digit percentage point range, with sequential EBITDA decrementals in line with Q1's results. 
Thinking longer term, we believe Rig Aftermarket will be an early beneficiary of activity recovery, as we work with our customers to provide the necessary parts, service, repair and maintenance required to put their rigs back to work. 
Additionally, we believe new U.S. offshore BOP regulations will drive additional demand for condition-based monitoring services, which we have been providing for over 5 years.
Our Wellbore Technologies segment generated revenues of $631 million during the first quarter of 2016, down 17% sequentially from the $757 million and down 46% from the $1.2 billion posted in the first quarter of 2015. Revenue mix by destination was 46% North America and 54% international. 70% of the segment's decline came from international markets, which declined 22% sequentially, most acutely in Asia and Latin America. The U.S. declined 16% sequentially, better than the 26% decline in the U.S. rig count, indicating that despite intense pricing pressures, the group's revenue per rig improved on market share gains. 
EBITDA for the segment was $43 million or 6.8% of sales, down 44% from the previous quarter and 82% from the prior year. Sequentially, EBITDA decremental leverage was limited to 27% on the $126 million in revenue decline, as the group experienced the full benefits of cost reductions made last quarter and continues to eliminate substantial portions of its cost structure, including the closure of more than 20 facilities during the first quarter of 2016. Operating loss for the segment was $53 million. 
Quotation activity from the downhole tools segment is increasing, and we believe that even a leveling of activity will bring more work as customers are depleting their stocks of equipment and tools coming in from jobs not being repaired. Therefore, expect -- we, therefore, expect repair work and motor relines to begin to rise through the year as customers run out of tools. We began manufacturing downhole tools in new plants in Saudi Arabia and Russia during the first quarter. Drillpipe demand remains very low, and we have mothballed much of our capacity as a result, but Q2 benefited from a high mix of large diameter, premium thread drillpipe. Our Tuboscope unit saw pipe mill and processor activity fall owing to 12 months of OCTG inventory on the ground in North America; 5 to 6 months is the normalized average. However, we are beginning to see some interest in completion and workover activity, which may drive demand for coating and inspection work in the back half of the year, along with higher demand for sucker rod services for artificial lift. 
Wellsite Services saw a significant decline in revenues tied to rig counts, but aggressive cost control enabled the group to post higher EBITDA sequentially. 
We noted a number of wins in our press release and in Clay's remarks, but I'd like to further highlight some of the recent successes and market share gains, particularly related to our downhole tool and drilling and optimization businesses. 
Our drill bit designs continue to set new performance records globally, most recently in Oman, where an operator set 3 new field records using our Tektonic bits to drill 8,000-plus feet in a single run. Since their introduction in October 2015, Tektonic bits have logged 22 field records in 10 countries around the globe. 
Additionally, our Dynamic Drilling Solutions business continues to gain traction with its eVolve optimization and closed-loop drilling automation services. 
In our release, we highlighted the completion of an 18-month project in the Norwegian North Sea with a major integrated oil company in developing a field that consists of oil reservoir and several deeper, structurally complex, high-pressure gas and condensate reservoirs. Wells drilled in this field have a narrow pressure window that requires a comprehensive understanding of the conditions in the formation and that leaves little room for error in order to optimize economics associated with the development of the field. 
Our suite of tools provided the customer with high-speed streaming downhole data used to actively analyze wellbore conditions, which enabled the customer to have the data required to justify extending laterals well beyond their originally planned pipe design. By extending the wellbore, the customer significantly increased production from the wells drilled, therefore, eliminating the need for the final well included in the original project plan. Given the cost of drilling in the North Sea, you can appreciate how our technologies reduced the customer's development costs substantially. 
Additionally, we were recently awarded a contract for downhole drilling automation with an independent E&P customer in Western Canada. And as Clay mentioned, we were awarded a 5-year project by a national oilwell -- oil company in North Africa for real-time data acquisition, visualization and optimization. 
The traction we continue to gain with new technologies indicate our customers' persistent desire to seek new and better ways to drill, and we have positioned ourselves as the leading independent provider to help them achieve those goals. 
Notwithstanding the many positive ongoing developments occurring within our Wellbore Technologies segment, our business is primarily driven by drilling-related activities. With Q2 global activity already sharply lower than the Q1 average, we anticipate second quarter revenues will be down approximately 15%. 
Additionally, while we continue to reduce our cost structure, we do not believe we will replicate the success we had in the first quarter managing our decremental margins and anticipate the segment to be at or near break-even EBITDA. 
The Completion & Production Solutions segment generated revenues of $585 million for the first quarter of 2016, down 25% sequentially and 41% compared to the first quarter of 2015. While all businesses experienced fewer sales, revenue declines were sharpest within the offshore production-related groups, which were coming off record or near record years in 2015. Revenue out of backlog was $330 million, down 28% sequentially. 
EBITDA for the segment was $48 million or 8.6% of sales, down from 11.9% in Q4 and 18.2% in Q1 of 2015. The segment was able to hold decremental EBITDA leverage to 22%, as cost savings realized from facility consolidations and headcount reductions helped soften the impact of declining revenues. Operating loss for the segment was $4 million. 
Revenues for intervention, stimulation and wireline equipment continued to decline, particularly across North America, while the Middle East has remained comparatively strong. Aftermarket spares and services for stimulation equipment are facing considerable headwinds as customers aggressively cannibalize fleets, including acquiring auctioned spreads going for $0.20 on the dollar to part out. 
However, we are encouraged by a recent pickup in quotations for possible orders in the second half of 2016, when some customers believe completion activity will pick up, and by sequentially stronger order bookings. 
Our floating production group posted lower revenues as well, but had excellent decrementals due to aggressive downsizing. We continue to advance half a dozen FEED studies for FPSO-related projects, but final investment decisions have been nonexistent as customers recycle designs and concepts to reduce costs. 
Our flexible pipe business fell sharply as our plant in Brazil ran out of orders in December. However, the group landed significant orders which will lead to revenue growth in Q2 and should load the plant through the remainder of the year. 
Our composite pipe business unit fell during the first quarter, but again, aggressive cost control led to an improvement in EBITDA in the first quarter and orders improved. 
Process and Flow Technologies also posted higher EBITDA on flat revenues, owing to significant restructuring that went on last year and favorable mix as the group won record levels of orders for production chokes. New orders were $328 million, up $56 million or 26%, resulting in a 99% book-to-bill in the first quarter. the segment ended the quarter with a backlog balance of $994 million. 
While we experienced a sharp quarterly decline and industry activity levels continue to fall, we believe achieving a book-to-bill approaching 100% is an indicator that the CAPS segment is rapidly approaching the bottom. But as those orders don't immediately convert to revenue, we expect segment revenue to decrease in the mid- to upper single-digit percentage range in the second quarter. Cost savings, which was positively impacted Q1 results, are expected to continue but not to the same magnitude on decremental margins as we experienced in the first quarter, which should lead to decrementals in the mid-30% range. 
Visibility on new order intake remains cloudy, particularly in the offshore space, as the industry continues its deepwater cost recalibration. That said, we optimistically anticipate that new orders will see a slight tick-up during the second quarter. 
In summary, our first quarter results reflect the fact that we are in an extremely challenging market environment. Despite current conditions, we continue to generate substantial amounts of free cash flow, even while we make meaningful investments in our ability to continue delivering better technologies and solutions for our customers in the oil and gas space. 
We expect the near-term environment to remain difficult. However, we are growing more optimistic that we are nearing the bottom of the cycle, and we're excited about the future value that the hard-working and innovative people of NOV will deliver to our customers and our shareholders as the recovery takes hold. 
With that, we'd like to open it up for questions."

A lot of -- it's been a systematic, steady application of capital over the years to very attractive businesses like Grant Prideco's drillpipe business. I think as you're aware, 97% of the acquisition capital we've deployed through the last decade-plus have been in areas outside of rigs. We have a great franchise in building rigs and very proud of that, have done a great job. But looking forward, I think as the cycle recovers, we're going to benefit from investments like that. Drillpipe demand comes back, that drives high -- very high operating leverage and high levels of profitability, particularly for our offering, which is -- which rests on a lot of premium technology in especially at drillpipe used to drill more complex well pads, for instance. As we noted in our comments, we expect to see rising demand in downhole tools. And we've been developing internally, as well as through acquisition, new offerings in that arena. And as recovery comes back, I think we'll see a response there. As Jose mentioned, our Rig Aftermarket business, customers really have cut spending to bare bones and are relying on cannibalization of many of the fleets that are out there. That can't last forever, and so recovery I think we'll see in Rig Aftermarket. And finally, Completion & Production Solutions, through the last decade, we've added new products there to help our customers improve economics in the deepwater, so things like turret mooring systems, flexible pipe that we referenced built out our offering of composite offerings. So now, we're the largest provider of flexible composite piping, for instance, in flow lines. And so all of these businesses, we expect in an upturn, to benefit pretty early. And so we're well poised and positioned, I think, as activity starts to come back and our customer starts to invest more again to take advantage of that."

We are downsizing in response to what we anticipate will be lower demand for at least the next few years and possibly beyond. But to clarify, our Rig Systems business is composed of manufacturing operations that make drilling components that support both land and offshore, as well as spare parts to support the Rig Aftermarket business. And reality is that although we break it out to enhance our disclosure to the investing public, the Rig Aftermarket and the Rig Systems segments, in many ways, really constitute one big global business, and they support all aspects of drilling from offshore rigs to land rigs to the spare parts, maintenance, special-purpose survey projects and repair that's out there. So we are moving our cost structure down, retrenching. As you know, in the past, we relied on a balanced mix between internal manufacturing as well as outsourcing. And so kind of the first actions we took in -- through 2015 was to minimize our outsourcing and bring more in-house. We're continuing to do that, but also looking at continuing to kind of reduce our footprint to cope with lower volumes. What I would tell you is although orders are very, very slowed down, business is obviously down to sort of subsistence levels, looking out in coming quarters, we expect to see a resumption of land rig projects. We have a number of conversations underway around the globe. We expect to see drilling contractors continuing to upgrade their equipment and make their rigs more competitive in a market that's a little tougher on them. We expect to see -- and we're investing in some new products I don't think we mentioned on the call, but some mew products to upgrade those rigs that we're pretty excited about. So we will retrench down to fit the volume that we foresee out there for the next few years, as well as continue to invest in our other 2 products -- 2 segments that have a lot of very bright prospects in a recovery."

So what I would say though is in terms of a second half recovery, my comments were more directed to Wellbore Technologies and Completion & Production Services specifically, where we're getting very, very anecdotal, but a few customers really talking explicitly about a second half recovery. And quotation volumes around that potential scenario are starting to go up. I'll stress, Bill, these are quotations, not POs. So we'll see how that plays out. But we're encouraged by that. In terms of sort of mid-cycle, peak cycle kind of EBITDA margins, we've always been attracted to sort of high operating leverage businesses, and we have a lot of that in our mix, one. Two, there's been an awful lot of cost reductions underway, both in our enterprise and around the industry. And the really great thing about the recoveries, when they come, is it doesn't take much incremental volume to flow in and you really have become sort of hyper efficient at generating profitability out of that. We've seen that in prior upcycles. And so when the turn comes, you have a lean, mean fighting force out there executing very skillfully, very efficiently. And then when the volume -- but volume comes beyond that, you start to get a little more pricing leverage. So you can start to undo some of the discounting that happened in the prior downturn.

But also I'd point out, Brazil is still the second largest deepwater drilling market in the world right now, and we still have significant business in Brazil. So we've made investments down there to support the program. Our expectation is we're going to sort of shift those to more support ongoing drilling activity in the future. But we've been trimming the cost position there along the way."

National Oilwell Varco's first quarter 2016 financial results reflect the painful financial stress that our oil and gas customers are operating under. As WTI prices marched steadily downward to bottom at $26 per barrel in mid-February, c",1799,"Thank you, Loren. National Oilwell Varco's first quarter 2016 financial results reflect the painful financial stress that our oil and gas customers are operating under. As WTI prices marched steadily downward to bottom at $26 per barrel in mid-February, customers simply stopped spending, and oilfield activity plummeted further. Consequently, our first quarter revenues fell 20% sequentially to $2.2 billion, and are down 62% from the fourth quarter of 2014, when the current down cycle started. The company posted a $0.06 per fully diluted share loss for the first quarter of 2016, excluding severance, restructuring and other items totaling $0.26 per fully diluted share. 
EBITDA was $127 million for the quarter or 5.8% of revenue, and operating loss was $48 million or negative 2.2% of revenue, excluding restructuring and other items from both. 
Sequential EBITDA decremental leverage was 37% on a 20% revenue decline. And year-over-year EBITDA decremental leverage was 29% on a 55% revenue decline, excluding restructuring and other items from all quarters. In a moment, Jose will take you through a more detailed discussion of operating results. 
Our restructuring efforts accelerated during the quarter as we continued to aggressively manage costs downward. We have closed or are closing 200 facilities since the downturn began, and we reduced our workforce by nearly 6,000 employees during the first quarter of 2016. SG&A expenses declined $31 million in the quarter sequentially and is down $180 million or 34% from late 2014. 
Importantly, while we downsize, we are also maintaining our investment in the future, including $110 million invested in the first quarter on engineering, research and development into emerging technologies and products, which will further reduce production costs, increase access to reserves, improve safety and reduce the impact on the environment for our customers. 
We closed 4 small acquisitions in the quarter which collectively bring new technology to our portfolio: specifically, surface rig instrumentation; downhole measurement while drilling technologies; and drillpipe asset tracking utilizing RFID chip technology. Each of these acquisitions complement our own internal organic investments that advance our long-term strategic plans. 
I'd like to take a moment this morning and share with you just how we see our future unfolding and how these investments in our long-term strategic plan articulate with that future. 
First, horizontal drilling and geosteering are key enabling technologies of the shale revolution. 90% of U.S. land rigs drilling today are drilling horizontally, or at least directionally, a share which has actually increased from 79% since the downturn began in the fourth quarter of 2014. Horizontal drilling, which opens up much more of the reservoir to the wellbore, will expand globally and be applied more widely in the inevitable upturn. Therefore, NOV has developed a new low-cost rotarysteerable tool, which will be run commercially in our customer's hole for the first time next week. This new product complements our comprehensive bottom hole assembly or BHA offering to the directional drilling industry. 
Our Tektonic family of abrasion-resistant fixed cutter bits are gaining market share, as is our new ERT downhole drilling motor. And we added new MWD products through an acquisition in the first quarter as well. These tools work with our jars, shock subs, drill collars and premium drillpipe, engineered to withstand the considerable rigors of horizontal drilling. Our long-term strategic plan in this area is built on our view that the next upcycle will see even greater demand for drilling tools for horizontal drilling, which will be provided by directional drilling service industry that NOV will continue to equip. 
Second, North American shale plays endured lengthy gestation periods before they evolved to profitability, as the E&Ps experimented with drilling techniques to arrive at the most cost-effective methods to drive marginal cost per barrel sufficiently low to be financially attractive investments. In the next upcycle, NOV can help short-circuit that empirical technique, using our closed-loop automated drilling service, which has proven it can materially reduce drilling costs by making microsecond level adjustments to the drilling rig through our proprietary rig control system and software. We are bidding or executing over a dozen closed-loop automated drilling projects currently, utilizing our proprietary IntelliServ wired drill pipe. We are also seeing more interest from drilling contractors wishing to differentiate their rigs by outfitting them with IntelliServ wired drill pipe. In fact, we know of an idled rig that was recently put back to work solely because it was outfitted with IntelliServ pipe, a big win for its owner. Our long-term strategic plan is built on the view that E&P companies will prospect new shale plays globally using rigs capable of closed-loop automated drilling: Tier 1 AC rigs, wired IntelliServ drill pipe, bottom hole assembly components and NOVOS software, all of which NOV can provide today. 
During the first quarter, NOV was awarded a major 5-year project in North Africa for a real-time technology center to track drilling rig operations, and we are currently bidding other similar projects. NOV has provided real-time remote monitoring of equipment for many years. A few weeks ago, we announced the industry's first predictive capabilities for monitoring BOP components through our RIGSENTRY remote condition-based monitoring services. We believe that condition-based remote monitoring of oilfield equipment and predictive data analytics will grow in importance in the next upturn, as the industry increasingly employs more sophisticated equipment and more demanding environments. 
The Internet of Things is coming to the oilfield, and NOV will continue to lead the way, and will benefit from the largest installed base of drilling equipment and drilling control systems in the world. 
Hydraulic fracture stimulation is another enabling technology with proven value to the industry. We're investing in new technologies which we believe can reduce the capital equipment on site, the number of truckloads required, the power requirements and the operating costs of conventional frac fleets. Our long-term strategic plan has us investing in better ways to our hydraulically stimulate reservoirs. Again, the next upturn will see more widespread application of fracture stimulation, and we plan to provide the next generation of tools. 
The oil and gas industry has invested billions in deepwater exploration, chalking up more than 400 undeveloped discoveries, and our strategic plan targets improving floating production technologies to lower the development cost of these reserves. We are targeting a new fully costed production solution to offer to owners of marginal deepwater fields by early 2017. Preliminary discussions with IOCs around our new, innovative concepts have been met with high levels of enthusiasm. Specifically, these are smaller standardized units which can operate efficiently across a broader range of production, which utilize standardized disconnectable turrets to increase asset utilization and efficiency. 
On the seafloor, we are expanding our offering in flexible pipe, connectors and other hardware, along with seawater treatment technologies for subsea seawater injection, which increases the ultimate recovery from reservoirs through pressure maintenance, ultimately lowering cost per barrel. 
We continue -- we are continuing to expand our offering of composite materials into both offshore and land markets, partly through an acquisition we closed in the fourth quarter. Composite materials offer superior corrosion resistance in the flow lines we supply and lighter weights which drive down offshore vessel construction costs. 
Our long-term plan continues to advance these technologies, which will see increased uptake in a recovery. As the largest provider of fiberglass and composite tubulars to the oilfield in the world, NOV is well positioned to continue to drive corrosion-resistant solutions. 
Onshore, we are focused on other technologies which help our customers reduce their cost of production. The U.S. is really a 60 million barrel per day water industry that produces 9 billion -- 9 million barrels a day of oil as a byproduct. Our WaterWolf technology offers superior oil/water separation and complements our proprietary sand separation technologies and extensive production pump business. 
Our long-term plan also invests strategically in key productive regions like Saudi Arabia and Russia, where we began fabricating our first land rig and downhole tools at a new plant we opened in the first quarter. 
NOV is an innovative, entrepreneurial organization resolutely focused on improving the cost per barrel position of our customers, through technology, improved supply chain, standardization and industrialization. Our experience is that business models such as these, built on sound fundamentals that focus on our customers' needs, are long-term winners. They're in contrast to new business models, which seem to arise during downturns, which focus on either providing our customers with increasingly valuable capital they cannot access elsewhere or business models wherein we shoulder more of our customers' risk. Prior cycles have demonstrated that these models frequently do not turn out so well. 
As we approach the bottom of this sharp downcycle, our customers are struggling to make money right now, and the oilfield services industry is being radically disassembled to cope with commodity prices far below levels required to return to production growth. This is not sustainable and will change. 
Investors are understandably focused on optionality of enterprises in an eventual recovery. The handful of strategic plans I just outlined rest on specific, promising technologies our customers can apply across the globe. They will continue to evolve the industry to higher levels of efficiency and safety and lower cost of production. NOV is positioning itself to capitalize on the inevitable upturn, and I'm excited about the optionality embedded in our initiatives and, more so, the creativity and ingenuity that our teammates here at NOV continue to apply to our customers' challenges. 
While we are not planning for a recovery in 2016, we are encouraged by reports from some customers that they are beginning to think about a potential upturn in the second half of the year, as oil production has finally begun to roll over and demand continues to march upward. We will continue to manage costs to the reality of the marketplace in the short term, which is becoming more challenging as very low volumes present rising absorption challenges for us. 
Even with a rebound in oil prices, it will take time for our customers to repair balance sheets, to complete their drilled but uncompleted wells, to work down oil inventories and access capital to resume drilling. But the industry will navigate these challenges, and NOV will be here with an enhanced offering and greater levels of efficiency. 
I'm grateful to be part of such an entrepreneurial, smart organization with deep financial resources and diverse business models and bright opportunities in our future. This has always been a deeply cyclical industry, and our leaders have been through many downturns before, and they will again lead us through the present storm. Oilfield services is not much fun right now, and I want to let all of our employees know that Jose, Loren and I appreciate you suiting up every day and fighting the good fight. Hang in there. Better days lie ahead. 
Jose?"
31900,326268360,966566,"National Oilwell Varco, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2016",2016-04-28,"Earnings Calls","NOV Inc.","Executives","As Clay mentioned, NOV posted a $0.06 per share loss for the quarter, excluding severance, restructuring and other items, which totaled $147 million pretax or $0.26 per share after tax. Consolidated revenues were $2.2 billion for the first quarter of 20",3179,"As Clay mentioned, NOV posted a $0.06 per share loss for the quarter, excluding severance, restructuring and other items, which totaled $147 million pretax or $0.26 per share after tax. 
Consolidated revenues were $2.2 billion for the first quarter of 2016, down 20% from the fourth quarter of '15 and 55% year-over-year. The sharp decline during the quarter was a result of significant E&P spending curtailments as oil prices reached new lows. The average U.S. land rig count fell 27% sequentially, exiting the quarter at 450, the lowest count since the 1940s. And the average international rig count fell 8%, hitting a decade low at 985 rigs, with declines seen across all major regions of the globe. All of NOV's business units and global regions were negatively impacted, and all reporting segments saw revenue declines during the quarter. 
EBITDA decreased to $127 million or 5.8% of sales, resulting in sequential EBITDA decremental leverage of 37% and year-over-year decremental leverage of 29%. Operating loss, excluding other items, was $48 million. 
Looking at some of the other line items of the P&L. SG&A decreased by $31 million or 8% sequentially and by $138 million or 28% year-over-year as we continue to execute cost-control measures necessary to size our business with the current market environment. 
Interest and other financial costs decreased $2 million sequentially and $1 million year-over-year, primarily due to banking -- lower banking fees associated with a reduction in letters of credit outstanding. We reported a $3 million higher loss sequentially in unconsolidated affiliates related to our Voest-Alpine joint venture, where demand for OCTV or Green Tubing remains exceedingly low, given the dearth of drillpipe demand. 
Other expenses for the quarter increased $4 million sequentially, driven primarily by a greater loss on disposals of fixed assets. 
Our GAAP effective tax rate was 50% for the quarter. The unusually high rate was a result of combining losses in higher tax jurisdictions, namely the U.S., with income from lower rate international jurisdictions. Additionally, we received a tax benefit associated with reversing reserves for tax audits which concluded with favorable outcomes. With the relatively low levels of pretax income and losses that we are currently experiencing, relatively small changes in the split between domestic and international results can have a disproportionate impact on our effective tax rate. Notwithstanding this uncertainty and anticipated volatility, our current estimate for the effective tax rate is 35% for the remainder of the year. 
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Working capital decreased $528 million from the fourth quarter of 2015 to $4.9 billion at March 31, 2016. The decrease in working capital was primarily the result of a $714 million reduction in accounts receivable, $144 million reduction in inventory levels and an $84 million decrease in customer financing, which is the net of prepayment and billings in excess of costs against costs in excess of billings. The reductions in working capital were partially offset by decreases in accrued liabilities and accounts payable. 
Our focus on collections yielded strong results during the quarter, although inventory is not liquidating as quickly as we'd like, reflecting lower current levels of demand. We anticipate working capital will continue to be a source of cash as our revenues move lower, but we expect the pace of cash flow generation to slow relative to the past 2 quarters. The reduction in working capital helped contribute to an exceptional quarter of cash flow generation relative to the current market environment. 
NOV generated $621 million in cash flow from operations during the first quarter. After paying $173 million in dividends, $84 million for nonacquisition-related capital expenditure investments and $21 million for acquisitions, and adding a foreign exchange benefit and other items totaling $20 million, we netted $363 million in free cash flow. 
Additionally, we successfully repatriated another $637 million in cash from overseas at a very low cost, allowing us to reduce our commercial paper balances by $683 million to a quarter-end balance of $210 million. This paydown of debt was partially offset by a capital lease associated with a large new facility which came onto our books during the quarter. The building will allow us to consolidate approximately 1,600 personnel from 12 existing NOV facilities, of which 10 will be fully vacated after we finish moving into this new facility. 
At March 31, we had a cash balance of $1.8 billion, total debt of $3.4 billion and our debt to capitalization was 17.1%, down from 19.2% at year-end. 
As Loren mentioned in his introductory remarks, we made a few changes to the presentation of certain information in our release this morning, which we hope will enhance a reader's ability to understand NOV and its financial performance. One of the changes relates to the presentation of our segment results. 
In order to provide a clear measurement of our reporting segments, we are no longer allocating certain corporate overhead costs to our segment results, and we are now capturing these costs in the line item Eliminations and Corporate Costs. We have revised prior period amounts to make the segment performance comparable. And when we speak to segment results this morning, we'll be referring to the reclassified results presented in our earnings release. 
In today's release, we also provided the specific amounts now deemed corporate costs for each period presented. However, we do not anticipate breaking these costs out in the future. 
Our Rig Systems segment generated first quarter revenue of $926 million, down 9% from $1 billion earned last quarter. For the first quarter, the split between offshore and land-related revenue was 75% and 25%, respectively. New construction of offshore rigs accounted for $431 million in revenues or 20% of NOV's consolidated revenues. 
First quarter EBITDA for the Rig Systems segment was $137 million. After 4 quarters of exceptional decremental margin management, our Rig Systems segment saw a significant decline in margins in the first quarter. Margins fell 630 basis points to 14.8% of sales, representing 87% decrementals on 9% lower sequential revenues. Operating profit was $119 million or 12.8% of sales. 
Lower margins arose from the much sharper than anticipated fall in spare part sales in our aftermarket business, meaningfully impacting absorption within Rig Systems segment's facilities that manufacture those products. Additionally, while cost reductions are underway, their pace simply can't always keep up with sharp volume declines, particularly when you're trying to be thoughtful in your actions while treating people as well as you reasonably can during this difficult time. Bottom line is that the lower anticipated margins were the result of lower throughput in our manufacturing facilities combined with a slowdown in cost-reduction efforts relative to the fall-off in volumes. 
On a year-over-year basis, first quarter revenue was down 63% at only 25% decremental margins. The solid year-over-year decrementals in the face of a nearly 2/3 revenue decline have been accomplished by significant in-sourcing from our external supply chain, but these opportunities are diminishing. 
New orders were $97 million in the first quarter, representing a book-to-bill of only 13% when compared to the $770 million shipped out of backlog. Q1 bookings were composed entirely of discrete capital equipment, including cranes, pressure control and jacking systems. For the second straight quarter, we received no new rig orders. 
As we note in our press release, effective March 31, 2016, we have deducted the backlog we previously disclosed for rigs being constructed in Brazil to reflect Sete's shareholder approval to file for bankruptcy protection last week, along with other orders for which we have not been paid in over a year, totaling approximately $2.1 billion. Although our contracts with the 3 yards remain in place and are enforceable, work on all these projects has been suspended pending payment and will remain so until customers make funds available to advance the projects, leading us to report backlog more conservatively. Therefore, ending backlog was $3.3 billion for Rig Systems, and we expect $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion of this backlog to be converted to revenue through the remainder of 2016 for a full year revenue from backlog number of about $2 billion to $2.1 billion. 
Looking at the second quarter, we anticipate a much sharper, up to 30%, fall-off in revenue as we continue to work off backlog on existing projects. We anticipate much improved decremental margins of approximately 30% as savings from our latest cost-cutting efforts are fully realized but are more than offset by declining volumes. 
Our Rig Aftermarket segment generated $391 million of revenue during the first quarter of 2016, down 31% from the $569 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, and down 46% from the $719 million in the first quarter of 2015. Revenue declines were anticipated in the first quarter due to deteriorating market conditions and the normal fall-off of year-end service and repair work. However, sharper fall-off in activity levels versus expectations amplified the decline and further eroded demand for spare parts as our drilling contractor customers, offshore in particular, cut their expenditures on repairs, services and spare parts dramatically across the board. 
EBITDA was $82 million, down 43% sequentially and down 62% from the prior year. Decrementals were 35%, driving EBITDA margins down to 21%. While a mix shift from spares to service and repair and some pricing pressure contributed to the profitability decline, the largest driver was reduced volumes, which resulted in lower absorption in our facilities and lower utilization of our service and repair personnel. Operating profit was $77 million or 19.7% of sales. 
Special Periodic Survey work continues, but we are seeing significant reductions in the scope on these surveys, and other long-planned SPS projects are being canceled lately in view of grim prospects for these offshore rigs winning contracts anytime soon. Additionally, we are seeing pricing pressures continue to mount. 
Looking forward, we expect revenues to come down in the mid-single-digit percentage point range, with sequential EBITDA decrementals in line with Q1's results. 
Thinking longer term, we believe Rig Aftermarket will be an early beneficiary of activity recovery, as we work with our customers to provide the necessary parts, service, repair and maintenance required to put their rigs back to work. 
Additionally, we believe new U.S. offshore BOP regulations will drive additional demand for condition-based monitoring services, which we have been providing for over 5 years.
Our Wellbore Technologies segment generated revenues of $631 million during the first quarter of 2016, down 17% sequentially from the $757 million and down 46% from the $1.2 billion posted in the first quarter of 2015. Revenue mix by destination was 46% North America and 54% international. 70% of the segment's decline came from international markets, which declined 22% sequentially, most acutely in Asia and Latin America. The U.S. declined 16% sequentially, better than the 26% decline in the U.S. rig count, indicating that despite intense pricing pressures, the group's revenue per rig improved on market share gains. 
EBITDA for the segment was $43 million or 6.8% of sales, down 44% from the previous quarter and 82% from the prior year. Sequentially, EBITDA decremental leverage was limited to 27% on the $126 million in revenue decline, as the group experienced the full benefits of cost reductions made last quarter and continues to eliminate substantial portions of its cost structure, including the closure of more than 20 facilities during the first quarter of 2016. Operating loss for the segment was $53 million. 
Quotation activity from the downhole tools segment is increasing, and we believe that even a leveling of activity will bring more work as customers are depleting their stocks of equipment and tools coming in from jobs not being repaired. Therefore, expect -- we, therefore, expect repair work and motor relines to begin to rise through the year as customers run out of tools. We began manufacturing downhole tools in new plants in Saudi Arabia and Russia during the first quarter. Drillpipe demand remains very low, and we have mothballed much of our capacity as a result, but Q2 benefited from a high mix of large diameter, premium thread drillpipe. Our Tuboscope unit saw pipe mill and processor activity fall owing to 12 months of OCTG inventory on the ground in North America; 5 to 6 months is the normalized average. However, we are beginning to see some interest in completion and workover activity, which may drive demand for coating and inspection work in the back half of the year, along with higher demand for sucker rod services for artificial lift. 
Wellsite Services saw a significant decline in revenues tied to rig counts, but aggressive cost control enabled the group to post higher EBITDA sequentially. 
We noted a number of wins in our press release and in Clay's remarks, but I'd like to further highlight some of the recent successes and market share gains, particularly related to our downhole tool and drilling and optimization businesses. 
Our drill bit designs continue to set new performance records globally, most recently in Oman, where an operator set 3 new field records using our Tektonic bits to drill 8,000-plus feet in a single run. Since their introduction in October 2015, Tektonic bits have logged 22 field records in 10 countries around the globe. 
Additionally, our Dynamic Drilling Solutions business continues to gain traction with its eVolve optimization and closed-loop drilling automation services. 
In our release, we highlighted the completion of an 18-month project in the Norwegian North Sea with a major integrated oil company in developing a field that consists of oil reservoir and several deeper, structurally complex, high-pressure gas and condensate reservoirs. Wells drilled in this field have a narrow pressure window that requires a comprehensive understanding of the conditions in the formation and that leaves little room for error in order to optimize economics associated with the development of the field. 
Our suite of tools provided the customer with high-speed streaming downhole data used to actively analyze wellbore conditions, which enabled the customer to have the data required to justify extending laterals well beyond their originally planned pipe design. By extending the wellbore, the customer significantly increased production from the wells drilled, therefore, eliminating the need for the final well included in the original project plan. Given the cost of drilling in the North Sea, you can appreciate how our technologies reduced the customer's development costs substantially. 
Additionally, we were recently awarded a contract for downhole drilling automation with an independent E&P customer in Western Canada. And as Clay mentioned, we were awarded a 5-year project by a national oilwell -- oil company in North Africa for real-time data acquisition, visualization and optimization. 
The traction we continue to gain with new technologies indicate our customers' persistent desire to seek new and better ways to drill, and we have positioned ourselves as the leading independent provider to help them achieve those goals. 
Notwithstanding the many positive ongoing developments occurring within our Wellbore Technologies segment, our business is primarily driven by drilling-related activities. With Q2 global activity already sharply lower than the Q1 average, we anticipate second quarter revenues will be down approximately 15%. 
Additionally, while we continue to reduce our cost structure, we do not believe we will replicate the success we had in the first quarter managing our decremental margins and anticipate the segment to be at or near break-even EBITDA. 
The Completion & Production Solutions segment generated revenues of $585 million for the first quarter of 2016, down 25% sequentially and 41% compared to the first quarter of 2015. While all businesses experienced fewer sales, revenue declines were sharpest within the offshore production-related groups, which were coming off record or near record years in 2015. Revenue out of backlog was $330 million, down 28% sequentially. 
EBITDA for the segment was $48 million or 8.6% of sales, down from 11.9% in Q4 and 18.2% in Q1 of 2015. The segment was able to hold decremental EBITDA leverage to 22%, as cost savings realized from facility consolidations and headcount reductions helped soften the impact of declining revenues. Operating loss for the segment was $4 million. 
Revenues for intervention, stimulation and wireline equipment continued to decline, particularly across North America, while the Middle East has remained comparatively strong. Aftermarket spares and services for stimulation equipment are facing considerable headwinds as customers aggressively cannibalize fleets, including acquiring auctioned spreads going for $0.20 on the dollar to part out. 
However, we are encouraged by a recent pickup in quotations for possible orders in the second half of 2016, when some customers believe completion activity will pick up, and by sequentially stronger order bookings. 
Our floating production group posted lower revenues as well, but had excellent decrementals due to aggressive downsizing. We continue to advance half a dozen FEED studies for FPSO-related projects, but final investment decisions have been nonexistent as customers recycle designs and concepts to reduce costs. 
Our flexible pipe business fell sharply as our plant in Brazil ran out of orders in December. However, the group landed significant orders which will lead to revenue growth in Q2 and should load the plant through the remainder of the year. 
Our composite pipe business unit fell during the first quarter, but again, aggressive cost control led to an improvement in EBITDA in the first quarter and orders improved. 
Process and Flow Technologies also posted higher EBITDA on flat revenues, owing to significant restructuring that went on last year and favorable mix as the group won record levels of orders for production chokes. New orders were $328 million, up $56 million or 26%, resulting in a 99% book-to-bill in the first quarter. The segment ended the quarter with a backlog balance of $994 million. 
While we experienced a sharp quarterly decline and industry activity levels continue to fall, we believe achieving a book-to-bill approaching 100% is an indicator that the CAPS segment is rapidly approaching the bottom. But as those orders don't immediately convert to revenue, we expect segment revenue to decrease in the mid- to upper single-digit percentage range in the second quarter. Cost savings, which was positively impacted Q1 results, are expected to continue but not to the same magnitude on decremental margins as we experienced in the first quarter, which should lead to decrementals in the mid-30% range. 
Visibility on new order intake remains cloudy, particularly in the offshore space, as the industry continues its deepwater cost recalibration. That said, we optimistically anticipate that new orders will see a slight tick-up during the second quarter. 
In summary, our first quarter results reflect the fact that we are in an extremely challenging market environment. Despite current conditions, we continue to generate substantial amounts of free cash flow, even while we make meaningful investments in our ability to continue delivering better technologies and solutions for our customers in the oil and gas space. 
We expect the near-term environment to remain difficult. However, we are growing more optimistic that we are nearing the bottom of the cycle, and we're excited about the future value that the hard-working and innovative people of NOV will deliver to our customers and our shareholders as the recovery takes hold. 
With that, we'd like to open it up for questions."

A lot of -- it's been a systematic, steady application of capital over the years to very attractive businesses like Grant Prideco's drillpipe business. I think as you're aware, 97% of the acquisition capital we've deployed through the last decade-plus have been in areas outside of rigs. We have a great franchise in building rigs and very proud of that, have done a great job. But looking forward, I think as the cycle recovers, we're going to benefit from investments like that. Drillpipe demand comes back, that drives high -- very high operating leverage and high levels of profitability, particularly for our offering, which is -- which rests on a lot of premium technology in especially at drillpipe used to drill more complex well pads, for instance. As we noted in our comments, we expect to see rising demand in downhole tools. And we've been developing internally, as well as through acquisition, new offerings in that arena. And as recovery comes back, I think we'll see a response there. As Jose mentioned, our Rig Aftermarket business, customers really have cut spending to bare bones and are relying on cannibalization of many of the fleets that are out there. That can't last forever, and so recovery I think we'll see in Rig Aftermarket. And finally, Completion & Production Solutions, through the last decade, we've added new products there to help our customers improve economics in the deepwater, so things like turret mooring systems, flexible pipe that we referenced built out our offering of composite offerings. So now, we're the largest provider of flexible composite piping, for instance, in flow lines. And so all of these businesses, we expect in an upturn, to benefit pretty early. And so we're well poised and positioned, I think, as activity starts to come back and our customer starts to invest more again to take advantage of that."

We are downsizing in response to what we anticipate will be lower demand for at least the next few years and possibly beyond. But to clarify, our Rig Systems business is composed of manufacturing operations that make drilling components that support both land and offshore, as well as spare parts to support the Rig Aftermarket business. And reality is that although we break it out to enhance our disclosure to the investing public, the Rig Aftermarket and the Rig Systems segments, in many ways, really constitute one big global business, and they support all aspects of drilling from offshore rigs to land rigs to the spare parts, maintenance, special-purpose survey projects and repair that's out there. So we are moving our cost structure down, retrenching. As you know, in the past, we relied on a balanced mix between internal manufacturing as well as outsourcing. And so kind of the first actions we took in -- through 2015 was to minimize our outsourcing and bring more in-house. We're continuing to do that, but also looking at continuing to kind of reduce our footprint to cope with lower volumes. What I would tell you is although orders are very, very slowed down, business is obviously down to sort of subsistence levels, looking out in coming quarters, we expect to see a resumption of land rig projects. We have a number of conversations underway around the globe. We expect to see drilling contractors continuing to upgrade their equipment and make their rigs more competitive in a market that's a little tougher on them. We expect to see -- and we're investing in some new products I don't think we mentioned on the call, but some mew products to upgrade those rigs that we're pretty excited about. So we will retrench down to fit the volume that we foresee out there for the next few years, as well as continue to invest in our other 2 products -- 2 segments that have a lot of very bright prospects in a recovery."

So what I would say though is in terms of a second half recovery, my comments were more directed to Wellbore Technologies and Completion & Production Services specifically, where we're getting very, very anecdotal, but a few customers really talking explicitly about a second half recovery. And quotation volumes around that potential scenario are starting to go up. I'll stress, Bill, these are quotations, not POs. So we'll see how that plays out. But we're encouraged by that. In terms of sort of mid-cycle, peak cycle kind of EBITDA margins, we've always been attracted to sort of high operating leverage businesses, and we have a lot of that in our mix, one. Two, there's been an awful lot of cost reductions underway, both in our enterprise and around the industry. And the really great thing about the recoveries, when they come, is it doesn't take much incremental volume to flow in and you really have become sort of hyper efficient at generating profitability out of that. We've seen that in prior upcycles. And so when the turn comes, you have a lean, mean fighting force out there executing very skillfully, very efficiently. And then when the volume -- but volume comes beyond that, you start to get a little more pricing leverage. So you can start to undo some of the discounting that happened in the prior downturn.

But also I'd point out, Brazil is still the second largest deepwater drilling market in the world right now, and we still have significant business in Brazil. So we've made investments down there to support the program. Our expectation is we're going to sort of shift those to more support ongoing drilling activity in the future. But we've been trimming the cost position there along the way."

In the second quarter of 2016, National Oilwell Varco did post revenues of $1.7 billion, down 21% from the first quarter and down 56% from the second quarter of 2015. Revenues declined more than expected due mostly to offshore drilling",2378,"Thank you, Loren. In the second quarter of 2016, National Oilwell Varco did post revenues of $1.7 billion, down 21% from the first quarter and down 56% from the second quarter of 2015. 
Revenues declined more than expected due mostly to offshore drilling contractors further delaying acceptance of newbuilds. The $26 crude oil prices we saw in February inflicted new agony on the oilfield, sending second quarter expenditures further downward and driving U.S. rig counts to record lows going back 7 decades.
NOV generated a loss of $0.30 per fully diluted share excluding severance facility closure costs and other items totaling $0.28 per fully diluted share in the second quarter. 
EBITDA was $25 million for the quarter and operating loss was $153 million, excluding $117 million in other items from both. 
Operating cash flow was $128 million for the quarter. 
Our managers continue to aggressively downsize our business to match the available market, enabling NOV to manage the decremental EBITDA leverage x other items of only 22% sequentially. 
Our workforce was reduced 10% and SG&A declined 16% during the quarter. Solid cost reduction results in the face of continuing pricing and absorption pain. 
EBITDA leverage x other items has been 30% on the 70% revenue declines since the present cyclical downturn began. We continue to manage cost of aggressively, but we're also maintaining investment and promising new opportunities we see for our business when prosperity returns. 
New technology and lower cost will lead to higher incrementals and margins for NOV in the eventual recovery, and I will speak to our efforts in both areas.
First on cost. Our team is resolute in our commitment to improve efficiencies, to reduce capacity and generate higher profitability. During the second quarter, we detailed additional cost reduction steps that total over $400 million in annualized savings that will flow in over the next few quarters. Plans developed and actions taken during the second quarter are on top of considerable work performed already having reduced our annual personnel cost well over $2 billion from peak levels. 
Since the downturn began, we have closed or are closing over 250 facilities to reduce capacity in view of lower demand. 
We've also insourced work previously outsourced to retain as many of our employees as possible and to help with absorption. Importantly, we do not believe we have sacrificed our ability to ramp up and respond to the eventual recovery. 
In a moment, Jose will take you to our detailed results by segment but overall, we expect these specific actions to lead the modestly higher EBITDA in the third quarter on a modest decline in revenues with more savings driving even higher EBITDA in the fourth quarter on roughly flattish sequential revenues.
Like others in our space, we believe we are seeing some isolated green shoots of activity, and we're encouraged that the North American rig counts have begun to increase. We have seen demand rise in recent weeks for certain products and services for North America, ride guides for artificial lift, solves controls jobs in West Texas, drilling motor rentals and other items.
On the other hand, our rig equipment business in many international markets continued to decline. At or near the bottom of the cycle, we see considerable cross currents, price pressure and shifting mix within our business. And frankly, we're not ready to call bottom yet. Our near-term outlook calls for modest revenue improvements in the Wellbore Technologies and completion of production solution segments, offset by another quarter of declines in our Rig Systems segment, which we expect to flatten thereafter. 
We expect Rig Aftermarket third quarter to be down only slightly from the second quarter. 
Laser-focused on efficiency is part of our DNA, and cost savings measure evolve continuously with our market outlook. Jose, Loren and I are grateful to serve with experienced, competent business leaders who roll up their sleeves and do the tough grim work of downsizing when this industry demands it. Better days lie ahead for NOV, and this team will help us navigate the present storm. When it passes, we will emerge lean and tough. 
The oil industry has been decimated by a generational down cycle, but record low levels of rig activity will inevitably lead to production declines, higher oil prices and higher activity. In the meantime, we plan for this to be a slow grind, and we still have a lot of swamp to traverse until we get to full recovery. 
When the market turns, NOV will have used the present downturn to improve its efficiency and importantly advanced promising new initiatives for the industry we serve. This company has a diverse robust portfolio of critical technologies the industry needs to drive better efficiencies in a low oil price world, a portfolio which we improve day by day as we continue to invest in our optionality to recovery. 
We believe recovery will drive higher demand for completion tools and hydraulic fracture stimulation and pressure pumping equipment where NOV occupies market-leading position. Our outlook for technology proven by the Shell Revolution is robust. Shell technologies will migrate to new basins on new continents requiring new sophisticated Tier 1 land rigs, bits, downhole tools and new drill pipe designs. 
Again, NOV occupies formidable positions in these markets.
Rising driving efficiencies enabled by NOV's technologies will increase well counts, vis-à-vis, rig counts with few days of drilling required to create each new wellbore. This was for incremental demand for well count-driven products and services like the production chokes, sand separation and oil separation equipment markets where NOV also occupies leading positions. 
In high risk of drilling per day where equal higher rates of consumption of bits, tools, drill pipe and rigs that we make per day. 
We acquired trackings and completion tools business into our completion of production solution segment a couple of weeks ago, which brings promising new sliding and coal frac technologies to our mix. The business plan here is simple. We can manufacture completion tools in our existing underobserved facilities. We can expand sales through the 67 countries we already operate in with our existing infrastructure. We see opportunities to add other completions technologies to our mix through M&A and organic investment.
We expect application of hydraulic fracture stimulation to continue to grow in an upturn, and the acquisition enhances NOV's exposure to this trend. 
Drillers and service companies will bring more attention to efficient management of their assets in the upturn. So within the Wellbore Technologies segment, we are advancing our new track ID, lifecycle management system, which utilizes RFID technology to provide customers with a complete life history, including ours and in-service of drill pipe, DHA components and drilling risers. 
Over 40,000 of these ships are in-service globally, but the end penetrating market is literally millions of components. The system tracks manufacturing and inspection history of each drill string component through our inventory management system. We can install the track ID, RFID chips at our drill pipe and downhole tools factories or in the field. And once installed, the system can automatically tally strengths on every chip when used with instruments mounted in the rubbery table. This makes for more efficient drilling operations in addition to more efficient lifecycle management of assets for our customers.
Operators will continue to push longer laterals and smooth profiles, tightly geosteered within the sweet spots of the shales stratigraphy. In the first quarter, we acquired Polartec, which brought us MWD system, which fits well with our Black Star electromagnetic wave MWD system that we've offered for many years. We are now investing to add recent measurements and to combine mudpoles and electromagnetic wave propagation capabilities into the same tools, thereby, positioning NOV to offer unique low-cost MWD tool that can be used together with our new low-cost rubbery system that we developed and introduced earlier this year. 
Together, this combination will enable our directional drilling service customers to provide cost-effective geosteering on longer horizontal wells. 
We will be introducing a new accounting control device for managed pressure drilling in the second half of 2016, and we're investing in rental kits for the launch currently. We see more and more customers interested in rigs that are NPD ready to drill more efficiently and safety, and NOV is developing the kit to fulfill this need. 
In the first quarter, we acquired a unique remote unmanned gas analysis unit that provides high-speed ratio measurements up to C5. The geo gas analyzer product transmits critical geologic data in realtime, which enables operators to reduce wellsite personnel to lower cost. This fits well with the rig instrumentation business that we have been engaged in for decades. 
Today, we have 3  of closed-loop automated drilling jobs under way, and we expect to spud 2 more jobs soon with dozens more operators interested in this emerging technology. 
Our closed-loop drilling automation service has proven the ability to reduce bud to TD times by a 1/3 or more. Drilling programs and new basins experienced learning curves effects well by well, closely bottoming drilling accelerates this process. 
Recovery will see new green drilling crews going back to work, and our new closely bottom drilling service illuminates the drilling mechanics downhole and it enables computers to control service equipment on a microsecond basis to optimize drilling performance. 
The service works with our new NOVOS rig operating system, which we introduced this quarter and won our first upgrade order. It also works with our proprietary IntelliServ Wired Drill Pipe to provide high-speed data link with downhole realtime drilling instrumentation. 
NOV is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this exciting technology, given that we have the world's largest installed base of drilling equipment, the most proven stable capable rig operating system, the Wired Drill Pipe and the experience of already having drilled hundreds of thousands of feet under our belt. Our rig of the future is here today and operating in the field with high efficiency.
Our installed base and drilling equipment are also uniquely positions NOV to capitalize on big data in the oilfield. We have monitored hundreds of rigs in realtime around the globe for over a decade through our Ewok system. This year, we launched our enhanced rig Sentry system, and we saw significant increase in revenues for our subsea rig sentry BOP monitoring service in the second quarter. 
You may recall that we announced last quarter our success in predictive analytics. We successfully forecasted certain components failures wees in advance based on our analysis of years of operating data. 
Condition-based monitoring and big data will provide step change improvement in reliability and maintenance practices for sophisticated oilfield equipment, and NOV is positioned to lead the way. We are pursuing additional opportunities to host realtime remote monitoring centers in the Middle East, which will enable customers to reduce cost by permitting their experts to simultaneously monitor drilling progress across multiple rigs in realtime. 
Our second quarter saw rig system orders decline further, and we expect orders to remain depressed for the foreseeable future. With no new offshore rig builds on the horizon, we're investing in new products to enhance efficiency and safety of existing rigs, products that will enable drilling contractors to differentiate their rigs in a crowded marketplace. 
For instance, we expect to introduce a new ROV retrievable BOP pod this year for subsea stacks, which would enable drilling contractors to replace pods on the seafloor, avoiding an expensive and time-consuming round-trip of the stack. 
Drilling contractors can retrofit their stacks with this. On land, we are set to introduce a lower guide-on product, which will work in conjunction with our existing STV racking arm on land rigs to bring further mechanism and potentially automation of pipe drilling activities. 
We are developing ways to improve the efficiency of contractors existing operations by, for example, exploring opportunities to reduce SPS cost and disruptions by using condition-based monitoring. We are working with the major classification agencies to develop a way to continuously certify drilling equipment in the field using condition-based monitoring. It is early days, but this new model could significantly reduce drilling contractor costs and interruptions.
We were pleased to announce a few weeks ago a cooperation agreement with GE within our completion and production solutions segment to work jointly to improve cost and speed of execution on FPSO topsides projects. We have detailed development work around integrating GE's market-leading power generation and compression capabilities with our own offering of mooring systems, swivel stack, seawater piping systems, pumps, fluid processing, treatment, cranes and deck machinery. 
By reducing the number of complex interfaces between multiple vendors, NOV and GE are vastly simplifying the supply chain, jointly engineering and causing FPSO topside modules across varying sizes and capabilities, which we will offer to the marketplace by early 2017. 
Final designs can be refined quickly to fit specific customer field needs, reducing time to first oil, reducing complexity and reducing cost. 
NOV is unique in our considerable experience in successful execution of complex vessel construction and dozens of projects with every major ship yard around the world.
While Deepwater development projects remained challenged from a returns perspective, the opportunity to pioneer new, efficient vessel construction model, together with initiatives being advanced by Deepwater wellhead companies, together with subsea processing and boosting advancement, including our own seabox technology, can materially improve the economics of developing the vast resources that have been discovered in the Deepwater. 
Our initial plans focus on smaller FPSO vessels targeting marginal discoveries in mature basins. 
In short, NOV continues to pivot and to private promising technologies that will disproportionately benefit in the upturn even as we shrink our productive capacities and reduce cost. Hydraulic fracture stimulation, completion tools, remote operations, big data, Deepwater advancements and horizontal drilling will all play key roles in supplying an energy-hungry world in the 21st century. 
NOV is investing both organically and through M&A in each of these areas.  Brighter days lie ahead and NOV will be there to lead the way. 
To our team at NOV, let me tell you, I know these are difficult times and I appreciate your resolve and your professionalism. We are laying the groundwork for future prosperity of a great company that you and I are blessed to be a part of. You have my heartfelt thanks. José?"

Let's quickly recap our consolidated results. Revenues for the second quarter of 2016 were $1.7 billion, down 28.1% from the first quarter and in line with the 19% sequential decline in global rig counts. Revenues declined 23% in North Ame",3048,"Thanks, Clay. Let's quickly recap our consolidated results. Revenues for the second quarter of 2016 were $1.7 billion, down 28.1% from the first quarter and in line with the 19% sequential decline in global rig counts. 
Revenues declined 23% in North America and 20% internationally as North American and international rig counts fell 35% and 7%, respectively. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $25 million, down $102 million from the first quarter of 2016. Sequential decremental EBITDA leverage was limited to 20% as efforts to resize the business and reduce our cost structure had their intended effect.
Operating loss, excluding other items, was $153 million. 
Looking at select other line items at the P&L. SG&A decreased by $56 million or 16% sequentially and by $125 million or 30% year-over-year.
SG&A is now down $944 million on an annualized basis since the fourth quarter of 2014. 
Interest and other financial cost expense increased $5 million sequentially, mostly driven by incremental interest cost of approximately $2.5 million, attributable to a large capital lease we booked in late Q1 as well as other charges we do not expect to repeat next quarter.  Therefore, we anticipate interest expense to be between $27 million and $28 million for Q3. 
Other expense for the quarter increased $13 million sequentially, driven primarily by a greater loss on disposals and fixed assets. On GAAP, effective tax rate was 35.8% for the quarter and our rate, excluding other items, was 41.5%.
As a reminder, in the current environment, relatively small changes in the split but between domestic and international results can have a disproportionate impact on our tax rates. 
In the third quarter, we anticipate the tax rate to be approximately 38%. 
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Working capital decreased $253 million from the first quarter of 2016. The decrease in working capital was primarily the result of a $247 million reduction in inventory levels, a $190 million reduction in customer financings, which is the decrease in cost in excess of billings netted against the decrease in billings in excess of costs and customer prepayments; and a $168 million reduction in accounts receivable. 
The reductions in working capital were partially offset by decreases in accrued liabilities and accounts payable. 
While working capital decreased by over $250 million, we continue to carry more working capital than are required to support the business at today's activity levels as converting inventory and receivables the cash remains challenging in the current environment.
Cash flow from operations totaled $128 million. After deducting $77 million in capital expenditures, $19 million in dividend payments, $15 million for acquisitions and $14 million in other items, we were essentially breakeven from a cash flow perspective for the quarter. Therefore, net debt remained mostly unchanged at approximately $1.6 billion.
During the quarter, we paid down our commercial paper by $100 million, leaving us with a balance of approximately $110 million. 
At June 30, 2016, we had a cash balance of $1.7 billion, $3.3 billion in total debt and our debt to capitalization was 16.8%.
Our Rig Systems segment generated revenues of $564 million during the second quarter of 2016, down 39% sequentially from $926 million and down 71% from the $1.9 billion posted in the second quarter of 2015.
Sharp revenue declines were anticipated in the second quarter due to reduced backlogs and more projects approaching completion. However, the fall off in revenues was stronger than expected as customers should lack contracts or faced pressures from operators to delay projects do what they can to defer deliveries.
Second quarter EBITDA for Rig Systems segment was $49 million. Efforts to resize the Rig Systems business and reduce the cost structure to mitigate the effects of the fall off in revenues had the intended result leading to detrimental margins of only 24%. 
EBITDA margins fells 610 basis points to 8.7% of sales. Operating profit, excluding other items, was $30 million or 5.3% of sales.
For the second quarter, the split between offshore and land-related revenue was roughly 2/3 onshore and 1/3 land. New construction of offshore rigs accounted for $213 million in revenues or 12% of NOV's consolidated revenue.
New orders were down 31 million sequentially to 66 million in the second quarter, representing a 10-year low. 
Book-to-bill was 15% when new orders are compared to the 44 -- compared to the 441 million shipped out of backlog during the quarter. 
Q1 bookings primarily consisted of pressure control systems and other replacement equipment. 
For the 3rd straight quarter, we received no new rig orders. 
Near-term demand for offshore remains almost nonexistent outside of replacement equipment. Discussions continue regarding midterm opportunities, which include one-off specialized 20K drillships and speculative midwater semisubmersible, however we do not anticipate these orders materializing in 2016. 
The landmark appear more promising as conversations from customers in North America, the Middle East and certain other international markets are increasing regarding equipment upgrades newfield opportunities. More and more operators are demanding modern, optimal Tier 1 AC rigs for potential upcoming projects, and contractors are seeking to upgrade and expand their capabilities in order to position themselves to capture incremental market opportunities. 
While offshore opportunities will remain limited for the foreseeable future, we believe our land business will bottom in Q3 and begin to recover as we enter 2017.
We continue to work diligently on restructuring and resizing the business we anticipate in future violence. Our focus is on standardizing processes, optimizing structures and eliminating all redundancies in our global operations. This focus is designed to ensure the flexibility and agility needed to respond to recovery significantly reduce cost and lead times. 
We anticipate revenue out of backlog will fall another $81 million in the third quarter to $360 million and anticipate an 18% to 20% fall off in total segment revenue as we continue to work off our backlog on existing projects. 
Decremental margins should be in the low 20% range as we expect normal decrementals to be partially offset by $15 million in cost savings, resulting for more efforts to cut cost and improve efficiencies as we restructure the business.
Our Rig Aftermarket segment generated $643 million in revenue during the second quarter of 2016, down 7% from $391 million in Q1 of 2016 and down 45% from $657 million in the second quarter of 2015.
EBITDA for the segment was $73 million or 20.1% of sales, down 11% sequentially and down 55% from the prior year. EBITDA decremental leverage was limited to 33% as cost controls were able to partially offset the decline in total revenue and an unfavorable mix shift as sales in spare parts continue to decline, while lower margin service and repair work begin to improve. 
Operating profit, excluding other items, was $67 million or 18.4% of sales. Spare parts sales continued to decline during the second quarter, however, bookings on spares began to solidify as we entered the third quarter. 
Customers have depleted existing inventories and are now getting to the point to where they must order new parts in order to support their exiting operations. 
Service and repair work rebounded during the second quarter as reactivations in the U.S. began to take place and a number of special periodic survey projects increased by 30%. 
While the number of projects and associated revenue are increasing, customers continue to reduce the scope of projects and associated purchases as much as possible. Our condition-based monitoring services continue to gain traction and deliver value for our customers. 
Our rig sentry service, which was introduced last quarter, identify potential failures in subsea BOPs before they occurred on 4 separate occasions, potentially saving our customers millions of dollars and unplanned downtime. 
Operational success is driving commercial success as our monitoring service revenues increased by over 50% during the quarter. We expect the pace of stacking offshore rigs will continue to accelerate, the difficult process, which will ultimately help rebalance and oversupplied market.
In the current environment, Rig Aftermarket remains focused on providing industry-leading OEM parts, service and support that we have delivered over the years to take care of our customers operating needs anywhere in the world.
We also continue to partner with our customers to develop innovative solutions for their most pressing needs. Today, our customers cannot afford actual downtime and need to be optimally positioned to capitalize or any new opportunities. 
As previously noted, we are seeing strong demand for our condition-based monitoring solutions, which allow contractors to predict failures and address problems before they occur. We're also seeing growing demand for other recently introduced offerings designed to address the stress our customers are under in the current environment. 
Some of these offerings include infield certification services for which we travel the rigs and readable to provide the required certifications on active locations resulting in substantially reduced downtime. 
Rig performance services in which we assess and review a customer's equipment to identify opportunities for improving operational efficiencies and minimizing downtime and storage presentation and reactivation services, which lowers the cost of stacking equipment and enables faster reactivation of rigs, creating a competitive advantage for contractors to securing new contracts. 
Not withstanding the remaining challenges in offshore space, conversations with our customers leave us cautiously optimistic that we are at or near a bottom for our Rig Aftermarket business. 
While we anticipate a tepid near-term recovery, driven by reactivation-related business in the U.S. and pent-up demand for offshore parts, service and repair work, we could still see revenue decline in the third quarter by a couple of hundred basis points. 
We also anticipate realizing roughly $5 million in cost savings during the third quarter, which should more than offset decrementals associated with revenue decline. 
Our wellbore technology segment generated $511 million in revenue during the second quarter, down 19% sequentially from $631 million and down 47% sequentially from the $956 million in the second quarter of 2015. 
Revenue mix by destination was 43% in North America and 57% international. North America revenue declined 24% compared to the 35% decline in rig count and the international revenue fell 13%, exceeding the decline in the international rig count as drilling activity in the Middle East registered its sharpest decline since the down cycle began. 
EBITDA was $1 million, down $42 million from the previous quarter and $156 million from the prior year. Sequentia EBITDA decrementals were 35%. 
Segment reported an operating loss, excluding other items, of $96 million for the quarter. 
Throughout the cycle, we have been intensely focused on what we can control. We aggressively pursued the declining number of bits as opportunities that were available and continue to invest and drive innovation with our customers' interest at heart. Meaning, our focus is on improving oilfield efficiency by reducing time and cost, while improving well. 
We've also been relentlessly focused on resizing the organization, lowering our cost structure and optimizing our processes. Additionally, we have repositioned our people and operations to focus on the customers and basisn around the world, which we believe will be the most active throughout the next cycle.
These actions have taken place across all 4 of our operating segments and all 15 of our business units. But today, I'll highlight a few representative examples from within our Wellbore Technologies segment. 
In our dynamic drilling solutions business, we have streamlined our operations to enhance relations with all the new customers, and we continue to execute well with our legacy offerings. We recently displaced primary competitor across the fleet of one of the largest private rig contractors in North America with our data acquisition information management systems. Additionally, we have continued investing and delivering innovative solutions to better serve the current needs of our customers, including one, building out capabilities and executing revenue-generating contracts associated with realtime drilling data acquisition, visualization and optimization technologies; two, delivering substantial drilling improvements for customers with our optimization and closely drilling automation services; three, introducing a new MWD tool and; four, introducing our geogas analyzer, the first patented Fourier transform infrared spectrometer specifically designed to provide realtime gas ratio analysis formation hydrocarbon identification. 
In our drilling and intervention business, in addition to launching a number of literally groundbreaking technologies, such as our rotary steerable tool and multiple innovative new drill bits and motors, we have substantially improve our product development and manufacturing capabilities. 
Investments made in streamlining processes, leading a manufacturing equipment and repositioning operations have us well positioned for the future. Changes implemented in our drill bit business have reduced the time it takes to take a new drill bit design for concept finished product down to 6 weeks from over 16 weeks as recently as a year ago. These changes will also allow us to reach prior peak volumes with the 25% lower headcount and will allow us to maintain substantially lower inventory levels, reducing working capital and the potential for obsolescence.
In our field service-related operations, we have numerous examples of how we've repositioned our assets in our personnel to become much more intimate with our customers focused on regions that will be most active in the future. 
Our well site services business has added to the capabilities in Argentina, which positions us well for anticipated long-term ramp in activity within the field. Here recently, an operator utilized our well site services business units, Petros fluid system and solids control services in addition to a myriad of other NOV products and equipment to drill the deepest horizontal well yet in the block of the mortar field. 
Circling back to our drilling and intervention business, we have reduced the average turnaround time for reparing bits and redressing motors in certain key basins around the world, including the Permian from 3 weeks to 1 week by expanding our field service and repair facilities. This type of improvement significantly enhances our ability to take care of our customers and reduces inventory requirements. 
As you can tell, we haven't simply reacted to a sharply deteriorating market over the past 6 quarters. We have and will continue to play offense. 
In May, the U.S. land rig count was down 80% from the prior peak and the past 2 quarters have had successive declines of approximately 20%, but it appears things have began to stabilize, at least within the North American marketplace.
While there is cautious optimism about rigs getting back to work, the extent of declines have reduced the level of trauma that likely delays some meaningful recovery until next year. 
For the third quarter, we expect our wellbore technologies segments top line to increase a couple hundred basis points with mid-30% incremental EBITDA margins. We also expect to realize an additional $15 million benefit in Q3 due to our ongoing cost cutting and operational efficiency initiatives. 
Our completion and production solutions segment generated $538 million in revenue during the second quarter, down 4% sequentially from $558 million and down 38% from $873 million recognized in the second quarter of 2015. 
EBITDA was $57 million or 10.6% of sales, an increase of $9 million from the previous quarter but down $91 million from the prior year.
Segment reported operating profit, excluding other items, of $5 million for the quarter. EBITDA improved on lower revenue due to cost-cutting initiatives, operational efficiencies and strong improvements in our subsea business as the operation benefited from high absorption in both of this manufacturing facilities and executable well on existing orders. 
We tipped in 269 million of new orders, down 59 million sequentially and shipped 333 million in revenue from backlog, resulting in an 81% book-to-bill. This segment ended the quarter with a backlog balance of $947 million, $47 million lower than the prior period. 
While our Subsea business had strong levels of activity this quarter and our plan should remain busy to at least year-end, the outlook for offshore related projects remains challenging in their pricing pressures persist. These challenges extend into other offshore-oriented businesses, including our floating production operations where there is limited visibility into additional projects outside of our existing backlog for the remainder of the year.
We do, however, remain optimistic regarding mid-term prospects as we continue to have strong dialogue regarding FPSO opportunities with customers and our new relationship with GE is contributing towards rapidly advancing our efforts to engineer and offer integrated topside solutions with standardized interfaces, which should materially improve the economics of deepwater production development. 
With the average price for WTI still hovering below $50 a barrel during the quarter, new order intake remains soft. While certain operators have slightly increased activity related to working down the inventory of drilled but uncompleted wells in the U.S. it has not yet translated into an increased activity for our well intervention and stimulation business and other completion-related offerings. 
The conversations regarding the plan to step up activity have increased. Additionally, we are seeing slight increases in production and infrastructure-related offerings, something we see as a good indication operators are preparing to get back to work as they cannot complete wells without having the production infrastructure in place. 
For the third quarter, we expect revenue to increase around 10% as we execute on certain large projects booked earlier in the year and see continued improvement in our production-related businesses. We should see 30% incrementals on the increase in revenue, and we expect to realize an additional $10 million benefit from the ongoing cost savings and efficiency enhancing initiatives, which are occurring across the segment.
While market conditions have proved challenging through the first half of 2016, we have been able to generate cash flow from operations of approximately $0.75 billion, more than twice the amount produced during the first half of 2015. 
With the current cash balance of $1.7 billion and an undrawn capacity on our credit facility of $4.4 billion, we have total liquidity in excess of $6 billion. So from a financial standpoint, NOV is very well positioned.
We hope our commentary this morning also provided you with insights into how well NOV is positioned from an operational and strategic standpoint. We are working hard to continue our long history of pioneering the critical technologies, which drive the oil and gas industry and the entire team at NOV remains laser-focused on reducing our cost structure and fine-tuning our ability to execute more efficiently regardless of the market environment. 
With that, Michelle, we'll open it up to questions."

And certainly, that's been a big business for NOV over the preceding 12-plus years. And it -- but that's also nothing new. That narrative has been out there for 1.5 years, and frankly, since the downturn begun, had been kind of preparing for a near term future that looks that way. And in view of that, we haven't jumped out there and done a great big deal. What I would tell you is I think we can get more impact for our capital by continuing to knock out these sort of bolt-on transactions a little bit smaller. When we' examined the portfolio of acquisitions that we've made over the preceding 20 years, we find consistently that the smaller transaction carry higher returns, lower risk. The specific examples that we've done here in the last 6 months have been really interesting technologies, have brought on really, really good people. The team, for instance, they came with the completion tools business is very experienced in that space and can help us grow and build the business. If you look back at our history, over the preceding 20 years, we've done a couple of large deals. But the business units that are -- that we have today, that are mostly market leaders around the globe, were really build kind of transaction by transaction, smaller acquisitions, bringing in really high quality businesses and products and technology and management teams and kind of brick-by-brick. And to me, that's a more efficient more workmanlike and more effective way to kind of build out global leading franchises. And so we see a terrific opportunity that's much larger. Certainly, we'll act on it, but realistically, I think we can do and will do a lot of good by continuing to deploy capital to the down cycle and a lot of smaller interesting high-value acquisition targets."

I want to say",462,"Yes, Sean, we -- a few years ago, we sort of begun to invest in the FPSO opportunity. We did a little study or actually had an industry expert doing it, do a study around the FPSO construction results for the industry. And I did look at it. I want to say a dozen or more vessels. And on average, they are 35% or more over budget and more than a year late. And we talked about delaying production that much. We talked about those sorts of cost overruns. That's a huge inefficiency in the space. And so in terms of the savings that this may carry, I think realistically, bringing more industrialized for the supply chain standardization and the design, kind of the partnership that we're forging with GE, I think it's going to materially move the needle. The size of each individual project for the 2 of us is going to vary a lot, given the size and capabilities of the FPSO. But it can easily range well over a couple of hundred million dollars per vessel for the larger FPSOs and beyond, and so that's exciting. But more specifically in terms of the near term opportunities, the brownfield focus is that the idea here is that we can develop families of small FPSOs that really target 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 wells and make those smaller accumulations more economic. What's interesting is you look statistically across the quarter basins, there's a lot more small basins than there are giant fields. And so it's a larger opportunity set, a way that new technology to sort of industrialized system that enables many, many, many more smaller fields to be produced will enable GE, and NOV and our shipyard partners to get up the learning curve on making these vessels. And so things will sort of work on itself, and so we're pretty excited about that. The other kind of element to the strategy I would also point out is that a lot of these larger fields, some of the inefficiencies around FPSO construction staff came from the fact that the view of the field changes over time, and so the forecast on production profiles changes over time. So part of our idea is if we take one of our small FPSOs and put on a larger field, if you put that field in the production for a year or 2, the owner that you get a lot smarter. It enables all parties to sort of optimize the design of the larger FPSO that might come in later and produced the field after many more wells. So on the whole, very excited about the partnership. I think ge is going to be a great partner and bring a lot to the mix."

And so while those pressures are in place, things tend to -- customers tend to want to put off acceptance of rigs, particularly for the rigs that don't have contracts in place. We still feel really good about the overall position, but as you know, we're very cautious about making sure that we don't get tips of in terms of the balance of sort of where we are in terms of progress payments and the amount that we have at risk.

It's not just impacting specifically completion what you think of as traditionally completion-related items. It really impacts the entire well construction process. So even though we're drilling much more efficiently and the rate of penetration is much, much higher, on a per footage basis, the amount of tubing, bits, motors, et cetera, that you consume is remaining essentially the same on a per foot basis. Additionally, when you're putting in the volumes of sand and in all these other items and you think about the flow back-type operation, you think about production chokes and things of that nature, that's an area where we're seeing a lot of demand for our products.

So that's all very speculative. But I took to state it more bluntly, I think we're mostly interested today, as we look out across a big and growing portfolio of potential M&A opportunities and pursuing a lot of smaller critical technologies, bolt-on sort of ads that we really think are going to create the most shareholder value for our shareholders in the upturn. And again, I can't stress this enough. This is how we really did build the business over the last 20-plus years. And having that moved into a much more of a buyers market, that sort of roll up your sleeves and get out there and a lot of conversations and look for opportunities to add on smaller acquisitions, I think is the best application of capital. Conversely, to go out there and to make 1 larger bet on 1 larger transaction and sort of say, well, that's it. At this point, it's just far less appeal."

In the second quarter of 2016, National Oilwell Varco did post revenues of $1.7 billion, down 21% from the first quarter and down 56% from the second quarter 2015.  Revenues declined more than expected due mostly to offshore drilling con",2379,"Thank you, Loren. In the second quarter of 2016, National Oilwell Varco did post revenues of $1.7 billion, down 21% from the first quarter and down 56% from the second quarter 2015.  Revenues declined more than expected due mostly to offshore drilling contractors further delaying acceptance of newbuilds. The $26 crude oil prices we saw in February inflicted new agony on the oilfield, sending second quarter expenditures further downward and driving U.S. rig counts to record lows going back 7 decades.
NOV generated a loss of $0.30 per fully diluted share excluding severance facility closure costs and other items totaling $0.28 per fully diluted share in the second quarter.  EBITDA was $25 million for the quarter and operating loss was $153 million, excluding $117 million in other items from both. 
Operating cash flow was $128 million for the quarter. 
Our managers continued to aggressively downsize our business to match the available market, enabling NOV to manage the decremental EBITDA leverage ex other items of only 22% sequentially. 
Our workforce was reduced 10% and SG&A declined 16% during the quarter. Solid cost reduction results in the face of continuing pricing and absorption pain. 
EBITDA leverage ex other items has been 30% on the 70% revenue decline since the present cyclical downturn began. We continue to manage cost aggressively, but we're also maintaining our investment and promising new opportunities we see for our business when prosperity returns.  New technology and lower cost will lead to higher incrementals and margins for NOV in the eventual recovery, and I will speak to our efforts in both areas.
First, on cost. Our team is resolute in our commitment to improve efficiencies, reduce capacity and generate higher profitability. During the second quarter, we detailed additional cost reduction steps that total over $400 million in annualized savings that will flow in over the next few quarters. Plans developed and actions taken during the second quarter are on top of considerable work performed already having reduced our annual personnel cost well over $2 billion from peak levels.  Since the downturn began, we have closed or are closing over 250 facilities to reduce capacity in view of lower demand.  We've also insourced work being previously outsourced to retain as many of our employees as possible and to help with absorption. Importantly, we do not believe we have sacrificed our ability to ramp up and respond to the eventual recovery. 
In a moment, Jose will take you through our detailed operating results by segment, but overall, we expect these specific actions to lead the modestly higher EBITDA in the third quarter on a modest decline in revenues, with more savings driving even higher EBITDA in the fourth quarter on roughly flattish sequential revenues.
Like others in our space, we believe we are seeing some isolated green shoots of activity, and we are encouraged that the North American rig counts have begun to increase. We have seen demand rise in recent weeks for certain products and services for North America: Rod guides for artificial lift, solids control jobs in West Texas, drilling motor rentals and other items.
On the other hand, our rig equipment business in many international markets continued to decline. At or near the bottom of the cycle, we see considerable cross currents, price pressure and shifting mix within our business. And frankly, we're not ready to call bottom yet. Our near-term outlook calls for modest revenue improvements in the Wellbore Technologies and Completion & Production Solutions segments, offset by another quarter of declines in our Rig Systems segment, which we expect to flatten thereafter.  We expect Rig Aftermarket third quarter to be down only slightly from the second quarter. 
Laser focus on efficiency is part of our DNA, and cost savings measure evolve continuously with our market outlook. Jose, Loren and I are grateful to serve with experienced, competent business leaders who roll up their sleeves and do the tough, grim work of downsizing when this industry demands it. Better days lie ahead for NOV, and this team will help us navigate the present storm. When it passes, we will emerge lean and tough.  
The oil industry has been decimated by a generational down cycle, but record low levels of rig activity will inevitably lead to production declines, higher oil prices and higher activity. In the meantime, we plan for this to be a slow grind, and we still have a lot of swamp to traverse until we get to full recovery. 
When the market turns, NOV will have used the present downturn to improve its efficiency and, importantly, advance promising new initiatives for the industry we serve. This company has a diverse, robust portfolio of critical technologies the industry needs to drive better efficiencies in a low oil price world, a portfolio which we improve day by day as we continue to invest in our optionality to recovery. 
We believe recovery will drive higher demand for completion tools and hydraulic fracture stimulation and pressure pumping equipment where NOV occupies market-leading positions. Our outlook for technology, proven by the Shell Revolution, is robust. Shell technologies will migrate to new basins on new continents requiring new sophisticated Tier 1 land rigs, bits, downhole tools and new drill pipe designs.  Again, NOV occupies formidable positions in these markets.
Rising driving efficiencies enabled by NOV's technologies will increase well counts, vis-à-vis rig counts, with fewer days of drilling required to create each new wellbore. This will spur incremental demand for well count-driven products and services like the production chokes, sand separation and oil separation equipment markets where NOV also occupies leading positions.  And high rates of drilling per day will equal high rates of consumption of bits, tools, drill pipe and rigs that we make per day. 
We acquired Trican's completion tools business into our Completion & Production Solutions segment a couple of weeks ago, which brings promising new sliding sleeve and coiled tubing frac technologies to our mix. The business plan here is simple. We can manufacture completion tools in our existing under-absorbed facilities. We can expand sales through the 67 countries we already operate in with our existing infrastructure. We see opportunities to add other completions technologies to our mix through M&A and organic investment.  We expect application of hydraulic fracture stimulation to continue to grow in an upturn, and the acquisition enhances NOV's exposure to this trend. 
Drillers and service companies will bring more attention to efficient management of their assets in the upturn. So within the Wellbore Technologies segment, we are advancing our new track ID lifecycle management system which utilizes RFID technology to provide customers with a complete life history, including hours in service of drill pipe, BHA components and drilling risers.  Over 40,000 of these chips are in service globally. But the un-penetrated market is literally millions of components. The system tracks manufacturing and inspection history of each drill string component through our inventory management system. We can install the track ID, RFID chips at our drill pipe and downhole tools factories or in the field. And once installed, the system can automatically tally strings on every trip when used with instruments mounted in the rotary table. This makes for more efficient drilling operations in addition to more efficient lifecycle management of assets for our customers.
Operators will continue to push longer laterals and smooth profiles, tightly geosteered within the sweet spots of the shale's stratigraphy. In the first quarter, we acquired tool tech [ph], which brought us a mud pulse MWD system, which fits well with our BlackStar electromagnetic wave MWD system that we have offered for many years. We're now investing to add resistivity measurements to combine mud pulse and electromagnetic wave propagation capabilities into the same tool, thereby positioning NOV to offer unique, low-cost MWD tool that can be used together with our new low-cost rotary steerable system that we developed and introduced earlier this year.  Together, this combination will enable our directional drilling service customers to provide cost-effective geosteering on longer horizontal wells. 
We will be introducing a new accounting control device for managed pressure drilling in the second half of 2016, and we are investing in rental kits for the launch currently. We see more and more customers interested in rigs that are MPD ready to drill more efficiently and safely, and NOV is developing the kit to fulfill this need. 
In the first quarter, we acquired a unique remote unmanned gas analysis unit that provides high-speed ratio measurements up to C5. The GEOgas Analyzer product transmits critical geologic data in realtime, which enables operators to reduce wellsite personnel to lower cost. This fits well with the rig instrumentation business that we have been engaged in for decades. 
Today, we have 3 eVolve closed-loop automated drilling jobs underway, and we expect to spud 2 more jobs soon, with dozens more operators interested in this emerging technology.  Our eVolve closed-loop drilling automation service has proven the ability to reduce spud-to-TD times by 1/3 or more. Drilling programs in new basins experienced learning curve effects well by well, closely bottom-ated drilling accelerates this process.  Recovery will see new green drilling crews going back to work, and our new closely bottom-ated drilling service illuminates the drilling mechanics downhole and enables computers to control surface equipment on a microsecond basis to optimize drilling performance.  The service works with our new NOVOS rig operating system, which we introduced this quarter and won our first upgrade order. It also works with our proprietary IntelliServ Wired Drill Pipe to provide high-speed data link with downhole realtime drilling instrumentation. 
NOV is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this exciting technology, given that we have the world's largest installed base of drilling equipment, the most proven stable capable rig operating system, the Wired Drill Pipe and the experience of already having drilled hundreds of thousands of feet under our belt. Our rig of the future is here today and operating in the field with high efficiency.
Our installed base of drilling equipment also uniquely positions NOV to capitalize on big data in the oilfield. We have monitored hundreds of rigs in realtime around the globe for over a decade through our eHawk system. This year, we launched our enhanced RIGSENTRY system, and we saw a significant increase in revenues for our subsea RIGSENTRY BOP monitoring service in the second quarter.  You may recall that we announced last quarter our success in predictive analytics. We successfully forecasted certain component failures weeks in advance based on our analysis of years of operating data.  Condition-based monitoring and big data will provide step change improvements in reliability and maintenance practices for sophisticated oilfield equipment, and NOV is positioned to lead the way. We are pursuing additional opportunities to host realtime remote monitoring centers in the Middle East, which will enable customers to reduce cost by permitting their experts to simultaneously monitor drilling progress across multiple rigs in realtime. 
Our second quarter saw rig system orders decline further, and we expect orders to remain depressed for the foreseeable future. With no new offshore rig builds on the horizon, we're investing in new products to enhance efficiency and safety of existing rigs, products that will enable drilling contractors to differentiate their rigs in a crowded marketplace.  For instance, we expect to introduce a new ROV retrievable BOP pod this year for subsea stacks which would enable drilling contractors to replace pods on the seafloor, avoiding an expensive and time-consuming round-trip of the stack.  Drilling contractors can retrofit their stacks with this. 
On land, we are set to introduce a lower guide arm product, which will work in conjunction with our existing STV racking arm on land rigs to bring further mechanization and potentially automation of pipe tripping activities. 
We're developing ways to improve the efficiency of contractors' existing operations by, for example, exploring opportunities to reduce SPS cost and disruptions by using condition-based monitoring. We are working with the major classification agencies to develop a way to continuously certify drilling equipment in the field using condition-based monitoring. It is early days, but this new model could significantly reduce drilling contractor costs and interruptions.
We were pleased to announce a few weeks ago a cooperation agreement with GE within our Completion & Production Solutions segment to work jointly to improve cost and speed of execution on FPSO topsides projects. We are in detailed development work around integrating GE's market-leading power generation and compression capabilities with our own offering of turret mooring systems, swivel stacks, seawater piping systems, pumps, fluid processing, treatment, cranes and deck machinery. 
By reducing the number of complex interfaces between multiple vendors, NOV and GE are vastly simplifying the supply chain, jointly engineering and costing FPSO topside modules across varying sizes and capabilities, which we will offer to the marketplace by early 2017. Final designs can be refined quickly to fit specific customer field needs, reducing time to first oil, reducing complexity and reducing cost. 
NOV is unique in our considerable experience in successful execution of complex vessel construction and dozens of projects with every major shipyard around the world.  While deepwater development projects remain challenged from a returns perspective, the opportunity to pioneer new, efficient vessel construction model, together with initiatives being advanced by deepwater wellhead companies, together with subsea processing and boosting advancements, including our own Seabox technology, can materially improve the economics of developing the vast resources that have been discovered in the deepwater.  Our initial plans focus on smaller FPSO vessels, targeting marginal discoveries in mature basins. 
In short, NOV continues to pivot into promising technologies that will disproportionately benefit in the upturn even as we shrink our productive capacities and reduce cost. Hydraulic fracture stimulation, completion tools, remote operations, big data, deepwater advancements and horizontal drilling will all play key roles in supplying an energy-hungry world in the 21st century.  NOV is investing both organically and through M&A in each of these areas.  Brighter days lie ahead, and NOV will be there to lead the way. 
To our team at NOV, let me tell you, I know these are difficult times, and I appreciate your resolve and your professionalism. We are laying the groundwork for future prosperity of a great company that you and I are blessed to be a part of. You have my heartfelt thanks. Jose?"

To quickly recap our consolidated results, revenues for the second quarter of 2016 were $1.7 billion, down 21% from the first quarter and in line with the 19% sequential decline in global rig counts. Revenues declined 23% in North America",3053,"Thanks, Clay. To quickly recap our consolidated results, revenues for the second quarter of 2016 were $1.7 billion, down 21% from the first quarter and in line with the 19% sequential decline in global rig counts. 
Revenues declined 23% in North America and 20% internationally as North American and international rig counts fell 35% and 7%, respectively. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $25 million, down $102 million from the first quarter of 2016. Sequential decremental EBITDA leverage was limited to 20% as efforts to resize the business and reduce our cost structure had their intended effect.
Operating loss, excluding other items, was $153 million. 
Looking at select other line items at the P&L. SG&A decreased by $56 million or 16% sequentially, and by $125 million or 30% year-over-year.
SG&A is now down $944 million on an annualized basis since the fourth quarter of 2014. 
Interest and other financial cost expense increased $5 million sequentially, mostly driven by incremental interest cost of approximately $2.5 million, attributable to a large capital lease we booked in late Q1 as well as other charges we do not expect to repeat next quarter.  Therefore, we anticipate interest expense to be between $27 million and $28 million for Q3. 
Other expense for the quarter increased $13 million sequentially, driven primarily by a greater loss on disposals and fixed assets. Our GAAP effective tax rate was 35.8% for the quarter and our rate, excluding other items, was 41.5%.
As a reminder, in the current environment, relatively small changes in the split between domestic and international results can have a disproportionate impact on our tax rates. 
In the third quarter, we anticipate the tax rate to be approximately 38%. 
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Working capital decreased $253 million from the first quarter of 2016. The decrease in working capital was primarily the result of a $247 million reduction in inventory levels, a $190 million reduction in customer financings, which is the decrease in cost in excess of billings netted against the decrease in billings in excess of costs and customer prepayments; and a $168 million reduction in accounts receivable.  The reductions in working capital were partially offset by decreases in accrued liabilities and accounts payable. 
While working capital decreased by over $250 million, we continue to carry more working capital than required to support the business at today's activity levels as converting inventory and receivables to cash remains challenging in the current environment.
Cash flow from operations totaled $128 million. After deducting $77 million in capital expenditures, $19 million in dividend payments, $15 million for acquisitions and $14 million in other items, we were essentially breakeven from a cash flow perspective for the quarter. Therefore, net debt remained mostly unchanged at approximately $1.6 billion.
During the quarter, we paid down our commercial paper by $100 million, leaving us with a balance of approximately $110 million. 
At June 30, 2016, we had a cash balance of $1.7 billion, $3.3 billion in total debt and our debt to capitalization was 16.8%.
Our Rig Systems segment generated revenues of $564 million during the second quarter of 2016, down 39% sequentially from $926 million, and down 71% from the $1.9 billion posted in the second quarter of 2015.
Sharp revenue declines were anticipated in the second quarter due to reduced backlogs and more projects approaching completion. However, the fall off in revenues was stronger than expected as customers who lack contracts or face pressures from operators to delay projects do what they can to defer deliveries.
Second quarter EBITDA for Rig Systems segment was $49 million. Efforts to resize the Rig Systems business and reduce the cost structure to mitigate the effects of the fall off in revenues had the intended result leading to decremental margins of only 24%. 
EBITDA margins fells 610 basis points to 8.7% of sales. Operating profit, excluding other items, was $30 million or 5.3% of sales.
For the second quarter, the split between offshore and land-related revenue was roughly 2/3 onshore and 1/3 land. New construction of offshore rigs accounted for $213 million in revenues or 12% of NOV's consolidated revenue.
New orders were down 31 million sequentially to 66 million in the second quarter, representing a 10-year low. 
Book-to-bill was 15% when new orders are compared to the 44 -- compared to the 441 million shipped out of backlog during the quarter. 
Q1 bookings primarily consisted of pressure control systems and other replacement equipment. 
For the third straight quarter, we received no new rig orders. 
Near-term demand for offshore remains almost nonexistent outside of replacement equipment. Discussions continue regarding midterm opportunities, which include one-off specialized 20K drillships and speculative mid-water semisubmersibles. However, we do not anticipate these orders materializing in 2016. 
The land markets appear much more promising as conversations with customers in North America, the Middle East and certain other international markets are increasing regarding equipment upgrades and new field opportunities. More and more operators are demanding modern, pad optimal Tier 1 AC rigs for potential upcoming projects, and contractors are seeking to upgrade and expand their capabilities in order to position themselves to capture incremental market opportunities.  While offshore opportunities will remain limited for the foreseeable future, we believe our land business will bottom in Q3 and begin to recover as we enter 2017.
We continue to work diligently on restructuring and resizing the business for anticipated future volumes. Our focus is on standardizing processes, optimizing structures and eliminating all redundancies in our global operations. This focus is designed to ensure the flexibility and agility needed to respond to recovery to significantly reduce cost and lead times. 
We anticipate revenue out of backlog will fall another $81 million in the third quarter to $360 million and anticipate an 18% to 20% fall off in total segment revenue as we continue to work off our backlog on existing projects.  Decremental margins should be in the low 20% range as we expect normal decrementals to be partially offset by $15 million in cost savings, resulting for more efforts to cut cost and improve efficiencies as we restructure the business.
Our Rig Aftermarket segment generated $643 million in revenue during the second quarter of 2016, down 7% from $391 million in Q1 of 2016 and down 45% from $657 million in the second quarter of 2015.
EBITDA for this segment was $73 million or 20.1% of sales, down 11% sequentially and down 55% from the prior year. EBITDA decremental leverage was limited to 33% as cost controls were able to partially offset the decline in total revenue and an unfavorable mix shift as sales of spare parts continued to decline, while lower-margin service and repair work began to improve. 
Operating profit, excluding other items, was $67 million or 18.4% of sales. Spare parts sales continued to decline during the second quarter. However, bookings on spares began to solidify as we entered the third quarter. 
Customers have depleted existing inventories and are now getting to the point to where they must order new parts in order to support their exiting operations. 
Service and repair work rebounded during the second quarter as reactivations in the U.S. began to take place and the number of special periodic survey projects increased by 30%.  While the number of projects and associated revenue are increasing, strained customers continue to reduce the scope of projects and associated purchases as much as possible. Our condition-based monitoring services continue to gain traction and deliver value for our customers. 
Our RIGSENTRY service, which was introduced last quarter, identified potential failures in subsea BOPs before they occurred on 4 separate occasions, potentially saving our customers millions of dollars in unplanned downtime. 
Operational success is driving commercial success as our monitoring service revenues increased by over 50% during the quarter. We expect the pace of stacking offshore rigs will continue to accelerate, a difficult process which will ultimately help rebalance an oversupplied market.
In the current environment, Rig Aftermarket remains focused on providing industry-leading OEM parts, service and support that we have delivered over the years to take care of our customers' operating needs anywhere in the world.  We also continue to partner with our customers to develop innovative solutions for their most pressing needs. Today, our customers cannot afford extra downtime and need to be optimally positioned to capitalize or any new opportunities. 
As previously noted, we are seeing strong demand for our condition-based monitoring solutions, which allow contractors to predict failures and address problems before they occur. We're also seeing growing demand for other recently introduced offerings designed to address the stress our customers are under in the current environment.  Some of these offerings include: Infield certification services, for which we travel the rigs anywhere in the world to provide required certifications on active locations, resulting in substantially reduced downtime; rig performance services, in which we assess and review a customer's equipment to identify opportunities for improving operational efficiencies and minimizing downtime; and storage presentation and reactivation services, which lowers the cost of stacking equipment and enables faster reactivation of rigs, creating a competitive advantage for contractors and securing new contracts.  Notwithstanding the remaining challenges in offshore space, conversations with our customers leave us cautiously optimistic that we are at or near a bottom for our Rig Aftermarket business. 
While we anticipate a tepid near-term recovery driven by reactivation-related business in the U.S. and pent-up demand for offshore parts, service and repair work, we could still see revenue decline in the third quarter by a couple of hundred basis points.  We also anticipate realizing roughly $5 million in cost savings during the third quarter, which should more than offset decrementals associated with the revenue decline. 
Our Wellbore Technologies segment generated $511 million in revenue during the second quarter, down 19% sequentially from $631 million and down 47% sequentially from the $956 million in the second quarter of 2015.  Revenue mix by destination was 43% North America and 57% international. 
North America revenue declined 24% compared to the 35% decline in rig count, and the international revenue fell 13%, exceeding the decline in the international rig count as drilling activity in the Middle East registered its sharpest decline since this down cycle began. 
EBITDA was $1 million, down $42 million from the previous quarter and $156 million from the prior year. Sequential EBITDA decrementals were 35%. 
Segment reported an operating loss, excluding other items, of $96 million for the quarter. 
Throughout this cycle, we have been intensely focused on what we can control. We aggressively pursued the declining number of business opportunities that were available and continued to invest and drive innovation with our customers' interest at heart. Meaning, our focus is on improving oilfield efficiencies by reducing time and cost while improving well productivity.  We have also been relentlessly focused on resizing the organization, lowering our cost structure and optimizing our processes. Additionally, we have repositioned our people and operations to focus on the customers and basins around the world which we believe will be the most active throughout the next cycle.  These actions have taken place across all 4 of our operating segments and all 15 of our business units. But today, I'll highlight a few representative examples from within our Wellbore Technologies segment. 
In our Dynamic Drilling Solutions business, we have streamlined our operations, enhanced relations with old and new customers, and we continue to execute well with our legacy offerings. We recently displaced primary competitor across the fleet of one of the largest private rig contractors in North America with our data acquisition and information management systems. Additionally, we have continued investing and delivering innovative solutions to better serve the current needs of our customers, including, one, building out capabilities and executing revenue-generating contracts associated with realtime drilling data acquisition, visualization and optimization technologies; two, delivering substantial drilling improvements for customers with our eVolve optimization and closed-loop drilling automation services; three, introducing a new MWD tool and; four, introducing our GEOgas Analyzer, the first patented Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer specifically designed to provide realtime gas ratio analysis formation hydrocarbon identification. 
In our drilling and intervention business, in addition to launching a number of, literally, groundbreaking technologies, such as our rotary steerable tool and multiple innovative new drill bits and motors, we have substantially improved our product development and manufacturing capabilities.  Investments made in streamlining processes, leading-edge manufacturing equipment and repositioning operations have us well-positioned for the future. Changes implemented in our drill bit business have reduced the time it takes to take a new drill bit design from concept to finished product down to 6 weeks from over 16 weeks as recently as a year ago. These changes will also allow us to reach prior peak volumes with a 25% lower headcount and will allow us to maintain substantially lower inventory levels, reducing working capital and the potential for obsolescence.
In our field service-related operations, we have numerous examples of how we've repositioned our assets and our personnel to become much more intimate with our customers, focused on regions that will be most active in the future.  Our WellSite Services business has added to the capabilities in Argentina, which positions us well for the anticipated long-term ramp in activity within the Vaca Muerta field. Here recently, an operator utilized our WellSite Services business units, PETROS fluid system and solids control services in addition to a myriad of other NOV products and equipment to drill the deepest horizontal well yet in the Loma Campana block of the Vaca Muerta field. 
Circling back to our drilling and intervention business, we have reduced the average turnaround time for repairing bits and redressing motors in certain key basins around the world, including the Permian, from 3 weeks to 1 week by expanding our field service and repair facilities. This type of improvement significantly enhances our ability to take care of our customers and reduces inventory requirements. 
As you can tell, we haven't simply reacted to a sharply deteriorating market over the past 6 quarters. We have and will continue to play offense. 
In May, the U.S. land rig count was down 80% from the prior peak, and the past 2 quarters have had successive declines of approximately 20%. But it appears things have begun to stabilize, at least within the North American marketplace.  While there is cautious optimism about rigs getting back to work, the extent of declines have induced a level of trauma that likely delays a meaningful recovery until next year. 
For the third quarter, we expect our Wellbore Technologies segment's top line to increase a couple hundred basis points with mid-30% incremental EBITDA margins. We also expect to realize an additional $15 million benefit in Q3 due to our ongoing cost-cutting and operational efficiency initiatives. 
Our Completion & Production Solutions segment generated $538 million in revenue during the second quarter, down 4% sequentially from $558 million and down 38% from $873 million recognized in the second quarter of 2015. 
EBITDA was $57 million or 10.6% of sales, an increase of $9 million from the previous quarter, but down $91 million from the prior year.
Segment reported operating profit, excluding other items, of $5 million for the quarter. EBITDA improved on lower revenue due to cost-cutting initiatives, operational efficiencies and strong improvements in our subsea business as the operation benefited from high absorption in both of this manufacturing facilities and executed well on existing orders. 
We took in 269 million of new orders, down 59 million sequentially, and shipped 333 million in revenue from backlog, resulting in an 81% book-to-bill. This segment ended the quarter with a backlog balance of $947 million, $47 million lower than the prior period. 
While our Subsea business had strong levels of activity this quarter, and our plant should remain busy to at least year-end, the outlook for offshore-related projects remains challenging if the pricing pressures persist. These challenges extend into other offshore-oriented businesses, including our floating production operations where there is limited visibility into additional projects outside of our existing backlog for the remainder of the year.
We do, however, remain optimistic regarding mid-term prospects as we continue to have strong dialogue regarding FPSO opportunities with customers, and our new relationship with GE is contributing towards rapidly advancing our efforts to engineer and offer integrated topside solutions with standardized interfaces, which should materially improve the economics of deepwater production development. 
With the average price for WTI still hovering below $50 a barrel during the quarter, new order intake remains soft. While certain operators have slightly increased activity related to working down the inventory of drilled but uncompleted wells in the U.S., it has not yet translated into an increase in activity for our well intervention and stimulation business and other completion-related offerings.  The conversations regarding the plans to step up activity have increased. 
Additionally, we are seeing slight increases in production and infrastructure-related offerings, something we see as a good indication operators are preparing to get back to work as they cannot complete wells without having the production infrastructure in place. 
For the third quarter, we expect revenue to increase around 10% as we execute on certain large projects booked earlier in the year and see continued improvement in our production-related businesses. We should see 30% incrementals on the increase in revenue, and we expect to realize an additional $10 million benefit from the ongoing cost savings and efficiency enhancing initiatives which are occurring across the segment.
While market conditions have proved challenging through the first half of 2016, we have been able to generate cash flow from operations of approximately $0.75 billion, more than twice the amount produced during the first half of 2015. 
With the current cash balance of $1.7 billion and an undrawn capacity on our credit facility of $4.4 billion, we have total liquidity in excess of $6 billion. So from a financial standpoint, NOV is very well-positioned.
We hope our commentary this morning also provided you with insights into how well NOV is positioned from an operational and strategic standpoint. We are working hard to continue our long history of pioneering the critical technologies, which drive the oil and gas industry and the entire team at NOV remains laser-focused on reducing our cost structure and fine-tuning our ability to execute more efficiently regardless of the market environment. 
With that, Michelle, we'll open it up to questions."

I mean, you go back to our comments, and we're kind of hunkering down for a much lower level of building in the offshore. And certainly, that's been a big business for NOV over the preceding 12-plus years. And but that's also nothing new. That narrative's been out there for 1.5 years, and frankly, we -- since the downturn began, had been kind of preparing for a near-term future that looks that way. And in view of that, we haven't jumped out there and done a great, big deal. What I would tell you is I think we can get more impact from our capital by continuing to knock out these sort of bolt-on transactions that are a little bit smaller. When we examine the portfolio of acquisitions that we've made over the preceding 20 years, we find consistently that the smaller transaction carry higher returns, lower risk. The specific examples that we've done here in the last 6 months have been really interesting technologies, have brought on really, really good people. The Trican team, for instance, that came in with the completion tools business is very experienced in that space and can help us grow and build the business. If you look back at our history, over the preceding 20 years, we've done a couple of large deals. But the business units that are -- that we have today, that are mostly market leaders around the globe, were really built kind of transaction by transaction, smaller acquisitions, bringing in really high-quality businesses and products and technology and management teams and kind of brick-by-brick. And to me, that's a more efficient, more workmanlike and more effective way to kind of build out global leading franchises. And so we see a terrific opportunity that's much larger. Certainly, we'll act on it, but realistically, I think we can do and will do a lot of good by continuing to deploy capital to the down cycle and a lot of smaller, interesting high-value acquisition targets."

And looked at it, I want to say a dozen or more vessels. And on average, they're 35% or more over budget and more than a year late. And when you talk about delaying production that much, when you talk about those sorts of cost overruns, that's a huge inefficiency in the space. And so in terms of the savings that this may carry, I think realistically, bringing a more industrialized sort of supply chain, standardization in the design, kind of the partnership that we're forging with GE, I think it's going to materially move the needle. The size of each individual project for the 2 of us is going to vary a lot given the size and capabilities of the FPSO. But can easily range well over a couple of hundred million dollars per vessel for the larger FPSOs and beyond. And so that's exciting. But more specifically, in terms of the near-term opportunities, the brownfield focus is, the idea here is that we can develop families of small FPSOs that really target 1, 2, 4, 5 wells and make those smaller accumulations more economic. What's interesting is you look statistically across the deepwater basins, there's a lot more smaller fields than there are giant fields. And so it's a larger opportunity set. A way that a new technology, new sort of industrialized system that enables many, many, many more smaller fields to be produced, will enable GE and NOV and our shipyard partners to get up the learning curve on making these vessels, and so the things will sort of grow on itself. And so we're pretty excited about that. The other kind of element to the strategy I would also point out is that a lot of these larger fields, some of the inefficiencies around FPSO construction stem from the fact that the view of the field changes over time. And so the forecast on production profiles and the like changes over time. So part of our idea is that we can take one of our small FPSOs and put it on a larger field, and put that field under production for a year or 2. The owner of that field gets a lot smarter. It enables all parties to sort of optimize the design of the larger FPSO that might come in later and produce the field through many more wells. So on the whole, very excited about the partnership. I think GE is going to be a great partner and bring a lot to the mix."

And to some degree, we're helping facilitate those discussions.  And so while those pressures are in place, things tend to -- customers tend to want to put off acceptance of rigs, particularly for the rigs that don't have contracts in place. We still feel really good about the overall position. But as you know, we're very cautious about making sure that we don't get over tips of our skis in terms of the balance of sort of where we are in terms of progress payments and the amount that we have at risk.

And I think there's -- people have some -- sometimes, have some misperceptions about our portfolio and product offering. But really, as we see the trend that is moving forward across not just North America, but all markets, that trend is due to -- is related to more product-consumptive wells, more service-intensive and product-consumptive wells. It's not just impacting specifically completion, what you think of as traditionally completion-related items, it really impacts the entire well construction process. So even though we're drilling much more efficiently and the rate of penetration is much, much higher, on a per footage basis, the amount of tubing, bits, motors, et cetera, that you consume is remaining essentially the same on a per foot basis. Additionally, when you're putting in the volumes of sand and proppant and all these other items, when you think about the flow back-type operations, you think about production chokes and things of that nature, that's an area where we're seeing a lot of demand for our products. And I think earlier, Clay touched on rod lift and the rods to where we're seeing a lot of demand and attention put on that product offering. So across our Wellbore Technologies segment as well as some large components of our completion solutions segment, we're seeing -- we're going to see a good impact from the trends that are taking place."

And those products are, in addition to downhole progressing cavity pumps, rotating heads, other artificial lift products that we have. And those are in addition to, as Jose just mentioned, production chokes, our dynamic oil recovery system for producing water. We have a lot of production and a growing portfolio of production equipment and processing and treatment equipment, centrifugal pumps, lack units, those sorts of things. So NOV, we've been quietly investing more in that area and kind of growing out that portfolio.

And again, I can't stress this enough. This is sort of how we really did build the business over the last 20-plus years. And having that moved into a much more of a buyer's market, that sort of roll up your sleeves and get out there, and a lot of conversations and look for opportunities to add on smaller acquisitions, I think, is the best application of capital.

In the second quarter of 2016, National Oilwell Varco did post revenues of $1.7 billion, down 21% from the first quarter and down 56% from the second quarter 2015.

In the second quarter of 2016, National Oilwell Varco did post revenues of $1.7 billion, down 21% from the first quarter and down 56% from the second quarter 2015.  Revenues declined more than expected due mostly to offshore drilling contractors further delaying acceptance of newbuilds. The $26 crude oil prices we saw in February inflicted new agony on the oilfield, sending second quarter expenditures further downward and driving U.S. rig counts to record lows going back 7 decades.
NOV generated a loss of $0.30 per fully diluted share excluding severance facility closure costs and other items totaling $0.28 per fully diluted share in the second quarter.  EBITDA was $25 million for the quarter and operating loss was $153 million, excluding $117 million in other items from both. 
Operating cash flow was $128 million for the quarter. 
Our managers continued to aggressively downsize our business to match the available market, enabling NOV to manage the decremental EBITDA leverage ex other items of only 22% sequentially. 
Our workforce was reduced 10% and SG&A declined 16% during the quarter. Solid cost reduction results in the face of continuing pricing and absorption pain. 
EBITDA leverage ex other items has been 30% on the 70% revenue decline since the present cyclical downturn began. We continue to manage cost aggressively, but we're also maintaining our investment and promising new opportunities we see for our business when prosperity returns.  New technology and lower cost will lead to higher incrementals and margins for NOV in the eventual recovery, and I will speak to our efforts in both areas.
First, on cost. Our team is resolute in our commitment to improve efficiencies, reduce capacity and generate higher profitability. During the second quarter, we detailed additional cost reduction steps that total over $400 million in annualized savings that will flow in over the next few quarters. Plans developed and actions taken during the second quarter are on top of considerable work performed already having reduced our annual personnel cost well over $2 billion from peak levels.  Since the downturn began, we have closed or are closing over 250 facilities to reduce capacity in view of lower demand. We've also insourced work being previously outsourced to retain as many of our employees as possible and to help with absorption. Importantly, we do not believe we have sacrificed our ability to ramp up and respond to the eventual recovery. 
In a moment, Jose will take you through our detailed operating results by segment, but overall, we expect these specific actions to lead the modestly higher EBITDA in the third quarter on a modest decline in revenues, with more savings driving even higher EBITDA in the fourth quarter on roughly flattish sequential revenues.
Like others in our space, we believe we are seeing some isolated green shoots of activity, and we are encouraged that the North American rig counts have begun to increase. We have seen demand rise in recent weeks for certain products and services for North America: Rod guides for artificial lift, solids control jobs in West Texas, drilling motor rentals and other items.
On the other hand, our rig equipment business in many international markets continued to decline. At or near the bottom of the cycle, we see considerable cross currents, price pressure and shifting mix within our business. And frankly, we're not ready to call bottom yet. Our near-term outlook calls for modest revenue improvements in the Wellbore Technologies and Completion & Production Solutions segments, offset by another quarter of declines in our Rig Systems segment, which we expect to flatten thereafter.  We expect Rig Aftermarket third quarter to be down only slightly from the second quarter. 
Laser-focus on efficiency is part of our DNA, and cost savings measure evolve continuously with our market outlook. Jose, Loren and I are grateful to serve with experienced, competent business leaders who roll up their sleeves and do the tough, grim work of downsizing when this industry demands it. Better days lie ahead for NOV, and this team will help us navigate the present storm. When it passes, we will emerge lean and tough.  
The oil industry has been decimated by a generational down cycle, but record low levels of rig activity will inevitably lead to production declines, higher oil prices and higher activity. In the meantime, we plan for this to be a slow grind, and we still have a lot of swamp to traverse until we get to full recovery. 
When the market turns, NOV will have used the present downturn to improve its efficiency and, importantly, advance promising new initiatives for the industry we serve. This company has a diverse, robust portfolio of critical technologies the industry needs to drive better efficiencies in a low oil price world, a portfolio which we improve day by day as we continue to invest in our optionality to recovery. 
We believe recovery will drive higher demand for completion tools and hydraulic fracture stimulation and pressure pumping equipment where NOV occupies market-leading positions. Our outlook for technology, proven by the Shell Revolution, is robust. Shell technologies will migrate to new basins on new continents requiring new sophisticated Tier 1 land rigs, bits, downhole tools and new drill pipe designs.  Again, NOV occupies formidable positions in these markets.
Rising driving efficiencies enabled by NOV's technologies will increase well counts, vis-à-vis rig counts, with fewer days of drilling required to create each new wellbore. This will spur incremental demand for well count-driven products and services like the production chokes, sand separation and oil separation equipment markets where NOV also occupies leading positions.  And high rates of drilling per day will equal high rates of consumption of bits, tools, drill pipe and rigs that we make per day. 
We acquired Trican's completion tools business into our Completion & Production Solutions segment a couple of weeks ago, which brings promising new sliding sleeve and coiled tubing frac technologies to our mix. The business plan here is simple. We can manufacture completion tools in our existing under-absorbed facilities. We can expand sales through the 67 countries we already operate in with our existing infrastructure. We see opportunities to add other completions technologies to our mix through M&A and organic investment.  We expect application of hydraulic fracture stimulation to continue to grow in an upturn, and the acquisition enhances NOV's exposure to this trend. 
Drillers and service companies will bring more attention to efficient management of their assets in the upturn. So within the Wellbore Technologies segment, we are advancing our new track ID life-cycle management system which utilizes RFID technology to provide customers with a complete life history, including hours in service of drill pipe, BHA components and drilling risers.  Over 40,000 of these chips are in service globally. But the unpenetrated market is literally millions of components. The system tracks manufacturing and inspection history of each drill string component through our inventory management system. We can install the track ID, RFID chips at our drill pipe and downhole tools factories or in the field. And once installed, the system can automatically tally strings on every trip when used with instruments mounted in the rotary table. This makes for more efficient drilling operations in addition to more efficient life-cycle management of assets for our customers.
Operators will continue to push longer laterals and smooth profiles, tightly geosteered within the sweet spots of the shale's stratigraphy. In the first quarter, we acquired Tolteq, which brought us a mud pulse MWD system, which fits well with our BlackStar electromagnetic wave MWD system that we have offered for many years. We're now investing to add resistivity measurements to combine mud pulse and electromagnetic wave propagation capabilities into the same tool, thereby positioning NOV to offer unique, low-cost MWD tool that can be used together with our new low-cost rotary steerable system that we developed and introduced earlier this year.  Together, this combination will enable our directional drilling service customers to provide cost-effective geosteering on longer horizontal wells. 
We will be introducing a new rotating control device for managed pressure drilling in the second half of 2016, and we are investing in rental kits for the launch currently. We see more and more customers interested in rigs that are MPD ready to drill more efficiently and safely, and NOV is developing the kit to fulfill this need. 
In the first quarter, we acquired a unique remote unmanned gas analysis unit that provides high-speed ratio measurements up to C5. The GEOgas Analyzer product transmits critical geologic data in realtime, which enables operators to reduce wellsite personnel to lower cost. This fits well with the rig instrumentation business that we have been engaged in for decades. 
Today, we have 3 eVolve closed-loop automated drilling jobs underway, and we expect to spud 2 more jobs soon, with dozens more operators interested in this emerging technology.  Our eVolve closed-loop drilling automation service has proven the ability to reduce spud-to-TD times by 1/3 or more. Drilling programs in new basins experienced learning curve effects well by well, closely bottom-ated drilling accelerates this process.  Recovery will see new green drilling crews going back to work, and our new closely bottom-ated drilling service illuminates the drilling mechanics downhole and enables computers to control surface equipment on a microsecond basis to optimize drilling performance.  The service works with our new NOVOS rig operating system, which we introduced this quarter and won our first upgrade order. It also works with our proprietary IntelliServ Wired Drill Pipe to provide high-speed data link with downhole real-time drilling instrumentation. 
NOV is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this exciting technology, given that we have the world's largest installed base of drilling equipment, the most proven stable capable rig operating system, the Wired Drill Pipe and the experience of already having drilled hundreds of thousands of feet under our belt. Our rig of the future is here today and operating in the field with high efficiency.
Our installed base of drilling equipment also uniquely positions NOV to capitalize on big data in the oilfield. We have monitored hundreds of rigs in real time around the globe for over a decade through our eHawk system. This year, we launched our enhanced RIGSENTRY system, and we saw a significant increase in revenues for our subsea RIGSENTRY BOP monitoring service in the second quarter.  You may recall that we announced last quarter our success in predictive analytics. We successfully forecasted certain component failures weeks in advance based on our analysis of years of operating data.  Condition-based monitoring and big data will provide step change improvements in reliability and maintenance practices for sophisticated oilfield equipment, and NOV is positioned to lead the way. We are pursuing additional opportunities to host real-time remote monitoring centers in the Middle East, which will enable customers to reduce cost by permitting their experts to simultaneously monitor drilling progress across multiple rigs in real time. 
Our second quarter saw rig system orders decline further, and we expect orders to remain depressed for the foreseeable future. With no new offshore rig builds on the horizon, we're investing in new products to enhance efficiency and safety of existing rigs, products that will enable drilling contractors to differentiate their rigs in a crowded marketplace.  For instance, we expect to introduce a new ROV retrievable BOP pod this year for subsea stacks which would enable drilling contractors to replace pods on the seafloor, avoiding an expensive and time-consuming round-trip of the stack.  Drilling contractors can retrofit their stacks with this. 
On land, we are set to introduce a lower guide arm product, which will work in conjunction with our existing STV racking arm on land rigs to bring further mechanization and potentially automation of pipe tripping activities. 
We're developing ways to improve the efficiency of contractors' existing operations by, for example, exploring opportunities to reduce SPS cost and disruptions by using condition-based monitoring. We are working with the major classification agencies to develop a way to continuously certify drilling equipment in the field using condition-based monitoring. It is early days, but this new model could significantly reduce drilling contractor costs and interruptions.
We were pleased to announce a few weeks ago a cooperation agreement with GE within our Completion & Production Solutions segment to work jointly to improve cost and speed of execution on FPSO topsides projects. We are in detailed development work around integrating GE's market-leading power generation and compression capabilities with our own offering of turret mooring systems, swivel stacks, seawater piping systems, pumps, fluid processing, treatment, cranes and deck machinery. 
By reducing the number of complex interfaces between multiple vendors, NOV and GE are vastly simplifying the supply chain, jointly engineering and costing FPSO topside modules across varying sizes and capabilities, which we will offer to the marketplace by early 2017. Final designs can be refined quickly to fit specific customer field needs, reducing time to first oil, reducing complexity and reducing cost. 
NOV is unique in our considerable experience in successful execution of complex vessel construction and dozens of projects with every major shipyard around the world.  While deepwater development projects remain challenged from a returns perspective, the opportunity to pioneer new, efficient vessel construction model, together with initiatives being advanced by deepwater wellhead companies, together with subsea processing and boosting advancements, including our own Seabox technology, can materially improve the economics of developing the vast resources that have been discovered in the deepwater.  Our initial plans focus on smaller FPSO vessels, targeting marginal discoveries in mature basins. 
In short, NOV continues to pivot into promising technologies that will disproportionately benefit in the upturn even as we shrink our productive capacities and reduce cost. Hydraulic fracture stimulation, completion tools, remote operations, big data, deepwater advancements and horizontal drilling will all play key roles in supplying an energy-hungry world in the 21st century.  NOV is investing both organically and through M&A in each of these areas.  Brighter days lie ahead, and NOV will be there to lead the way. 
To our team at NOV, let me tell you, I know these are difficult times, and I appreciate your resolve and your professionalism. We are laying the groundwork for future prosperity of a great company that you and I are blessed to be a part of. You have my heartfelt thanks. Jose?"

Revenues declined 23% in North America",3052,"Thanks, Clay. To quickly recap our consolidated results, revenues for the second quarter of 2016 were $1.7 billion, down 21% from the first quarter and in line with the 19% sequential decline in global rig counts. 
Revenues declined 23% in North America and 20% internationally as North American and international rig counts fell 35% and 7%, respectively. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $25 million, down $102 million from the first quarter of 2016. Sequential decremental EBITDA leverage was limited to 20% as efforts to resize the business and reduce our cost structure had their intended effect.
Operating loss, excluding other items, was $153 million. 
Looking at select other line items at the P&L. SG&A decreased by $56 million or 16% sequentially, and by $125 million or 30% year-over-year.
SG&A is now down $944 million on an annualized basis since the fourth quarter of 2014. 
Interest and other financial cost expense increased $5 million sequentially, mostly driven by incremental interest cost of approximately $2.5 million, attributable to a large capital lease we booked in late Q1 as well as other charges we do not expect to repeat next quarter.  Therefore, we anticipate interest expense to be between $27 million and $28 million for Q3. 
Other expense for the quarter increased $13 million sequentially, driven primarily by a greater loss on disposals and fixed assets. Our GAAP effective tax rate was 35.8% for the quarter and our rate, excluding other items, was 41.5%.
As a reminder, in the current environment, relatively small changes in the split between domestic and international results can have a disproportionate impact on our tax rates. 
In the third quarter, we anticipate the tax rate to be approximately 38%. 
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Working capital decreased $253 million from the first quarter of 2016. The decrease in working capital was primarily the result of a $247 million reduction in inventory levels, a $190 million reduction in customer financings, which is the decrease in cost in excess of billings netted against the decrease in billings in excess of costs and customer prepayments; and a $168 million reduction in accounts receivable.  The reductions in working capital were partially offset by decreases in accrued liabilities and accounts payable. 
While working capital decreased by over $250 million, we continue to carry more working capital than required to support the business at today's activity levels as converting inventory and receivables to cash remains challenging in the current environment.
Cash flow from operations totaled $128 million. After deducting $77 million in capital expenditures, $19 million in dividend payments, $15 million for acquisitions and $14 million in other items, we were essentially breakeven from a cash flow perspective for the quarter. Therefore, net debt remained mostly unchanged at approximately $1.6 billion.
During the quarter, we paid down our commercial paper by $100 million, leaving us with a balance of approximately $110 million. 
At June 30, 2016, we had a cash balance of $1.7 billion, $3.3 billion in total debt and our debt to capitalization was 16.8%.
Our Rig Systems segment generated revenues of $564 million during the second quarter of 2016, down 39% sequentially from $926 million, and down 71% from the $1.9 billion posted in the second quarter of 2015.
Sharp revenue declines were anticipated in the second quarter due to reduced backlogs and more projects approaching completion. However, the fall off in revenues was stronger than expected as customers who lack contracts or face pressures from operators to delay projects do what they can to defer deliveries.
Second quarter EBITDA for Rig Systems segment was $49 million. Efforts to resize the Rig Systems business and reduce the cost structure to mitigate the effects of the fall off in revenues had the intended result leading to decremental margins of only 24%. 
EBITDA margins fells 610 basis points to 8.7% of sales. Operating profit, excluding other items, was $30 million or 5.3% of sales.
For the second quarter, the split between offshore and land-related revenue was roughly 2/3 onshore and 1/3 land. New construction of offshore rigs accounted for $213 million in revenues or 12% of NOV's consolidated revenue.
New orders were down $31 million sequentially to $66 million in the second quarter, representing a 10-year low. 
Book-to-bill was 15% when new orders are compared to the 44 -- compared to the $441 million shipped out of backlog during the quarter. 
Q1 bookings primarily consisted of pressure control systems and other replacement equipment. 
For the third straight quarter, we received no new rig orders. 
Near-term demand for offshore remains almost nonexistent outside of replacement equipment. Discussions continue regarding midterm opportunities, which include one-off specialized 20K drillships and speculative mid-water semisubmersibles. However, we do not anticipate these orders materializing in 2016. 
The land markets appear much more promising as conversations with customers in North America, the Middle East and certain other international markets are increasing regarding equipment upgrades and new field opportunities. More and more operators are demanding modern, pad optimal Tier 1 AC rigs for potential upcoming projects, and contractors are seeking to upgrade and expand their capabilities in order to position themselves to capture incremental market opportunities.  While offshore opportunities will remain limited for the foreseeable future, we believe our land business will bottom in Q3 and begin to recover as we enter 2017.
We continue to work diligently on restructuring and resizing the business for anticipated future volumes. Our focus is on standardizing processes, optimizing structures and eliminating all redundancies in our global operations. This focus is designed to ensure the flexibility and agility needed to respond to recovery to significantly reduce cost and lead times. 
We anticipate revenue out of backlog will fall another $81 million in the third quarter to $360 million and anticipate an 18% to 20% fall-off in total segment revenue as we continue to work off our backlog on existing projects.  Decremental margins should be in the low 20% range as we expect normal decrementals to be partially offset by $15 million in cost savings, resulting for more efforts to cut cost and improve efficiencies as we restructure the business.
Our Rig Aftermarket segment generated $643 million in revenue during the second quarter of 2016, down 7% from $391 million in Q1 of 2016 and down 45% from $657 million in the second quarter of 2015.
EBITDA for this segment was $73 million or 20.1% of sales, down 11% sequentially and down 55% from the prior year. EBITDA decremental leverage was limited to 33% as cost controls were able to partially offset the decline in total revenue and an unfavorable mix shift as sales of spare parts continued to decline, while lower-margin service and repair work began to improve. 
Operating profit, excluding other items, was $67 million or 18.4% of sales. Spare parts sales continued to decline during the second quarter. However, bookings on spares began to solidify as we entered the third quarter. 
Customers have depleted existing inventories and are now getting to the point to where they must order new parts in order to support their exiting operations. 
Service and repair work rebounded during the second quarter as reactivations in the U.S. began to take place and the number of special periodic survey projects increased by 30%.  While the number of projects and associated revenue are increasing, strained customers continue to reduce the scope of projects and associated purchases as much as possible. Our condition-based monitoring services continue to gain traction and deliver value for our customers. 
Our RIGSENTRY service, which was introduced last quarter, identified potential failures in subsea BOPs before they occurred on 4 separate occasions, potentially saving our customers millions of dollars in unplanned downtime. 
Operational success is driving commercial success as our monitoring service revenues increased by over 50% during the quarter. We expect the pace of stacking offshore rigs will continue to accelerate, a difficult process which will ultimately help rebalance an oversupplied market.
In the current environment, Rig Aftermarket remains focused on providing industry-leading OEM parts, service and support that we have delivered over the years to take care of our customers' operating needs anywhere in the world.  We also continue to partner with our customers to develop innovative solutions for their most pressing needs. Today, our customers cannot afford extra downtime and need to be optimally positioned to capitalize or any new opportunities. 
As previously noted, we are seeing strong demand for our condition-based monitoring solutions, which allow contractors to predict failures and address problems before they occur. We're also seeing growing demand for other recently introduced offerings designed to address the stress our customers are under in the current environment.  Some of these offerings include: Infield certification services, for which we travel the rigs anywhere in the world to provide required certifications on active locations, resulting in substantially reduced downtime; rig performance services, in which we assess and review a customer's equipment to identify opportunities for improving operational efficiencies and minimizing downtime; and storage presentation and reactivation services, which lowers the cost of stacking equipment and enables faster reactivation of rigs, creating a competitive advantage for contractors and securing new contracts.  Notwithstanding the remaining challenges in offshore space, conversations with our customers leave us cautiously optimistic that we are at or near a bottom for our Rig Aftermarket business. 
While we anticipate a tepid near-term recovery driven by reactivation-related business in the U.S. and pent-up demand for offshore parts, service and repair work, we could still see revenue decline in the third quarter by a couple of hundred basis points.  We also anticipate realizing roughly $5 million in cost savings during the third quarter, which should more than offset decrementals associated with the revenue decline. 
Our Wellbore Technologies segment generated $511 million in revenue during the second quarter, down 19% sequentially from $631 million and down 47% sequentially from the $956 million in the second quarter of 2015.  Revenue mix by destination was 43% North America and 57% international. 
North America revenue declined 24% compared to the 35% decline in rig count, and the international revenue fell 13%, exceeding the decline in the international rig count as drilling activity in the Middle East registered its sharpest decline since this down cycle began. 
EBITDA was $1 million, down $42 million from the previous quarter and $156 million from the prior year. Sequential EBITDA decrementals were 35%. 
Segment reported an operating loss, excluding other items, of $96 million for the quarter. 
Throughout this cycle, we have been intensely focused on what we can control. We aggressively pursued the declining number of business opportunities that were available and continued to invest and drive innovation with our customers' interest at heart. Meaning, our focus is on improving oilfield efficiencies by reducing time and cost while improving well productivity.  We have also been relentlessly focused on resizing the organization, lowering our cost structure and optimizing our processes. Additionally, we have repositioned our people and operations to focus on the customers and basins around the world which we believe will be the most active throughout the next cycle.  These actions have taken place across all 4 of our operating segments and all 15 of our business units. But today, I'll highlight a few representative examples from within our Wellbore Technologies segment. 
In our Dynamic Drilling Solutions business, we have streamlined our operations, enhanced relations with old and new customers, and we continue to execute well with our legacy offerings. We recently displaced primary competitor across the fleet of one of the largest private rig contractors in North America with our data acquisition and information management systems. Additionally, we have continued investing and delivering innovative solutions to better serve the current needs of our customers, including: one, building out capabilities and executing revenue-generating contracts associated with real-time drilling data acquisition, visualization and optimization technologies; two, delivering substantial drilling improvements for customers with our eVolve optimization and closed-loop drilling automation services; three, introducing a new MWD tool and; four, introducing our GEOgas Analyzer, the first patented Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer specifically designed to provide real-time gas ratio analysis formation hydrocarbon identification. 
In our drilling and intervention business, in addition to launching a number of, literally, groundbreaking technologies, such as our rotary steerable tool and multiple innovative new drill bits and motors, we have substantially improved our product development and manufacturing capabilities.  Investments made in streamlining processes, leading-edge manufacturing equipment and repositioning operations have us well-positioned for the future. Changes implemented in our drill bit business have reduced the time it takes to take a new drill bit design from concept to finished product down to 6 weeks from over 16 weeks as recently as a year ago. These changes will also allow us to reach prior peak volumes with a 25% lower headcount and will allow us to maintain substantially lower inventory levels, reducing working capital and the potential for obsolescence.
In our field service-related operations, we have numerous examples of how we've repositioned our assets and our personnel to become much more intimate with our customers, focused on regions that will be most active in the future.  Our WellSite Services business has added to the capabilities in Argentina, which positions us well for the anticipated long-term ramp in activity within the Vaca Muerta field. Here recently, an operator utilized our WellSite Services business units, PETROS fluid system and solids control services in addition to a myriad of other NOV products and equipment to drill the deepest horizontal well yet in the Loma Campana block of the Vaca Muerta field. 
Circling back to our drilling and intervention business, we have reduced the average turnaround time for repairing bits and redressing motors in certain key basins around the world, including the Permian, from 3 weeks to 1 week by expanding our field service and repair facilities. This type of improvement significantly enhances our ability to take care of our customers and reduces inventory requirements. 
As you can tell, we haven't simply reacted to a sharply deteriorating market over the past 6 quarters. We have and will continue to play offense. 
In May, the U.S. land rig count was down 80% from the prior peak, and the past 2 quarters have had successive declines of approximately 20%. But it appears things have begun to stabilize, at least within the North American marketplace.  While there is cautious optimism about rigs getting back to work, the extent of declines have induced a level of trauma that likely delays a meaningful recovery until next year. 
For the third quarter, we expect our Wellbore Technologies segment's top line to increase a couple hundred basis points with mid-30% incremental EBITDA margins. We also expect to realize an additional $15 million benefit in Q3 due to our ongoing cost-cutting and operational efficiency initiatives. 
Our Completion & Production Solutions segment generated $538 million in revenue during the second quarter, down 4% sequentially from $558 million and down 38% from $873 million recognized in the second quarter of 2015. 
EBITDA was $57 million or 10.6% of sales, an increase of $9 million from the previous quarter, but down $91 million from the prior year.
Segment reported operating profit, excluding other items, of $5 million for the quarter. EBITDA improved on lower revenue due to cost-cutting initiatives, operational efficiencies and strong improvements in our subsea business as the operation benefited from high absorption in both of its manufacturing facilities and executed well on existing orders. 
We took in $269 million of new orders, down $59 million sequentially, and shipped $333 million in revenue from backlog, resulting in an 81% book-to-bill. This segment ended the quarter with a backlog balance of $947 million, $47 million lower than the prior period. 
While our Subsea business had strong levels of activity this quarter, and our plant should remain busy through at least year-end, the outlook for offshore-related projects remains challenging if the pricing pressures persist. These challenges extend into other offshore-oriented businesses, including our floating production operations where there is limited visibility into additional projects outside of our existing backlog for the remainder of the year.
We do, however, remain optimistic regarding mid-term prospects as we continue to have strong dialogue regarding FPSO opportunities with customers, and our new relationship with GE is contributing towards rapidly advancing our efforts to engineer and offer integrated topside solutions with standardized interfaces, which should materially improve the economics of deepwater production development. 
With the average price for WTI still hovering below $50 a barrel during the quarter, new order intake remains soft. While certain operators have slightly increased activity related to working down the inventory of drilled but uncompleted wells in the U.S., it has not yet translated into an increase in activity for our well intervention and stimulation business and other completion-related offerings.  The conversations regarding the plans to step up activity have increased. 
Additionally, we are seeing slight increases in production and infrastructure-related offerings, something we see as a good indication operators are preparing to get back to work as they cannot complete wells without having the production infrastructure in place. 
For the third quarter, we expect revenue to increase around 10% as we execute on certain large projects booked earlier in the year and see continued improvement in our production-related businesses. We should see 30% incrementals on the increase in revenue, and we expect to realize an additional $10 million benefit from the ongoing cost savings and efficiency enhancing initiatives which are occurring across the segment.
While market conditions have proved challenging through the first half of 2016, we have been able to generate cash flow from operations of approximately $0.75 billion, more than twice the amount produced during the first half of 2015. 
With the current cash balance of $1.7 billion and an undrawn capacity on our credit facility of $4.4 billion, we have total liquidity in excess of $6 billion. So from a financial standpoint, NOV is very well-positioned.
We hope our commentary this morning also provided you with insights into how well NOV is positioned from an operational and strategic standpoint. We are working hard to continue our long history of pioneering the critical technologies, which drive the oil and gas industry and the entire team at NOV remains laser-focused on reducing our cost structure and fine-tuning our ability to execute more efficiently regardless of the market environment. 
With that, Michelle, we'll open it up to questions."

I mean, you go back to our comments, and we're kind of hunkering down for a much lower level of building in the offshore. And certainly, that's been a big business for NOV over the preceding 12-plus years. But that's also nothing new. That narrative's been out there for 1.5 years, and frankly, we -- since the downturn began, had been kind of preparing for a near-term future that looks that way. And in view of that, we haven't jumped out there and done a great, big deal. What I would tell you is I think we can get more impact from our capital by continuing to knock out these sort of bolt-on transactions that are a little bit smaller. When we examine the portfolio of acquisitions that we've made over the preceding 20 years, we find consistently that the smaller transaction carry higher returns, lower risk. The specific examples that we've done here in the last 6 months have been really interesting technologies, have brought on really, really good people. The Trican team, for instance, that came in with the completion tools business is very experienced in that space and can help us grow and build the business. If you look back at our history, over the preceding 20 years, we've done a couple of large deals. But the business units that are -- that we have today, that are mostly market leaders around the globe, were really built kind of transaction by transaction, smaller acquisitions, bringing in really high-quality businesses and products and technology and management teams and kind of brick-by-brick. And to me, that's a more efficient, more workmanlike and more effective way to kind of build out global leading franchises. And so we see a terrific opportunity that's much larger. Certainly, we'll act on it, but realistically, I think we can do and will do a lot of good by continuing to deploy capital to the down cycle in a lot of smaller, interesting high-value acquisition targets."

And the potential for you all."
31900,337764329,1015791,"National Oilwell Varco, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","NOV Inc.","Executives","Yes, Sean, we -- a few years ago, when we sort of begun to invest in the FPSO opportunity, we did a little study, or actually had an industry expert do a study around the FPSO construction results for the industry.

And they looked at I want to say a dozen or more vessels. And on average, they're 35% or more over budget and more than a year late. And when you talk about delaying production that much, when you talk about those sorts of cost overruns, that's a huge inefficiency in the space. And so in terms of the savings that this may carry, I think realistically, bringing a more industrialized sort of supply chain, standardization in the design, kind of the partnership that we're forging with GE, I think it's going to materially move the needle. The size of each individual project for the 2 of us is going to vary a lot given the size and capabilities of the FPSO. But can easily range well over a couple of hundred million dollars per vessel for the larger FPSOs and beyond. And so that's exciting. But more specifically, in terms of the near-term opportunities, the brownfield focus is, the idea here is that we can develop families of small FPSOs that really target 1, 2, 4, 5 wells and make those smaller accumulations more economic. What's interesting is you look statistically across the deepwater basins, there's a lot more smaller fields than there are giant fields. And so it's a larger opportunity set. A way that a new technology, new sort of industrialized system that enables many, many, many more smaller fields to be produced, will enable GE and NOV and our shipyard partners to get up the learning curve on making these vessels, and so the things will sort of grow on itself. And so we're pretty excited about that. The other kind of element to the strategy I would also point out is that a lot of these larger fields, some of the inefficiencies around FPSO construction stem from the fact that the view of the field changes over time. And so the forecast on production profiles and the like changes over time. So part of our idea is that we can take one of our small FPSOs and put it on a larger field, and put that field under production for a year or 2. The owner of that field gets a lot smarter. It enables all parties to sort of optimize the design of the larger FPSO that might come in later and produce the field through many more wells. So on the whole, very excited about the partnership. I think GE is going to be a great partner and bring a lot to the mix."

We're continuing to progress all the contracts forward and are maintaining really good relationships with both the shipyards and the drilling contractors as well, but there's certainly tremendous amount of tension between the drilling contractors and the shipyards. And to some degree, we're helping facilitate those discussions.  And so while those pressures are in place, things tend to -- customers tend to want to put off acceptance of rigs, particularly for the rigs that don't have contracts in place. We still feel really good about the overall position. But as you know, we're very cautious about making sure that we don't get over tips of our skis in terms of the balance of sort of where we are in terms of progress payments and the amount that we have at risk.

When I think back to the ramp up from 2006 onward, a lot of time and effort went into qualifying our vendors and kind of developing a supply chain that supports our operations. And honestly, in terms of cost cutting in 2015, that was kind of the first actions that we took, was to in-source more and try to keep our factories loaded. So kind of building out our supply chain once again will be challenging.  Labor will be a challenge certainly. Obviously, a very painful time for this industry and for this company to lose so many talented people. And attracting those folks back or folks that could come in and kind of grow with us is going to be a challenge. But look, this is nothing new in the oilfield. This is a cyclical business. And I think we've said in prior calls, one of the critical skills that you got to have is the ability to both reduce quickly in markets like this, but also the ability to grow quickly when it goes the other way. And so frankly, we're looking forward to solving the challenges that the upturn are going to bring to us."

And I think there's -- people have some -- sometimes, have some misperceptions about our portfolio and product offering.

It's not just impacting specifically completion, what you think of as traditionally completion-related items, it really impacts the entire well construction process. So even though we're drilling much more efficiently and the rate of penetration is much, much higher, on a per footage basis, the amount of tubing, bits, motors, et cetera, that you consume is remaining essentially the same on a per-foot basis. Additionally, when you're putting in the volumes of sand and proppant and all these other items, when you think about the flow back-type operations, you think about production chokes and things of that nature, that's an area where we're seeing a lot of demand for our products. And I think earlier, Clay touched on rod lift and the rods to where we're seeing a lot of demand and attention put on that product offering.

And those are in addition to, as Jose just mentioned, production chokes, our dynamic oil recovery system for producing water. We have a lot of production and a growing portfolio of production equipment and processing and treatment equipment, centrifugal pumps, lack units, those sorts of things.

In the second quarter of 2016, National Oilwell Varco did post revenues of $1.7 billion, down 21% from the first quarter and down 56% from the second quarter 2015.  Revenues declined more than expected due mostly to offshore drilling con",2378,"Thank you, Loren. In the second quarter of 2016, National Oilwell Varco did post revenues of $1.7 billion, down 21% from the first quarter and down 56% from the second quarter 2015.  Revenues declined more than expected due mostly to offshore drilling contractors further delaying acceptance of newbuilds. The $26 crude oil prices we saw in February inflicted new agony on the oilfield, sending second quarter expenditures further downward and driving U.S. rig counts to record lows going back 7 decades.
NOV generated a loss of $0.30 per fully diluted share excluding severance facility closure costs and other items totaling $0.28 per fully diluted share in the second quarter.  EBITDA was $25 million for the quarter and operating loss was $153 million, excluding $117 million in other items from both. 
Operating cash flow was $128 million for the quarter. 
Our managers continued to aggressively downsize our business to match the available market, enabling NOV to manage the decremental EBITDA leverage ex other items of only 22% sequentially. 
Our workforce was reduced 10% and SG&A declined 16% during the quarter. Solid cost reduction results in the face of continuing pricing and absorption pain. 
EBITDA leverage ex other items has been 30% on the 70% revenue decline since the present cyclical downturn began. We continue to manage cost aggressively, but we're also maintaining our investment and promising new opportunities we see for our business when prosperity returns.  New technology and lower cost will lead to higher incrementals and margins for NOV in the eventual recovery, and I will speak to our efforts in both areas.
First, on cost. Our team is resolute in our commitment to improve efficiencies, reduce capacity and generate higher profitability. During the second quarter, we detailed additional cost reduction steps that total over $400 million in annualized savings that will flow in over the next few quarters. Plans developed and actions taken during the second quarter are on top of considerable work performed already having reduced our annual personnel cost well over $2 billion from peak levels.  Since the downturn began, we have closed or are closing over 250 facilities to reduce capacity in view of lower demand. We've also insourced work being previously outsourced to retain as many of our employees as possible and to help with absorption. Importantly, we do not believe we have sacrificed our ability to ramp up and respond to the eventual recovery. 
In a moment, Jose will take you through our detailed operating results by segment, but overall, we expect these specific actions to lead the modestly higher EBITDA in the third quarter on a modest decline in revenues, with more savings driving even higher EBITDA in the fourth quarter on roughly flattish sequential revenues.
Like others in our space, we believe we are seeing some isolated green shoots of activity, and we are encouraged that the North American rig counts have begun to increase. We have seen demand rise in recent weeks for certain products and services for North America: Rod guides for artificial lift, solids control jobs in West Texas, drilling motor rentals and other items.
On the other hand, our rig equipment business in many international markets continued to decline. At or near the bottom of the cycle, we see considerable cross currents, price pressure and shifting mix within our business. And frankly, we're not ready to call bottom yet. Our near-term outlook calls for modest revenue improvements in the Wellbore Technologies and Completion & Production Solutions segments, offset by another quarter of declines in our Rig Systems segment, which we expect to flatten thereafter.  We expect Rig Aftermarket third quarter to be down only slightly from the second quarter. 
Laser-focus on efficiency is part of our DNA, and cost savings measure evolve continuously with our market outlook. Jose, Loren and I are grateful to serve with experienced, competent business leaders who roll up their sleeves and do the tough, grim work of downsizing when this industry demands it. Better days lie ahead for NOV, and this team will help us navigate the present storm. When it passes, we will emerge lean and tough.  
The oil industry has been decimated by a generational down cycle, but record low levels of rig activity will inevitably lead to production declines, higher oil prices and higher activity. In the meantime, we plan for this to be a slow grind, and we still have a lot of swamp to traverse until we get to full recovery. 
When the market turns, NOV will have used the present downturn to improve its efficiency and, importantly, advance promising new initiatives for the industry we serve. This company has a diverse, robust portfolio of critical technologies the industry needs to drive better efficiencies in a low oil price world, a portfolio which we improve day by day as we continue to invest in our optionality to recovery. 
We believe recovery will drive higher demand for completion tools and hydraulic fracture stimulation and pressure pumping equipment where NOV occupies market-leading positions. Our outlook for technology, proven by the Shell Revolution, is robust. Shell technologies will migrate to new basins on new continents requiring new sophisticated Tier 1 land rigs, bits, downhole tools and new drill pipe designs.  Again, NOV occupies formidable positions in these markets.
Rising driving efficiencies enabled by NOV's technologies will increase well counts, vis-à-vis rig counts, with fewer days of drilling required to create each new wellbore. This will spur incremental demand for well count-driven products and services like the production chokes, sand separation and oil separation equipment markets where NOV also occupies leading positions.  And high rates of drilling per day will equal high rates of consumption of bits, tools, drill pipe and rigs that we make per day. 
We acquired Trican's completion tools business into our Completion & Production Solutions segment a couple of weeks ago, which brings promising new sliding sleeve and coiled tubing frac technologies to our mix. The business plan here is simple. We can manufacture completion tools in our existing under-absorbed facilities. We can expand sales through the 67 countries we already operate in with our existing infrastructure. We see opportunities to add other completions technologies to our mix through M&A and organic investment.  We expect application of hydraulic fracture stimulation to continue to grow in an upturn, and the acquisition enhances NOV's exposure to this trend. 
Drillers and service companies will bring more attention to efficient management of their assets in the upturn. So within the Wellbore Technologies segment, we are advancing our new track ID life-cycle management system which utilizes RFID technology to provide customers with a complete life history, including hours in service of drill pipe, BHA components and drilling risers.  Over 40,000 of these chips are in service globally. But the unpenetrated market is literally millions of components. The system tracks manufacturing and inspection history of each drill string component through our inventory management system. We can install the track ID, RFID chips at our drill pipe and downhole tools factories or in the field. And once installed, the system can automatically tally strings on every trip when used with instruments mounted in the rotary table. This makes for more efficient drilling operations in addition to more efficient life-cycle management of assets for our customers.
Operators will continue to push longer laterals and smooth profiles, tightly geosteered within the sweet spots of the shale's stratigraphy. In the first quarter, we acquired Tolteq, which brought us a mud pulse MWD system, which fits well with our BlackStar electromagnetic wave MWD system that we have offered for many years. We're now investing to add resistivity measurements to combine mud pulse and electromagnetic wave propagation capabilities into the same tool, thereby positioning NOV to offer unique, low-cost MWD tool that can be used together with our new low-cost rotary steerable system that we developed and introduced earlier this year.  Together, this combination will enable our directional drilling service customers to provide cost-effective geosteering on longer horizontal wells. 
We will be introducing a new rotating control device for managed pressure drilling in the second half of 2016, and we are investing in rental kits for the launch currently. We see more and more customers interested in rigs that are MPD ready to drill more efficiently and safely, and NOV is developing the kit to fulfill this need. 
In the first quarter, we acquired a unique remote unmanned gas analysis unit that provides high-speed ratio measurements up to C5. The GEOgas Analyzer product transmits critical geologic data in realtime, which enables operators to reduce wellsite personnel to lower cost. This fits well with the rig instrumentation business that we have been engaged in for decades. 
Today, we have 3 eVolve closed-loop automated drilling jobs underway, and we expect to spud 2 more jobs soon, with dozens more operators interested in this emerging technology.  Our eVolve closed-loop drilling automation service has proven the ability to reduce spud-to-TD times by 1/3 or more. Drilling programs in new basins experienced learning curve effects well by well, closely bottom-ated drilling accelerates this process.  Recovery will see new green drilling crews going back to work, and our new closely bottom-ated drilling service illuminates the drilling mechanics downhole and enables computers to control surface equipment on a microsecond basis to optimize drilling performance.  The service works with our new NOVOS rig operating system, which we introduced this quarter and won our first upgrade order. It also works with our proprietary IntelliServ Wired Drill Pipe to provide high-speed data link with downhole real-time drilling instrumentation. 
NOV is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this exciting technology, given that we have the world's largest installed base of drilling equipment, the most proven stable capable rig operating system, the Wired Drill Pipe and the experience of already having drilled hundreds of thousands of feet under our belt. Our rig of the future is here today and operating in the field with high efficiency.
Our installed base of drilling equipment also uniquely positions NOV to capitalize on big data in the oilfield. We have monitored hundreds of rigs in real time around the globe for over a decade through our eHawk system. This year, we launched our enhanced RIGSENTRY system, and we saw a significant increase in revenues for our subsea RIGSENTRY BOP monitoring service in the second quarter.  You may recall that we announced last quarter our success in predictive analytics. We successfully forecasted certain component failures weeks in advance based on our analysis of years of operating data.  Condition-based monitoring and big data will provide step change improvements in reliability and maintenance practices for sophisticated oilfield equipment, and NOV is positioned to lead the way. We are pursuing additional opportunities to host real-time remote monitoring centers in the Middle East, which will enable customers to reduce cost by permitting their experts to simultaneously monitor drilling progress across multiple rigs in real time. 
Our second quarter saw rig system orders decline further, and we expect orders to remain depressed for the foreseeable future. With no new offshore rig builds on the horizon, we're investing in new products to enhance efficiency and safety of existing rigs, products that will enable drilling contractors to differentiate their rigs in a crowded marketplace.  For instance, we expect to introduce a new ROV retrievable BOP pod this year for subsea stacks which would enable drilling contractors to replace pods on the seafloor, avoiding an expensive and time-consuming round-trip of the stack.  Drilling contractors can retrofit their stacks with this. 
On land, we are set to introduce a lower guide arm product, which will work in conjunction with our existing STV racking arm on land rigs to bring further mechanization and potentially automation of pipe tripping activities. 
We're developing ways to improve the efficiency of contractors' existing operations by, for example, exploring opportunities to reduce SPS cost and disruptions by using condition-based monitoring. We are working with the major classification agencies to develop a way to continuously certify drilling equipment in the field using condition-based monitoring. It is early days, but this new model could significantly reduce drilling contractor costs and interruptions.
We were pleased to announce a few weeks ago a cooperation agreement with GE within our Completion & Production Solutions segment to work jointly to improve cost and speed of execution on FPSO topsides projects. We are in detailed development work around integrating GE's market-leading power generation and compression capabilities with our own offering of turret mooring systems, swivel stacks, seawater piping systems, pumps, fluid processing, treatment, cranes and deck machinery. 
By reducing the number of complex interfaces between multiple vendors, NOV and GE are vastly simplifying the supply chain, jointly engineering and costing FPSO topside modules across varying sizes and capabilities, which we will offer to the marketplace by early 2017. Final designs can be refined quickly to fit specific customer field needs, reducing time to first oil, reducing complexity and reducing cost. 
NOV is unique in our considerable experience in successful execution of complex vessel construction and dozens of projects with every major shipyard around the world.  While deepwater development projects remain challenged from a returns perspective, the opportunity to pioneer new, efficient vessel construction model, together with initiatives being advanced by deepwater wellhead companies, together with subsea processing and boosting advancements, including our own Seabox technology, can materially improve the economics of developing the vast resources that have been discovered in the deepwater.  Our initial plans focus on smaller FPSO vessels, targeting marginal discoveries in mature basins. 
In short, NOV continues to pivot into promising technologies that will disproportionately benefit in the upturn even as we shrink our productive capacities and reduce cost. Hydraulic fracture stimulation, completion tools, remote operations, big data, deepwater advancements and horizontal drilling will all play key roles in supplying an energy-hungry world in the 21st century.  NOV is investing both organically and through M&A in each of these areas.  Brighter days lie ahead, and NOV will be there to lead the way. 
To our team at NOV, let me tell you, I know these are difficult times, and I appreciate your resolve and your professionalism. We are laying the groundwork for future prosperity of a great company that you and I are blessed to be a part of. You have my heartfelt thanks. Jose?"
31900,337764329,1016564,"National Oilwell Varco, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","NOV Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Clay. To quickly recap our consolidated results, revenues for the second quarter of 2016 were $1.7 billion, down 21% from the first quarter and in line with the 19% sequential decline in global rig counts. Revenues declined 23% in North America",3052,"Thanks, Clay. To quickly recap our consolidated results, revenues for the second quarter of 2016 were $1.7 billion, down 21% from the first quarter and in line with the 19% sequential decline in global rig counts. 
Revenues declined 23% in North America and 20% internationally as North American and international rig counts fell 35% and 7%, respectively. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $25 million, down $102 million from the first quarter of 2016. Sequential decremental EBITDA leverage was limited to 20% as efforts to resize the business and reduce our cost structure had their intended effect.
Operating loss, excluding other items, was $153 million. 
Looking at select other line items at the P&L. SG&A decreased by $56 million or 16% sequentially, and by $125 million or 30% year-over-year.
SG&A is now down $944 million on an annualized basis since the fourth quarter of 2014. 
Interest and other financial cost expense increased $5 million sequentially, mostly driven by incremental interest cost of approximately $2.5 million, attributable to a large capital lease we booked in late Q1 as well as other charges we do not expect to repeat next quarter.  Therefore, we anticipate interest expense to be between $27 million and $28 million for Q3. 
Other expense for the quarter increased $13 million sequentially, driven primarily by a greater loss on disposals and fixed assets. Our GAAP effective tax rate was 35.8% for the quarter and our rate, excluding other items, was 41.5%.
As a reminder, in the current environment, relatively small changes in the split between domestic and international results can have a disproportionate impact on our tax rates. 
In the third quarter, we anticipate the tax rate to be approximately 38%. 
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Working capital decreased $253 million from the first quarter of 2016. The decrease in working capital was primarily the result of a $247 million reduction in inventory levels, a $190 million reduction in customer financings, which is the decrease in cost in excess of billings netted against the decrease in billings in excess of costs and customer prepayments; and a $168 million reduction in accounts receivable.  The reductions in working capital were partially offset by decreases in accrued liabilities and accounts payable. 
While working capital decreased by over $250 million, we continue to carry more working capital than required to support the business at today's activity levels as converting inventory and receivables to cash remains challenging in the current environment.
Cash flow from operations totaled $128 million. After deducting $77 million in capital expenditures, $19 million in dividend payments, $15 million for acquisitions and $14 million in other items, we were essentially breakeven from a cash flow perspective for the quarter. Therefore, net debt remained mostly unchanged at approximately $1.6 billion.
During the quarter, we paid down our commercial paper by $100 million, leaving us with a balance of approximately $110 million. 
At June 30, 2016, we had a cash balance of $1.7 billion, $3.3 billion in total debt and our debt to capitalization was 16.8%.
Our Rig Systems segment generated revenues of $564 million during the second quarter of 2016, down 39% sequentially from $926 million, and down 71% from the $1.9 billion posted in the second quarter of 2015.
Sharp revenue declines were anticipated in the second quarter due to reduced backlogs and more projects approaching completion. However, the fall off in revenues was stronger than expected as customers who lack contracts or face pressures from operators to delay projects do what they can to defer deliveries.
Second quarter EBITDA for Rig Systems segment was $49 million. Efforts to resize the Rig Systems business and reduce the cost structure to mitigate the effects of the fall off in revenues had the intended result leading to decremental margins of only 24%. 
EBITDA margins fells 610 basis points to 8.7% of sales. Operating profit, excluding other items, was $30 million or 5.3% of sales.
For the second quarter, the split between offshore and land-related revenue was roughly 2/3 onshore and 1/3 land. New construction of offshore rigs accounted for $213 million in revenues or 12% of NOV's consolidated revenue.
New orders were down $31 million sequentially to $66 million in the second quarter, representing a 10-year low. 
Book-to-bill was 15% when new orders are compared to the 44 -- compared to the $441 million shipped out of backlog during the quarter. 
Q1 bookings primarily consisted of pressure control systems and other replacement equipment. 
For the third straight quarter, we received no new rig orders. 
Near-term demand for offshore remains almost nonexistent outside of replacement equipment. Discussions continue regarding midterm opportunities, which include one-off specialized 20K drillships and speculative mid-water semisubmersibles. However, we do not anticipate these orders materializing in 2016. 
The land markets appear much more promising as conversations with customers in North America, the Middle East and certain other international markets are increasing regarding equipment upgrades and new field opportunities. More and more operators are demanding modern, pad optimal Tier 1 AC rigs for potential upcoming projects, and contractors are seeking to upgrade and expand their capabilities in order to position themselves to capture incremental market opportunities.  While offshore opportunities will remain limited for the foreseeable future, we believe our land business will bottom in Q3 and begin to recover as we enter 2017.
We continue to work diligently on restructuring and resizing the business for anticipated future volumes. Our focus is on standardizing processes, optimizing structures and eliminating all redundancies in our global operations. This focus is designed to ensure the flexibility and agility needed to respond to recovery to significantly reduce cost and lead times. 
We anticipate revenue out of backlog will fall another $81 million in the third quarter to $360 million and anticipate an 18% to 20% fall-off in total segment revenue as we continue to work off our backlog on existing projects.  Decremental margins should be in the low 20% range as we expect normal decrementals to be partially offset by $15 million in cost savings, resulting for more efforts to cut cost and improve efficiencies as we restructure the business.
Our Rig Aftermarket segment generated $643 million in revenue during the second quarter of 2016, down 7% from $391 million in Q1 of 2016 and down 45% from $657 million in the second quarter of 2015.
EBITDA for this segment was $73 million or 20.1% of sales, down 11% sequentially and down 55% from the prior year. EBITDA decremental leverage was limited to 33% as cost controls were able to partially offset the decline in total revenue and an unfavorable mix shift as sales of spare parts continued to decline, while lower-margin service and repair work began to improve. 
Operating profit, excluding other items, was $67 million or 18.4% of sales. Spare parts sales continued to decline during the second quarter. However, bookings on spares began to solidify as we entered the third quarter. 
Customers have depleted existing inventories and are now getting to the point to where they must order new parts in order to support their exiting operations. 
Service and repair work rebounded during the second quarter as reactivations in the U.S. began to take place and the number of special periodic survey projects increased by 30%.  While the number of projects and associated revenue are increasing, strained customers continue to reduce the scope of projects and associated purchases as much as possible. Our condition-based monitoring services continue to gain traction and deliver value for our customers. 
Our RIGSENTRY service, which was introduced last quarter, identified potential failures in subsea BOPs before they occurred on 4 separate occasions, potentially saving our customers millions of dollars in unplanned downtime. 
Operational success is driving commercial success as our monitoring service revenues increased by over 50% during the quarter. We expect the pace of stacking offshore rigs will continue to accelerate, a difficult process which will ultimately help rebalance an oversupplied market.
In the current environment, Rig Aftermarket remains focused on providing industry-leading OEM parts, service and support that we have delivered over the years to take care of our customers' operating needs anywhere in the world.  We also continue to partner with our customers to develop innovative solutions for their most pressing needs. Today, our customers cannot afford extra downtime and need to be optimally positioned to capitalize or any new opportunities. 
As previously noted, we are seeing strong demand for our condition-based monitoring solutions, which allow contractors to predict failures and address problems before they occur. We're also seeing growing demand for other recently introduced offerings designed to address the stress our customers are under in the current environment.  Some of these offerings include: Infield certification services, for which we travel the rigs anywhere in the world to provide required certifications on active locations, resulting in substantially reduced downtime; rig performance services, in which we assess and review a customer's equipment to identify opportunities for improving operational efficiencies and minimizing downtime; and storage presentation and reactivation services, which lowers the cost of stacking equipment and enables faster reactivation of rigs, creating a competitive advantage for contractors and securing new contracts.  Notwithstanding the remaining challenges in offshore space, conversations with our customers leave us cautiously optimistic that we are at or near a bottom for our Rig Aftermarket business. 
While we anticipate a tepid near-term recovery driven by reactivation-related business in the U.S. and pent-up demand for offshore parts, service and repair work, we could still see revenue decline in the third quarter by a couple of hundred basis points.  We also anticipate realizing roughly $5 million in cost savings during the third quarter, which should more than offset decrementals associated with the revenue decline. 
Our Wellbore Technologies segment generated $511 million in revenue during the second quarter, down 19% sequentially from $631 million and down 47% sequentially from the $956 million in the second quarter of 2015.  Revenue mix by destination was 43% North America and 57% international. 
North America revenue declined 24% compared to the 35% decline in rig count, and the international revenue fell 13%, exceeding the decline in the international rig count as drilling activity in the Middle East registered its sharpest decline since this down cycle began. 
EBITDA was $1 million, down $42 million from the previous quarter and $156 million from the prior year. Sequential EBITDA decrementals were 35%. 
Segment reported an operating loss, excluding other items, of $96 million for the quarter. 
Throughout this cycle, we have been intensely focused on what we can control. We aggressively pursued the declining number of business opportunities that were available and continued to invest and drive innovation with our customers' interest at heart. Meaning, our focus is on improving oilfield efficiencies by reducing time and cost while improving well productivity.  We have also been relentlessly focused on resizing the organization, lowering our cost structure and optimizing our processes. Additionally, we have repositioned our people and operations to focus on the customers and basins around the world which we believe will be the most active throughout the next cycle.  These actions have taken place across all 4 of our operating segments and all 15 of our business units. But today, I'll highlight a few representative examples from within our Wellbore Technologies segment. 
In our Dynamic Drilling Solutions business, we have streamlined our operations, enhanced relations with old and new customers, and we continue to execute well with our legacy offerings. We recently displaced primary competitor across the fleet of one of the largest private rig contractors in North America with our data acquisition and information management systems. Additionally, we have continued investing and delivering innovative solutions to better serve the current needs of our customers, including: one, building out capabilities and executing revenue-generating contracts associated with real-time drilling data acquisition, visualization and optimization technologies; two, delivering substantial drilling improvements for customers with our eVolve optimization and closed-loop drilling automation services; three, introducing a new MWD tool and; four, introducing our GEOgas Analyzer, the first patented Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer specifically designed to provide real-time gas ratio analysis formation hydrocarbon identification. 
In our drilling and intervention business, in addition to launching a number of, literally, groundbreaking technologies, such as our rotary steerable tool and multiple innovative new drill bits and motors, we have substantially improved our product development and manufacturing capabilities.  Investments made in streamlining processes, leading-edge manufacturing equipment and repositioning operations have us well-positioned for the future. Changes implemented in our drill bit business have reduced the time it takes to take a new drill bit design from concept to finished product down to 6 weeks from over 16 weeks as recently as a year ago. These changes will also allow us to reach prior peak volumes with a 25% lower headcount and will allow us to maintain substantially lower inventory levels, reducing working capital and the potential for obsolescence.
In our field service-related operations, we have numerous examples of how we've repositioned our assets and our personnel to become much more intimate with our customers, focused on regions that will be most active in the future.  Our WellSite Services business has added to the capabilities in Argentina, which positions us well for the anticipated long-term ramp in activity within the Vaca Muerta field. Here recently, an operator utilized our WellSite Services business units, PETROS fluid system and solids control services in addition to a myriad of other NOV products and equipment to drill the deepest horizontal well yet in the Loma Campana block of the Vaca Muerta field. 
Circling back to our drilling and intervention business, we have reduced the average turnaround time for repairing bits and redressing motors in certain key basins around the world, including the Permian, from 3 weeks to 1 week by expanding our field service and repair facilities. This type of improvement significantly enhances our ability to take care of our customers and reduces inventory requirements. 
As you can tell, we haven't simply reacted to a sharply deteriorating market over the past 6 quarters. We have and will continue to play offense. 
In May, the U.S. land rig count was down 80% from the prior peak, and the past 2 quarters have had successive declines of approximately 20%. But it appears things have begun to stabilize, at least within the North American marketplace.  While there is cautious optimism about rigs getting back to work, the extent of declines have induced a level of trauma that likely delays a meaningful recovery until next year. 
For the third quarter, we expect our Wellbore Technologies segment's top line to increase a couple hundred basis points with mid-30% incremental EBITDA margins. We also expect to realize an additional $15 million benefit in Q3 due to our ongoing cost-cutting and operational efficiency initiatives. 
Our Completion & Production Solutions segment generated $538 million in revenue during the second quarter, down 4% sequentially from $558 million and down 38% from $873 million recognized in the second quarter of 2015. 
EBITDA was $57 million or 10.6% of sales, an increase of $9 million from the previous quarter, but down $91 million from the prior year.
Segment reported operating profit, excluding other items, of $5 million for the quarter. EBITDA improved on lower revenue due to cost-cutting initiatives, operational efficiencies and strong improvements in our subsea business as the operation benefited from high absorption in both of its manufacturing facilities and executed well on existing orders. 
We took in $269 million of new orders, down $59 million sequentially, and shipped $333 million in revenue from backlog, resulting in an 81% book-to-bill. This segment ended the quarter with a backlog balance of $947 million, $47 million lower than the prior period. 
While our Subsea business had strong levels of activity this quarter, and our plant should remain busy through at least year-end, the outlook for offshore-related projects remains challenging if the pricing pressures persist. These challenges extend into other offshore-oriented businesses, including our floating production operations where there is limited visibility into additional projects outside of our existing backlog for the remainder of the year.
We do, however, remain optimistic regarding mid-term prospects as we continue to have strong dialogue regarding FPSO opportunities with customers, and our new relationship with GE is contributing towards rapidly advancing our efforts to engineer and offer integrated topside solutions with standardized interfaces, which should materially improve the economics of deepwater production development. 
With the average price for WTI still hovering below $50 a barrel during the quarter, new order intake remains soft. While certain operators have slightly increased activity related to working down the inventory of drilled but uncompleted wells in the U.S., it has not yet translated into an increase in activity for our well intervention and stimulation business and other completion-related offerings.  The conversations regarding the plans to step up activity have increased. 
Additionally, we are seeing slight increases in production and infrastructure-related offerings, something we see as a good indication operators are preparing to get back to work as they cannot complete wells without having the production infrastructure in place. 
For the third quarter, we expect revenue to increase around 10% as we execute on certain large projects booked earlier in the year and see continued improvement in our production-related businesses. We should see 30% incrementals on the increase in revenue, and we expect to realize an additional $10 million benefit from the ongoing cost savings and efficiency enhancing initiatives which are occurring across the segment.
While market conditions have proved challenging through the first half of 2016, we have been able to generate cash flow from operations of approximately $0.75 billion, more than twice the amount produced during the first half of 2015. 
With the current cash balance of $1.7 billion and an undrawn capacity on our credit facility of $4.4 billion, we have total liquidity in excess of $6 billion. So from a financial standpoint, NOV is very well-positioned.
We hope our commentary this morning also provided you with insights into how well NOV is positioned from an operational and strategic standpoint. We are working hard to continue our long history of pioneering the critical technologies, which drive the oil and gas industry and the entire team at NOV remains laser-focused on reducing our cost structure and fine-tuning our ability to execute more efficiently regardless of the market environment. 
With that, Michelle, we'll open it up to questions."

I mean, you go back to our comments, and we're kind of hunkering down for a much lower level of building in the offshore. And certainly, that's been a big business for NOV over the preceding 12-plus years. But that's also nothing new. That narrative's been out there for 1.5 years, and frankly, we -- since the downturn began, had been kind of preparing for a near-term future that looks that way. And in view of that, we haven't jumped out there and done a great, big deal. What I would tell you is I think we can get more impact from our capital by continuing to knock out these sort of bolt-on transactions that are a little bit smaller. When we examine the portfolio of acquisitions that we've made over the preceding 20 years, we find consistently that the smaller transaction carry higher returns, lower risk. The specific examples that we've done here in the last 6 months have been really interesting technologies, have brought on really, really good people. The Trican team, for instance, that came in with the completion tools business is very experienced in that space and can help us grow and build the business. If you look back at our history, over the preceding 20 years, we've done a couple of large deals. But the business units that are -- that we have today, that are mostly market leaders around the globe, were really built kind of transaction by transaction, smaller acquisitions, bringing in really high-quality businesses and products and technology and management teams and kind of brick-by-brick. And to me, that's a more efficient, more workmanlike and more effective way to kind of build out global leading franchises. And so we see a terrific opportunity that's much larger. Certainly, we'll act on it, but realistically, I think we can do and will do a lot of good by continuing to deploy capital to the down cycle in a lot of smaller, interesting high-value acquisition targets."

And the potential for you all."
31900,337764329,1016564,"National Oilwell Varco, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","NOV Inc.","Executives","Yes, Sean, we -- a few years ago, when we sort of begun to invest in the FPSO opportunity, we did a little study, or actually had an industry expert do a study around the FPSO construction results for the industry. And they looked at I want to say a dozen",462,"Yes, Sean, we -- a few years ago, when we sort of begun to invest in the FPSO opportunity, we did a little study, or actually had an industry expert do a study around the FPSO construction results for the industry. And they looked at I want to say a dozen or more vessels. And on average, they're 35% or more over budget and more than a year late. And when you talk about delaying production that much, when you talk about those sorts of cost overruns, that's a huge inefficiency in the space. And so in terms of the savings that this may carry, I think realistically, bringing a more industrialized sort of supply chain, standardization in the design, kind of the partnership that we're forging with GE, I think it's going to materially move the needle. The size of each individual project for the 2 of us is going to vary a lot given the size and capabilities of the FPSO. But can easily range well over a couple of hundred million dollars per vessel for the larger FPSOs and beyond. And so that's exciting. But more specifically, in terms of the near-term opportunities, the brownfield focus is, the idea here is that we can develop families of small FPSOs that really target 1, 2, 4, 5 wells and make those smaller accumulations more economic. What's interesting is you look statistically across the deepwater basins, there's a lot more smaller fields than there are giant fields. And so it's a larger opportunity set. A way that a new technology, new sort of industrialized system that enables many, many, many more smaller fields to be produced, will enable GE and NOV and our shipyard partners to get up the learning curve on making these vessels, and so the things will sort of grow on itself. And so we're pretty excited about that. The other kind of element to the strategy I would also point out is that a lot of these larger fields, some of the inefficiencies around FPSO construction stem from the fact that the view of the field changes over time. And so the forecast on production profiles and the like changes over time. So part of our idea is that we can take one of our small FPSOs and put it on a larger field, and put that field under production for a year or 2. The owner of that field gets a lot smarter. It enables all parties to sort of optimize the design of the larger FPSO that might come in later and produce the field through many more wells. So on the whole, very excited about the partnership. I think GE is going to be a great partner and bring a lot to the mix."

There's a lot of stress and strain on the systems. We're continuing to progress all the contracts forward and are maintaining really good relationships with both the shipyards and the drilling contractors as well, but there's certainly tremendous amount of tension between the drilling contractors and the shipyards. And to some degree, we're helping facilitate those discussions.  And so while those pressures are in place, things tend to -- customers tend to want to put off acceptance of rigs, particularly for the rigs that don't have contracts in place. We still feel really good about the overall position. But as you know, we're very cautious about making sure that we don't get over tips of our skis in terms of the balance of sort of where we are in terms of progress payments and the amount that we have at risk. So try to keep the overall portfolio in a positive position, and that's how we're managing the business."

And honestly, in terms of cost cutting in 2015, that was kind of the first actions that we took, was to in-source more and try to keep our factories loaded. So kind of building out our supply chain once again will be challenging.  Labor will be a challenge certainly. Obviously, a very painful time for this industry and for this company to lose so many talented people. And attracting those folks back or folks that could come in and kind of grow with us is going to be a challenge. But look, this is nothing new in the oilfield. This is a cyclical business. And I think we've said in prior calls, one of the critical skills that you got to have is the ability to both reduce quickly in markets like this, but also the ability to grow quickly when it goes the other way.

It's not just impacting specifically completion, what you think of as traditionally completion-related items, it really impacts the entire well construction process. So even though we're drilling much more efficiently and the rate of penetration is much, much higher, on a per footage basis, the amount of tubing, bits, motors, et cetera, that you consume is remaining essentially the same on a per-foot basis. Additionally, when you're putting in the volumes of sand and proppant and all these other items, when you think about the flow back-type operations, you think about production chokes and things of that nature, that's an area where we're seeing a lot of demand for our products.

31900,379119222,1063053,"National Oilwell Varco, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2016",2016-10-27,"Earnings Calls","NOV Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Loren. During the third quarter, National Oilwell Varco began to see some improved demand in certain of our businesses, mostly North America, where the rig count grew 28% sequentially. For the first time since the downturn began, we posted top",752,"Thank you, Loren. During the third quarter, National Oilwell Varco began to see some improved demand in certain of our businesses, mostly North America, where the rig count grew 28% sequentially. For the first time since the downturn began, we posted top line growth in our Wellbore Technologies and Completions & Production Solutions segments. We also saw our cost reductions begin to outpace the steep declines in revenues we've seen through the past 7 quarters as 3 of our 4 segments posted higher margins due to aggressive cost reductions. 
Since the downturn began in late 2014, our revenues have declined 71%, reflecting the severe stress the oil and gas industry has been under. Our customers have slashed spending to the lowest levels possible, and the oil and gas industry  has delayed or canceled future projects totaling over 7 million barrels of oil per day. 2015 saw the lowest level of new reserve discoveries globally since 1947, only about 10% of the average annual discovery volumes through the past 50 years, according to Wood Mackenzie, and in 2016, the U.S. is forecast to see the lowest number of wells drilled since 1933. 
The 2.2 million barrel per day decline in non-OPEC production since 2014 has been fully offset by rising OPEC production, which achieved record levels this summer, along with Russian production, which achieved record levels in September. Overall, we believe OPEC to be producing at near maximum levels with little remaining excess capacity cushion, which has delayed the inevitable rebalancing of the world oil markets. Nevertheless, time is on our side as OPEC faces rising challenges to grow production further and as dwindling oilfield expenditures accelerate production declines through the rest of the world. 
Faced with extraordinary revenue declines and significant price discounting in all areas of our business, we've aggressively reduced costs and improved efficiency, enabling NOV to manage EBITDA decremental leverage to only 28% since the end of 2014. We're on track to obtain $3.1 billion in annual structural contractor and workforce cost reductions by year-end, thanks to the hard work of the experienced, capable management team that Jose, Loren and I are honored to serve with. This downturn has been extraordinarily painful on them and our entire organization. They have worked hard to insource wherever possible and to keep our plants loaded to maximize absorption. But we have nevertheless been forced to reduce our workforce 43% from peak levels and have closed or are closing 286 facilities globally. 
For the seventh quarter in a row, we have made significant reductions in our cost to match available demand while also continuing to invest in emerging opportunities we see, such as the pending acquisition of Fjords Processing from Akastor that we highlighted in our press release last night. Fjords Processing is a global leader in providing processing technology, systems and services to the upstream oil and gas industry. Fjords technology solutions include sulfate removal, oil and produced water treatment and hydrate inhibition that efficiently address critical needs for both onshore and offshore operators. 
The acquisition provides complementary technology for our Completions & Production Solutions segment. We expect that our combined operations will leverage the collective organizations' global infrastructure to reduce cost and achieve broader channels to market for the valves, pumps and composite tubulars that NOV already produces. Additionally, we believe the capabilities obtained through the transaction will leveraged by other business units who will benefit certain initiatives that are ongoing within NOV. We're excited about the capabilities at Fjords Processing, the  capabilities that it brings to our platform, and we're eager to welcome the talented employees of Fjords to NOV when the transaction closes, which we expect to occur before year-end. 
As we've highlighted on prior calls, NOV's strategy is centered on the most promising areas for future production: North American shale technologies; international markets, like the Middle East and Russia; and deepwater improvements. We've used this downturn, thus far, to position the company for the inevitable upturn, closing 4 small acquisitions in the third quarter, bringing our total to 9 year-to-date. 
We foresee significant opportunities in the upturn. Precise geosteering, directional drilling to produce longer horizontal laterals, closed-loop drilling automation and optimization, completion tools, hydraulic fracture stimulation techniques, new subsea production technologies and condition-based equipment monitoring will be the big winners in the next upcycle. NOV is at the forefront in each area, and our R&D investments and acquisitions are tightly focused on these promising trends. 
At this point, I'll ask Jose to review our financial results with you."

For the third quarter of 2016, National Oilwell Varco reported a net loss of $1.36 billion or $3.62 per fully diluted share on a U.S. GAAP basis. Excluding other items totaling $1.09 billion, net loss for the quarter was $128 million or $0.34 per share. Total company revenues for the third quarter of 2016 were $1.65 billion, down 5% from the second quarter of 2016 and down 50% from the third quarter of 2015. EBITDA was $68 million, an improvement of $43 million from the second quarter as our efforts to reduce costs and optimize our operations outpaced the decline in revenues. 
Our Completion & Production Solutions segment generated revenues of $543 million during the third quarter of 2016, up $5 million sequentially and down $255 million compared to the third quarter of 2015. Revenues increased on incremental sales of coil tubing and completion-related equipment, partially offset by fewer sales of primarily offshore-oriented production equipment, including offshore conductor pipe connectors and flexible pipe. EBITDA for the segment was $43 million or 7.9% of sales, a decrease of $14 million from the previous quarter and an $82 million decline from the prior year. The decrease in sequential EBITDA was primarily attributable to changes in revenue mix and certain inventory receivable charges. In the third quarter, we recognized $319 million in revenue from backlog, down $14 million from the second quarter of 2016. New orders were 184 million, down 85 million or 32% sequentially, resulting in a big book to bill equal to 58% and a quarter ending backlog of $812 million. 
Our Wellbore Technologies segment generated $526 million in revenue during the third quarter, up 3% sequentially from $511 million and down 37% from the third quarter of 2015. As mentioned in our press release, we're very encouraged by the performance of our short-cycle businesses within the segment as they posted sequential revenue growth of approximately 15% within the North American marketplace. EBITDA for the segment was $26 million, an increase of $25 million from the previous quarter and down $100 million from the prior year. Strong sequential improvement in EBITDA was a result of achieving targeted cost reductions and our successful implementation of numerous process and efficiency improvements -- improvement initiatives across the segment. 
Our Rig Aftermarket segment generated $322 million of revenue during the third quarter of '16, down 12% from $364 million in the second quarter of '16 and down 44% from the $570 million in the third quarter of 2015. Third quarter 2016 EBITDA for the segment was $81 million, up $8 million or 11% sequentially. EBITDA margins increased 510 basis points to 25.2% of sales. Spare parts sales, service and repairs all experienced revenue declines during the third quarter. However, sales of spares parts declined modestly than service and repairs from Q2 to Q3. The more favorable mix, along with our cost-reduction efforts, drove the increase in EBITDA on lower revenue. 
Our Rig Systems segment generated revenues of $470 million during the third quarter of 2016, down 17% sequentially from $564 million and down 69% from the $1.5 billion posted in the third quarter of 2015. The revenue decline was in line with expectations as we continue to work through our backlog and bring projects to completion. Third quarter EBITDA for the Rig Systems segment was $50 million, an increase of $1 million from the second quarter of 2016. EBITDA margins increased 190 basis points to 10.6% of sales. As we described in a fair amount of detail last quarter, we've been extremely focused on standardizing processes, optimizing structures and eliminating redundancies in our global operations. These structural changes reduced our costs and improved our efficiencies during  the quarter, enabling us to slightly increase EBITDA on a 17% decrease in revenue.
During the quarter, we recognized $363 million in revenue from backlog, down 18% from the $441 million in the prior quarter, and the segment continue to work down its backlog and slow the pace of delivery in the face of low order volumes and project delays. 
New orders improved by $119 million sequentially or 180% to $185 million in the third quarter. Book to bill was 51%, marking the highest level achieved since the third quarter of 2014. Included in the quarter's bookings were 2 land rigs, one of which is a highly specialized, harsh environment extended-reach rig destined for Alaska's North Slope. The 2 rig sales represent the first orders for new rigs since this time last year other bookings during the quarter included several top drives, pedestal cranes for FPSOs and pressure control equipment. Quarter-ending backlog was $2.76 billion. We're encouraged by the 2 rig orders and are optimistic regarding near-term growth opportunities in land markets. 
In North America, smaller contractors are looking to add more modern rigs to their fleet. And while most larger contractors don't expect a need for new land build orders until the second half of 2017, they're expressing strong interest in improving the pressure and torque capabilities of their existing AC rig fleets through upgraded 7,500 psi mud systems, new top drives and Iron Roughnecks. Customers in international land markets are also expressing interest in equipment upgrades as well as newbuild programs, particularly in the Middle East, Russia and Latin America. 
While the outlook for land markets around the world appear promising, in recognition of further deterioration in outlook for the offshore newbuild market, we took a $972 million noncash goodwill impairment charge associated with our offshore Rig Systems business unit during the third quarter of 2016. The diminished outlook is based on the accelerating restructuring process in the offshore market, which is reflected in early contract terminations by operators and in the stacking and scrapping rigs by drilling contractors. 
Looking at a few select items in the P&L. Interest and other financial costs decreased $5 million, primarily due to the reduction in commercial paper balances as well as certain charges that occurred in the second quarter that were not expected to repeat. Our effective tax rate, excluding other items, was 16.7%. As a reminder, in the current environment, relatively small changes in discrete items or the split between domestic and international results can have a disproportionate impact on our tax rates. In the fourth quarter, we expect the tax rate to be approximately 30%. 
Turning to the balance sheet. During the quarter, as I previously mentioned, we paid off our full commercial paper balance of $110 million, leaving us with $4.5 billion of availability on our facility. At September 30, 2016, our cash balance is $1.5 billion, total debt was $3.2 billion and our debt-to-capitalization ratio was 17.8%. 
In summary, I think this quarter's financial results reflect the tremendous job the team at NOV has done to resize the business, cut cost and optimize our operations. While certain elements of our business are showing signs of improvement, organization remains focused on fine-tuning our operations, developing and delivering valuable solutions for our customers and preparing to capitalize on a market recovery. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Clay."
31900,379119222,1063053,"National Oilwell Varco, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2016",2016-10-27,"Earnings Calls","NOV Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jose. I'll offer some additional color and guidance in each of our segments, beginning with our Completions & Production Solutions segment, which, as Jose mentioned, saw its book to bill fall to 58%. This was due to sharply lower orders for con",1790,"Thank you, Jose. I'll offer some additional color and guidance in each of our segments, beginning with our Completions & Production Solutions segment, which, as Jose mentioned, saw its book to bill fall to 58%. This was due to sharply lower orders for conductor pipe connections and subsea flexible pipe. This was partially offset by higher demand for fiberglass pipe, which is up 39% sequentially, and completion equipment, which was up 47% sequentially. International demand picked up nicely for fracture stimulation equipment and wireline units, but North American demand generally remains very low outside of some budgetary equipment quotes and some rising demand for aftermarket spares for well stimulation equipment. 
We noted in the press release our record 2 5/8 inch coiled tubing string manufactured in the third quarter, and we're seeing increasing interest in larger diameter coiled tubing units in strings that can traverse longer laterals in North America. We also believe that international markets are keenly focused on hydraulic fracture techniques pioneered in North America. So the stage is set for more widespread application of these enabling technologies overseas in 2017. 
Within our fiberglass pipe unit, we saw a rising demand for flowlines in North America, offsetting lower marine offshore pipe demand in Asia. Our fiberglass flowlines offer corrosion proof solutions for well tiebacks, and the rising level of drilling activity in West Texas as well as continued large sales in the Saudi Arabia and elsewhere in the Middle East lifted this group's backlog 14% sequentially. 
The new completion tools business we acquired in July is off to a great start with wins in Canada and Russia where we secured a pilot project for our bulldog [indiscernible] frac system to be run this quarter. And we believe our cemented sliding sleeve technology and burst fork [ph] system offer a superior solution for multistage horizontal wells. We're also advancing new ideas in completion technology that we look forward to sharing with you on future calls. 
Revenues for process and flow technologies improved slightly during the third quarter with further improvements expected in Q4 as we benefited -- and to benefit from higher demand for artificial lift products, process equipment and production chokes. As I mentioned earlier, Fjords Processing will contribute meaningfully to this business in 2017. 
Our offshore products within Completion & Production Solutions continue to face challenging market prospects due to the very low level of offshore projects globally, a situation that we believe may improve in the second half of 2017. While Brazil demand for a subsea flexible pipe has remained comparatively strong through the downturn, orders for Brazil dipped sharply during the third quarter. Elsewhere around the globe, our flexible subsea pipe business has seen several quarters of very low demand, driving intense pricing pressures and reducing average margins within our flexible pipe backlog. Nevertheless, we continue to win smaller tieback jobs, and we expect Brazil orders to rebound this quarter, leading to modest sequential revenue gains. We're also continuing to engineer unique floating production unit topside modules within our cooperative agreement with GE, including our unique small-field honeybee and mini bee FPSO designs, which we will complete by early 2017. 
During the quarter, we had a customer engage us in a page [ph] study to apply these through their field development plan in the Barents Sea. So overall, we see some green shoots emerging for many of our products, but others continuing to slide, a theme that we see across other segments as well. Looking into the fourth quarter, we expect Completion & Production Solutions segment to improve in the mid-single-digit percentage range as solid incrementals due to additional cost reductions.
Wellbore Technologies benefited from shorter-cycle products and services in the third quarter, which comprised about 80% of this segment's revenue, with drill pipe sales making up most of the balance. Rig reactivations in North America drove higher demand for our shorter-cycle businesses like downhole drilling tools, including new bits and new drilling motors that we've introduced through the downturn, as more than 90% of the U.S. fleet is drilling directionally and horizontally today. 
Our WellSite Services solids control business posted excellent sequential growth and margin improvements, too, on rising demand in West Texas, where we are beginning to claw back certain pricing concessions by charging more for items like freight and mobilization. While there are about 10 months of oil country tubular goods inventory on the ground in the U.S., half of this is for the offshore. So our pipe mill and processor customers got busier in the third quarter working on casing sizes that fit shale drilling, driving better results for our Tuboscope pipe inspection services. 
Drill pipe margins improved significantly in the third quarter, owing to a near-record mix of premium, large diameter pipe. However, backlog remained very low for this business, and we expect Q4 to face significant headwinds on a poor mix and much lower volumes. 2017 looks better for drill pipe as we start to see higher demand for 5.5-inch premium drill pipe to drill longer, larger diameter laterals. We will be enhancing our market-leading drill pipe technology with the launch of our new delta premium connection technology in the fourth quarter, which offers much faster makeup times, higher torques, much reduced risk of thread balling, improving drilling efficiencies and reducing total cost of ownership for our customers. And our new track ID product attaches RFID chips to the pipe, enabling contractors to automatically tally pipe on trips [ph] and track pipe in inventory, including the specific history of each joint of drill pipe. We're also seeing higher demand for our IntelliServ Wired Drill Pipe, owing to growing success in using its high-speed data link to downhole instruments to improve drilling efficiency and wellbore placement. While these advancements paint a bright future for drill pipe demand, given near-term mix and volume pressures in drill pipe, we remain cautious on our outlook for Q4. 
While demand is growing in North America and we continue to see rising interest in our close-loop drilling automation services, the segment is also seeing increasing price pressure in many of its traditional businesses in international markets. For the fourth quarter, we expect Wellbore Technologies revenues to decline slightly, and we expect EBITDA to remain roughly flat as we -- as continued cost reductions are offset by international pricing pressures and lower drill pipe sales and margins. 
Rig Aftermarket posted a 12% sequential decline in revenues in the third quarter, but saw improved EBITDA, up by about $8 million. Parts, service and repair all declined in the quarter, partly due to the evaporation of SPS work on offshore vessels. The cost reductions 
and rig reactivations in West Texas as well as a higher mix of spare parts helped to offset the impact from lower revenues. 
The group performed its first top drive rebuilds in our new facility in Russia during the third quarter. It is also aggressively pursuing condition-based monitoring opportunities. Our predictive failure monitoring system for subsea BOP stacks has notified our customers of potential regulator valve wear on 11 separate occasions, which enabled them to avoid unplanned lost time in drilling operations. We're now working on similar pilot products for top drives and mud pump failures, and we believe there is a tremendous market for condition-based predictive monitoring of equipment across the industry. Again, NOV is leading the way in bringing practical big data-driven enhancements to the operations of our customers. Nevertheless, the bulk of Rig Aftermarket's business is spare parts sales and service into our considerable installed base of equipment offshore. 
Given the financial stress the offshore drilling industry is enduring, Rig Aftermarket will continue to face near-term headwinds. We expect the fourth quarter to see mid-single-digit revenue declines for the Rig Aftermarket segment and margins to compress a few hundred basis points, owing to mix between spare parts sales and repair services. 
Our Rig Systems segment posted significantly higher sequential orders, owing to 2 land rigs booked in the quarter, but demand, nevertheless, remains very weak with book to bill at only 51%. Orders for equipment for the land market significantly outpaced offshore equipment demand in the quarter, reducing our offshore mix within our backlog to 81%. Revenue fell 17% sequentially, where the segment managed to hold EBITDA flat at $50 million or 10.6% of sales due primarily to lower execution cost on offshore rig construction in Asia and cost reductions elsewhere around the world. 
Major offshore newbuild rig construction project revenue totaled about $200 million in the quarter, about 12% of our consolidated revenue, and overall demand for offshore equipment remains very low despite a few conversations about potential new platform rigs. Offshore drilling contractors continued to only order replacement equipment for unplanned outages or worn-out equipment that can otherwise cannibalize from stack rigs or access [ph] elsewhere. 
Our outlook for demand for land rigs is much brighter as we have several inquiries for new land rigs for North America and numerous tenders being let for rigs in international markets for customers who have shrewdly observed that the upgraded rig fleet in North America had much to do with the shale revolution of the prior peak. we believe 2017 will see meaningful resumption in demand for land equipment. As Jose mentioned, we are quoting upgrade packages for 7,500 psi mud systems, higher torque and new NOVOS control systems required to drill longer laterals. In fact, top drive sales in the land market picked up in the quarter due to the need for higher torque to execute longer laterals. 
The financial stress offshore will continue to weigh heavily on the results for this segment. We expect the fourth quarter revenues to decline in the mid-single-digit percentage range, but margins to fall a few hundred basis points as we face a mix shift to lower margin land opportunities, lower-priced and lower-margin offshore orders in our backlog and increasingly challenging absorption loads. 
So to summarize, at or near the bottom of an extraordinary down cycle, we see lots of cross-currents. After 2 years of brutal declines, growth in North America land and Middle East have been a welcome relief, and we're optimistic about activity in Russia. On the other hand, our offshore customers remain very challenged, and many international markets continue to slow, exacerbating pricing pressures. Nonetheless, NOV's diverse portfolio of critical technologies and strong liquidity make it well positioned to benefit from a recovery in all corners of the oilfield. 
Before we open the call to Q&A, let me take a moment to thank our many hard-working employees of our organization. You had done a tremendous job fighting the fight, navigating exceptionally tough times and positioning the company for recovery. Thank you.

But on the other hand, I presume there's still a lot that near term that this comp is down, given that you have a substantial backlog that still needs to ship before truly optimize your production infrastructure. So could you talk a little bit about some of these 2 cross currents and how you expect them to play out over the next couple of quarters as well as how much of the manufacturing infrastructure that's typically used for offshore that can get filled with the components for onshore activity?"

I know you are aware of this, and other listeners may not be, the same infrastructure makes top drives, Iron Roughneck, pumps, old man of equipment for both land and offshore. What we've been doing is since demand has been down in both areas, we've continued to shrink our capacity and reduce our infrastructure, scaling down a new of the market demand. But simultaneously, we are seeing a shift in our mix away from offshore, which really dominated our order book for the last decade plus 2 land in 2017 in 2018. And as we mentioned in our remarks, I think calls for some optimism there. Conversations are beginning. Tenders for land equipment are starting to be wet. And it's very early days, but that's certainly a good and welcome relief, and that showed up in our orders in the third quarter, which grew off of some pretty low levels of orders in the preceding quarters. So what we're facing is the shift towards the land business for kind of the next up cycle. Right now, it's very, very cost competitive. We're having to get very aggressive, and so the margin impact certainly not positive early on in the cycle. But as this blossoms and as we get back into full recovery, we're much more optimistic. So right now, the business is executing kind of a shift in that direction. What I would, in particular, highlight to you. We have a terrific management team that runs our rig business. They've been responding aggressively in realtime to the lower levels of demand. In the third quarter, our business was down 82% from where we were 2 years ago. So considering that the business posted double-digit EBITDA margins on 18% of revenue we saw 2 years ago is an amazing accomplishment. What I'd like to offer more quantitative guidance around margins and rig, but frankly, at this point in this cycle and given kind of the shift is under way, we're not able to really quantify the margins. But I do have an abundance of confidence in the ability of our team to continue to reduce cost in the face of a more challenging market."

How do you think about that? Do you have a very large position in North American shale? And what rig count do you think of as the rig count really to be able to take out the old the revenue and margin level?"

So not really prepared to jump out there with a number on the rig count. I think the important trend that underlies all of this is that the shale revolution really prompted the U.S. to be the major source of incremental growth for oil between 2011 and 2014 globally, and that was really enabled by better rig technology. You've got the vast majority of oil produced in other regions around the globe. We have a lot of customers overseas looking at the impact of better rig technology in the U.S. And so as I look to sort of the next upturn, I think overseas markets are going to begin to adopt these AC rigs, higher tier rigs. We're getting a lot of inbound interest on that. What's interesting about NOV is we're really prepared to sort of offer next-generation of rigs. We have a great success using Wired Drill Pipe closely automotive drilling to let software machine-learning technologies drive those rigs to even higher levels of efficiency, and that's what has sparked a lot of interest and a lot of intrigue amongst our customer base not just in North America, but elsewhere around the world. So I think a lot of opportunity there. I think a lot of opportunity even upgrading the 800 or 900 AC rigs across North American market for -- to be more pad capable. As we mentioned in the prepared remarks, 7,500 psi mud systems hired torque packages. That's anywhere from $1 million to $4 million worth of opportunity for NOV per rig, so a meaningful opportunity to upgrade."

As I mentioned, excellent mix of premium pipe, but we expect Q4 -- running in Q4 with a kind of depleted backlog for drill pipe. And so that's going to offset top line growth. However, I also highlighted in the opening comments a lot of cost for optimism around 2017 in terms of new technologies, larger pipe that we see demand for, wired Drill Pipe that we see demand for and enhancement of drill pipe with our FID chips. It's just a lot of technology going on in that space so -- but that's still at least few quarters out."

And so looking forward to that happy day of being faced with those challenges, I've said it many times before and I'll repeat it, the 2 scale sets you have to master in Wilford Services are rapid aggressive cost reductions when the market dictates and then rapid profitable growth when the market dictates. And so this is a very highly cyclical business that swings wildly, and I've seen our team do it before, responding to the upturns. And so again, I have an abundance of confidence in the talented management team that I get to work with here in terms of responding to that day. With regards to your inventory comment, what I would tell you is that frankly, our inventory is -- we still have too much. And so we have ample inventory, I think, to respond to our customers needs, and so that's not really the issue. What the upturn will look like, the scarcest resource in every upturn pretty quickly becomes people, and so -- but I think we have a great team here at NOV. It's been very tough to reduce the size of our workforce, but we're getting down to our kind of our core team and looking forward to responding to the upturn. I would add to those that responding to an upturn is not unique at NOV. Our customers face that as well. So a lot of our products and strategies really are around kind of bring technology to help them navigate the challenges as well. So close-up drilling, for instance, as I mentioned a moment ago, we believe will help drilling contractors when they're called upon to put much larger portion or fleets back to our drilling. So that's where the technology can drive a lot of efficiency and learning curve effects that would otherwise take much longer to accomplish."

Prior up turns, if the prior up turns are a guide, that begins to change and we -- and as demand kind of starts to accelerate, in this industry, it can really rocket quickly. Beginning to use pricing to sort of manage demand versus available capacity. And so pricing leverage can be pretty stout in the industry. I would add to that. It's psychologically. You have a workforce and an organization that's gone through a significant downsizing like we have. There's a hesitancy to add people, and so we all naturally kind of do more with less on the upturn. And so that drives just a high level of efficiency that gets put into the organization through a downturn. So when you get the upturn, you really benefit from that. So again, really looking forward to that, but very, very confident we'll be able to navigate our way upwards."

And when you think about what our shale technologies, it starts with a Tier 1 land rig, high-torque capability, high-torque top drive, high level of automation and mechanization around pipe handling. It includes premium drill pipe to table to handle higher torques and to drill out laterals that extend 10,000 to 15,000 feet or more. I think which bits downhole drilling motors, road steer holes we'd invested in, NWD to geosteer those wells into the best parts of the shale, to drill smooth wellbores where you don't have later faction funding problems and areas of the wellbore to hold up solids. It includes sliding sleeve completion technologies that we think will grow in application in the next upturn. Hydraulic fracture stimulation technologies, coiled tubing for plug and perf, flow iron mixtures, blenders. Okay, we make all of that and we're a market leader across that. So I think we're very well positioned for an upturn that has a lot more sort of shale technology to it. And we've -- our M&A strategy and our internal development of new products and technologies that you asked about really are targeting sort of that  view of the world, and that's in addition to the FPSO in offshore steps that we've taken because we also see significant improvements in that arena.

Additionally, while we believe that drill contractors have really taken their spare parts inventories down to levels which are really beyond their comfort zones, we continue to be very surprised by how resilient they are and how effective they are in terms of being able to cut back their need for expenditures. So I think for us to really be able to call bottom, the process of rebalancing the market, particularly as it relates to just stopping the decline in the overall offshore rig count, needs to come to an end. But, hopefully, we're not too terribly up far away from that. And obviously, our rate of decline in that business has been slowing. So good long-term outlook.

As it relates to specific numbers on related to that operation, those numbers are available in AC stores public filings. But basically, if you look at the trailing 12 basis, they did that $255 million in revenue, and you can look up some of the other details if you'd like but you can follow up after the call."

What happened in Q3 was a downturn mostly in offshore-related products coming out of Completions & Production Solutions, and business is broad brushstrokes. It's about 44%, 45% offshore revenue-related, but the backlog is much higher mix of offshore products because the offshore products tend to remain in backlog much longer than quicker turn land things. So the backlog and the order rate really is much more, frankly, offshore focused than the revenue stream for completion and production solutions, if that makes sense. And while we do expect that to pickup, offshore demand to pickup in Q4 based on some specific things, we do view the offshore market as continuing to face some pretty challenging levels of demand as we enter 2017. So it's very difficult to say at this point."

Now let me turn the call over to Clay."
31900,379119222,1063363,"National Oilwell Varco, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2016",2016-10-27,"Earnings Calls","NOV Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Loren. During the third quarter, National Oilwell Varco began to see some improved demand in certain of our businesses, mostly North America, where the rig count grew 28% sequentially.

During the third quarter, National Oilwell Varco began to see some improved demand in certain of our businesses, mostly North America, where the rig count grew 28% sequentially. For the first time since the downturn began, we posted top line growth in our Wellbore Technologies and Completions & Production Solutions segments. We also saw our cost reductions begin to outpace the steep declines in revenues we've seen through the past 7 quarters as 3 of our 4 segments posted higher margins due to aggressive cost reductions. 
Since the downturn began in late 2014, our revenues have declined 71%, reflecting the severe stress the oil and gas industry has been under. Our customers have slashed spending to the lowest levels possible, and the oil and gas industry  has delayed or canceled future projects totaling over 7 million barrels of oil per day. 2015 saw the lowest level of new reserve discoveries globally since 1947, only about 10% of the average annual discovery volumes through the past 50 years, according to Wood Mackenzie, and in 2016, the U.S. is forecast to see the lowest number of wells drilled since 1933. 
The 2.2 million barrel per day decline in non-OPEC production since 2014 has been fully offset by rising OPEC production, which achieved record levels this summer, along with Russian production, which achieved record levels in September. Overall, we believe OPEC to be producing at near maximum levels with little remaining excess capacity cushion, which has delayed the inevitable rebalancing of the world oil markets. Nevertheless, time is on our side as OPEC faces rising challenges to grow production further and as dwindling oilfield expenditures accelerate production declines through the rest of the world. 
Faced with extraordinary revenue declines and significant price discounting in all areas of our business, we've aggressively reduced costs and improved efficiency, enabling NOV to manage EBITDA decremental leverage to only 28% since the end of 2014. We're on track to obtain $3.1 billion in annual structural contractor and workforce cost reductions by year-end, thanks to the hard work of the experienced, capable management team that Jose, Loren and I are honored to serve with. This downturn has been extraordinarily painful on them and our entire organization. They have worked hard to insource wherever possible and to keep our plants loaded to maximize absorption. But we have nevertheless been forced to reduce our workforce 43% from peak levels and have closed or are closing 286 facilities globally. 
For the seventh quarter in a row, we have made significant reductions in our cost to match available demand while also continuing to invest in emerging opportunities we see, such as the pending acquisition of Fjords Processing from Akastor that we highlighted in our press release last night. Fjords Processing is a global leader in providing processing technology, systems and services to the upstream oil and gas industry. Fjords technology solutions include sulfate removal, oil and produced water treatment and hydrate inhibition that efficiently address critical needs for both onshore and offshore operators. 
The acquisition provides complementary technology for our Completions & Production Solutions segment. We expect that our combined operations will leverage the collective organizations' global infrastructure to reduce cost and achieve broader channels to market for the valves, pumps and composite tubulars that NOV already produces. Additionally, we believe the capabilities obtained through the transaction will leveraged by other business units who will benefit certain initiatives that are ongoing within NOV. We're excited about the capabilities at Fjords Processing, the  capabilities that it brings to our platform, and we're eager to welcome the talented employees of Fjords to NOV when the transaction closes, which we expect to occur before year-end. 
As we've highlighted on prior calls, NOV's strategy is centered on the most promising areas for future production: North American shale technologies; international markets, like the Middle East and Russia; and deepwater improvements. We've used this downturn, thus far, to position the company for the inevitable upturn, closing 4 small acquisitions in the third quarter, bringing our total to 9 year-to-date. 
We foresee significant opportunities in the upturn. Precise geosteering, directional drilling to produce longer horizontal laterals, closed-loop drilling automation and optimization, completion tools, hydraulic fracture stimulation techniques, new subsea production technologies and condition-based equipment monitoring will be the big winners in the next upcycle. NOV is at the forefront in each area, and our R&D investments and acquisitions are tightly focused on these promising trends. 
At this point, I'll ask Jose to review our financial results with you."

For the third quarter of 2016, National Oilwell Varco reported a net loss of $1.36 billion or $3.62 per fully diluted share on a U.S. GAAP basis. Excluding other items totaling $1.09 billion, net loss for the quarter was $128 million or $0.34 per share. Total company revenues for the third quarter of 2016 were $1.65 billion, down 5% from the second quarter of 2016 and down 50% from the third quarter of 2015. EBITDA was $68 million, an improvement of $43 million from the second quarter as our efforts to reduce costs and optimize our operations outpaced the decline in revenues. 
Our Completion & Production Solutions segment generated revenues of $543 million during the third quarter of 2016, up $5 million sequentially and down $255 million compared to the third quarter of 2015. Revenues increased on incremental sales of coil tubing and completion-related equipment, partially offset by fewer sales of primarily offshore-oriented production equipment, including offshore conductor pipe connectors and flexible pipe. EBITDA for the segment was $43 million or 7.9% of sales, a decrease of $14 million from the previous quarter and an $82 million decline from the prior year. The decrease in sequential EBITDA was primarily attributable to changes in revenue mix and certain inventory receivable charges. In the third quarter, we recognized $319 million in revenue from backlog, down $14 million from the second quarter of 2016. New orders were 184 million, down 85 million or 32% sequentially, resulting in a big book to bill equal to 58% and a quarter ending backlog of $812 million. 
Our Wellbore Technologies segment generated $526 million in revenue during the third quarter, up 3% sequentially from $511 million and down 37% from the third quarter of 2015. As mentioned in our press release, we're very encouraged by the performance of our short-cycle businesses within the segment as they posted sequential revenue growth of approximately 15% within the North American marketplace. EBITDA for the segment was $26 million, an increase of $25 million from the previous quarter and down $100 million from the prior year. Strong sequential improvement in EBITDA was a result of achieving targeted cost reductions and our successful implementation of numerous process and efficiency improvements -- improvement initiatives across the segment. 
Our Rig Aftermarket segment generated $322 million of revenue during the third quarter of '16, down 12% from $364 million in the second quarter of '16 and down 44% from the $570 million in the third quarter of 2015. Third quarter 2016 EBITDA for the segment was $81 million, up $8 million or 11% sequentially. EBITDA margins increased 510 basis points to 25.2% of sales. Spare parts sales, service and repairs all experienced revenue declines during the third quarter. However, sales of spares parts declined modestly than service and repairs from Q2 to Q3. The more favorable mix, along with our cost-reduction efforts, drove the increase in EBITDA on lower revenue. 
Our Rig Systems segment generated revenues of $470 million during the third quarter of 2016, down 17% sequentially from $564 million and down 69% from the $1.5 billion posted in the third quarter of 2015. The revenue decline was in line with expectations as we continue to work through our backlog and bring projects to completion. Third quarter EBITDA for the Rig Systems segment was $50 million, an increase of $1 million from the second quarter of 2016. EBITDA margins increased 190 basis points to 10.6% of sales. As we described in a fair amount of detail last quarter, we've been extremely focused on standardizing processes, optimizing structures and eliminating redundancies in our global operations. These structural changes reduced our costs and improved our efficiencies during  the quarter, enabling us to slightly increase EBITDA on a 17% decrease in revenue.
During the quarter, we recognized $363 million in revenue from backlog, down 18% from the $441 million in the prior quarter, and the segment continue to work down its backlog and slow the pace of delivery in the face of low order volumes and project delays. 
New orders improved by $119 million sequentially or 180% to $185 million in the third quarter. Book to bill was 51%, marking the highest level achieved since the third quarter of 2014. Included in the quarter's bookings were 2 land rigs, one of which is a highly specialized, harsh environment extended-reach rig destined for Alaska's North Slope. The 2 rig sales represent the first orders for new rigs since this time last year other bookings during the quarter included several top drives, pedestal cranes for FPSOs and pressure control equipment. Quarter-ending backlog was $2.76 billion. We're encouraged by the 2 rig orders and are optimistic regarding near-term growth opportunities in land markets. 
In North America, smaller contractors are looking to add more modern rigs to their fleet. And while most larger contractors don't expect a need for new land build orders until the second half of 2017, they're expressing strong interest in improving the pressure and torque capabilities of their existing AC rig fleets through upgraded 7,500 psi mud systems, new top drives and Iron Roughnecks. Customers in international land markets are also expressing interest in equipment upgrades as well as newbuild programs, particularly in the Middle East, Russia and Latin America. 
While the outlook for land markets around the world appear promising, in recognition of further deterioration in outlook for the offshore newbuild market, we took a $972 million noncash goodwill impairment charge associated with our offshore Rig Systems business unit during the third quarter of 2016. The diminished outlook is based on the accelerating restructuring process in the offshore market, which is reflected in early contract terminations by operators and in the stacking and scrapping rigs by drilling contractors. 
Looking at a few select items in the P&L. Interest and other financial costs decreased $5 million, primarily due to the reduction in commercial paper balances as well as certain charges that occurred in the second quarter that were not expected to repeat. Our effective tax rate, excluding other items, was 16.7%. As a reminder, in the current environment, relatively small changes in discrete items or the split between domestic and international results can have a disproportionate impact on our tax rates. In the fourth quarter, we expect the tax rate to be approximately 30%. 
Turning to the balance sheet. During the quarter, as I previously mentioned, we paid off our full commercial paper balance of $110 million, leaving us with $4.5 billion of availability on our facility. At September 30, 2016, our cash balance is $1.5 billion, total debt was $3.2 billion and our debt-to-capitalization ratio was 17.8%. 
In summary, I think this quarter's financial results reflect the tremendous job the team at NOV has done to resize the business, cut cost and optimize our operations. While certain elements of our business are showing signs of improvement, organization remains focused on fine-tuning our operations, developing and delivering valuable solutions for our customers and preparing to capitalize on a market recovery. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Clay."

I'll offer some additional color and guidance in each of our segments, beginning with our Completions & Production Solutions segment, which, as Jose mentioned, saw its book to bill fall to 58%.

I'll offer some additional color and guidance in each of our segments, beginning with our Completions & Production Solutions segment, which, as Jose mentioned, saw its book to bill fall to 58%. This was due to sharply lower orders for conductor pipe connections and subsea flexible pipe. This was partially offset by higher demand for fiberglass pipe, which is up 39% sequentially, and completion equipment, which was up 47% sequentially. International demand picked up nicely for fracture stimulation equipment and wireline units, but North American demand generally remains very low outside of some budgetary equipment quotes and some rising demand for aftermarket spares for well stimulation equipment. 
We noted in the press release our record 2 5/8 inch coiled tubing string manufactured in the third quarter, and we're seeing increasing interest in larger diameter coiled tubing units in strings that can traverse longer laterals in North America. We also believe that international markets are keenly focused on hydraulic fracture techniques pioneered in North America. So the stage is set for more widespread application of these enabling technologies overseas in 2017. 
Within our fiberglass pipe unit, we saw a rising demand for flowlines in North America, offsetting lower marine offshore pipe demand in Asia. Our fiberglass flowlines offer corrosion proof solutions for well tiebacks, and the rising level of drilling activity in West Texas as well as continued large sales in the Saudi Arabia and elsewhere in the Middle East lifted this group's backlog 14% sequentially. 
The new completion tools business we acquired in July is off to a great start with wins in Canada and Russia where we secured a pilot project for our bulldog annulus frac system to be run this quarter. And we believe our cemented sliding sleeve technology and burst port system offer a superior solution for multistage horizontal wells. We're also advancing new ideas in completion technology that we look forward to sharing with you on future calls. 
Revenues for process and flow technologies improved slightly during the third quarter with further improvements expected in Q4 as we benefited -- and to benefit from higher demand for artificial lift products, process equipment and production chokes. As I mentioned earlier, Fjords Processing will contribute meaningfully to this business in 2017. 
Our offshore products within Completion & Production Solutions continue to face challenging market prospects due to the very low level of offshore projects globally, a situation that we believe may improve in the second half of 2017. While Brazil demand for a subsea flexible pipe has remained comparatively strong through the downturn, orders for Brazil dipped sharply during the third quarter. Elsewhere around the globe, our flexible subsea pipe business has seen several quarters of very low demand, driving intense pricing pressures and reducing average margins within our flexible pipe backlog. Nevertheless, we continue to win smaller tieback jobs, and we expect Brazil orders to rebound this quarter, leading to modest sequential revenue gains. We're also continuing to engineer unique floating production unit topside modules within our cooperative agreement with GE, including our unique small-field HoneyBee and MiniBee FPSO designs, which we will complete by early 2017. 
During the quarter, we had a customer engage us in a paid study to apply these through their field development plan in the Barents Sea. So overall, we see some green shoots emerging for many of our products, but others continuing to slide, a theme that we see across other segments as well. Looking into the fourth quarter, we expect Completion & Production Solutions segment to improve in the mid-single-digit percentage range as solid incrementals due to additional cost reductions.
Wellbore Technologies benefited from shorter-cycle products and services in the third quarter, which comprised about 80% of this segment's revenue, with drill pipe sales making up most of the balance. Rig reactivations in North America drove higher demand for our shorter-cycle businesses like downhole drilling tools, including new bits and new drilling motors that we've introduced through the downturn, as more than 90% of the U.S. fleet is drilling directionally and horizontally today. 
Our WellSite Services solids control business posted excellent sequential growth and margin improvements, too, on rising demand in West Texas, where we are beginning to claw back certain pricing concessions by charging more for items like freight and mobilization. While there are about 10 months of oil country tubular goods inventory on the ground in the U.S., half of this is for the offshore. So our pipe mill and processor customers got busier in the third quarter working on casing sizes that fit shale drilling, driving better results for our Tuboscope pipe inspection services. 
Drill pipe margins improved significantly in the third quarter, owing to a near-record mix of premium, large diameter pipe. However, backlog remained very low for this business, and we expect Q4 to face significant headwinds on a poor mix and much lower volumes. 2017 looks better for drill pipe as we start to see higher demand for 5.5 inch premium drill pipe to drill longer, larger diameter laterals. We will be enhancing our market-leading drill pipe technology with the launch of our new delta premium connection technology in the fourth quarter, which offers much faster make-up times, higher torques, much reduced risk of thread galling, improving drilling efficiencies and reducing total cost of ownership for our customers. And our new track ID product attaches RFID chips to the pipe, enabling contractors to automatically tally pipe on trips and track pipe in inventory, including the specific history of each joint of drill pipe. We're also seeing higher demand for our IntelliServ wired drill pipe, owing to growing success in using its high-speed data link to downhole instruments to improve drilling efficiency and wellbore placement. While these advancements paint a bright future for drill pipe demand, given near-term mix and volume pressures in drill pipe, we remain cautious on our outlook for Q4. 
While demand is growing in North America and we continue to see rising interest in our close-loop drilling automation services, the segment is also seeing increasing price pressure in many of its traditional businesses in international markets. For the fourth quarter, we expect Wellbore Technologies revenues to decline slightly, and we expect EBITDA to remain roughly flat as we -- as continued cost reductions are offset by international pricing pressures and lower drill pipe sales and margins. 
Rig Aftermarket posted a 12% sequential decline in revenues in the third quarter, but saw improved EBITDA, up by about $8 million. Parts, service and repair all declined in the quarter, partly due to the evaporation of SPS work on offshore vessels. The cost reductions 
and rig reactivations in West Texas as well as a higher mix of spare parts helped to offset the impact from lower revenues. 
The group performed its first top drive rebuilds in our new facility in Russia during the third quarter. It is also aggressively pursuing condition-based monitoring opportunities. Our predictive failure monitoring system for subsea BOP stacks has notified our customers of potential regulator valve wear on 11 separate occasions, which enabled them to avoid unplanned lost time in drilling operations. We're now working on similar pilot products for top drives and mud pump failures, and we believe there is a tremendous market for condition-based predictive monitoring of equipment across the industry. Again, NOV is leading the way in bringing practical big data-driven enhancements to the operations of our customers. Nevertheless, the bulk of Rig Aftermarket's business is spare parts sales and service into our considerable installed base of equipment offshore. 
Given the financial stress the offshore drilling industry is enduring, Rig Aftermarket will continue to face near-term headwinds. We expect the fourth quarter to see mid-single-digit revenue declines for the Rig Aftermarket segment and margins to compress a few hundred basis points, owing to mix between spare parts sales and repair services. 
Our Rig Systems segment posted significantly higher sequential orders, owing to 2 land rigs booked in the quarter, but demand, nevertheless, remains very weak with book to bill at only 51%. Orders for equipment for the land market significantly outpaced offshore equipment demand in the quarter, reducing our offshore mix within our backlog to 81%. Revenue fell 17% sequentially, where the segment managed to hold EBITDA flat at $50 million or 10.6% of sales due primarily to lower execution cost on offshore rig construction in Asia and cost reductions elsewhere around the world. 
Major offshore newbuild rig construction project revenue totaled about $200 million in the quarter, about 12% of our consolidated revenue, and overall demand for offshore equipment remains very low despite a few conversations about potential new platform rigs. Offshore drilling contractors continued to only order replacement equipment for unplanned outages or worn-out equipment they can't otherwise cannibalize from stacked rigs or access elsewhere. 
Our outlook for demand for land rigs is much brighter as we have several inquiries for new land rigs for North America and numerous tenders being let for rigs in international markets for customers who have shrewdly observed that the upgraded rig fleet in North America had much to do with the shale revolution of the prior peak. We we believe 2017 will see meaningful resumption in demand for land equipment. As Jose mentioned, we are quoting upgrade packages for 7,500 psi mud systems, higher torque and new NOVOS control systems required to drill longer laterals. In fact, top drive sales in the land market picked up in the quarter due to the need for higher torque to execute longer laterals. 
The financial stress offshore will continue to weigh heavily on the results for this segment. We expect the fourth quarter revenues to decline in the mid-single-digit percentage range, but margins to fall a few hundred basis points as we face a mix shift to lower margin land opportunities, lower-priced and lower-margin offshore orders in our backlog and increasingly challenging absorption loads. 
So to summarize, at or near the bottom of an extraordinary down cycle, we see lots of cross-currents. After 2 years of brutal declines, growth in North America land and Middle East have been a welcome relief, and we're optimistic about activity in Russia. On the other hand, our offshore customers remain very challenged, and many international markets continue to slow, exacerbating pricing pressures. Nonetheless, NOV's diverse portfolio of critical technologies and strong liquidity make it well positioned to benefit from a recovery in all corners of the oilfield. 
Before we open the call to Q&A, let me take a moment to thank our many hard-working employees of our organization. You had done a tremendous job fighting the fight, navigating exceptionally tough times and positioning the company for recovery. Thank you. 
Esther, let's open up the call for questions from our audience."

I think also the debates will be around rig technology over the next, say, several quarters as you implement or see the full effect of your very substantial cost reductions and insourcing, on one hand, but on the other hand, I presume there's still a lot that, near term, it just can't be done down, given that you have a substantial backlog that still needs to ship before I presume you can truly optimize your production infrastructure. So could you talk a little bit about some of these 2 cross-currents and how you expect them to play out over the next couple of quarters as well as how much of the manufacturing infrastructure that's typically used for offshore that can get filled with the components for onshore activity?"

I know you're aware of this, but other listeners may not be, the same infrastructure makes top drives, Iron Roughneck, pumps, all manner of equipment for both land and offshore. What we've been doing is since demand has been down in both areas, we've continued to shrink our capacity and reduce our infrastructure, scaling down in view of the market demand. But simultaneously, we are seeing a shift in our mix away from offshore, which really dominated our order book for the last decade, plus 2 land in 2017 in 2018. And as we mentioned in our remarks, I think it calls for some optimism there. Conversations are beginning. Tenders for land equipment are starting to be let. And it's very early days, but that's certainly a good and welcome relief. And that showed up in our orders in the third quarter, which grew off of some pretty low levels of orders in the preceding quarters. So what we're facing is a shift towards the land business for kind of the next upcycle. Right now, it's very, very cost competitive. We're having to get very aggressive. And so the margin impact is certainly not positive early on in this cycle. But as this blossoms and as we get back into full recovery, we're much more optimistic. So right now, the business is executing kind of a shift in that direction. What I would, in particular, highlight to you though, we have a terrific management team that runs our Rig business. They've been responding aggressively in real time to the lower levels of demand. In the third quarter, our business was down 82% from where we were 2 years ago. So considering that the business posted double-digit EBITDA margins on 18% of revenue we saw 2 years ago is an amazing accomplishment. What -- I'd like to offer more quantitative guidance around margins in Rig, but frankly, at this point in this cycle and given kind of the shift is under way, we're not able to really quantify the margins. But I do have an abundance of confidence in the ability of our team to continue to reduce cost in the face of a more challenging market."

I think the important trend that underlies all of this is that the shale revolution really prompted the U.S. to be the major source of incremental growth for oil between 2011 and 2014 globally, and that was really enabled by better rig technology. You've got the vast majority of oil produced in other regions around the globe. We have a lot of customers overseas looking at the impact of better rig technology in the U.S. And so as I look to sort of the next upturn, I think overseas markets are going to begin to adopt these AC rigs, higher-tier rigs. We're getting a lot of inbound interest on that. What's interesting about NOV is we're really prepared to sort of offer the next generation of rigs. We have great success using wired drill pipe, close-loop automated drilling to let software machine-learning technologies drive those rigs to even higher levels of efficiency. And that's what has sparked a lot of interest and a lot of intrigue amongst our customer base, not just in North America, but elsewhere around the world. So I think a lot of opportunity there. I think a lot of opportunity even upgrading the 800 or 900 AC rigs across North American market for -- to be more pad capable, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, 7,500 psi mud systems, higher torque packages. That's anywhere from $1 million to $4 million worth of opportunity for NOV per rig, so a meaningful opportunity to upgrade."

So the conversations are starting. But I would caution everybody those international tenders tend to move slowly. So this is still probably at least a few quarters away. But the good news is that there's a lot of talk, there's a lot of interest in drilling capability and technologies, and I think NOV is the kind of a go-to source in terms of the latest, greatest, next-generation rig."

And when you think about what our shale technologies, it starts with a Tier 1 land rig, high-torque capability, high-torque top drive, higher level of automation and mechanization around pipe handling. It includes premium drill pipe that's able to handle higher torques and to drill out laterals that extend 10,000, 15,000 feet or more. It includes PDC bits, downhole drilling motors, rotary steerables we've invested in, MWD to geosteer those wells into the best parts of the shale and to drill smooth wellbores where you don't have later production ponding problems and areas of the wellbore that hold up solids. It includes sliding sleeve completion technologies that we think will grow in application in the next upturn, hydraulic fracture stimulation technologies, coiled tubing for plug and perf, flow iron of mixtures, blenders. Okay, we make all of that, and we're market leader across all that. So I think we're very well positioned for an upturn that has a lot more sort of shale technology to it.

Additionally, while we believe that drill contractors have really taken their spare parts inventories down to levels which are really beyond their comfort zones, we continue to be very surprised by how resilient they are and how effective they are in terms of being able to cut back their need for expenditures. So I think for us to really be able to call bottom, the process of rebalancing the market, particularly as it relates to just stopping the decline in the overall offshore rig count, needs to come to an end. But hopefully, we're not too terribly far away from that, and obviously, our rate of decline in that business has been slowing.

31900,379119222,1063699,"National Oilwell Varco, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2016",2016-10-27,"Earnings Calls","NOV Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Loren. During the third quarter, National Oilwell Varco began to see some improved demand in certain of our businesses, mostly North America, where the rig count grew 28% sequentially. For the first time since the downturn began, we posted top",752,"Thank you, Loren. During the third quarter, National Oilwell Varco began to see some improved demand in certain of our businesses, mostly North America, where the rig count grew 28% sequentially. For the first time since the downturn began, we posted top line growth in our Wellbore Technologies and Completions & Production Solutions segments. We also saw our cost reductions begin to outpace the steep declines in revenues we've seen through the past 7 quarters as 3 of our 4 segments posted higher margins due to aggressive cost reductions. 
Since the downturn began in late 2014, our revenues have declined 71%, reflecting the severe stress the oil and gas industry has been under. Our customers have slashed spending to the lowest levels possible, and the oil and gas industry  has delayed or canceled future projects totaling over 7 million barrels of oil per day. 2015 saw the lowest level of new reserve discoveries globally since 1947, only about 10% of the average annual discovery volumes through the past 50 years, according to Wood Mackenzie, and in 2016, the U.S. is forecast to see the lowest number of wells drilled since 1933. 
The 2.2 million barrel per day decline in non-OPEC production since 2014 has been fully offset by rising OPEC production, which achieved record levels this summer, along with Russian production, which achieved record levels in September. Overall, we believe OPEC to be producing at near maximum levels with little remaining excess capacity cushion, which has delayed the inevitable rebalancing of the world oil markets. Nevertheless, time is on our side as OPEC faces rising challenges to grow production further and as dwindling oilfield expenditures accelerate production declines through the rest of the world. 
Faced with extraordinary revenue declines and significant price discounting in all areas of our business, we've aggressively reduced costs and improved efficiency, enabling NOV to manage EBITDA decremental leverage to only 28% since the end of 2014. We're on track to obtain $3.1 billion in annual structural contractor and workforce cost reductions by year-end, thanks to the hard work of the experienced, capable management team that Jose, Loren and I are honored to serve with. This downturn has been extraordinarily painful on them and our entire organization. They have worked hard to insource wherever possible and to keep our plants loaded to maximize absorption. But we have nevertheless been forced to reduce our workforce 43% from peak levels and have closed or are closing 286 facilities globally. 
For the seventh quarter in a row, we have made significant reductions in our cost to match available demand while also continuing to invest in emerging opportunities we see, such as the pending acquisition of Fjords Processing from Akastor that we highlighted in our press release last night. Fjords Processing is a global leader in providing processing technology, systems and services to the upstream oil and gas industry. Fjords technology solutions include sulfate removal, oil and produced water treatment and hydrate inhibition that efficiently address critical needs for both onshore and offshore operators. 
The acquisition provides complementary technology for our Completions & Production Solutions segment. We expect that our combined operations will leverage the collective organizations' global infrastructure to reduce cost and achieve broader channels to market for the valves, pumps and composite tubulars that NOV already produces. Additionally, we believe the capabilities obtained through the transaction will leveraged by other business units who will benefit certain initiatives that are ongoing within NOV. We're excited about the capabilities at Fjords Processing, the capabilities that it brings to our platform, and we're eager to welcome the talented employees of Fjords to NOV when the transaction closes, which we expect to occur before year-end. 
As we've highlighted on prior calls, NOV's strategy is centered on the most promising areas for future production: North American shale technologies; international markets, like the Middle East and Russia; and deepwater improvements. We've used this downturn, thus far, to position the company for the inevitable upturn, closing 4 small acquisitions in the third quarter, bringing our total to 9 year-to-date. 
We foresee significant opportunities in the upturn. Precise geosteering, directional drilling to produce longer horizontal laterals, closed-loop drilling automation and optimization, completion tools, hydraulic fracture stimulation techniques, new subsea production technologies and condition-based equipment monitoring will be the big winners in the next upcycle. NOV is at the forefront in each area, and our R&D investments and acquisitions are tightly focused on these promising trends. 
At this point, I'll ask Jose to review our financial results with you."

For the third quarter of 2016, National Oilwell Varco reported a net loss of $1.36 billion or $3.62 per fully diluted share on a U.S. GAAP basis.

For the third quarter of 2016, National Oilwell Varco reported a net loss of $1.36 billion or $3.62 per fully diluted share on a U.S. GAAP basis. Excluding other items totaling $1.09 billion, net loss for the quarter was $128 million or $0.34 per share. Total company revenues for the third quarter of 2016 were $1.65 billion, down 5% from the second quarter of 2016 and down 50% from the third quarter of 2015. EBITDA was $68 million, an improvement of $43 million from the second quarter as our efforts to reduce costs and optimize our operations outpaced the decline in revenues. 
Our Completion & Production Solutions segment generated revenues of $543 million during the third quarter of 2016, up $5 million sequentially and down $255 million compared to the third quarter of 2015. Revenues increased on incremental sales of coil tubing and completion-related equipment, partially offset by fewer sales of primarily offshore-oriented production equipment, including offshore conductor pipe connectors and flexible pipe. EBITDA for the segment was $43 million or 7.9% of sales, a decrease of $14 million from the previous quarter and an $82 million decline from the prior year. The decrease in sequential EBITDA was primarily attributable to changes in revenue mix and certain inventory receivable charges. In the third quarter, we recognized $319 million in revenue from backlog, down $14 million from the second quarter of 2016. New orders were $184 million, down $85 million or 32% sequentially, resulting in a book to bill equal to 58% and a quarter ending backlog of $812 million. 
Our Wellbore Technologies segment generated $526 million in revenue during the third quarter, up 3% sequentially from $511 million and down 37% from the third quarter of 2015. As mentioned in our press release, we're very encouraged by the performance of our short-cycle businesses within the segment as they posted sequential revenue growth of approximately 15% within the North American marketplace. EBITDA for the segment was $26 million, an increase of $25 million from the previous quarter and down $100 million from the prior year. Strong sequential improvement in EBITDA was a result of achieving targeted cost reductions and our successful implementation of numerous process and efficiency improvements -- improvement initiatives across the segment. 
Our Rig Aftermarket segment generated $322 million of revenue during the third quarter of '16, down 12% from $364 million in the second quarter of '16 and down 44% from the $570 million in the third quarter of 2015. Third quarter 2016 EBITDA for the segment was $81 million, up $8 million or 11% sequentially. EBITDA margins increased 510 basis points to 25.2% of sales. Spare parts sales, service and repairs all experienced revenue declines during the third quarter. However, sales of spares parts declined more modestly than service and repairs from Q2 to Q3. The more favorable mix, along with our cost-reduction efforts, drove the increase in EBITDA on lower revenue. 
Our Rig Systems segment generated revenues of $470 million during the third quarter of 2016, down 17% sequentially from $564 million and down 69% from the $1.5 billion posted in the third quarter of 2015. The revenue decline was in line with expectations as we continue to work through our backlog and bring projects to completion. Third quarter EBITDA for the Rig Systems segment was $50 million, an increase of $1 million from the second quarter of 2016. EBITDA margins increased 190 basis points to 10.6% of sales. As we described in a fair amount of detail last quarter, we've been extremely focused on standardizing processes, optimizing structures and eliminating redundancies in our global operations. These structural changes reduced our costs and improved our efficiencies during  the quarter, enabling us to slightly increase EBITDA on a 17% decrease in revenue.
During the quarter, we recognized $363 million in revenue from backlog, down 18% from the $441 million in the prior quarter as the segment continued to work down its backlog and slow the pace of delivery in the face of low order volumes and project delays. 
New orders improved by $119 million sequentially or 180% to $185 million in the third quarter. Book-to-bill was 51%, marking the highest level achieved since the third quarter of 2014. Included in the quarter's bookings were 2 land rigs, one of which is a highly specialized, harsh environment extended-reach rig destined for Alaska's North Slope. The 2 rig sales represent the first orders for new rigs since this time last year. Other bookings during the quarter included several top drives, pedestal cranes for FPSOs and pressure control equipment. Quarter-ending backlog was $2.76 billion. We're encouraged by the 2 rig orders and are optimistic regarding near-term growth opportunities in land markets. 
In North America, smaller contractors are looking to add more modern rigs to their fleet. And while most larger contractors don't expect a need for new land build orders until the second half of 2017, they're expressing strong interest in improving the pressure and torque capabilities of their existing AC rig fleets through upgraded 7,500 psi mud systems, new top drives and Iron Roughnecks. Customers in international land markets are also expressing interest in equipment upgrades as well as newbuild programs, particularly in the Middle East, Russia and Latin America. 
While the outlook for land markets around the world appear promising, in recognition of further deterioration in outlook for the offshore newbuild market, we took a $972 million noncash goodwill impairment charge associated with our offshore Rig Systems business unit during the third quarter of 2016. The diminished outlook is based on the accelerating restructuring process in the offshore market, which is reflected in early contract terminations by operators and in the stacking and scrapping of rigs by drilling contractors. 
Looking at a few select items in the P&L. Interest and other financial costs decreased $5 million, primarily due to the reduction in commercial paper balances as well as certain charges that occurred in the second quarter and were not expected to repeat. Our effective tax rate, excluding other items, was 16.7%. As a reminder, in the current environment, relatively small changes in discrete items or the split between domestic and international results can have a disproportionate impact on our tax rates. In the fourth quarter, we expect the tax rate to be approximately 30%. 
Turning to the balance sheet. During the quarter, as I previously mentioned, we paid off our full commercial paper balance of $110 million, leaving us with $4.5 billion of availability on our facility. At September 30, 2016, our cash balance is $1.5 billion, total debt was $3.2 billion and our debt-to-capitalization ratio was 17.8%. 
In summary, I think this quarter's financial results reflect the tremendous job the team at NOV has done to resize the business, cut cost and optimize our operations. While certain elements of our business are showing signs of improvement, the organization remains focused on fine-tuning our operations, developing and delivering valuable solutions for our customers and preparing to capitalize on a market recovery. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Clay."
31900,379119222,1063699,"National Oilwell Varco, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2016",2016-10-27,"Earnings Calls","NOV Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jose.

I'll offer some additional color and guidance for each of our segments, beginning with our Completions & Production Solutions segment, which, as Jose mentioned, saw its book-to-bill fall to 58%. This was due to sharply lower orders for conductor pipe connections and subsea flexible pipe. This was partially offset by higher demand for fiberglass pipe, which is up 39% sequentially, and completion equipment, which was up 47% sequentially. International demand picked up nicely for fracture stimulation equipment and wireline units, but North American demand generally remains very low outside of some budgetary equipment quotes and some rising demand for aftermarket spares for well stimulation equipment. 
We noted in the press release our record 2.625 inch coiled tubing string manufactured in the third quarter, and we're seeing increasing interest in larger diameter coiled tubing units in strings that can traverse longer laterals in North America. We also believe that international markets are keenly focused on hydraulic fracture techniques pioneered in North America. So the stage is set for more widespread application of these enabling technologies overseas in 2017. 
Within our fiberglass pipe unit, we saw a rising demand for flowlines in North America, offsetting lower marine offshore pipe demand in Asia. Our fiberglass flowlines offer corrosion-proof solutions for well tiebacks, and the rising level of drilling activity in West Texas as well as continued large sales in the Saudi Arabia and elsewhere in the Middle East lifted this group's backlog 14% sequentially. 
The new completion tools business we acquired in July is off to a great start with wins in Canada and Russia where we secured a pilot project for our Bulldog annulus Frac system to be run this quarter. And we believe our cemented sliding sleeve technology and burst port system offer a superior solution for multistage horizontal wells. We're also advancing new ideas in completion technology that we look forward to sharing with you on future calls. 
Revenues for process and flow technologies improved slightly during the third quarter with further improvements expected in Q4 as we benefited -- and to benefit from higher demand for artificial lift products, process equipment and production chokes. As I mentioned earlier, Fjords Processing will contribute meaningfully to this business in 2017. 
Our offshore products within Completion & Production Solutions continue to face challenging market prospects due to the very low level of offshore projects globally, a situation that we believe may improve in the second half of 2017. While Brazil demand for a subsea flexible pipe has remained comparatively strong through the downturn, orders for Brazil dipped sharply during the third quarter. Elsewhere around the globe, our flexible subsea pipe business has seen several quarters of very low demand, driving intense pricing pressures and reducing average margins within our flexible pipe backlog. Nevertheless, we continue to win smaller tieback jobs and we expect Brazil orders to rebound this quarter, leading to modest sequential revenue gains. We're also continuing to engineer unique floating production unit topside modules within our cooperative agreement with GE, including our unique small-field HoneyBee and MiniBee FPSO designs, which we will complete by early 2017. 
During the quarter, we had a customer engage us in a paid study to apply these through their field development plan in the Barents Sea. So overall, we see some green shoots emerging for many of our products, but others continuing to slide, a theme that we see across other segments as well. Looking into the fourth quarter, we expect Completion & Production Solutions segment to improve in the mid-single-digit percentage range as solid incrementals due to additional cost reductions.
Wellbore Technologies benefited from shorter-cycle products and services in the third quarter, which comprised about 80% of this segment's revenue, with drill pipe sales making up most of the balance. Rig reactivations in North America drove higher demand for our shorter-cycle businesses like downhole drilling tools, including new bits and new drilling motors that we've introduced through the downturn, as more than 90% of the U.S. fleet is drilling directionally and horizontally today. 
Our WellSite Services solids control business posted excellent sequential growth and margin improvements, too, on rising demand in West Texas, where we are beginning to claw back certain pricing concessions by charging more for items like freight and mobilization. While there are about 10 months of oil country tubular goods inventory on the ground in the U.S., half of this is for the offshore. So our pipe mill and processor customers got busier in the third quarter working on casing sizes that fit shale drilling, driving better results for our Tuboscope pipe inspection services. 
Drill pipe margins improved significantly in the third quarter, owing to a near-record mix of premium, large diameter pipe. However, backlog remained very low for this business, and we expect Q4 to face significant headwinds on a poor mix and much lower volumes. 2017 looks better for drill pipe as we start to see higher demand for 5.5 inch premium drill pipe to drill longer, larger diameter laterals. We will be enhancing our market-leading drill pipe technology with the launch of our new delta premium connection technology in the fourth quarter, which offers much faster make-up times, higher torques, much reduced risk of thread galling, improving drilling efficiencies and reducing total cost of ownership for our customers. And our new track ID product attaches RFID chips to the pipe, enabling contractors to automatically tally pipe on trips and track pipe in inventory, including the specific history of each joint of drill pipe. We're also seeing higher demand for our IntelliServ wired drill pipe, owing to growing success in using its high-speed data link to downhole instruments to improve drilling efficiency and wellbore placement. While these advancements paint a bright future for drill pipe demand, given near-term mix and volume pressures in drill pipe, we remain cautious on our outlook for Q4. 
While demand is growing in North America and we continue to see rising interest in our close-loop drilling automation services, the segment is also seeing increasing price pressure in many of its traditional businesses in international markets. For the fourth quarter, we expect Wellbore Technologies revenues to decline slightly, and we expect EBITDA to remain roughly flat as we -- as continued cost reductions are offset by international pricing pressures and lower drill pipe sales and margins. 
Rig Aftermarket posted a 12% sequential decline in revenues in the third quarter, but saw improved EBITDA, up by about $8 million. Parts, service and repair all declined in the quarter, partly due to the evaporation of SPS work on offshore vessels. The cost reductions 
and rig reactivations in West Texas as well as a higher mix of spare parts helped to offset the impact from lower revenues. 
The group performed its first top drive rebuilds in our new facility in Russia during the third quarter. It is also aggressively pursuing condition-based monitoring opportunities. Our predictive failure monitoring system for subsea BOP stacks has notified our customers of potential regulator valve wear on 11 separate occasions, which enabled them to avoid unplanned lost time in drilling operations. We're now working on similar pilot products for top drives and mud pump failures, and we believe there is a tremendous market for conditions-based predictive monitoring of equipment across the industry. Again, NOV is leading the way in bringing practical big data-driven enhancements to the operations of our customers. Nevertheless, the bulk of Rig Aftermarket's business is spare parts sales and service into our considerable installed base of equipment offshore. 
Given the financial stress the offshore drilling industry is enduring, Rig Aftermarket will continue to face near-term headwinds. We expect the fourth quarter to see mid-single-digit revenue declines for the Rig Aftermarket segment and margins to compress a few hundred basis points, owing to mix between spare parts sales and repair services. 
Our Rig Systems segment posted significantly higher sequential orders, owing to 2 land rigs booked in the quarter, but demand, nevertheless, remains very weak with book-to-bill at only 51%. Orders for equipment for the land market significantly outpaced offshore equipment demand in the quarter, reducing our offshore mix within our backlog to 81%. Revenue fell 17% sequentially, but the segment managed to hold EBITDA flat at $50 million or 10.6% of sales due primarily to lower execution cost on offshore rig construction in Asia and cost reductions elsewhere around the world. 
Major offshore newbuild rig construction project revenue totaled about $200 million in the quarter, about 12% of our consolidated revenue, and overall demand for offshore equipment remains very low despite a few conversations about potential new platform rigs. Offshore drilling contractors continued to only order replacement equipment for unplanned outages or worn-out equipment they can't otherwise cannibalize from stacked rigs or access elsewhere. 
Our outlook for demand for land rigs is much brighter as we have several inquiries for new land rigs for North America and numerous tenders being let for rigs in international markets for customers who have shrewdly observed that the upgraded rig fleet in North America had much to do with the shale revolution of the prior peak. We believe 2017 will see meaningful resumption in demand for land equipment. As Jose mentioned, we are quoting upgrade packages for 7,500 psi mud systems, higher torque and new NOVOS control systems required to drill longer laterals. In fact, top drive sales in the land market picked up in the quarter due to the need for higher torque to execute longer laterals. 
The financial stress offshore will continue to weigh heavily on the results for this segment. We expect the fourth quarter revenues to decline in the mid-single-digit percentage range, but margins to fall a few hundred basis points as we face a mix shift to lower margin land opportunities, lower-priced and lower-margin offshore orders in our backlog and increasingly challenging absorption loads. 
So to summarize, at or near the bottom of an extraordinary down cycle we see lots of cross-currents. After 2 years of brutal declines, growth in North America land and Middle East have been a welcome relief, and we're optimistic about activity in Russia. On the other hand, our offshore customers remain very challenged, and many international markets continue to slow, exacerbating pricing pressures. Nonetheless, NOV's diverse portfolio of critical technologies and strong liquidity make it well positioned to benefit from a recovery in all corners of the oilfield. 
Before we open the call to Q&A, let me take a moment to thank our many hard-working employees of our organization. You have done a tremendous job fighting the fight, navigating exceptionally tough times and positioning the company for recovery. Thank you.

So could you talk a little bit about some of these 2 cross-currents and how you expect them to play out over the next couple of quarters as well as how much of the manufacturing infrastructure that's typically used for offshore that can get filled with the components for onshore activity?"

I know you're aware of this, but other listeners may not be, the same infrastructure makes top drives, Iron Roughneck, pumps, all manner of equipment for both land and offshore. What we've been doing is -- since demand has been down in both areas -- we've continued to shrink our capacity and reduce our infrastructure, scaling down in view of the market demand. But simultaneously, we are seeing a shift in our mix away from offshore, which really dominated our order book for the last decade plus, to land in 2017, 2018. And as we mentioned in our remarks, I think it calls for some optimism there. Conversations are beginning. Tenders for land equipment are starting to be let. And it's very early days, but that's certainly a good and welcome relief. And that showed up in our orders in the third quarter, which grew off of some pretty low levels of orders in the preceding quarters. So what we're facing is a shift towards the land business for kind of the next upcycle. Right now, it's very, very cost competitive. We're having to get very aggressive. And so the margin impact is certainly not positive early on in this cycle. But as this blossoms and as we get back into full recovery, we're much more optimistic. So right now, the business is executing kind of a shift in that direction. What I would, in particular, highlight to you though, we have a terrific management team that runs our Rig business. They've been responding aggressively in real time to the lower levels of demand. In the third quarter, our business was down 82% from where we were 2 years ago. So considering that the business posted double-digit EBITDA margins on 18% of revenue we saw 2 years ago is an amazing accomplishment. What -- I'd like to offer more quantitative guidance around margins in Rig, but frankly, at this point in this cycle and given the kind of shift is under way, we're not able to really quantify the margins. But I do have an abundance of confidence in the ability of our team to continue to reduce cost in the face of a more challenging market."

I think the important trend that underlies all of this is that the shale revolution really prompted the U.S. to be the major source of incremental growth for oil between 2011 and 2014 globally, and that was really enabled by better rig technology. You've got the vast majority of oil produced in other regions around the globe. We have a lot of customers overseas looking at the impact of better rig technology in the U.S. And so as I look to sort of the next upturn, I think overseas markets are going to begin to adopt these AC rigs, higher-tier rigs. We're getting a lot of inbound interest on that. What's interesting about NOV is we're really prepared to sort of offer the next generation of rigs. We have great success using wired drill pipe, close-loop automated drilling to let software machine-learning technologies drive those rigs to even higher levels of efficiency. And that's what has sparked a lot of interest and a lot of intrigue amongst our customer base, not just in North America, but elsewhere around the world. So I think a lot of opportunity there. I think a lot of opportunity even upgrading the 800 or 900 AC rigs across North American market for -- to be more pad capable, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, 7,500 psi mud systems, higher torque packages. That's anywhere from $1 million to $4 million worth of opportunity for NOV per rig, so a meaningful opportunity to upgrade."

It's not a perfect science for getting to the number, but we estimate that we captured about $240 million to $250 million of that $400 million in annualized cost savings during the third quarter.

I've said it many times before and I'll repeat it, the 2 skill sets you have to master in oilfield services are rapid, aggressive cost reductions when the market dictates and then rapid profitable growth when the market dictates, and so this is a very highly cyclical business that swings wildly. And I've seen our team do it before, responding to the upturns, and so again, I have an abundance of confidence in the talented management team that I get to work with here in terms of responding to that day. With regards to your inventory comment, what I would tell you is that, frankly, our inventory is -- we still have too much, and so we have ample inventory, I think, to respond to our customers' needs. And so that's not really the issue. What the upturn will look like, the scarcest resource in every upturn pretty quickly becomes people. And so -- but I think we have a great team here at NOV. It's been very tough to reduce the size of our workforce, but we're getting down to our kind of our core team and looking forward to responding to the upturn. I would add too, though, that responding to an upturn is not unique to NOV. Our customers face that as well. So a lot of our products and strategies really are around try to bring technology to help them navigate the challenges as well, so close-loop drilling, for instance, that I mentioned a moment ago, we believe, will help drilling contractors when they're called upon to put a much larger portion of their fleets back toward drilling.

And so pricing leverage can be pretty stout in the industry. I would add too that psychologically, when you have a workforce and an organization that's gone through a significant downsizing like we have, there's a hesitancy to add people. And so we all naturally try to do more with less on the upturn, and so that drives just a high level of efficiency that gets put into the organization through a downturn.

It includes premium drill pipe that's able to handle higher torques and to drill out laterals that extend 10,000, 15,000 feet or more. It includes PDC bits, downhole drilling motors, rotary steerables we've invested in, MWD to geosteer those wells into the best parts of the shale and to drill smooth wellbores where you don't have later production ponding problems in areas of the wellbore that hold up solids.

But -- obviously, it's very challenging environment to really predict and forecast exactly what's going to happen with the Aftermarket business. A couple of factors make that challenging. With the continuation of cancellations of contracts by operators and rigs being stacked or scrapped, that's continuing to challenge our market opportunity on that front. Additionally, while we believe that drill contractors have really taken their spare parts inventories down to levels which are really beyond their comfort zones, we continue to be very surprised by how resilient they are and how effective they are in terms of being able to cut back their need for expenditures. So I think for us to really be able to call bottom, the process of rebalancing the market, particularly as it relates to just stopping the decline in the overall offshore rig count, needs to come to an end. But hopefully, we're not too terribly far away from that, and obviously, our rate of decline in that business has been slowing. So good long-term outlook, but here near term, still a little cautious."

During the third quarter, National Oilwell Varco began to see some improved demand in certain of our businesses, mostly North America, where the rig count grew 28% sequentially. For the first time since the downturn began, we posted top",752,"Thank you, Loren. During the third quarter, National Oilwell Varco began to see some improved demand in certain of our businesses, mostly North America, where the rig count grew 28% sequentially. For the first time since the downturn began, we posted top line growth in our Wellbore Technologies and Completions & Production Solutions segments. We also saw our cost reductions begin to outpace the steep declines in revenues we've seen through the past 7 quarters as 3 of our 4 segments posted higher margins due to aggressive cost reductions. 
Since the downturn began in late 2014, our revenues have declined 71%, reflecting the severe stress the oil and gas industry has been under. Our customers have slashed spending to the lowest levels possible, and the oil and gas industry  has delayed or canceled future projects totaling over 7 million barrels of oil per day. 2015 saw the lowest level of new reserve discoveries globally since 1947, only about 10% of the average annual discovery volumes through the past 50 years, according to Wood Mackenzie, and in 2016, the U.S. is forecast to see the lowest number of wells drilled since 1933. 
The 2.2 million barrel per day decline in non-OPEC production since 2014 has been fully offset by rising OPEC production, which achieved record levels this summer, along with Russian production, which achieved record levels in September. Overall, we believe OPEC to be producing at near maximum levels with little remaining excess capacity cushion, which has delayed the inevitable rebalancing of the world oil markets. Nevertheless, time is on our side as OPEC faces rising challenges to grow production further and as dwindling oilfield expenditures accelerate production declines through the rest of the world. 
Faced with extraordinary revenue declines and significant price discounting in all areas of our business, we've aggressively reduced costs and improved efficiency, enabling NOV to manage EBITDA decremental leverage to only 28% since the end of 2014. We're on track to obtain $3.1 billion in annual structural contractor and workforce cost reductions by year-end, thanks to the hard work of the experienced, capable management team that Jose, Loren and I are honored to serve with. This downturn has been extraordinarily painful on them and our entire organization. They have worked hard to insource wherever possible and to keep our plants loaded to maximize absorption. But we have nevertheless been forced to reduce our workforce 43% from peak levels and have closed or are closing 286 facilities globally. 
For the seventh quarter in a row, we have made significant reductions in our cost to match available demand while also continuing to invest in emerging opportunities we see, such as the pending acquisition of Fjords Processing from Akastor that we highlighted in our press release last night. Fjords Processing is a global leader in providing processing technology, systems and services to the upstream oil and gas industry. Fjords technology solutions include sulfate removal, oil and produced water treatment and hydrate inhibition that efficiently address critical needs for both onshore and offshore operators. 
The acquisition provides complementary technology for our Completions & Production Solutions segment. We expect that our combined operations will leverage the collective organizations' global infrastructure to reduce cost and achieve broader channels to market for the valves, pumps and composite tubulars that NOV already produces. Additionally, we believe the capabilities obtained through the transaction will leveraged by other business units who will benefit certain initiatives that are ongoing within NOV. We're excited about the capabilities at Fjords Processing, the capabilities that it brings to our platform, and we're eager to welcome the talented employees of Fjords to NOV when the transaction closes, which we expect to occur before year-end. 
As we've highlighted on prior calls, NOV's strategy is centered on the most promising areas for future production: North American shale technologies; international markets, like the Middle East and Russia; and deepwater improvements. We've used this downturn, thus far, to position the company for the inevitable upturn, closing 4 small acquisitions in the third quarter, bringing our total to 9 year-to-date. 
We foresee significant opportunities in the upturn. Precise geosteering, directional drilling to produce longer horizontal laterals, closed-loop drilling automation and optimization, completion tools, hydraulic fracture stimulation techniques, new subsea production technologies and condition-based equipment monitoring will be the big winners in the next upcycle. NOV is at the forefront in each area, and our R&D investments and acquisitions are tightly focused on these promising trends.

For the third quarter of 2016, National Oilwell Varco reported a net loss of $1.36 billion or $3.62 per fully diluted share on a U.S. GAAP basis. Excluding other items totaling $1.09 billion, net loss for the q",1180,"Thank you, Clay, and good morning, everyone. For the third quarter of 2016, National Oilwell Varco reported a net loss of $1.36 billion or $3.62 per fully diluted share on a U.S. GAAP basis. Excluding other items totaling $1.09 billion, net loss for the quarter was $128 million or $0.34 per share. Total company revenues for the third quarter of 2016 were $1.65 billion, down 5% from the second quarter of 2016 and down 50% from the third quarter of 2015. EBITDA was $68 million, an improvement of $43 million from the second quarter as our efforts to reduce costs and optimize our operations outpaced the decline in revenues. 
Our Completion & Production Solutions segment generated revenues of $543 million during the third quarter of 2016, up $5 million sequentially and down $255 million compared to the third quarter of 2015. Revenues increased on incremental sales of coil tubing and completion-related equipment, partially offset by fewer sales of primarily offshore-oriented production equipment, including offshore conductor pipe connectors and flexible pipe. EBITDA for the segment was $43 million or 7.9% of sales, a decrease of $14 million from the previous quarter and an $82 million decline from the prior year. The decrease in sequential EBITDA was primarily attributable to changes in revenue mix and certain inventory receivable charges. In the third quarter, we recognized $319 million in revenue from backlog, down $14 million from the second quarter of 2016. New orders were $184 million, down $85 million or 32% sequentially, resulting in a book to bill equal to 58% and a quarter ending backlog of $812 million. 
Our Wellbore Technologies segment generated $526 million in revenue during the third quarter, up 3% sequentially from $511 million and down 37% from the third quarter of 2015. As mentioned in our press release, we're very encouraged by the performance of our short-cycle businesses within the segment as they posted sequential revenue growth of approximately 15% within the North American marketplace. EBITDA for the segment was $26 million, an increase of $25 million from the previous quarter and down $100 million from the prior year. Strong sequential improvement in EBITDA was a result of achieving targeted cost reductions and our successful implementation of numerous process and efficiency improvements -- improvement initiatives across the segment. 
Our Rig Aftermarket segment generated $322 million of revenue during the third quarter of '16, down 12% from $364 million in the second quarter of '16 and down 44% from the $570 million in the third quarter of 2015. Third quarter 2016 EBITDA for the segment was $81 million, up $8 million or 11% sequentially. EBITDA margins increased 510 basis points to 25.2% of sales. Spare parts sales, service and repairs all experienced revenue declines during the third quarter. However, sales of spares parts declined more modestly than service and repairs from Q2 to Q3. The more favorable mix, along with our cost-reduction efforts, drove the increase in EBITDA on lower revenue. 
Our Rig Systems segment generated revenues of $470 million during the third quarter of 2016, down 17% sequentially from $564 million and down 69% from the $1.5 billion posted in the third quarter of 2015. The revenue decline was in line with expectations as we continue to work through our backlog and bring projects to completion. Third quarter EBITDA for the Rig Systems segment was $50 million, an increase of $1 million from the second quarter of 2016. EBITDA margins increased 190 basis points to 10.6% of sales. As we described in a fair amount of detail last quarter, we've been extremely focused on standardizing processes, optimizing structures and eliminating redundancies in our global operations. These structural changes reduced our costs and improved our efficiencies during  the quarter, enabling us to slightly increase EBITDA on a 17% decrease in revenue.
During the quarter, we recognized $363 million in revenue from backlog, down 18% from the $441 million in the prior quarter as the segment continued to work down its backlog and slow the pace of delivery in the face of low order volumes and project delays. 
New orders improved by $119 million sequentially or 180% to $185 million in the third quarter. Book-to-bill was 51%, marking the highest level achieved since the third quarter of 2014. Included in the quarter's bookings were 2 land rigs, one of which is a highly specialized, harsh environment extended-reach rig destined for Alaska's North Slope. The 2 rig sales represent the first orders for new rigs since this time last year. Other bookings during the quarter included several top drives, pedestal cranes for FPSOs and pressure control equipment. Quarter-ending backlog was $2.76 billion. We're encouraged by the 2 rig orders and are optimistic regarding near-term growth opportunities in land markets. 
In North America, smaller contractors are looking to add more modern rigs to their fleet. And while most larger contractors don't expect a need for new land build orders until the second half of 2017, they're expressing strong interest in improving the pressure and torque capabilities of their existing AC rig fleets through upgraded 7,500 psi mud systems, new top drives and Iron Roughnecks. Customers in international land markets are also expressing interest in equipment upgrades as well as newbuild programs, particularly in the Middle East, Russia and Latin America. 
While the outlook for land markets around the world appear promising, in recognition of further deterioration in outlook for the offshore newbuild market, we took a $972 million noncash goodwill impairment charge associated with our offshore Rig Systems business unit during the third quarter of 2016. The diminished outlook is based on the accelerating restructuring process in the offshore market, which is reflected in early contract terminations by operators and in the stacking and scrapping of rigs by drilling contractors. 
Looking at a few select items in the P&L. Interest and other financial costs decreased $5 million, primarily due to the reduction in commercial paper balances as well as certain charges that occurred in the second quarter and were not expected to repeat. Our effective tax rate, excluding other items, was 16.7%. As a reminder, in the current environment, relatively small changes in discrete items or the split between domestic and international results can have a disproportionate impact on our tax rates. In the fourth quarter, we expect the tax rate to be approximately 30%. 
Turning to the balance sheet. During the quarter, as I previously mentioned, we paid off our full commercial paper balance of $110 million, leaving us with $4.5 billion of availability on our facility. At September 30, 2016, our cash balance is $1.5 billion, total debt was $3.2 billion and our debt-to-capitalization ratio was 17.8%. 
In summary, I think this quarter's financial results reflect the tremendous job the team at NOV has done to resize the business, cut cost and optimize our operations. While certain elements of our business are showing signs of improvement, the organization remains focused on fine-tuning our operations, developing and delivering valuable solutions for our customers and preparing to capitalize on a market recovery. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Clay."
31900,379119222,1064560,"National Oilwell Varco, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2016",2016-10-27,"Earnings Calls","NOV Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jose. I'll offer some additional color and guidance for each of our segments, beginning with our Completions & Production Solutions segment, which, as Jose mentioned, saw its book-to-bill fall to 58%. This was due to sharply lower orders for co",1780,"Thank you, Jose. I'll offer some additional color and guidance for each of our segments, beginning with our Completions & Production Solutions segment, which, as Jose mentioned, saw its book-to-bill fall to 58%. This was due to sharply lower orders for conductor pipe connections and subsea flexible pipe. This was partially offset by higher demand for fiberglass pipe, which is up 39% sequentially, and completion equipment, which was up 47% sequentially. International demand picked up nicely for fracture stimulation equipment and wireline units, but North American demand generally remains very low outside of some budgetary equipment quotes and some rising demand for aftermarket spares for well stimulation equipment. 
We noted in the press release our record 2.625 inch coiled tubing string manufactured in the third quarter, and we're seeing increasing interest in larger diameter coiled tubing units in strings that can traverse longer laterals in North America. We also believe that international markets are keenly focused on hydraulic fracture techniques pioneered in North America. So the stage is set for more widespread application of these enabling technologies overseas in 2017. 
Within our fiberglass pipe unit, we saw a rising demand for flowlines in North America, offsetting lower marine offshore pipe demand in Asia. Our fiberglass flowlines offer corrosion-proof solutions for well tiebacks, and the rising level of drilling activity in West Texas as well as continued large sales in the Saudi Arabia and elsewhere in the Middle East lifted this group's backlog 14% sequentially. 
The new completion tools business we acquired in July is off to a great start with wins in Canada and Russia where we secured a pilot project for our Bulldog annulus Frac system to be run this quarter. And we believe our cemented sliding sleeve technology and burst port system offer a superior solution for multistage horizontal wells. We're also advancing new ideas in completion technology that we look forward to sharing with you on future calls. 
Revenues for process and flow technologies improved slightly during the third quarter with further improvements expected in Q4 as we benefited -- and to benefit from higher demand for artificial lift products, process equipment and production chokes. As I mentioned earlier, Fjords Processing will contribute meaningfully to this business in 2017. 
Our offshore products within Completion & Production Solutions continue to face challenging market prospects due to the very low level of offshore projects globally, a situation that we believe may improve in the second half of 2017. While Brazil demand for a subsea flexible pipe has remained comparatively strong through the downturn, orders for Brazil dipped sharply during the third quarter. Elsewhere around the globe, our flexible subsea pipe business has seen several quarters of very low demand, driving intense pricing pressures and reducing average margins within our flexible pipe backlog. Nevertheless, we continue to win smaller tieback jobs and we expect Brazil orders to rebound this quarter, leading to modest sequential revenue gains. We're also continuing to engineer unique floating production unit topside modules within our cooperative agreement with GE, including our unique small-field HoneyBee and MiniBee FPSO designs, which we will complete by early 2017. 
During the quarter, we had a customer engage us in a paid study to apply these through their field development plan in the Barents Sea. So overall, we see some green shoots emerging for many of our products, but others continuing to slide, a theme that we see across other segments as well. Looking into the fourth quarter, we expect Completion & Production Solutions segment to improve in the mid-single-digit percentage range as solid incrementals due to additional cost reductions.
Wellbore Technologies benefited from shorter-cycle products and services in the third quarter, which comprised about 80% of this segment's revenue, with drill pipe sales making up most of the balance. Rig reactivations in North America drove higher demand for our shorter-cycle businesses like downhole drilling tools, including new bits and new drilling motors that we've introduced through the downturn, as more than 90% of the U.S. fleet is drilling directionally and horizontally today. 
Our WellSite Services solids control business posted excellent sequential growth and margin improvements, too, on rising demand in West Texas, where we are beginning to claw back certain pricing concessions by charging more for items like freight and mobilization. While there are about 10 months of oil country tubular goods inventory on the ground in the U.S., half of this is for the offshore. So our pipe mill and processor customers got busier in the third quarter working on casing sizes that fit shale drilling, driving better results for our Tuboscope pipe inspection services. 
Drill pipe margins improved significantly in the third quarter, owing to a near-record mix of premium, large diameter pipe. However, backlog remained very low for this business, and we expect Q4 to face significant headwinds on a poor mix and much lower volumes. 2017 looks better for drill pipe as we start to see higher demand for 5.5 inch premium drill pipe to drill longer, larger diameter laterals. We will be enhancing our market-leading drill pipe technology with the launch of our new delta premium connection technology in the fourth quarter, which offers much faster make-up times, higher torques, much reduced risk of thread galling, improving drilling efficiencies and reducing total cost of ownership for our customers. And our new track ID product attaches RFID chips to the pipe, enabling contractors to automatically tally pipe on trips and track pipe in inventory, including the specific history of each joint of drill pipe. We're also seeing higher demand for our IntelliServ wired drill pipe, owing to growing success in using its high-speed data link to downhole instruments to improve drilling efficiency and wellbore placement. While these advancements paint a bright future for drill pipe demand, given near-term mix and volume pressures in drill pipe, we remain cautious on our outlook for Q4. 
While demand is growing in North America and we continue to see rising interest in our close-loop drilling automation services, the segment is also seeing increasing price pressure in many of its traditional businesses in international markets. For the fourth quarter, we expect Wellbore Technologies revenues to decline slightly, and we expect EBITDA to remain roughly flat as we -- as continued cost reductions are offset by international pricing pressures and lower drill pipe sales and margins. 
Rig Aftermarket posted a 12% sequential decline in revenues in the third quarter, but saw improved EBITDA, up by about $8 million. Parts, service and repair all declined in the quarter, partly due to the evaporation of SPS work on offshore vessels. The cost reductions 
and rig reactivations in West Texas as well as a higher mix of spare parts helped to offset the impact from lower revenues. 
The group performed its first top drive rebuilds in our new facility in Russia during the third quarter. It is also aggressively pursuing condition-based monitoring opportunities. Our predictive failure monitoring system for subsea BOP stacks has notified our customers of potential regulator valve wear on 11 separate occasions, which enabled them to avoid unplanned lost time in drilling operations. We're now working on similar pilot products for top drives and mud pump failures, and we believe there is a tremendous market for conditions-based predictive monitoring of equipment across the industry. Again, NOV is leading the way in bringing practical big data-driven enhancements to the operations of our customers. Nevertheless, the bulk of Rig Aftermarket's business is spare parts sales and service into our considerable installed base of equipment offshore. 
Given the financial stress the offshore drilling industry is enduring, Rig Aftermarket will continue to face near-term headwinds. We expect the fourth quarter to see mid-single-digit revenue declines for the Rig Aftermarket segment and margins to compress a few hundred basis points, owing to mix between spare parts sales and repair services. 
Our Rig Systems segment posted significantly higher sequential orders, owing to 2 land rigs booked in the quarter, but demand, nevertheless, remains very weak with book-to-bill at only 51%. Orders for equipment for the land market significantly outpaced offshore equipment demand in the quarter, reducing our offshore mix within our backlog to 81%. Revenue fell 17% sequentially, but the segment managed to hold EBITDA flat at $50 million or 10.6% of sales due primarily to lower execution cost on offshore rig construction in Asia and cost reductions elsewhere around the world. 
Major offshore newbuild rig construction project revenue totaled about $200 million in the quarter, about 12% of our consolidated revenue, and overall demand for offshore equipment remains very low despite a few conversations about potential new platform rigs. Offshore drilling contractors continued to only order replacement equipment for unplanned outages or worn-out equipment they can't otherwise cannibalize from stacked rigs or access elsewhere. 
Our outlook for demand for land rigs is much brighter as we have several inquiries for new land rigs for North America and numerous tenders being let for rigs in international markets for customers who have shrewdly observed that the upgraded rig fleet in North America had much to do with the shale revolution of the prior peak. We believe 2017 will see meaningful resumption in demand for land equipment. As Jose mentioned, we are quoting upgrade packages for 7,500 psi mud systems, higher torque and new NOVOS control systems required to drill longer laterals. In fact, top drive sales in the land market picked up in the quarter due to the need for higher torque to execute longer laterals. 
The financial stress offshore will continue to weigh heavily on the results for this segment. We expect the fourth quarter revenues to decline in the mid-single-digit percentage range, but margins to fall a few hundred basis points as we face a mix shift to lower margin land opportunities, lower-priced and lower-margin offshore orders in our backlog and increasingly challenging absorption loads. 
So to summarize, at or near the bottom of an extraordinary down cycle we see lots of cross-currents. After 2 years of brutal declines, growth in North America land and Middle East have been a welcome relief, and we're optimistic about activity in Russia. On the other hand, our offshore customers remain very challenged, and many international markets continue to slow, exacerbating pricing pressures. Nonetheless, NOV's diverse portfolio of critical technologies and strong liquidity make it well positioned to benefit from a recovery in all corners of the oilfield. 
Before we open the call to Q&A, let me take a moment to thank our many hard-working employees of our organization. You have done a tremendous job fighting the fight, navigating exceptionally tough times and positioning the company for recovery. Thank you.

So could you talk a little bit about some of these 2 cross-currents and how you expect them to play out over the next couple of quarters as well as how much of the manufacturing infrastructure that's typically used for offshore that can get filled with the components for onshore activity?"

I know you're aware of this, but other listeners may not be, the same infrastructure makes top drives, Iron Roughneck, pumps, all manner of equipment for both land and offshore. What we've been doing is -- since demand has been down in both areas -- we've continued to shrink our capacity and reduce our infrastructure, scaling down in view of the market demand. But simultaneously, we are seeing a shift in our mix away from offshore, which really dominated our order book for the last decade plus, to land in 2017, 2018. And as we mentioned in our remarks, I think it calls for some optimism there. Conversations are beginning. Tenders for land equipment are starting to be let. And it's very early days, but that's certainly a good and welcome relief. And that showed up in our orders in the third quarter, which grew off of some pretty low levels of orders in the preceding quarters. So what we're facing is a shift towards the land business for kind of the next upcycle. Right now, it's very, very cost competitive. We're having to get very aggressive. And so the margin impact is certainly not positive early on in this cycle. But as this blossoms and as we get back into full recovery, we're much more optimistic. So right now, the business is executing kind of a shift in that direction. What I would, in particular, highlight to you though, we have a terrific management team that runs our Rig business. They've been responding aggressively in real time to the lower levels of demand. In the third quarter, our business was down 82% from where we were 2 years ago. So considering that the business posted double-digit EBITDA margins on 18% of revenue we saw 2 years ago is an amazing accomplishment. What -- I'd like to offer more quantitative guidance around margins in Rig, but frankly, at this point in this cycle and given the kind of shift is under way, we're not able to really quantify the margins. But I do have an abundance of confidence in the ability of our team to continue to reduce cost in the face of a more challenging market."

How do you think about that? You have a very large position in North America shale. And what rig count do you think of as the -- is the rig count really be able to take out the old revenue and margin levels?"

I think the important trend that underlies all of this is that the shale revolution really prompted the U.S. to be the major source of incremental growth for oil between 2011 and 2014 globally, and that was really enabled by better rig technology. You've got the vast majority of oil produced in other regions around the globe. We have a lot of customers overseas looking at the impact of better rig technology in the U.S. And so as I look to sort of the next upturn, I think overseas markets are going to begin to adopt these AC rigs, higher-tier rigs. We're getting a lot of inbound interest on that. What's interesting about NOV is we're really prepared to sort of offer the next generation of rigs. We have great success using wired drill pipe, close-loop automated drilling to let software machine-learning technologies drive those rigs to even higher levels of efficiency. And that's what has sparked a lot of interest and a lot of intrigue amongst our customer base, not just in North America, but elsewhere around the world. So I think a lot of opportunity there. I think a lot of opportunity even upgrading the 800 or 900 AC rigs across North American market for -- to be more pad capable, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, 7,500 psi mud systems, higher torque packages. That's anywhere from $1 million to $4 million worth of opportunity for NOV per rig, so a meaningful opportunity to upgrade."

It's not a perfect science for getting to the number, but we estimate that we captured about $240 million to $250 million of that $400 million in annualized cost savings during the third quarter. So the team has done a tremendous job of not only cutting cost from the system, but as we've highlighted several times, really using that opportunity to streamline the operations and make things more efficient, translating into further margin improvement. So more to come on that front unfortunately because those actions are painful, but team is doing a tremendous job."

I've said it many times before and I'll repeat it, the 2 skill sets you have to master in oilfield services are rapid, aggressive cost reductions when the market dictates and then rapid profitable growth when the market dictates, and so this is a very highly cyclical business that swings wildly. And I've seen our team do it before, responding to the upturns, and so again, I have an abundance of confidence in the talented management team that I get to work with here in terms of responding to that day. With regards to your inventory comment, what I would tell you is that, frankly, our inventory is -- we still have too much, and so we have ample inventory, I think, to respond to our customers' needs. And so that's not really the issue. What the upturn will look like, the scarcest resource in every upturn pretty quickly becomes people. And so -- but I think we have a great team here at NOV. It's been very tough to reduce the size of our workforce, but we're getting down to our kind of our core team and looking forward to responding to the upturn. I would add too, though, that responding to an upturn is not unique to NOV. Our customers face that as well. So a lot of our products and strategies really are around try to bring technology to help them navigate the challenges as well, so close-loop drilling, for instance, that I mentioned a moment ago, we believe, will help drilling contractors when they're called upon to put a much larger portion of their fleets back toward drilling. That sort of technology can drive a lot of efficiency and learning curve effects that would otherwise take much longer to accomplish."

And so pricing leverage can be pretty stout in the industry. I would add too that psychologically, when you have a workforce and an organization that's gone through a significant downsizing like we have, there's a hesitancy to add people. And so we all naturally try to do more with less on the upturn, and so that drives just a high level of efficiency that gets put into the organization through a downturn. And so when you get the upturn, you really benefit from that. So again, really looking forward to that and -- but very, very confident we'll be able to navigate our way upwards."

So the conversations are starting. But I would caution everybody those international tenders tend to move slowly. So this is still probably at least a few quarters away.

And when you think about what our shale technologies -- it starts with a Tier 1 land rig, high-torque capability, high-torque top drive, higher level of automation and mechanization around pipe handling. It includes premium drill pipe that's able to handle higher torques and to drill out laterals that extend 10,000, 15,000 feet or more. It includes PDC bits, downhole drilling motors, rotary steerables we've invested in, MWD to geosteer those wells into the best parts of the shale and to drill smooth wellbores where you don't have later production ponding problems in areas of the wellbore that hold up solids. It includes sliding sleeve completion technologies that we think will grow in application in the next upturn, hydraulic fracture stimulation technologies, coiled tubing for plug and perf, flow iron of mixtures, blenders. Okay, we make all of that, and we're market leader across all that. So I think we're very well positioned for an upturn that has a lot more sort of shale technology to it.

Additionally, while we believe that drill contractors have really taken their spare parts inventories down to levels which are really beyond their comfort zones, we continue to be very surprised by how resilient they are and how effective they are in terms of being able to cut back their need for expenditures. So I think for us to really be able to call bottom, the process of rebalancing the market, particularly as it relates to just stopping the decline in the overall offshore rig count, needs to come to an end. But hopefully, we're not too terribly far away from that, and obviously, our rate of decline in that business has been slowing.

So there's sort of overall margin shift underway. And again, our team is fighting hard to reduce costs, to get us high margin as we can, given that mix shift backdrop. But realistically, I think we're probably going to see margins -- we guided down a bit for Q4, and I think that's probably more closer to what we expect for -- to see in 2017 across Rig Systems."

The Fjords acquisition, as we mentioned, fits well within our Completion & Production Solutions group and our process flow technology business unit within that, but very excited about it. They are about 50% land, 50% offshore, fluid processing modules, a lot of specific technologies around sulfur removal units, around glycol units for gas, electrostatic coalescers. That's very additive to a number of technologies that we have and really provide a kind of a new channel to market for valves and pumps and composite pipes and other things that we already make here at NOV, so it's a great synergy. What's interesting about Fjords too is that it's predominantly an eastern hemisphere business, and so we really think NOV can help open up new geographic markets to that business. So very excited about it, looking forward to getting it closed in Q4 and, again, further sort of cements NOV's pivot towards things other than rig building. So here's another investment in production-related technologies that we think have a very bright future."

It's about 44%, 45% offshore revenue-related, but the backlog is much higher mix of offshore products, because the offshore products tend to remain in backlog much longer than quicker-turn land things. So the backlog and the order rate really is much more, frankly, offshore-focused than the revenue stream for Completion & Production Solutions, if that makes sense. And while we do expect that to pick up, offshore demand to pick up in Q4 based on some specific things, we do view the offshore market as continuing to face some pretty challenging levels of demand as we enter 2017. So it's very difficult to say at this point."

So flexible pipe, we've added to our offering of subsea components with the Kongsberg acquisition, which brought a lot of connectors, subsea connectors, and that's in addition to our Seabox water processing technology that we acquired last year. So we do a lot in this space, turret mooring systems, FPSOs and the like. So we're out there doing our best. However, like I said earlier, the deepwater faces some challenging return hurdles at $50 crude. And so we're very hopeful that these projects do move forward in 2017, but we remain -- I'm going to remain cautious in my outlook."
