The fourth quarter and full year 2015 were really great for Valero. We operated safely and reliably, achieving our lowest ever employee injury rate in refining and reaching an annual average refinery utilization rates of 95%. The market were favorable during the quarter. Domestic product demand grew supported by a lower pulp price in sour crude discounts relative to breath were attractive to our highly complex refining system. While distillates margins were pressured during unseasonably warm weather in North America and Europe, distillates demand in Latin America remained robust. In fact, we exported record volumes of distillates and gasoline in the fourth quarter. 
We continue to execute well on our fourth quarter. In the quarter, we successfully commissioned the new Corpus Christi crude unit, the Port Arthur gas hydrocracker expansion and the McKee crude unit expansion. Our Qu√©bec city refinery also began receiving crude via Enbridge's Line 9B. We exercised our option with Plains All American to acquire 50% interest in the Diamond crude oil pipeline project. Once completed, this project will connect Cushing with Memphis and provide us with crude optionality and long-term cost savings versus sourcing crude oil from St. James. Additionally, Valero Energy Partners continues to execute its growth strategy and Valero GP's interest in VLP reached the highest splits with the distribution increase we announced earlier this week. 
We also continue to advance our refining growth strategy. Construction of the Houston crude unit remains on schedule with startup plans in the second quarter of 2016 and earlier this month, our Board of Directors approved the Houston alkylation project. This project is estimated to cost $300 million and is expected to be completed in the first half of 2019. 
And finally, regarding cash returns to stockholders. We paid out 80% of our 2015 adjusted net income, exceeding the 75% annual payout target, further demonstrating our belief in Valero's earning potential. Last week, our Board of Directors approved a 20% increase in the regular quarterly dividend to $0.60 per share or $2.40 annually. 
With that, John, I'll hand it back over to you."

Moving on to the results.

We reported fourth quarter 2015 adjusted net income from continuing operations of $862 million or $1.79 per share versus $952 million or $1.83 per share for the fourth quarter of 2014. Actual net income from continuing operations was $298 million or $0.62 per share, which compares to $1.2 billion or $2.22 per share in the fourth quarter of 2014. Please refer to the reconciliations of actual to adjusted amounts as shown in the financial tables that the company released. 
For 2015, we reported adjusted net income from continuing operations of $4.6 billion for $9.24 per share compared to $3.5 billion or $6.68 per share for 2014. Actual net income from continuing operations was $4 billion or $7.99 per share in 2015 versus $3.7 billion or $6.97 per share in 2014. Fourth quarter 2015 refining segment adjusted operating income of $1.5 billion was in line with the fourth quarter of 2014. Stronger gasoline other product margins combined with higher refining throughput volumes were offset by lower distillates and petrochemical margins and lower discounts for sweet crude oils relative to Brent crude oil. 
Refining throughput volumes averaged 2.9 million barrels per day, which was 34,000 barrels per day higher than the fourth quarter of 2014. Our refineries operated at 97% throughput capacity utilization in the fourth quarter of 2015. Refining cash operating expenses of $3.47 per barrel or $0.29 per barrel lower than the fourth quarter of 2014, largely driven by favorable property tax settlements and reserve adjustments at lower energy cost. 
The ethanol segment generated $37 million of adjusted operating income in the fourth quarter of 2015, versus $154 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, due primarily to lower gross margin per gallon driven by a decline in ethanol prices versus relatively stable corn prices. For the fourth quarter of 2015, general and administrative expenses excluding corporate depreciation were $206 million and net interest expense was $107 million. Depreciation and amortization expense was $494 million and the effective tax rate was 28% in the fourth quarter of 2015. The effective tax rate was lower than expected due primarily to a reduction in the statutory tax rate in the United Kingdom and the settlement of income tax audits in the United States. 
With respect to our balance sheet at quarter end. Total debt was $7.4 billion and cash and temporary cash investments were $4.1 billion, of which $81 million was held by VLP. Valero's debt to capitalization ratio, net of $2 billion in cash, was 20%. We have $5.6 billion of available liquidity, excluding cash. Cash flows in the fourth quarter included $732 million of capital investments, of which $164 million was for turnarounds in catalyst and $136 million was for investment in the Diamond pipeline. 
For 2015, capital investment included $1.4 billion for stay-in business and $1 billion for growth. We returned $1 billion in cash for stockholders in the fourth quarter, which included $240 million in dividend payments and $767 million for the purchase of 11.1 million shares of Valero common stock. For 2015, we purchased 44.9 million shares for $2.8 billion. 
For 2016, we maintain our guidance of $2.6 billion for capital investments, including turnarounds, catalyst, joint venture and strategic investments. This consists of approximately $1.6 billion for stay-in business and $1 billion for growth. For modeling our first quarter operations, we expect throughput volumes to fall between the following ranges: U.S. Gulf Coast at 1.61 million to 1.66 million barrels per day; U.S. Mid-Continent at 430,000 to 450,000 barrels per day; U.S. West Coast at 245,000 to 265,000 barrels per day; and North Atlantic at 465,000 to 485,000 barrels per day. We expect refining cash operating expenses in the first quarter to be approximately $3.85 per barrel. 
Our ethanol segment is expected to produce a total of 3.8 million gallons per day in the first quarter. Operating expenses should average $0.37 per gallon, which includes $0.05 per gallon for noncash costs, such as depreciation and amortization. We expect G&A expenses, excluding corporate depreciation for the first quarter, to be around $175 million and that interest expense should be about $110 million. Total depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately $470 million and our effective tax rate is expected to be around 32%.

It's not trading around 60% of Brent, which should mean that we would expect to see good medium sour and heavy sour differentials throughout the year.

We're moving a lot of products over the rags. We've seen the domestic demand for our product as well. Certainly, I think when you get this early in the year, it's kind of hard to dissect the DOE data. We've seen the large builds as well. Some of the data looks a little suspect. I think we've seen a lot of weather issues in the Gulf that our belief may have been that it's hindered some of the waterborne barrels from being able to leave due to fog and weather that we've had in the Gulf. And then Mississippi River flooding also has hindered some of the refineries along the rivers, the ability to clear those barrels as well. I think we're just too early to really do to get a good view of what demand is going to look like, but everything from us, our perspective looks good."

The retail business is materially different from the refining business and you know that. I mean, we're capital intensive and fewer people and the retail business is people intensive. And when we look at it, I think our view would generally be that we don't need to control the retail outlet to be able to be a very good supplier into that market. And so frankly, what we're focused on is further extending our wholesale business where we could have contractual relationships and support the Valero brand at the Street from the wholesale side rather than from a direct retail operation. If you reflect back on our retail volumes when we owned CST in the thousand or so sites in the sites in Canada, the volume we moved through them was about 125,000 barrels a day. And when you look at that as its order of magnitude relative to the total motor fuel that Valero's producing, it's a very small percentage. So it would take a real huge step for us to have any kind of material presence to really allow us to hedge the benefits associated with owning retail directly. So I don't know that -- unless there was really something that was just incredibly good or allowed us to sustain our contractual relationships with customers, I don't see us reentering that market in the retail business."

The fourth quarter and full year 2015 were really great for Valero. We operated safely and reliably, achieving our lowest ever employee injury rate in refining and reaching an annual average refinery utilization rate of 95%. The markets were favorable during the quarter. Domestic product demand grew supported by lower pulp prices and sour crude discounts relative to the breadth were attractive to our highly complex refining system. While distillate margins were pressured during unseasonably warm weather in North America and Europe, distillate demand in Latin America remained robust. In fact, we exported record volumes of distillate and gasoline in the fourth quarter.
We continue to execute well on our projects. In the quarter, we successfully commissioned the new Corpus Christi crude unit, the Port Arthur gas-oil hydrocracker expansion and the McKee crude unit expansion. Our Qu√©bec City refinery also began receiving crude via Enbridge's Line 9B. We exercised our option with Plains All American to acquire a 50% interest in the Diamond crude oil pipeline project. Once completed, this project will connect Cushing with Memphis and provide us with crude optionality and long-term cost savings versus sourcing crude oil from St. James. Additionally, Valero Energy Partners continues to execute its growth strategy, and Valero GP's interest in VLP reached the highest splits with the distribution increase we announced earlier this week.
We also continue to advance our refining growth strategy. Construction of the Houston crude unit remains on schedule with startup planned in the second quarter of 2016, and earlier this month, our Board of Directors approved the Houston alkylation project. This project is estimated to cost $300 million and is expected to be completed in the first half of 2019.
And finally, regarding cash returns to stockholders, we paid out 80% of our 2015 adjusted net income, exceeding the 75% annual payout target. Further demonstrating our belief in Valero's earning potential, last week, our Board of Directors approved a 20% increase in the regular quarterly dividend to $0.60 per share or $2.40 annually.
With that, John, I'll hand it back over to you."

Thank you, Joe.Moving on to the results.

Moving on to the results. We reported fourth quarter 2015 adjusted net income from continuing operations of $862 million or $1.79 per share versus $952 million or $1.83 per share for the fourth quarter of 2014. Actual net income from continuing operations was $298 million or $0.62 per share, which compares to $1.2 billion or $2.22 per share in the fourth quarter of 2014. Please refer to the reconciliations of actual to adjusted amounts as shown in the financial tables that the accompany our release.
For 2015, we reported adjusted net income from continuing operations of $4.6 billion or $9.24 per share compared to $3.5 billion or $6.68 per share for 2014. Actual net income from continuing operations was $4 billion or $7.99 per share in 2015 versus $3.7 billion or $6.97 per share in 2014. Fourth quarter 2015 refining segment adjusted operating income of $1.5 billion was in line with the fourth quarter of 2014. Stronger gasoline and other product margins combined with higher refining throughput volumes were offset by lower distillate and petrochemical margins and lower discounts for sweet crude oils relative to Brent crude oil.
Refining throughput volumes averaged 2.9 million barrels per day, which was 34,000 barrels per day higher than the fourth quarter of 2014. Our refineries operated at 97% throughput capacity utilization in the fourth quarter of 2015. Refining cash operating expenses of $3.47 per barrel or $0.29 per barrel lower than the fourth quarter of 2014, largely driven by favorable property tax settlements and reserve adjustments and lower energy cost.
The ethanol segment generated $37 million of adjusted operating income in the fourth quarter of 2015 versus $154 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, due primarily to lower gross margin per gallon driven by a decline in ethanol prices versus relatively stable corn prices. For the fourth quarter of 2015, general and administrative expenses excluding corporate depreciation were $206 million, and net interest expense was $107 million. Depreciation and amortization expense was $494 million, and the effective tax rate was 28% in the fourth quarter of 2015. The effective tax rate was lower than expected due primarily to a reduction in the statutory tax rate in the United Kingdom and the settlement of income tax audits in the United States.
With respect to our balance sheet at quarter end, total debt was $7.4 billion, and cash and temporary cash investments were $4.1 billion, of which $81 million was held by VLP. Valero's debt to capitalization ratio, net of $2 billion in cash, was 20%. We have $5.6 billion of available liquidity, excluding cash. Cash flows in the fourth quarter included $732 million of capital investments, of which $164 million was for turnaround and catalyst, and $136 million was for investment in the Diamond pipeline.
For 2015, capital investment included $1.4 billion for stay-in-business and $1 billion for growth. We returned $1 billion in cash for our stockholders in the fourth quarter, which included $240 million in dividend payments and $767 million for the purchase of 11.1 million shares of Valero common stock. For 2015, we purchased 44.9 million shares for $2.8 billion.
For 2016, we maintain our guidance of $2.6 billion for capital investments, including turnarounds, catalyst, joint venture and strategic investments. This consists of approximately $1.6 billion for stay-in-business and $1 billion for growth. For modeling our first quarter operations, we expect throughput volumes to fall between the following ranges: U.S. Gulf Coast at 1.61 million to 1.66 million barrels per day; U.S. Mid-Continent at 430,000 to 450,000 barrels per day; U.S. West Coast at 245,000 to 265,000 barrels per day; and North Atlantic at 465,000 to 485,000 barrels per day. We expect refining cash operating expenses in the first quarter to be approximately $3.85 per barrel.
Our ethanol segment is expected to produce a total of 3.8 million gallons per day in the first quarter. Operating expenses should average $0.37 per gallon, which includes $0.05 per gallon for noncash costs, such as depreciation and amortization. We expect G&A expenses, excluding corporate depreciation for the first quarter, to be around $175 million, and net interest expense should be about $110 million. Total depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately $470 million, and our effective tax rate is expected to be around 32%.
That concludes our opening remarks. [Operator Instructions]"

And certainly, the uranium production coming online will put further pressure on those differentials. I think we see several things in the market. As you know, the increase in OPEC productions put in medium sour barrels into the Gulf. You see Gulf of Mexico deepwater medium sour production rising. At the same time, we're seeing some of the light sweet production falling off here in the United States with leading to very good differentials. I think the other thing that a fundamental shift is where fuel had been trading around 80% of Brent. It's now trading around 60% of Brent, which should mean that we would expect to see good medium sour and heavy sour differentials throughout the year. I think the other thing for us, the uranium production, of course, we won't be running any of those barrels, but we do think the market rebalances and makes some additional heavy and medium grades available from us -- to us from Latin America."

As Joe mentioned, we had record volumes in the fourth quarter. We continue to see good demand for both distillate and gasoline abroad. Our rack volumes remain very strong. We're moving a lot of products over the racks. We've seen good domestic demand for our product as well. Certainly, I think when you get this early in the year, it's kind of hard to dissect the DOE data. We've seen the large builds as well. Some of the data does looks a little suspect. I think we've seen a lot of weather issues in the Gulf that our belief may have been that it's hindered some of the waterborne barrels from being able to leave due to fog and weather that we've had in the Gulf. And the Mississippi River flooding also has hindered some of the refineries along the rivers, the ability to clear those barrels as well. I think we're just too early to really get a good view of what demand's going to look like, but everything from us, our perspective looks good."

Does it make sense even though you already have a very, very strong balance sheet to maybe utilize a part of the free cash flow, maybe 20% or so, to further strengthen the balance sheet? I think that we all live through the up-and-down. While I'm bullish on the market, I could be wrong. And that we have seen what happened to everyone was bullish in 2007 and then the bottom fell off because of the economy. So should we actually take maybe a slightly different view at this point just as a safe thought to ensure that we view up some additional cushion, even though you're balance sheet is already remarkably strong?

And when we look at it, I think our view would generally be that we don't need to control the retail outlet to be able to be a very good supplier into that market. And so frankly, what we're focused on is further extending our wholesale business where we could have contractual relationships and support the Valero brand at The Street from the wholesale side rather than from a direct retail operation. If you reflect back on our retail volumes when we owned CST in the thousand or so sites in the sites in Canada, the volume we moved through them was about 125,000 barrels a day. And when you look at that as its order of magnitude relative to the total motor fuels that Valero's producing, it's a very small percentage. So it would take a real huge step for us to have any kind of material presence to really allow us to hedge the benefits associated with owning retail directly. So I don't know that -- unless there was really something that was just incredibly good or allowed us to sustain our contractual relationships with customers, I don't see us reentering that market in the retail business."

The fourth quarter and full year 2015 were really great for Valero. We operated safely and reliably, achieving our lowest ever employee injury rate in refining and reaching an annual average refinery utilization rate of 95%. The markets were favorable during the quarter. Domestic product demand grew supported by lower pump prices and sour crude discounts relative to the Brent were attractive to our highly complex refining system. While distillate margins were pressured during unseasonably warm weather in North America and Europe, distillate demand in Latin America remained robust. In fact, we exported record volumes of distillate and gasoline in the fourth quarter.
We continue to execute well on our projects. In the quarter we successfully commissioned the new Corpus Christi crude unit, the Port Arthur gas-oil hydrocracker expansion and the McKee crude unit expansion. Our Qu√©bec City refinery also began receiving crude via Enbridge's Line 9B. We exercised our option with Plains All American to acquire a 50% interest in the Diamond crude oil pipeline project. Once completed, this project will connect Cushing with Memphis and provide us with crude optionality and long-term cost savings versus sourcing crude oil from St. James. 
Additionally, Valero Energy Partners continues to execute its growth strategy, and Valero GP's interest in VLP reached the high splits with the distribution increase we announced earlier this week.
We also continue to advance our refining growth strategy. Construction of the Houston crude unit remains on schedule with startup planned in the second quarter of 2016. And earlier this month our Board of Directors approved the Houston alkylation project. This project is estimated to cost $300 million and is expected to be completed in the first half of 2019.
And finally, regarding cash returns to stockholders, we paid out 80% of our 2015 adjusted net income, exceeding the 75% annual payout target. Further demonstrating our belief in Valero's earnings potential, last week our Board of Directors approved a 20% increase in the regular quarterly dividend to $0.60 per share or $2.40 annually.
With that, John, I'll hand it back over to you."

Moving on to the results. We reported fourth quarter 2015 adjusted net income from continuing operations of $862 million or $1.79 per share versus $952 million or $1.83 per share for the fourth quarter of 2014. Actual net income from continuing operations was $298 million or $0.62 per share, which compares to $1.2 billion or $2.22 per share in the fourth quarter of 2014. Please refer to the reconciliations of actual to adjusted amounts as shown in the financial tables that accompany our release.
For 2015, we reported adjusted net income from continuing operations of $4.6 billion or $9.24 per share compared to $3.5 billion or $6.68 per share for 2014. Actual net income from continuing operations was $4 billion or $7.99 per share in 2015 versus $3.7 billion or $6.97 per share in 2014. 
Fourth quarter 2015 refining segment adjusted operating income of $1.5 billion was in line with the fourth quarter of 2014. Stronger gasoline and other product margins combined with higher refining throughput volumes were offset by lower distillate and petrochemical margins and lower discounts for sweet crude oils relative to Brent crude oil.
Refining throughput volumes averaged 2.9 million barrels per day, which was 34,000 barrels per day higher than the fourth quarter of 2014. Our refineries operated at 97% throughput capacity utilization in the fourth quarter of 2015. Refining cash operating expenses of $3.47 per barrel or $0.29 per barrel lower than the fourth quarter of 2014, largely driven by favorable property tax settlements and reserve adjustments and lower energy cost.
The ethanol segment generated $37 million of adjusted operating income in the fourth quarter of 2015 versus $154 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, due primarily to lower gross margin per gallon driven by a decline in ethanol prices versus relatively stable corn prices. 
For the fourth quarter of 2015, general and administrative expenses excluding corporate depreciation were $206 million, and net interest expense was $107 million. Depreciation and amortization expense was $494 million, and the effective tax rate was 28% in the fourth quarter of 2015. The effective tax rate was lower than expected due primarily to a reduction in the statutory tax rate in the United Kingdom and the settlement of income tax audits in the United States.
With respect to our balance sheet at quarter end, total debt was $7.4 billion, and cash and temporary cash investments were $4.1 billion, of which $81 million was held by VLP. Valero's debt to capitalization ratio, net of $2 billion in cash, was 20%. We have $5.6 billion of available liquidity, excluding cash. Cash flows in the fourth quarter included $732 million of capital investments, of which $164 million was for turnaround and catalyst, and $136 million was for investment in the Diamond pipeline.
For 2015, capital investment included $1.4 billion for stay-in-business and $1 billion for growth. We returned $1 billion in cash to our stockholders in the fourth quarter, which included $240 million in dividend payments and $767 million for the purchase of 11.1 million shares of Valero common stock. For 2015, we purchased 44.9 million shares for $2.8 billion.
For 2016, we maintain our guidance of $2.6 billion for capital investments, including turnarounds, catalyst, joint venture and strategic investments. This consists of approximately $1.6 billion for stay-in-business and $1 billion for growth. For modeling our first quarter operations, we expect throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges: U.S. Gulf Coast at 1.61 million to 1.66 million barrels per day; U.S. Mid-Continent at 430,000 to 450,000 barrels per day; U.S. West Coast at 245,000 to 265,000 barrels per day; and North Atlantic at 465,000 to 485,000 barrels per day. We expect refining cash operating expenses in the first quarter to be approximately $3.85 per barrel.
Our ethanol segment is expected to produce a total of 3.8 million gallons per day in the first quarter. Operating expenses should average $0.37 per gallon, which includes $0.05 per gallon for noncash costs such as depreciation and amortization. We expect G&A expenses, excluding corporate depreciation for the first quarter, to be around $175 million, and net interest expense should be about $110 million. Total depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately $470 million, and our effective tax rate is expected to be around 32%.
That concludes our opening remarks. [Operator Instructions]"

Overall, yes, we've seen very good spreads between the medium sours and light and heavy sours as well. And certainly the Iranian production coming online will put further pressure on those differentials. I think we see several things in the market. As you know, the increase in OPEC productions put medium sour barrels into the Gulf. You see Gulf of Mexico deepwater medium sour production rising. At the same time we're seeing some of the light sweet production falling off here in the United States, leading to very good differentials. 
I think the other thing that's a fundamental shift is, where fuel had been trading around 80% of Brent, it's now trading around 60% of Brent, which should mean that we would expect to see good medium sour and heavy sour differentials throughout the year. I think the other thing for us, the Iranian production, of course we won't be running any of those barrels, but we do think the market rebalances and makes some additional heavy and medium grades available from us -- to us from Latin America."

We're moving a lot of product over the racks. We've seen good domestic demand for our product as well. 
Certainly I think when you get this early in the year it's kind of hard to dissect the DOE data. We've seen the large builds as well. Some of the data does looks a little suspect. I think we've seen a lot of weather issues in the Gulf that our belief may have been that it hindered some of the waterborne barrels from being able to leave due to fog and weather that we've had in the Gulf. And the Mississippi River flooding also has hindered some of the refineries along the rivers, the ability to clear those barrels as well. I think we're just too early to really get a good view of what demand's going to look like, but everything from us, our perspective looks good."

Does it make sense, even though you already have a very, very strong balance sheet, to maybe utilize part of the free cash flow, maybe 20% or so, to further strengthen the balance sheet? 
I think that we all live through the up and down. While I'm bullish on the market, I could be wrong. And that we have seen what happened to everyone was bullish in 2007 and then the bottom fell off because of the economy. So should we actually take maybe a slightly different view at this point just as a safe thought to ensure that we build up some additional cushion, even though your balance sheet is already remarkably strong?

And when we look at it, I think our view would generally be that we don't need to control the retail outlet to be able to be a very good supplier into that market. And so frankly, what we're focused on is further extending our wholesale business where we could have contractual relationships and support the Valero brand at the street from the wholesale side rather than from a direct retail operation. 
If you reflect back on our retail volumes when we owned CST in the thousand or so sites, in the sites in Canada, the volume we moved through them was about 125,000 barrels a day. And when you look at that as its order of magnitude relative to the total motor fuels that Valero's producing, it's a very small percentage. So it would take a real huge step for us to have any kind of material presence to really allow us to hedge the benefits associated with owning retail directly. So I don't know that -- unless there was really something that was just incredibly good or allowed us to sustain our contractual relationships with customers, I don't see us reentering that market in the retail business."

The capital that we're investing in logistics assets at Valero Energy are assets that can't be dropped to VLP. So we'll continue to build the droppable EBITDA base. But the motivation behind it, and we've shared this before, the motivation behind Valero investing in logistics assets are projects that benefit Valero's core business, its core refining business. They're projects that help us optimize our operations. And we're not taking flyers on projects that we wouldn't be willing to commit contractually long term to. 
And so again, the things we're investing in today, for example the Diamond pipeline, I mean, that is going to be a direct benefit to the Memphis refinery and provide crude optionality there that they don't currently have today. So this is a -- it's a long game. And even though markets are challenged right now, I don't think we should sit here and throw the baby out with the bath water and totally redirect strategies to try to accommodate it. 
The other thing that Mike hasn't mentioned is that VLP is in a great position. They've got very high coverage ratios. To maintain distribution growth at the targets we've talked about is not going to be an issue. And here again, we're running the business to continue to improve the business and drive EPS growth at VLO, and VLP is going to go along for the ride. So anyway, that's just a little more color."

So certainly I invite you to follow-up with Karen and John after the call. But some high-level things I can tell intro-mac volume, there really was a negative impact on volume variance for our refineries. Actually, we would show that the volume variance was slightly positive for the quarter. So what you're seeing on the capture rate is all market driven. On a high level, there's a few things I would point to that higher cost RIN certainly had an impact on our capture rates. The butane differential, the gasoline was much more narrow in the first quarter than what we saw last year. That had an impact on our capture rates. In the North Atlantic Basin, when you look at our crude costs relative to Brent, the narrow Brent and WTI impact on our crude costs most importantly, in Qu√©bec. Also the Western Canadian crude, the Syncrude were more expensive in the first course. So the volumes coming of Line 9. So we had crude cost impact to our North Atlantic Basin system. And the only thing that really operationally we have the cut down on the West Coast for a planned turnaround. So our capture rates there were down a little bit as well but those are some of the real key factors."

You know Paul, M&A is something that we have in our capital allocation framework for the last 2 years and that really hasn't changed. Now it seems like you and your peers are the ones that are interested in that perhaps more than we are. But we look at our approach of trying to drive EPS growth over the next 3 to 5 years, it's really multifaceted and includes growth investments in refining and midstream. We also look at M&A, and we look at share repurchases. And we've got a really good pipeline of refining projects that are underdeveloped or are under development. Now we don't want to get out over our skis, so we don't really discuss the specifics on these projects that are in development until we've gone further down the approval process. But we do have a bunch of great projects that exceeded the 25% IRR hurdle rate that we've talked about and we'll try to do as many of those projects as we find. Midstream investments are of interest. They got a lower hurdle rate as you would expect, but they'll drive earnings growth through optimization. So these are critical to us also. Then when we look at the discretionary uses of cash, M&A fits into that category for us. And really what I just want to communicate on that is the assets that we would look at there, Paul, will be those that create synergy and will be accretive to the company. We've got a great portfolio today, and we do have that tension between the used, the discretionary use of cash via this framework that we put in place. And we're not going to do an acquisition and that's why you consider we haven't pulled the trigger. We're not going to do an acquisition if we believe that it's more accretive to do a share repurchase. So anyway, returning cash to shareholders hasn't lost its priority at all from our perspective. It's just we are looking at that growth projects and M&A as a competitive use of funds. So with that, Gary, you want to answer it. . ."

The first quarter presented us with challenging markets, with gasoline and diesel margins under pressure for most of the quarter.

The first quarter presented us with challenging markets, with gasoline and diesel margins under pressure for most of the quarter. A bright spot was the performance of our team as we continue to operate safely and reliably. 
What I'd like to do this morning is take a few minutes to discuss our strategic initiatives that we believe will continue to drive long-term value creation and then share some color on what we're seeing in the markets. 
First, is the core of everything we do, is the relentless focus on safety and reliability. Our dedication and persistence here is what keeps our people and communities safe, our operations reliable, our cash operating costs lowest among the peer group. Having low-cost operations is a major advantage in our industry where product margins can be quite volatile. As a disciplined operator, we are able to run profitably in a lower margin environment as experienced in the first quarter. 
Second, we apply discipline and rigor as we evaluate and execute investments that will grow the profitability and competitiveness of our business for many years. The strategic plan that was approved by our Board of Directors last year included $2.6 billion of capital spending for 2016, approximately $1 billion was allocated to strategic investments to drive long-term earnings growth. 
Third, we're committed to delivering value to stockholders by making the right investments in our business and returning cash to our stockholders. We demonstrated this in 2015 when we delivered the highest total stockholder return among our peers for both Valero and VLP. We expect VLP to continue to be well positioned to execute its distribution growth strategy through 2017 despite volatile capital markets. 
We also continued to keep an eye on M&A. We review opportunities, and we have a list of targets that we consistently monitor. We consider M&A a discretionary use of cash, so there's a healthy tension when evaluating M&A opportunities versus other alternative uses. Of course, we can't comment specifically on M&A but we are diligently reviewing opportunities. 
For cash returns in 2016, which is made up of dividends and buybacks, we've extended our 2015 payout target of 75% of net income. In January, we increased the quarterly dividend by 20% to $0.60 a share and we remain focused on maintaining a dividend payout at the high end of our peer group. We're confident in Valero's ability to fund investments in future growth and to meet its payout target. Lastly, let me sure some color on the current market. Already this year, we've been in a lot of conversations about various market topics, including gasoline demand resurgence, strength, diesel length, domestic crude supply and crude storage levels. As you know, markets for Valero's feedstocks and products are dynamic. Our high complexity refineries, system flexibility, advantage locations and low cash cost operations enable us to maximize earnings under challenging market conditions. 
On the crude supply side, we're seeing more medial sour crude coming into the market. As a result, we're seeing healthy medium and heavy sour crude discounts. We also have greater access to domestic sweet crudes with the logistics build out in the U.S. allowing domestic production to clear the Mid-Continent region that reach large Gulf Coast refining center. 
On the demand side, continued GDP growth in the product prices should continue to support demand. In the U.S., we've seen gasoline demand continue to growth. We've encouraged by increased vehicle miles traveled and double-digit percentage increases in SUV and truck purchases in the U.S. and key countries around the globe. This commitment nobody was good albeit in the U.S., it's been fairly flat. While distillate margins were pressured near term due to unseasonably warm weather in North America and Europe, distillate demand in Latin America remains robust. 
Overall, we still have structural refine product supply challenges in South America and in developing countries, which we don't expect to be resolved in the near-term. With our low-cost Gulf Coast refining presence, we have the ability to compete in markets all over the globe, we also have the opportunity to optimize our system and supply, the Atlantic Basin with our refineries and wealth in Qu√©bec city. In fact, we generated another quarter of solid distillates and gasoline export volumes. 
In summary, we still have significant crude supply from ample natural gas availability and growing global petroleum demand that's outpacing refining capacity additions. We don't see this changing anytime soon. So although the markets will be challenging at times, the longer-term macro outlook remains favorable. 
So with that, John, I'll hand the call back to you."

Moving on to the results. Net income was $495 million or $1.05 per share for the first quarter of 2016. Excluding an after-tax, lower cost of market inventory valuation benefit of $212 million or $0.45 per share, we recorded first quarter",876,"Thank you, Joe. Moving on to the results. Net income was $495 million or $1.05 per share for the first quarter of 2016. Excluding an after-tax, lower cost of market inventory valuation benefit of $212 million or $0.45 per share, we recorded first quarter 2016 adjusted net income of $283 million or $0.60 per share. This compares to $964 million for $1.87 per share for the first quarter of 2015. For reconciliations of actual to adjusted amounts, please refer to Page 6 of the financial tables that accompany our release. 
Adjusted operating income for the refining segment in the first quarter of 2016 was $695 million or $946 million lower than in the first quarter of 2015. Margins were pressured downward primarily due to weaker distillate margins given high refinery run rates across the industry, product inventory builds and unseasonably warm weather. Other headwinds on refining margins included narrower domestic light sweet crude oil discount versus the Brent benchmark, low fuel oil and petrochemical product margins and elevated costs for RINs credits. 
Low crude oil prices continue to travel slowdowns in North America on drilling and production, which coupled with in excess of pipeline take a we capacity in the Mid-Continent region, led to tighter discounts for crude oil relative to Brent. Lower energy cost supported by robust North American natural gas production partly offset these factors. 
Our refineries operated at 96% throughput capacity utilization in the first quarter of 2016 and throughput volumes average 2.9 million barrels per day, which was 169,000 barrels per day higher than in the first quarter of 2015. 
Refining cash operating expenses of $3.55 per barrel were $0.40 per barrel lower than in the first quarter of 2015 mostly due to higher throughput volumes and lower energy costs. 
In the ethanol segment earned $9 million of adjusted operating income in the first quarter of 2016 compared to $12 million in the first quarter of 2015. The low crude oil and gasoline price environment challenged ethanol margins but with the recent recovery in prices, ethanol margins had modestly improved to start the second quarter. 
For the first quarter of 2016, general and administrative expenses, excluding corporate depreciation were $156 million, net interest expense was $108 million. 
Depreciation and amortization expense was $485 million and the effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2016 was 30%. The effective tax rate was lower than the first quarter of 2015, primarily due to higher relative earnings contribution from international operations with lower statutory tax rates. 
Regarding our balance sheet, at quarter-end, we had $7.3 billion of total debt and $3.8 billion of cash and temporary cash investments, of which $102 million was held by VLP. Valero's debt-to-capitalization ratio net of $2 billion in cash was 20%. We had $5.5 billion of available liquidity, excluding cash, of which $575 million was only available to VLP. 
Cash flows in the first quarter included $479 million of capital investments, of which $161 million was for turnarounds and catalyst. For 2016, we expect to invest $1.6 billion of capital to sustain the business and $1 billion for refining asset optimization and logistics to drive long-term earnings growth. 
With respect to our refining growth strategy, the new Corpus Christi crude unit, which was completed late last year operated as planned and delivered approximately $35 million of EBITDA in the first quarter. 
We completed the St. Charles hydrocracker expansion in March and the new Houston crude unit is on track to start up in the second quarter. The Houston alkylation project, which was approved in January is now undergoing detailed engineering and procurement. Completion of the alkylation unit is expected on the first half of 2019. 
Now moving to  financing activities. We returned $547 million in cash to our stockholders in the first quarter, which included $282 million in dividend payments and $265 million for the repurchase of 3.8 million shares of Valero common stock. We had $1.1 billion of remaining share repurchase authorization as of March 31, 2016. Our regular quarterly cash dividend is now $0.60 per share. 
We continue to target a payout of 75% of annual net income for 2016. For modeling our second quarter operations, we expect throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges: Gulf Coast at 1.59 million to 1.64 million barrels per day; Mid-Continent at 430,000 to 450,000 barrels per day; West Coast at 260,000 to 280,000 barrels per day; and North Atlantic at 450,000 to 470,000 barrels per day. 
Refining cash operating expenses are estimated at approximately $3.75 per barrel for the second quarter. Based on today's market prices, we expect costs relating to meeting our biofuel blending obligations to be between $750 million and $850 million for 2015. This is primarily related to RINs in the U.S. The ethanol segment is expected to produce a total of 3.8 million gallons per day. 
Operating expenses should average $0.37 per gallon, which includes $0.05 per gallon for depreciation and amortization. G&A expenses for the second quarter, excluding corporate depreciation are expected to be approximately $165 million and net interest expense should be about $110 million. Total depreciation and amortization expense is estimated at $465 million and our effective tax rate is expected to be 31%. This concludes our opening remarks. [Operator Instructions]"

The cost of issuing debt or equity, however, remains more expensive than historical level. The good news is that VLP is well positioned, with strong distribution company -- distribution coverage and does not need access the capital markets and is price environment. Therefore, we are going to revised our drop-down guidance to $500 million $750 million. We could execute drabs in this range without going to capital market.

So certainly I invite you to follow-up with Karen and John after the call. But some high-level things I can tell intro-mac volume, there really was a negative impact on volume variance for our refineries. Actually, we would show that the volume variance was slightly positive for the quarter. So what you're seeing on the capture rate is all market driven. On a high level, there's a few things I would point to that higher cost RIN certainly had an impact on our capture rates. The butane differential, the gasoline was much more narrow in the first quarter than what we saw last year. That had an impact on our capture rates. In the North Atlantic Basin, when you look at our crude costs relative to Brent, the narrow Brent and WTI impact on our crude costs most importantly, in Qu√©bec. Also the Western Canadian crude, the Syncrude were more expensive in the first course. So the volumes coming of Line 9. So we had crude cost impact to our North Atlantic Basin system. And the only thing that really operationally we have the cut down on the West Coast for a planned turnaround. So our capture rates there were down a little bit as well but those are some of the real key factors."

You know Paul, M&A is something that we have in our capital allocation framework for the last 2 years and that really hasn't changed. Now it seems like you and your peers are the ones that are interested in that perhaps more than we are. But we look at our approach of trying to drive EPS growth over the next 3 to 5 years, it's really multifaceted and includes growth investments in refining and midstream. We also look at M&A, and we look at share repurchases. And we've got a really good pipeline of refining projects that are underdeveloped or are under development. Now we don't want to get out over our skis, so we don't really discuss the specifics on these projects that are in development until we've gone further down the approval process. But we do have a bunch of great projects that exceeded the 25% IRR hurdle rate that we've talked about and we'll try to do as many of those projects as we find. Midstream investments are of interest. They got a lower hurdle rate as you would expect, but they'll drive earnings growth through optimization. So these are critical to us also. Then when we look at the discretionary uses of cash, M&A fits into that category for us. And really what I just want to communicate on that is the assets that we would look at there, Paul, will be those that create synergy and will be accretive to the company. We've got a great portfolio today, and we do have that tension between the used, the discretionary use of cash via this framework that we put in place. And we're not going to do an acquisition and that's why you consider we haven't pulled the trigger. We're not going to do an acquisition if we believe that it's more accretive to do a share repurchase. So anyway, returning cash to shareholders hasn't lost its priority at all from our perspective. It's just we are looking at that growth projects and M&A as a competitive use of funds. So with that, Gary, you want to answer it. . ."

The first quarter presented us with challenging markets, with gasoline and diesel margins under pressure for most of the quarter. A bright spot was the performance of our team as we continue to operate safel",768,"Well, thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. The first quarter presented us with challenging markets, with gasoline and diesel margins under pressure for most of the quarter. A bright spot was the performance of our team as we continue to operate safely and reliably. 
What I'd like to do this morning is take a few minutes to discuss our strategic initiatives that we believe will continue to drive long-term value creation and then share some color on what we're seeing in the markets. 
First, is the core of everything we do, is the relentless focus on safety and reliability. Our dedication and persistence here is what keeps our people and communities safe, our operations reliable, our cash operating costs lowest among the peer group. Having low-cost operations is a major advantage in our industry where product margins can be quite volatile. As a disciplined operator, we are able to run profitably in a lower margin environment as experienced in the first quarter. 
Second, we apply discipline and rigor as we evaluate and execute investments that will grow the profitability and competitiveness of our business for many years. The strategic plan that was approved by our Board of Directors last year included $2.6 billion of capital spending for 2016, approximately $1 billion was allocated to strategic investments to drive long-term earnings growth. 
Third, we're committed to delivering value to stockholders by making the right investments in our business and returning cash to our stockholders. We demonstrated this in 2015 when we delivered the highest total stockholder return among our peers for both Valero and VLP. We expect VLP to continue to be well positioned to execute its distribution growth strategy through 2017 despite volatile capital markets. 
We also continued to keep an eye on M&A. We review opportunities, and we have a list of targets that we consistently monitor. We consider M&A a discretionary use of cash, so there's a healthy tension when evaluating M&A opportunities versus other alternative uses. Of course, we can't comment specifically on M&A but we are diligently reviewing opportunities. 
For cash returns in 2016, which is made up of dividends and buybacks, we've extended our 2015 payout target of 75% of net income. In January, we increased the quarterly dividend by 20% to $0.60 a share and we remain focused on maintaining a dividend payout at the high end of our peer group. We're confident in Valero's ability to fund investments in future growth and to meet its payout target. Lastly, let me sure some color on the current market. Already this year, we've been in a lot of conversations about various market topics, including gasoline demand resurgence, strength, diesel length, domestic crude supply and crude storage levels. As you know, markets for Valero's feedstocks and products are dynamic. Our high complexity refineries, system flexibility, advantage locations and low cash cost operations enable us to maximize earnings under challenging market conditions. 
On the crude supply side, we're seeing more medial sour crude coming into the market. As a result, we're seeing healthy medium and heavy sour crude discounts. We also have greater access to domestic sweet crudes with the logistics build out in the U.S. allowing domestic production to clear the Mid-Continent region that reach large Gulf Coast refining center. 
On the demand side, continued GDP growth in the product prices should continue to support demand. In the U.S., we've seen gasoline demand continue to growth. We've encouraged by increased vehicle miles traveled and double-digit percentage increases in SUV and truck purchases in the U.S. and key countries around the globe. This commitment nobody was good albeit in the U.S., it's been fairly flat. While distillate margins were pressured near term due to unseasonably warm weather in North America and Europe, distillate demand in Latin America remains robust. 
Overall, we still have structural refine product supply challenges in South America and in developing countries, which we don't expect to be resolved in the near-term. With our low-cost Gulf Coast refining presence, we have the ability to compete in markets all over the globe, we also have the opportunity to optimize our system and supply, the Atlantic Basin with our refineries and wealth in Qu√©bec city. In fact, we generated another quarter of solid distillates and gasoline export volumes. 
In summary, we still have significant crude supply from ample natural gas availability and growing global petroleum demand that's outpacing refining capacity additions. We don't see this changing anytime soon. So although the markets will be challenging at times, the longer-term macro outlook remains favorable. 
So with that, John, I'll hand the call back to you."

Moving on to the results. Net income was $495 million or $1.05 per share for the first quarter of 2016. Excluding an after-tax, lower cost of market inventory valuation benefit of $212 million or $0.45 per share, we recorded first quarter",876,"Thank you, Joe. Moving on to the results. Net income was $495 million or $1.05 per share for the first quarter of 2016. Excluding an after-tax, lower cost of market inventory valuation benefit of $212 million or $0.45 per share, we recorded first quarter 2016 adjusted net income of $283 million or $0.60 per share. This compares to $964 million for $1.87 per share for the first quarter of 2015. For reconciliations of actual to adjusted amounts, please refer to Page 6 of the financial tables that accompany our release. 
Adjusted operating income for the refining segment in the first quarter of 2016 was $695 million or $946 million lower than in the first quarter of 2015. Margins were pressured downward primarily due to weaker distillate margins given high refinery run rates across the industry, product inventory builds and unseasonably warm weather. Other headwinds on refining margins included narrower domestic light sweet crude oil discount versus the Brent benchmark, low fuel oil and petrochemical product margins and elevated costs for RINs credits. 
Low crude oil prices continue to travel slowdowns in North America on drilling and production, which coupled with in excess of pipeline take a we capacity in the Mid-Continent region, led to tighter discounts for crude oil relative to Brent. Lower energy cost supported by robust North American natural gas production partly offset these factors. 
Our refineries operated at 96% throughput capacity utilization in the first quarter of 2016 and throughput volumes average 2.9 million barrels per day, which was 169,000 barrels per day higher than in the first quarter of 2015. 
Refining cash operating expenses of $3.55 per barrel were $0.40 per barrel lower than in the first quarter of 2015 mostly due to higher throughput volumes and lower energy costs. 
In the ethanol segment earned $9 million of adjusted operating income in the first quarter of 2016 compared to $12 million in the first quarter of 2015. The low crude oil and gasoline price environment challenged ethanol margins but with the recent recovery in prices, ethanol margins had modestly improved to start the second quarter. 
For the first quarter of 2016, general and administrative expenses, excluding corporate depreciation were $156 million, net interest expense was $108 million. 
Depreciation and amortization expense was $485 million and the effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2016 was 30%. The effective tax rate was lower than the first quarter of 2015, primarily due to higher relative earnings contribution from international operations with lower statutory tax rates. 
Regarding our balance sheet, at quarter-end, we had $7.3 billion of total debt and $3.8 billion of cash and temporary cash investments, of which $102 million was held by VLP. Valero's debt-to-capitalization ratio net of $2 billion in cash was 20%. We had $5.5 billion of available liquidity, excluding cash, of which $575 million was only available to VLP. 
Cash flows in the first quarter included $479 million of capital investments, of which $161 million was for turnarounds and catalyst. For 2016, we expect to invest $1.6 billion of capital to sustain the business and $1 billion for refining asset optimization and logistics to drive long-term earnings growth. 
With respect to our refining growth strategy, the new Corpus Christi crude unit, which was completed late last year operated as planned and delivered approximately $35 million of EBITDA in the first quarter. 
We completed the St. Charles hydrocracker expansion in March and the new Houston crude unit is on track to start up in the second quarter. The Houston alkylation project, which was approved in January is now undergoing detailed engineering and procurement. Completion of the alkylation unit is expected on the first half of 2019. 
Now moving to  financing activities. We returned $547 million in cash to our stockholders in the first quarter, which included $282 million in dividend payments and $265 million for the repurchase of 3.8 million shares of Valero common stock. We had $1.1 billion of remaining share repurchase authorization as of March 31, 2016. Our regular quarterly cash dividend is now $0.60 per share. 
We continue to target a payout of 75% of annual net income for 2016. For modeling our second quarter operations, we expect throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges: Gulf Coast at 1.59 million to 1.64 million barrels per day; Mid-Continent at 430,000 to 450,000 barrels per day; West Coast at 260,000 to 280,000 barrels per day; and North Atlantic at 450,000 to 470,000 barrels per day. 
Refining cash operating expenses are estimated at approximately $3.75 per barrel for the second quarter. Based on today's market prices, we expect costs relating to meeting our biofuel blending obligations to be between $750 million and $850 million for 2015. This is primarily related to RINs in the U.S. The ethanol segment is expected to produce a total of 3.8 million gallons per day. 
Operating expenses should average $0.37 per gallon, which includes $0.05 per gallon for depreciation and amortization. G&A expenses for the second quarter, excluding corporate depreciation are expected to be approximately $165 million and net interest expense should be about $110 million. Total depreciation and amortization expense is estimated at $465 million and our effective tax rate is expected to be 31%. This concludes our opening remarks. [Operator Instructions]"

The cost of issuing debt or equity, however, remains more expensive than historical level. The good news is that VLP is well positioned, with strong distribution company -- distribution coverage and does not need access the capital markets and is price environment. Therefore, we are going to revised our drop-down guidance to $500 million $750 million. We could execute drabs in this range without going to capital market.

But some high-level things I can tell intro-mac volume, there really was a negative impact on volume variance for our refineries. Actually, we would show that the volume variance was slightly positive for the quarter. So what you're seeing on the capture rate is all market driven. On a high level, there's a few things I would point to that higher cost RIN certainly had an impact on our capture rates. The butane differential, the gasoline was much more narrow in the first quarter than what we saw last year. That had an impact on our capture rates. In the North Atlantic Basin, when you look at our crude costs relative to Brent, the narrow Brent and WTI impact on our crude costs most importantly, in Qu√©bec. Also the Western Canadian crude, the Syncrude were more expensive in the first course. So the volumes coming of Line 9. So we had crude cost impact to our North Atlantic Basin system. And the only thing that really operationally we have the cut down on the West Coast for a planned turnaround. So our capture rates there were down a little bit as well but those are some of the real key factors."

You know Paul, M&A is something that we have in our capital allocation framework for the last 2 years and that really hasn't changed. Now it seems like you and your peers are the ones that are interested in that perhaps more than we are. But we look at our approach of trying to drive EPS growth over the next 3 to 5 years, it's really multifaceted and includes growth investments in refining and midstream. We also look at M&A, and we look at share repurchases. And we've got a really good pipeline of refining projects that are underdeveloped or are under development. Now we don't want to get out over our skis, so we don't really discuss the specifics on these projects that are in development until we've gone further down the approval process. But we do have a bunch of great projects that exceeded the 25% IRR hurdle rate that we've talked about and we'll try to do as many of those projects as we find. Midstream investments are of interest. They got a lower hurdle rate as you would expect, but they'll drive earnings growth through optimization. So these are critical to us also. Then when we look at the discretionary uses of cash, M&A fits into that category for us. And really what I just want to communicate on that is the assets that we would look at there, Paul, will be those that create synergy and will be accretive to the company. We've got a great portfolio today, and we do have that tension between the used, the discretionary use of cash via this framework that we put in place. And we're not going to do an acquisition and that's why you consider we haven't pulled the trigger. We're not going to do an acquisition if we believe that it's more accretive to do a share repurchase. So anyway, returning cash to shareholders hasn't lost its priority at all from our perspective. It's just we are looking at that growth projects and M&A as a competitive use of funds. So with that, Gary, you want to answer it. . ."

The first quarter presented us with challenging markets with gasoline and diesel margins under pressure for most of the quarter. The bright spot was the performance of our team, as we continue to operate saf",770,"Well, thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. The first quarter presented us with challenging markets with gasoline and diesel margins under pressure for most of the quarter. The bright spot was the performance of our team, as we continue to operate safely and reliably. 
What I'd like to do this morning is take a few minutes to discuss our strategic initiatives that we believe will continue to drive long-term value creation and then share some color on what we're seeing in the markets. 
First is the core of everything we do, is the relentless focus on safety and reliability. Our dedication and persistence here is what keeps our people and communities safe, our operations reliable, our cash operating costs the lowest among the peer group. Having low-cost operations is a major advantage in our industry where product margins can be quite volatile. As a disciplined operator, we are able to run profitably in a lower margin environment as experienced in the first quarter. 
Second, we apply discipline and rigor as we evaluate and execute investments that will grow the profitability and competitiveness of our business for many years. The strategic plan that was approved by our Board of Directors last year included $2.6 billion of capital spending for 2016, approximately $1 billion was allocated to strategic investments to drive long-term earnings growth. 
Third, we're committed to delivering value to stockholders by making the right investments in our business and returning cash to our stockholders. We demonstrated this in 2015 when we delivered the highest total stockholder return among our peers for both Valero and VLP. We expect VLP to continue to be well positioned to execute its distribution growth strategy through 2017 despite volatile capital markets. 
We also continued to keep an eye on M&A. We review opportunities, and we have a list of targets that we consistently monitor. We consider M&A a discretionary use of cash, so there's a healthy tension when evaluating M&A opportunities versus other alternative uses. Of course, we can't comment specifically on M&A, but we are diligently reviewing opportunities. 
For cash returns in 2016, which is made up of dividends and buybacks, we've extended our 2015 payout target of 75% of net income. In January, we increased the quarterly dividend by 20% to $0.60 a share, and we remain focused on maintaining a dividend payout at the high end of our peer group. We're confident in Valero's ability to fund investments in future growth and to meet its payout target. 
Lastly, let me sure some color on the current market. Already this year, we've been in a lot of conversations about various market topics, including gasoline demand resurgence, octane strength, diesel length, domestic crude supply and crude storage levels. As you know, markets for Valero's feedstocks and products are dynamic. Our high complexity refineries, system flexibility, advantage locations and low cash cost operations enable us to maximize earnings under challenging market conditions. 
On the crude supply side, we're seeing more medium sour crudes coming into the market. As a result, we're seeing healthy medium and heavy sour crude discounts. We also have greater access to domestic sweet crudes with the logistics buildup in the U.S. allowing domestic production to clear the Mid-Continent region and reach the large Gulf Coast refining center. 
On the demand side, continued GDP growth and low product prices should continue to support demand. In the U.S., we've seen gasoline demand continue to grow. We're encouraged by increased vehicle miles traveled and double-digit percentage increases in SUV and truck purchases in the U.S. and key countries around the globe. 
Distillate demand globally was good, albeit in the U.S., it's been fairly flat. While distillate margins were pressured near term due to unseasonably warm weather in North America and Europe, distillate demand in Latin America remains robust. 
Overall, we still have structural refine product supply challenges in South America and in developing countries, which we don't expect to be resolved in the near term. With our low-cost Gulf Coast refining presence, we have the ability to compete in markets all over the globe. We also have the opportunity to optimize our system and supply, the Atlantic Basin with our refineries in Wales in Qu√©bec City. In fact, we generated another quarter of solid distillate and gasoline export volumes. 
In summary, we still have significant crude supply, ample natural gas availability and growing global petroleum demand that's outpacing refining capacity additions. We don't see this changing anytime soon. So although the markets will be challenging at times, the longer-term macro outlook remains favorable. 
So with that, John, I'll hand the call back to you."

Moving on to the results. Net income was $495 million or $1.05 per share for the first quarter of 2016. Excluding an after-tax, lower of cost or market inventory valuation benefit of $212 million or $0.45 per share, we recorded first quart",873,"Thank you, Joe. Moving on to the results. Net income was $495 million or $1.05 per share for the first quarter of 2016. Excluding an after-tax, lower of cost or market inventory valuation benefit of $212 million or $0.45 per share, we recorded first quarter 2016 adjusted net income of $283 million or $0.60 per share. This compares to $964 million or $1.87 per share for the first quarter of 2015. For reconciliations of actual to adjusted amounts, please refer to Page 6 of the financial tables that accompany our release. 
Adjusted operating income for the refining segment in the first quarter of 2016 was $695 million or $946 million lower than in the first quarter of 2015. Margins were pressured downward primarily due to weaker distillate margins given high refinery run rates across the industry, product inventory builds and unseasonably warm weather. Other headwinds on refining margins included narrower domestic light sweet crude oil discount versus the Brent benchmark, low fuel oil and petrochemical product margins and elevated costs for RINs credits. 
Low crude oil prices continue to drive slowdowns in North American drilling and production, which, coupled with an excess of pipeline takeaway capacity in the Mid-Continent region, led to tighter discounts for crude oils relative to Brent. Low energy cost supported by robust North American natural gas production partly offset these factors. 
Our refineries operated at 96% throughput capacity utilization in the first quarter of 2016, and throughput volumes average 2.9 million barrels per day, which was 169,000 barrels per day higher than in the first quarter of 2015. Refining cash operating expenses of $3.55 per barrel were $0.40 per barrel lower than the first quarter of 2015, mostly due to higher throughput volumes and lower energy costs. 
The ethanol segment earned $9 million of adjusted operating income in the first quarter of 2016 compared to $12 million in the first quarter of 2015. The low crude oil and gasoline price environment challenged ethanol margins but with the recent recovery in prices, ethanol margins had modestly improved to start the second quarter. 
For the first quarter of 2016, general and administrative expenses, excluding corporate depreciation, were $156 million. Net interest expense was $108 million. 
Depreciation and amortization expense was $485 million, and the effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2016 was 30%. The effective tax rate was lower than the first quarter of 2015, primarily due to higher relative earnings contribution from international operations with lower statutory tax rates. 
Regarding our balance sheet, at quarter end, we had $7.3 billion of total debt and $3.8 billion of cash and temporary cash investments, of which $102 million was held by VLP. Valero's debt-to-capitalization ratio net of $2 billion cash was 20%. We had $5.5 billion of available liquidity, excluding cash, of which $575 million was only available to VLP. 
Cash flows in the first quarter included $479 million of capital investments, of which $161 million was for turnarounds and catalysts. 
For 2016, we expect to invest $1.6 billion of capital to sustain the business and $1 billion for refining asset optimization and logistics to drive long-term earnings growth. 
With respect to our refining growth strategy, the new Corpus Christi crude unit, which was completed late last year, operated as planned and delivered approximately $35 million of EBITDA in the first quarter. We completed the St. Charles hydrocracker expansion in March and the new Houston crude unit is on track to start up in the second quarter. The Houston alkylation project, which was approved in January, is now undergoing detailed engineering and procurement. Completion of the alkylation unit is expected on the first half of 2019. 
Now moving to the financing activities. We returned $547 million in cash to our stockholders in the first quarter, which included $282 million in dividend payments and $265 million for the repurchase of 3.8 million shares of Valero common stock. We have $1.1 billion of remaining share repurchase authorization as of March 31, 2016. Our regular quarterly cash dividend is now $0.60 per share. 
We continue to target a payout of 75% of annual net income for 2016. For modeling our second quarter operations, we expect throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges: Gulf Coast at 1.59 million to 1.64 million barrels per day; Mid-Continent at 430,000 to 450,000 barrels per day; West Coast at 260,000 to 280,000 barrels per day; and North Atlantic at 450,000 to 470,000 barrels per day. 
Refining cash operating expenses are estimated at approximately $3.75 per barrel for the second quarter. Based on today's market prices, we expect costs relating to meeting our biofuel blending obligations to be between $750 million and $850 million for 2015. This is primarily related to RINs in the U.S. The ethanol segment is expected to produce a total of 3.8 million gallons per day. 
Operating expenses should average $0.37 per gallon, which includes $0.05 per gallon for depreciation and amortization. G&A expenses for the second quarter, excluding corporate depreciation are expected to be approximately $165 million and net interest expense should be about $110 million. Total depreciation and amortization expense is estimated at $465 million and our effective tax rate is expected to be 31%. This concludes our opening remarks. [Operator Instructions]"

We've seen some good agricultural demand begin to kick in. And so we've trended to where we're now more towards the 5-year high, actually last week, above the 5-year high. So I think some of these demand will help clean up the inventory. And then also, you talked about the exports. We're seeing a lot of good opportunities to export distillate as well. So the combination of 2 of those things, I think, will help keep domestic inventories in check. Moving forward, I think, if flat price continues to rise and start to see some recovery in the upstream sector, which should improved distillate demand as well. But really, we'll have to wait and see if we have a more normal winter this winter and that will be a key driver in terms of what happens with the distillate track from moving forward."

VLC does not need to execute any drop to meet its 25% disposition growth through 2017. So VLP does not need to access the capital market. That being said, we believe the capital markets, both debt and equity, are open for MLP, particularly high-quality MLPs like VLP. The cost of issuing debt or equity, however, remains more expensive than historical level. The good news is VLP is well positioned with strong distribution company -- distribution coverage and does not need access to the capital market in this price environment. Therefore, we are going to revise our drop-down guidance to $500 million to $750 million. We can execute drops in this range without going to the capital market. We are going to continue to prepare for $1 billion in drops and will be ready to execute $1 billion in drop if the capital markets improve. From a Valero Energy perspective, regardless of whether or not we drop $500 million or $1 billion worth of assets this year to VLP, this amount will not materially change our view on our payout guidance."

But some high-level things I can tell in terms of volume variance, there really wasn't a negative impact on volume variance for our refineries. Actually, we would show that the volume variance was slightly positive for the quarter. So what you're seeing on the capture rate is all market-driven. In a  high level, there is a few things I would point to that higher-cost RIN certainly had an impact on our capture rates. The butane differential, the gasoline, was much more narrow in the first quarter than what we saw last year. That had an impact on our capture rates. In the North Atlantic Basin, when you look at our crude cost relative to Brent, the narrower Brent TIR impacted our crude cost, most importantly at Qu√©bec. Also, the Western Canadian crudes, the syn crudes, were more expensive in the first quarter, so the volumes coming of Line 9. So we had a crude cost impact to our North Atlantic Basin system. And the only thing that's really operationally, we had the Benicia crackdown on the West Coast for a planned turnaround, and so our capture rates there were down a little bit as well.

Paul, I'd say M&A is something that we've in our capital allocation framework for the last 2 years, and that really hasn't changed. Now it seems like you and your peers are the ones that are interested in that, perhaps, more than we are. When we look at our approach of trying to drive EPS growth over the next 3 to 5 years, it's really multifaceted. And it includes growth investments in refining in midstream. We also look at M&A, and we look at share repurchases. And we've got a really good pipeline of refining projects that are underdeveloped -- that are under development. Now we don't want to get out over our skis, so we don't really discuss the specifics on these projects that are in development until we've gone further down the approval process. But we do have a bunch of great projects that exceeded the 25% IRR hurdle rate that we've talked about, and we'll try to do as many of those projects as we find. Midstream investments are of interest. They've got a lower hurdle rate, as you would expect, but they'll drive earnings growth through optimization. So these are critical to us also. Then when we look at the discretionary uses of cash, M&A fits into that category for us. And really what I just want to communicate on that is that the assets that we would look at there, Paul, would be those that create synergy and would be accretive to the company. We've got a great portfolio today, and we do have that tension between the use, the discretionary use of cash via this framework that we put in place. And we're not going to do an acquisition, and that's why you see we haven't pulled the trigger. We're not going to do an acquisition if we believe it's more accretive to do a share repurchase. So anyway, returning cash to shareholders hasn't lost its priority at all from our perspective. It's just we are looking at that growth projects and M&A as a competitive use of funds.

We keep pointing to on the distillate side, the warmer weather in the United States, and Northwest Europe certainly hindered this demand coming through the winter. And so it created this overhang we're living with today. I think the other thing that happened is the combination of relatively strong frac spreads in December and January instead of higher utilization than what we typically see. In combination, the strong carry in the market and refiners that typically aren't running high utilizations in December and January running at high utilizations and selling their product forward.

So that's where the project sort of fit. Any other [indiscernible] those are affecting it. Well, you have commodity risk all over the place. I think, when we analyze a project, the one that we always stare at the most is NAFTA. The Gulf has a long NAFTA.

But what I would describe them as a very reasonable group, quite honestly, and we've had a lot of dealings with them over the years as we've done acquisitions, I believe that what they would look at, not only for Valero but for anybody, is your ability to restrict trade in a particular market. And because the Gulf Coast is so long and so oversupplied and the barrels tend to move throughout the U.S. and abroad, you're not going to run into a situation whereby having a more significant concentration in the Gulf Coast, you could run into a situation where you could manipulate market.

311679,329303363,973717,"Valero Energy Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 03, 2016",2016-05-03,"Earnings Calls","Valero Energy Corporation","Executives","Well, thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. The first quarter presented us with challenging markets with gasoline and diesel margins under pressure for most of the quarter. The bright spot was the performance of our team, as we continued to operate sa",771,"Well, thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. The first quarter presented us with challenging markets with gasoline and diesel margins under pressure for most of the quarter. The bright spot was the performance of our team, as we continued to operate safely and reliably. 
What I'd like to do this morning is take a few minutes to discuss our strategic initiatives that we believe will continue to drive long-term value creation and then share some color on what we're seeing in the markets. 
First, at the core of everything we do, is the relentless focus on safety and reliability. Our dedication and persistence here is what keeps our people and communities safe, our operations reliable, and our cash operating costs the lowest among the peer group. Having low-cost operations is a major advantage in our industry where product margins can be quite volatile. As a disciplined operator, we are able to run profitably in a lower margin environment as experienced in the first quarter. 
Second, we apply discipline and rigor as we evaluate and execute investments that will grow the profitability and competitiveness of our business for many years. The strategic plan that was approved by our Board of Directors last year included $2.6 billion of capital spending for 2016, approximately $1 billion was allocated to strategic investments to drive long-term earnings growth. 
Third, we're committed to delivering value to stockholders by making the right investments in our business and returning cash to our stockholders. We demonstrated this in 2015 when we delivered the highest total stockholder return among our peers for both Valero and VLP. We expect VLP to continue to be well positioned to execute its distribution growth strategy through 2017 despite volatile capital markets. 
We also continue to keep an eye on M&A. We review opportunities, and we have a list of targets that we consistently monitor. We consider M&A a discretionary use of cash, so there's a healthy tension when evaluating M&A opportunities versus other alternative uses. Of course, we can't comment specifically on M&A, but we are diligently reviewing opportunities. 
For cash returns in 2016, which is made up of dividends and buybacks, we've extended our 2015 payout target of 75% of net income. In January, we increased the quarterly dividend by 20% to $0.60 a share, and we remain focused on maintaining a dividend payout at the high end of our peer group. We're confident in Valero's ability to fund investments in future growth and to meet its payout target. 
Lastly, let me sure some color on the current market. Already this year, we've been in a lot of conversations about various market topics, including gasoline demand resurgence, octane strength, diesel length, domestic crude supply and crude storage levels. As you know, markets for Valero's feedstocks and products are dynamic. Our high complexity refineries, system flexibility, advantage locations and low cash cost operations enable us to maximize earnings under challenging market conditions. 
On the crude supply side, we're seeing more medium sour crudes coming into the market. As a result, we're seeing healthy medium and heavy sour crude discounts. We also have greater access to domestic sweet crudes with the logistics buildup in the U.S. allowing domestic production to clear the Mid-Continent region and reach the large Gulf Coast refining center. 
On the demand side, continued GDP growth and low product prices should continue to support demand. In the U.S., we've seen gasoline demand continue to grow. We're encouraged by increased vehicle miles traveled and double-digit percentage increases in SUV and truck purchases in the U.S. and key countries around the globe. 
Distillate demand globally was good, albeit in the U.S., it's been fairly flat. While distillate margins were pressured near term due to unseasonably warm weather in North America and Europe, distillate demand in Latin America remains robust. 
Overall, we still have structural refine product supply challenges in South America and in developing countries, which we don't expect to be resolved in the near term. With our low-cost Gulf Coast refining presence, we have the ability to compete in markets all over the globe. We also have the opportunity to optimize our system and supply, the Atlantic Basin with our refineries in Wales and Qu√©bec City. In fact, we generated another quarter of solid distillate and gasoline export volumes. 
In summary, we still have significant crude supply, ample natural gas availability and growing global petroleum demand that's outpacing refining capacity additions. We don't see this changing anytime soon. So although the markets will be challenging at times, the longer-term macro outlook remains favorable. 
So with that, John, I'll hand the call back to you."
311679,329303363,973717,"Valero Energy Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 03, 2016",2016-05-03,"Earnings Calls","Valero Energy Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Joe. Moving on to the results. Net income was $495 million or $1.05 per share for the first quarter of 2016. Excluding an after-tax, lower cost to market inventory valuation benefit of $212 million or $0.45 per share, we recorded first quarter",873,"Thank you, Joe. Moving on to the results. Net income was $495 million or $1.05 per share for the first quarter of 2016. Excluding an after-tax, lower cost to market inventory valuation benefit of $212 million or $0.45 per share, we recorded first quarter 2016 adjusted net income of $283 million or $0.60 per share. This compares to $964 million or $1.87 per share for the first quarter of 2015. For reconciliations of actual to adjusted amounts, please refer to Page 6 of the financial tables that accompany our release. 
Adjusted operating income for the refining segment in the first quarter of 2016 was $695 million or $946 million lower than in the first quarter of 2015. Margins were pressured downward primarily due to weaker distillate margins given high refinery run rates across the industry, product inventory builds and unseasonably warm weather. Other headwinds on refining margins included narrower domestic light sweet crude oil discounts versus the Brent benchmark, low fuel oil and petrochemical product margins and elevated costs for RINs credits. 
Low crude oil prices continued to drive slowdowns in North American drilling and production, which, coupled with an excess of pipeline takeaway capacity in the Mid-Continent region, led to tighter discounts for crude oils relative to Brent. Low energy cost supported by robust North American natural gas production partly offset these factors. 
Our refineries operated at 96% throughput capacity utilization in the first quarter of 2016, and throughput volumes average 2.9 million barrels per day, which was 169,000 barrels per day higher than in the first quarter of 2015. Refining cash operating expenses of $3.55 per barrel were $0.40 per barrel lower than the first quarter of 2015, mostly due to higher throughput volumes and lower energy costs. 
The ethanol segment earned $9 million of adjusted operating income in the first quarter of 2016 compared to $12 million in the first quarter of 2015. The low crude oil and gasoline price environment challenged ethanol margins but with the recent recovery in prices, ethanol margins had modestly improved to start the second quarter. 
For the first quarter of 2016, general and administrative expenses, excluding corporate depreciation, were $156 million. Net interest expense was $108 million. 
Depreciation and amortization expense was $485 million, and the effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2016 was 30%. The effective tax rate was lower than the first quarter of 2015, primarily due to higher relative earnings contribution from international operations with lower statutory tax rates. 
Regarding our balance sheet, at quarter end, we had $7.3 billion of total debt and $3.8 billion of cash and temporary cash investments, of which $102 million was held by VLP. Valero's debt-to-capitalization ratio net of $2 billion in cash was 20%. We had $5.5 billion of available liquidity, excluding cash, of which $575 million was only available to VLP. 
Cash flows in the first quarter included $479 million of capital investments, of which $161 million was for turnarounds and catalysts. 
For 2016, we expect to invest $1.6 billion of capital to sustain the business and $1 billion for refining asset optimization and logistics to drive long-term earnings growth. 
With respect to our refining growth strategy, the new Corpus Christi crude unit, which was completed late last year, operated as planned and delivered approximately $35 million of EBITDA in the first quarter. We completed the St. Charles hydrocracker expansion in March and the new Houston crude unit is on track to start up in the second quarter. The Houston alkylation project, which was approved in January, is now undergoing detailed engineering and procurement. Completion of the alkylation unit is expected in the first half of 2019. 
Now moving to the financing activities. We returned $547 million in cash to our stockholders in the first quarter, which included $282 million in dividend payments and $265 million for the repurchase of 3.8 million shares of Valero common stock. We had $1.1 billion of remaining share repurchase authorization as of March 31, 2016. Our regular quarterly cash dividend is now $0.60 per share. 
We continue to target a payout of 75% of annual net income for 2016. For modeling our second quarter operations, we expect throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges: Gulf Coast at 1.59 million to 1.64 million barrels per day; Mid-Continent at 430,000 to 450,000 barrels per day; West Coast at 260,000 to 280,000 barrels per day; and North Atlantic at 450,000 to 470,000 barrels per day. 
Refining cash operating expenses are estimated at approximately $3.75 per barrel for the second quarter. Based on today's market prices, we expect costs relating to meeting our biofuel blending obligations to be between $750 million and $850 million for 2016.  This is primarily related to RINs in the U.S. The ethanol segment is expected to produce a total of 3.8 million gallons per day. 
Operating expenses should average $0.37 per gallon, which includes $0.05 per gallon for depreciation and amortization. G&A expenses for the second quarter, excluding corporate depreciation are expected to be approximately $165 million and net interest expense should be about $110 million. Total depreciation and amortization expense is estimated at $465 million and our effective tax rate is expected to be 31%. This concludes our opening remarks. [Operator Instructions]"

We've seen some good agricultural demand begin to kick in. And so we've trended to where we're now more towards a 5-year high, actually last week, above the 5-year high. So I think some of this demand will help clean up the inventory. And then also, you talked about the exports. We're seeing a lot of good opportunities to export distillate as well. So the combination of 2 of those things, I think, will help keep domestic inventories in check. Moving forward, I think, if flat price continues to rise we'll start to see some recovery in the upstream sector, which should improve distillate demand as well. But really, we'll have to wait and see if we have a more normal winter this winter and that will be a key driver in terms of what happens with the distillate frac moving forward."

That being said, we believe the capital markets, both debt and equity, are open for MLP, particularly high-quality MLPs like VLP. The cost of issuing debt or equity, however, remains more expensive than historical levels.  The good news is VLP is well positioned with strong distribution company -- distribution coverage and does not need access to the capital market in this price environment. Therefore, we are going to revise our drop-down guidance to $500 million to $750 million. We can execute drops in this range without going to the capital market. We are going to continue to prepare for $1 billion in drops and will be ready to execute $1 billion in drop if the capital markets improve. From a Valero Energy perspective, regardless of whether or not we drop $500 million or $1 billion worth of assets this year to VLP, this amount will not materially change our view on our payout guidance."

But on some high-level things I can tell in terms of volume variance, there really wasn't a negative impact on volume variance for our refineries. Actually, we would show that the volume variance was slightly positive for the quarter. So what you're seeing on the capture rate is all market-driven. At a high level, there are a few things I would point to; that higher-cost RIN certainly had an impact on our capture rates. The butane differential, the gasoline, was much more narrow in the first quarter than what we saw last year. That had an impact on our capture rates. In the North Atlantic Basin, when you look at our crude cost relative to Brent, the narrower Brent TIR impacted our crude cost, most importantly at Qu√©bec. Also, the Western Canadian crudes, the syn crudes, were more expensive in the first quarter, so the volumes coming of Line 9. So we had a crude cost impact to our North Atlantic Basin system. And the only thing that's really operational is we had the Benicia crackdown on the West Coast for a planned turnaround, and so our capture rates there were down a little bit as well. But those are some of the real key factors."

If we want to maximize heavy sour crudes, that will generally mean we're running at lower throughputs. So we have to look at the discounts and also where the crack spreads are, and then we do that optimization."

I mean, if you look at areas that we feel that we could grow, okay -- and I'm doing this from just historical looks at different assets and how the FTC might view something, the West Coast, California in particular will be very, very difficult for us. We're not really focused there. The East Coast, we've exited, and so we're not interested there. The Mid-Con, I think we would be good to go on transactions and we'd be interested in there, and then, of course, the U.S. Gulf Coast. And when we look at the acquisitions, we look at them from a perspective of where can we create the greatest synergies. And with the portfolio of assets that we have in the U.S. Gulf Coast, we believe that we can greet synergies around feedstocks and product movements there perhaps better than anywhere else. Now if we -- so that would be on the U.S. side. If we go over to Europe, I think we'd be interested in assets in markets like the U.K., where we've got a presence today and we could bolt something on and support it out of the London office. We're not interested in a lot of the countries in Western Europe just because of the nature of the assets and then the issues that go along with owning assets in those markets. And then I really think from our perspective, the Far East is off the table. So in a nutshell, the U.S. Gulf Coast would be interesting. The Mid-Continent of the U.S. would be interesting. The U.K. would be interesting, and that would be our primary focus."

Paul, I tell you, M&A is something that we've had in our capital allocation framework for the last 2 years, and that really hasn't changed. Now it seems like you and your peers are the ones that are interested in that, perhaps, more than we are. When we look at our approach of trying to drive EPS growth over the next 3 to 5 years, it's really multifaceted. And it includes growth investments in refining in midstream. We also look at M&A, and then we look at share repurchases. And we've got a really good pipeline of refining projects that are underdeveloped -- that are under development. Now we don't want to get out over our skis, so we don't really discuss the specifics on these projects that are in development until we've gone further down the approval process. But we do have a bunch of great projects that exceed the 25% IRR hurdle rate that we've talked about, and we'll try to do as many of those projects as we find. Midstream investments are of interest. They've got a lower hurdle rate, as you would expect, but they'll drive earnings growth through optimization. So these are critical to us also. Then when we look at the discretionary uses of cash, M&A fits into that category for us. And really what I just want to communicate on that is that the assets that we would look at there, Paul, would be those that create synergy and would be accretive to the company. We've got a great portfolio today, and we do have that tension between the use, the discretionary use of cash via this framework that we put in place. And we're not going to do an acquisition, and that's why you see we haven't pulled the trigger. We're not going to do an acquisition if we believe it's more accretive to do a share repurchase. So anyway, return of cash to shareholders hasn't lost its priority at all from our perspective. It's just we are looking at that, growth projects, and M&A as a competitive use of funds.

The warmer weather in the United States and Northwest Europe certainly hindered decent demand coming through the winter, and so it created this overhang we're living with today.

In combination, the strong carry in the market and refiners that typically aren't running high utilizations in December and January running at high utilizations and selling their product forward.

And whether we do $500 million or $750 million now, and then we'll start talking about next year what we're going to do, we're going to continue to grow the LP, we're going to continue to drop. I think we're just waiting to see if things don't improve a bit, and certainly higher crude prices should take some of this pressure off if we see the crude markets move up, and then we should be in a good place going forward."

The first quarter presented us with challenging markets with gasoline and diesel margins under pressure for most of the quarter.

The first quarter presented us with challenging markets with gasoline and diesel margins under pressure for most of the quarter. The bright spot was the performance of our team, as we continued to operate safely and reliably. 
What I'd like to do this morning is take a few minutes to discuss our strategic initiatives that we believe will continue to drive long-term value creation and then share some color on what we're seeing in the markets. 
First, at the core of everything we do, is the relentless focus on safety and reliability. Our dedication and persistence here is what keeps our people and communities safe, our operations reliable, and our cash operating costs the lowest among the peer group. Having low-cost operations is a major advantage in our industry where product margins can be quite volatile. As a disciplined operator, we are able to run profitably in a lower margin environment as experienced in the first quarter. 
Second, we apply discipline and rigor as we evaluate and execute investments that will grow the profitability and competitiveness of our business for many years. The strategic plan that was approved by our Board of Directors last year included $2.6 billion of capital spending for 2016, approximately $1 billion was allocated to strategic investments to drive long-term earnings growth. 
Third, we're committed to delivering value to stockholders by making the right investments in our business and returning cash to our stockholders. We demonstrated this in 2015 when we delivered the highest total stockholder return among our peers for both Valero and VLP. We expect VLP to continue to be well positioned to execute its distribution growth strategy through 2017 despite volatile capital markets. 
We also continue to keep an eye on M&A. We review opportunities, and we have a list of targets that we consistently monitor. We consider M&A a discretionary use of cash, so there's a healthy tension when evaluating M&A opportunities versus other alternative uses. Of course, we can't comment specifically on M&A, but we are diligently reviewing opportunities. 
For cash returns in 2016, which is made up of dividends and buybacks, we've extended our 2015 payout target of 75% of net income. In January, we increased the quarterly dividend by 20% to $0.60 a share, and we remain focused on maintaining a dividend payout at the high end of our peer group. We're confident in Valero's ability to fund investments in future growth and to meet its payout target. 
Lastly, let me sure some color on the current market. Already this year, we've been in a lot of conversations about various market topics, including gasoline demand resurgence, octane strength, diesel length, domestic crude supply and crude storage levels. As you know, markets for Valero's feedstocks and products are dynamic. Our high complexity refineries, system flexibility, advantage locations and low cash cost operations enable us to maximize earnings under challenging market conditions. 
On the crude supply side, we're seeing more medium sour crudes coming into the market. As a result, we're seeing healthy medium and heavy sour crude discounts. We also have greater access to domestic sweet crudes with the logistics buildup in the U.S. allowing domestic production to clear the Mid-Continent region and reach the large Gulf Coast refining center. 
On the demand side, continued GDP growth and low product prices should continue to support demand. In the U.S., we've seen gasoline demand continue to grow. We're encouraged by increased vehicle miles traveled and double-digit percentage increases in SUV and truck purchases in the U.S. and key countries around the globe. 
Distillate demand globally was good, albeit in the U.S., it's been fairly flat. While distillate margins were pressured near term due to unseasonably warm weather in North America and Europe, distillate demand in Latin America remains robust. 
Overall, we still have structural refine product supply challenges in South America and in developing countries, which we don't expect to be resolved in the near term. With our low-cost Gulf Coast refining presence, we have the ability to compete in markets all over the globe. We also have the opportunity to optimize our system and supply, the Atlantic Basin with our refineries in Wales and Qu√©bec City. In fact, we generated another quarter of solid distillate and gasoline export volumes. 
In summary, we still have significant crude supply, ample natural gas availability and growing global petroleum demand that's outpacing refining capacity additions. We don't see this changing anytime soon. So although the markets will be challenging at times, the longer-term macro outlook remains favorable. 
So with that, John, I'll hand the call back to you."
311679,329303363,974729,"Valero Energy Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 03, 2016",2016-05-03,"Earnings Calls","Valero Energy Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Joe. Moving on to the results. Net income was $495 million or $1.05 per share for the first quarter of 2016. Excluding an after-tax, lower cost to market inventory valuation benefit of $212 million or $0.45 per share, we recorded first quarter",873,"Thank you, Joe. Moving on to the results. Net income was $495 million or $1.05 per share for the first quarter of 2016. Excluding an after-tax, lower cost to market inventory valuation benefit of $212 million or $0.45 per share, we recorded first quarter 2016 adjusted net income of $283 million or $0.60 per share. This compares to $964 million or $1.87 per share for the first quarter of 2015. For reconciliations of actual to adjusted amounts, please refer to Page 6 of the financial tables that accompany our release. 
Adjusted operating income for the refining segment in the first quarter of 2016 was $695 million or $946 million lower than in the first quarter of 2015. Margins were pressured downward primarily due to weaker distillate margins given high refinery run rates across the industry, product inventory builds and unseasonably warm weather. Other headwinds on refining margins included narrower domestic light sweet crude oil discounts versus the Brent benchmark, low fuel oil and petrochemical product margins and elevated costs for RINs credits. 
Low crude oil prices continued to drive slowdowns in North American drilling and production, which, coupled with an excess of pipeline takeaway capacity in the Mid-Continent region, led to tighter discounts for crude oils relative to Brent. Low energy cost supported by robust North American natural gas production partly offset these factors. 
Our refineries operated at 96% throughput capacity utilization in the first quarter of 2016, and throughput volumes average 2.9 million barrels per day, which was 169,000 barrels per day higher than in the first quarter of 2015. Refining cash operating expenses of $3.55 per barrel were $0.40 per barrel lower than the first quarter of 2015, mostly due to higher throughput volumes and lower energy costs. 
The ethanol segment earned $9 million of adjusted operating income in the first quarter of 2016 compared to $12 million in the first quarter of 2015. The low crude oil and gasoline price environment challenged ethanol margins but with the recent recovery in prices, ethanol margins had modestly improved to start the second quarter. 
For the first quarter of 2016, general and administrative expenses, excluding corporate depreciation, were $156 million. Net interest expense was $108 million. 
Depreciation and amortization expense was $485 million, and the effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2016 was 30%. The effective tax rate was lower than the first quarter of 2015, primarily due to higher relative earnings contribution from international operations with lower statutory tax rates. 
Regarding our balance sheet, at quarter end, we had $7.3 billion of total debt and $3.8 billion of cash and temporary cash investments, of which $102 million was held by VLP. Valero's debt-to-capitalization ratio net of $2 billion in cash was 20%. We had $5.5 billion of available liquidity, excluding cash, of which $575 million was only available to VLP. 
Cash flows in the first quarter included $479 million of capital investments, of which $161 million was for turnarounds and catalysts. 
For 2016, we expect to invest $1.6 billion of capital to sustain the business and $1 billion for refining asset optimization and logistics to drive long-term earnings growth. 
With respect to our refining growth strategy, the new Corpus Christi crude unit, which was completed late last year, operated as planned and delivered approximately $35 million of EBITDA in the first quarter. We completed the St. Charles hydrocracker expansion in March and the new Houston crude unit is on track to start up in the second quarter. The Houston alkylation project, which was approved in January, is now undergoing detailed engineering and procurement. Completion of the alkylation unit is expected in the first half of 2019. 
Now moving to the financing activities. We returned $547 million in cash to our stockholders in the first quarter, which included $282 million in dividend payments and $265 million for the repurchase of 3.8 million shares of Valero common stock. We had $1.1 billion of remaining share repurchase authorization as of March 31, 2016. Our regular quarterly cash dividend is now $0.60 per share. 
We continue to target a payout of 75% of annual net income for 2016. For modeling our second quarter operations, we expect throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges: Gulf Coast at 1.59 million to 1.64 million barrels per day; Mid-Continent at 430,000 to 450,000 barrels per day; West Coast at 260,000 to 280,000 barrels per day; and North Atlantic at 450,000 to 470,000 barrels per day. 
Refining cash operating expenses are estimated at approximately $3.75 per barrel for the second quarter. Based on today's market prices, we expect costs relating to meeting our biofuel blending obligations to be between $750 million and $850 million for 2016. This is primarily related to RINs in the U.S. The ethanol segment is expected to produce a total of 3.8 million gallons per day. 
Operating expenses should average $0.37 per gallon, which includes $0.05 per gallon for depreciation and amortization. G&A expenses for the second quarter, excluding corporate depreciation are expected to be approximately $165 million and net interest expense should be about $110 million. Total depreciation and amortization expense is estimated at $465 million and our effective tax rate is expected to be 31%. This concludes our opening remarks. [Operator Instructions]"

We've seen some good agricultural demand begin to kick in. And so we've trended to where we're now more towards a 5-year high, actually last week, above the 5-year high. So I think some of this demand will help clean up the inventory. And then also, you talked about the exports. We're seeing a lot of good opportunities to export distillate as well. So the combination of 2 of those things, I think, will help keep domestic inventories in check. Moving forward, I think, if flat price continues to rise we'll start to see some recovery in the upstream sector, which should improve distillate demand as well. But really, we'll have to wait and see if we have a more normal winter this winter and that will be a key driver in terms of what happens with the distillate frac moving forward."

VLC does not need to execute any drop to meet its 25% distribution growth through 2017. So VLP does not need to access the capital market. That being said, we believe the capital markets, both debt and equity, are open for MLP, particularly high-quality MLPs like VLP. The cost of issuing debt or equity, however, remains more expensive than historical levels. The good news is VLP is well positioned with strong distribution company -- distribution coverage and does not need access to the capital market in this price environment. Therefore, we are going to revise our drop-down guidance to $500 million to $750 million. We can execute drops in this range without going to the capital market. We are going to continue to prepare for $1 billion in drops and will be ready to execute $1 billion in drop if the capital markets improve. From a Valero Energy perspective, regardless of whether or not we drop $500 million or $1 billion worth of assets this year to VLP, this amount will not materially change our view on our payout guidance."

At a high level, there are a few things I would point to; that higher-cost RIN certainly had an impact on our capture rates. The butane differential, the gasoline, was much more narrow in the first quarter than what we saw last year. That had an impact on our capture rates. In the North Atlantic Basin, when you look at our crude cost relative to Brent, the narrower Brent TIR impacted our crude cost, most importantly at Qu√©bec. Also, the Western Canadian crudes, the syn crudes, were more expensive in the first quarter, so the volumes coming of Line 9. So we had a crude cost impact to our North Atlantic Basin system. And the only thing that's really operational is we had the Benicia crackdown on the West Coast for a planned turnaround, and so our capture rates there were down a little bit as well. But those are some of the real key factors."

And some of those resids are actually replacements for heavy sour crudes in our system. We run the resids through our crude unit. And so where the heavy sour crudes were down, actually the resids we process were up. So there really wasn't a significant difference in the amount of heavy sour crude we ran in the first quarter. In terms of the range, some of the things that we talk about, it's not just the discounts that we're looking at, there's a rate lever associated with really pushing heavy sour crudes in our system. If we want to maximize heavy sour crudes, that will generally mean we're running at lower throughputs. So we have to look at the discounts and also where the crack spreads are, and then we do that optimization."

And when we look at the acquisitions, we look at them from a perspective of where can we create the greatest synergies.

Now if we -- so that would be on the U.S. side. If we go over to Europe, I think we'd be interested in assets in markets like the U.K., where we've got a presence today and we could bolt something on and support it out of the London office.

Paul, I tell you, M&A is something that we've had in our capital allocation framework for the last 2 years, and that really hasn't changed. Now it seems like you and your peers are the ones that are interested in that, perhaps, more than we are. When we look at our approach of trying to drive EPS growth over the next 3 to 5 years, it's really multifaceted. And it includes growth investments in refining in midstream. We also look at M&A, and then we look at share repurchases. And we've got a really good pipeline of refining projects that are underdeveloped -- that are under development. Now we don't want to get out over our skis, so we don't really discuss the specifics on these projects that are in development until we've gone further down the approval process. But we do have a bunch of great projects that exceed the 25% IRR hurdle rate that we've talked about, and we'll try to do as many of those projects as we find. Midstream investments are of interest. They've got a lower hurdle rate, as you would expect, but they'll drive earnings growth through optimization. So these are critical to us also. Then when we look at the discretionary uses of cash, M&A fits into that category for us. And really what I just want to communicate on that is that the assets that we would look at there, Paul, would be those that create synergy and would be accretive to the company. We've got a great portfolio today, and we do have that tension between the use, the discretionary use of cash via this framework that we put in place. And we're not going to do an acquisition, and that's why you see we haven't pulled the trigger. We're not going to do an acquisition if we believe it's more accretive to do a share repurchase. So anyway, return of cash to shareholders hasn't lost its priority at all from our perspective. It's just we are looking at that, growth projects, and M&A as a competitive use of funds.

The warmer weather in the United States and Northwest Europe certainly hindered decent demand coming through the winter, and so it created this overhang we're living with today.

In combination, the strong carry in the market and refiners that typically aren't running high utilizations in December and January running at high utilizations and selling their product forward.

So -- but -- I mean, Doug, you know those markets. I mean, frankly, we've said this for years that -- and we got a jam in Pembroke. And back to your first question, all the diesel that's produced at Pembroke moved in late, most of the gasoline. And so we've got a fairly unique footprint there in that we're able to supply the domestic markets in Ireland in a very efficient way. So we really like that. If we could find a very similar type of asset in a market that was similar, okay, and when I say that I really am thinking primarily of the U.K., I think we'd consider it. Now are we having active conversations on anything like that? No. But would we want to move into France, Spain, Italy or the Med, the answer would be no. So it's more of a passing comment. But we tell you guys we are looking at everything that's out there, and we do that, because we're always looking for opportunities to continue to grow the EPS. But again, we are very pleased with the portfolio that we have, and we can create significant income with it. So we don't feel desperate to do anything in that M&A market. Certainly, again, it's a competition for all the other good uses of cash that we have."

Again, Mike mentioned earlier that we think it's -- that the capital markets are certainly there, but it's a little bit expensive to go to the public markets today. We don't have a gun to our head to do something because we've got the distribution covered for 2 years with the cash flow stream that we have today. And with all the things that he mentioned earlier, I think we're in a very, very strong position here. And we can take our time and time to market and be patient in doing this. And whether we do $500 million or $750 million now, and then we'll start talking about next year what we're going to do, we're going to continue to grow the LP, we're going to continue to drop. I think we're just waiting to see if things don't improve a bit, and certainly higher crude prices should take some of this pressure off if we see the crude markets move up, and then we should be in a good place going forward."

In the second quarter, we continued to face a challenging margin environment, which was further complicated by high compliance cost headwinds, but our team performed well, running safely and reliably while maintaining our cost-efficient operations. 
Turning to the markets. Sweet crude discounts in the second quarter remained narrow, as shale crude production continued to slow. Unplanned crude production outages caused by wildfires in Canada led to the tightening of medium and heavy sour crude discounts relative to Brent. More recently, with the resumption of crude production in Canada and the continued flow of foreign medium sour crudes to the U.S. Gulf Coast, we've seen discounts widening versus Brent. We expect medium, heavy and sour crude oil to remain attractive.
On the product side, margins improved compared to the first quarter, and product demand in domestic and export markets remained robust. In fact, we exported record volumes of distillate and gasoline combined for a second quarter. 
Turning to our refining growth strategy. We successfully commissioned the new Houston crude unit in June. In addition, the Corpus Christi crude unit, which was completed late last year, ran well and above plan rates. We continued engineering and procurement work on the $300 million Houston Appalachian unit, which we expect to complete in the first half of 2019. We also continue to develop other strategic projects that will provide octane enhancement, feedstock flexibility and cogeneration to create higher-value products and reduce costs. Also in June, we acquired the remaining 50% interest in the Parkway Pipeline, which connects our St. Charles refinery to the plantation pipeline. With 100% ownership interest in this pipeline and the planned connection to the Colonial Pipeline, we've enhanced our product supply options to the U.S. East Coast. This transaction fits our strategy to optimize through investments in logistics assets, which we expect to be eligible for future drop to Valero Energy Partners LP, our sponsored MLP. 
With respective VLP, last week, we announced a distribution increase of 7.4% for the second quarter, which keeps us on pace for an annual distribution growth rate of 25%. 
And finally, despite the lower-margin environment, we generated solid cash flow from operations and stepped up our return of cash of stockholders to our buyback program. 
So with that, John, I'll hand it back over to you."

For the quarter, net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $814 million or $1.73 per share, which compares to $1.4 billion or $2.66 per share in the second quarter of 2015.

For the quarter, net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $814 million or $1.73 per share, which compares to $1.4 billion or $2.66 per share in the second quarter of 2015. Excluding an after-tax lower cost market inventory valuation benefit of $367 million or $0.78 per share and an asset impairment loss of $56 million or $0.12 per share, second quarter 2016 adjusted net income was $503 million or $1.07 per share. Please refer to the reconciliations of actual to adjusted amounts that begin on Page 3 of the financial tables that accompany our release. 
Operating income for the refining segment in the second quarter of 2016 was $1.3 billion, and adjusted operating income was $954 million, which was $1.2 billion lower than the second quarter of 2015. Primary drivers of the decline were weaker gasoline and distillate margins due to lingering high product inventories and lower discounts for sweet crude oils relative to Brent crude oil. Higher rent prices also created additional earnings headwinds in the second quarter of 2016. 
Refining throughput volumes averaged 2.8 million barrels per day in the second quarter of 2016, which was in line with the second quarter of 2015. Our refineries operated at 94% throughput capacity utilization, which was impacted by a turnaround at our Texas City refinery. 
Refining cash operating expenses of $3.51 per barrel in the second quarter of 2016 were $0.15 per barrel lower compared to the second quarter of 2015, largely driven by lower energy costs.
The ethanol segment generated $69 million of operating income in the second quarter of 2016 and adjusted operating income of $49 million, which was $59 million lower than in the second quarter of 2015, due primarily to lower gross margin per gallon, driven by higher corn prices in the second quarter of 2016. 
Additionally, for the second quarter of 2016, general and administrative expenses, excluding corporate depreciation, were $159 million, and net interest expense was $111 million. Depreciation and amortization expense was $471 million, and the effective tax rate was 26% in the second quarter of 2016. The effective tax rate was lower than expected and lower than in the second quarter of 2015, primarily due to the positive change in the company's lower of cost market inventory valuation reserve in the second quarter of 2016, which contributed to a stronger relative earnings contribution from international operations with lower statutory tax rates.
With respect to our balance sheet, at quarter end, total debt was $7.5 billion, and cash and temporary cash investments were $4.9 billion, of which $67 million was held by VLP. Valero's debt-to-capitalization ratio, net of $2 billion in cash, was 21%. We have $5.3 billion of available liquidity, excluding cash, of which $436 million was only available to VLP. We generated $2.3 billion of cash from operating activities in the second quarter, of which $1.3 billion was due to favorable working capital changes, primarily increases in accounts and taxes payable and a reduction in inventories.
With regard to investing activities, we made $461 million of capital investments, of which $164 million was for turnarounds and catalysts. This amount excludes our purchase of the remaining 50% interest in the Parkway Pipeline from Kinder Morgan. 
Moving to financing activities. We returned $683 million in cash to stockholders in the second quarter, which included $282 million of dividend payments and $401 million for the purchase of over 7.5 million shares of Valero common stock. As of June 30, we have approximately $700 million of share repurchase authorization remaining. 
For 2016, we expect to invest $1.6 billion to maintain the business and another $1 billion for refining asset optimization and logistics projects, which are expected to drive long-term earnings growth.
For modeling our third quarter operations, we expect throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges: U.S. Gulf Coast at 1.6 million to 1.65 million barrels per day; U.S. Mid-Continent at 415,000 to 435,000 barrels per day; U.S. West Coast at 260,000 to 280,000 barrels per day; and the North Atlantic at 460,000 to 480,000 barrels per day. The guidance range for the U.S. Gulf Coast reflects the previously announced major turnaround at Port Arthur refinery, which occurs once every 5 years. Refining cash operating expenses are estimated at approximately $3.70 per barrel in the third quarter. 
We continue to expect costs related to meeting our biofuel blending obligations, primarily related to RINs in the U.S, to be between $750 million and $850 million for 2016. Costs will likely end up in upper end of that range based on recent RIN prices.
The ethanol segment is expected to produce a total of 3.9 million gallons per day. Operating expenses should average $0.37 per gallon, which includes $0.05 per gallon for noncash costs such as depreciation and amortization.
G&A expenses for the third quarter, excluding corporate depreciation, are expected to be around $180 million, and net interest expense should be about $110 million. Total depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately $465 million, and our effective tax rate should be around 30%.
That concludes our opening remarks. [Operator Instructions]"

So ultimately, we're going to need a rebalancing and see lower refinery utilization moving forward. So I do believe that you'll see some refinery run cuts as we head into the third and fourth quarter. I think that similar to what happened this year is that with the steep contango in the market, especially early in the year, some marginal refining capacity that, typically, you would see cut in the winter, go ahead and run and produce the summer-graded gasoline. And so it caused utilization to be very high, especially like in the January, February timeframe, and that's where we built a large overhang of products that we've really had to manage the rest of this year."

And I'll speak just briefly about the lawsuit, really, and then if we have procedural questions, Jake can help me with that. But our action with the EPA is really focused on dealing with the current structure of the system. The current system, as you know, misaligns the RIN obligation with the ability to comply by blending. So what's happened is it enabled speculators to drive up RIN prices, which really distorts the market. And it facilitates opportunities for RIN, which we've seen a fair amount of. Moving the point of obligation really would address these issues, and then it would enable the penetration of biofuel products into the marketplace to increase their blending. So that's really the emphasis for us on trying to push this, just to try to fix a structure that we think, really, is misaligned and infeasible today. And then, Jay, on process, any comments?"

And so it's always a negotiation when you're looking at it. But you're raising the question on M&A, and if I could, I just want to stress the fact that M&A is a component of our capital allocation framework. It is not the component of our capital allocation framework. And unfortunately, in our last call, we gave the impression that there was a greater emphasis on M&A than there has been in the past, which we really never intended to do. We've consistently shared that we look at opportunities all the time. So a transaction like the Parkway Pipeline acquisition wouldn't come as a surprise. But any M&A transactions will need to compete for cash with our growth capital projects and our buybacks. So just to be clear, there's no greater emphasis on M&A today than there was 2 years ago, and our commitment to the other components of our capital allocation framework is really unchanged."

However, in the U.S. Gulf Coast, in the New York Harbor, we've seen weaker octane premiums. And so if you kind of try to get your mind around what is going on, I think a lot of that is the fact that where you really can store gasoline is in the U.S. Gulf Coast and then in New York Harbor. When you have that's deep content over there in the year, people restoring gasoline and it's hard way restoring premium-grade summer gasoline and high-octane blend components. So in those markets, in the harbor and the Gulf Coast, that inventories come out kind of caused the premiums to be in the weaker this year than what we saw in the past.

In the second quarter, we continued to face a challenging margin environment, which was further complicated by high compliance cost headwinds, but our team performed well, running safely and reliably while maintaining our cost-efficient operations. 
Turning to the markets. Sweet crude discounts in the second quarter remained narrow as shale crude production continued to slow. Unplanned crude production outages caused by wildfires in Canada led to the tightening of medium and heavy sour crude discounts relative to Brent. More recently, with the resumption of crude production in Canada and the continued flow of foreign medium sour crudes to the U.S. Gulf Coast, we've seen discounts widening versus Brent. We expect medium, heavy and sour crude oils to remain attractive.
On the product side, margins improved compared to the first quarter, and product demand in domestic and export markets remained robust. In fact, we exported record volumes of distillate and gasoline combined for a second quarter. 
Turning to our refining growth strategy. We successfully commissioned the new Houston crude unit in June. In addition, the Corpus Christi crude unit, which was completed late last year, ran well and above plan rates. We continued engineering and procurement work on the $300 million Houston Appalachian unit, which we expect to complete in the first half of 2019. We also continue to develop other strategic projects that will provide octane enhancement, feedstock flexibility and cogeneration to create higher-value products and reduce cost. Also in June, we acquired the remaining 50% interest in the Parkway Pipeline, which connects our St. Charles refinery to the plantation pipeline. With 100% ownership interest in this pipeline and the planned connection to the Colonial Pipeline, we've enhanced our product supply options to the U.S. East Coast. This transaction fits our strategy to optimize through investments in logistics assets, which we expect to be eligible for future drop to Valero Energy Partners LP, our sponsored MLP. 
With respective to VLP, last week, we announced a distribution increase of 7.4% for the second quarter, which keeps us on pace for an annual distribution growth rate of 25%. 
And finally, despite the lower-margin environment, we generated solid cash flow from operations and stepped up our return of cash to stockholders through our buyback program. 
So with that, John, I'll hand it back over to you."

For the quarter, net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $814 million or $1.73 per share, which compares to $1.4 billion or $2.66 per share in the second quarter of 2015. Excluding an after-tax, lower cost to market inventory",850,"Thank you, Joe. 
For the quarter, net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $814 million or $1.73 per share, which compares to $1.4 billion or $2.66 per share in the second quarter of 2015. Excluding an after-tax, lower cost to market inventory valuation benefit of $367 million or $0.78 per share and an asset impairment loss of $56 million or $0.12 per share, second quarter 2016 adjusted net income was $503 million or $1.07 per share. Please refer to the reconciliations of actual to adjusted amounts that begin on Page 3 of the financial tables that accompany our release. 
Operating income for the refining segment in the second quarter of 2016 was $1.3 billion, and adjusted operating income was $954 million, which was $1.2 billion lower than the second quarter of 2015. Primary drivers of the decline were weaker gasoline and distillate margins due to lingering high-product inventories and lower discounts for sweet crude oils relative to Brent crude oil. Higher rent prices also created additional earnings headwinds in the second quarter of 2016. 
Refining throughput volumes averaged 2.8 million barrels per day in the second quarter of 2016, which was in line with the second quarter of 2015. Our refineries operated at 94% throughput capacity utilization, which was impacted by a turnaround at our Texas City refinery. 
Refining cash operating expenses of $3.51 per barrel in the second quarter of 2016 were $0.15 per barrel lower compared to the second quarter of 2015, largely driven by lower energy costs.
The ethanol segment generated $69 million of operating income in the second quarter of 2016 and adjusted operating income of $49 million, which was $59 million lower than in the second quarter of 2015, due primarily to lower gross margin per gallon, driven by higher corn prices in the second quarter of 2016. 
Additionally, for the second quarter of 2016, general and administrative expenses, excluding corporate depreciation, were $159 million, and net interest expense was $111 million. Depreciation and amortization expense was $471 million, and the effective tax rate was 26% in the second quarter of 2016. The effective tax rate was lower than expected and lower than in the second quarter of 2015, primarily due to the positive change in the company's lower of cost to market inventory valuation reserve in the second quarter of 2016, which contributed to a stronger relative earnings contribution from international operations with lower statutory tax rates.
With respect to our balance sheet, at quarter end, total debt was $7.5 billion, and cash and temporary cash investments were $4.9 billion, of which $67 million was held by VLP. Valero's debt-to-capitalization ratio, net of $2 billion in cash, was 21%. We have $5.3 billion of available liquidity, excluding cash, of which $436 million was only available to VLP. We generated $2.3 billion of cash from operating activities in the second quarter, of which $1.3 billion was due to favorable working capital changes, primarily increases in accounts and taxes payable and a reduction in inventories.
With regard to investing activities, we made $461 million of capital investments, of which $164 million was for turnarounds and catalysts. This amount excludes our purchase of the remaining 50% interest in the Parkway Pipeline from Kinder Morgan. 
Moving to financing activities. We returned $683 million in cash to stockholders in the second quarter, which included $282 million of dividend payments and $401 million for the purchase of over 7.5 million shares of Valero common stock. As of June 30, we have approximately $700 million of share repurchase authorization remaining. 
For 2016, we expect to invest $1.6 billion to maintain the business and another $1 billion for refining asset optimization and logistics projects, which are expected to drive long-term earnings growth.
For modeling our third quarter operations, we expect throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges: U.S. Gulf Coast at 1.6 million to 1.65 million barrels per day; U.S. Mid-Continent at 415,000 to 435,000 barrels per day; U.S. West Coast at 260,000 to 280,000 barrels per day; and the North Atlantic at 460,000 to 480,000 barrels per day. The guidance range for the U.S. Gulf Coast reflects the previously announced major turnaround at the Port Arthur refinery, which occurs once every 5 years. Refining cash operating expenses are estimated at approximately $3.70 per barrel in the third quarter. 
We continue to expect costs related to meeting our biofuel blending obligations, primarily related to RINs in the U.S, to be between $750 million and $850 million for 2016. Costs will likely end up in the upper end of that range based on recent RIN prices.
The ethanol segment is expected to produce a total of 3.9 million gallons per day. Operating expenses should average $0.37 per gallon, which includes $0.05 per gallon for noncash costs such as depreciation and amortization.
G&A expenses for the third quarter, excluding corporate depreciation, are expected to be around $180 million, and net interest expense should be about $110 million. Total depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately $465 million, and our effective tax rate should be around 30%.
That concludes our opening remarks. [Operator Instructions]"

So ultimately, we're going to need a rebalancing and see lower refinery utilization moving forward. So I do believe that you'll see some refinery run-cuts as we head into the third and fourth quarter. I think that some of what happened this year is that with the steep contango in the market, especially early in the year, some marginal refining capacity that, typically, you would see cut in the winter, had incentive to go ahead and run and produce the summer-graded gasoline. And so it caused utilization to be very high, especially like in the January, February time frame, and that's where we built the large overhang of products that we've really had to manage the rest of this year."

And I'll speak just briefly about the lawsuit, really, and then if we have procedural questions, Jake can help me with that. But our action with the EPA is really focused on dealing with the current structure of the system. The current system, as you know, misaligns the RIN obligation with the ability to comply by blending. So what's happened is it enabled speculators to drive up RIN prices, which really distorts the markets, and it facilitates opportunities for RIN frag, which we've seen a fair amount of. Moving the point of obligation really would address these issues, and then it would enable the penetration of biofuel products into the marketplace to increase their blending. So that's really the emphasis for us on trying to push this, just to try to fix a structure that we think, really, is misaligned and infeasible today. And then, Jay, on process, any comments?"

And so it's always a negotiation when you're looking at it. But you're raised the question on M&A, and if I could, I just want to stress the fact that M&A is a component of our capital allocation framework. It is not the component of our capital allocation framework. And unfortunately, in our last call, we gave the impression that there was a greater emphasis on M&A than there had been in the past, which we really never intended to do. We've consistently shared that we look at opportunities all the time. So a transaction like the Parkway Pipeline acquisition wouldn't come as a surprise, but any M&A transactions will need to compete for cash with our growth capital projects and our buybacks. So just to be clear, there's no greater emphasis on M&A today than there was 2 years ago, and our commitment to the other components of our capital allocation framework is really unchanged."

So what we've seen in the market is actually the octane premiums on the West Coast in the Mid-Continent, in the Group 3 market has been stronger this year than what they were last year. However, in the U.S. Gulf Coast, in the New York Harbor, we've seen weaker octane premiums. And so if you kind of try to get your mind around what's going on, I think a lot of that is the fact that where you really can store gasoline is in the U.S. Gulf Coast and in New York Harbor. So when we had that steep contango early in the year, people were storing gasoline. And it's hard to store a premium-grade summer gasoline and high-octane blend components. So in those markets, in the harbor and the Gulf Coast, that inventories come out has kind of caused the premiums to be a little weaker this year than what we saw in the past. However in the Group 3 market, the West Coast market, where you don't have a lot of capability to store gasoline, the octane values have actually been stronger than what we saw last year."

And it has to do with this -- what we would call this lean cut between the heavy part of cat gasoline and LPO, and there's compelling economics as well to bring butane into full. So that's how we're postured today. But we're very close on all these things just because of where the relative cracks are. In terms of catalyst choices, FCCs we can change relatively quickly. I would say if we weren't-- and  most of the time there we make a decision on whether we want to try to fill our Appalachian capacity catalytically with like VSM 5 [ph] and not run as much rate.

In the second quarter, we continued to face a challenging margin environment, which was further complicated by high compliance cost headwinds, but our team performed well, running safely and reliably while maintaining our cost-efficient operations. 
Turning to the markets. Sweet crude discounts in the second quarter remained narrow as shale crude production continued to slow. Unplanned crude production outages caused by wildfires in Canada led to the tightening of medium and heavy sour crude discounts relative to Brent. More recently, with the resumption of crude production in Canada and the continued flow of foreign medium sour crudes to the U.S. Gulf Coast, we've seen discounts widening versus Brent. We expect medium, heavy and sour crude oils to remain attractive.
On the product side, margins improved compared to the first quarter, and product demand in domestic and export markets remained robust. In fact, we exported record volumes of distillate and gasoline combined for a second quarter. 
Turning to our refining growth strategy. We successfully commissioned the new Houston crude unit in June. In addition, the Corpus Christi crude unit, which was completed late last year, ran well and above plan rates. We continued engineering and procurement work on the $300 million Houston Appalachian unit, which we expect to complete in the first half of 2019. We also continue to develop other strategic projects that will provide octane enhancement, feedstock flexibility and cogeneration to create higher-value products and reduce cost. Also in June, we acquired the remaining 50% interest in the Parkway Pipeline, which connects our St. Charles refinery to the plantation pipeline. With 100% ownership interest in this pipeline and the planned connection to the Colonial Pipeline, we've enhanced our product supply options to the U.S. East Coast. This transaction fits our strategy to optimize through investments in logistics assets, which we expect to be eligible for future drop to Valero Energy Partners LP, our sponsored MLP. 
With respective to VLP, last week, we announced a distribution increase of 7.4% for the second quarter, which keeps us on pace for an annual distribution growth rate of 25%. 
And finally, despite the lower-margin environment, we generated solid cash flow from operations and stepped up our return of cash to stockholders through our buyback program. 
So with that, John, I'll hand it back over to you."

For the quarter, net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $814 million or $1.73 per share, which compares to $1.4 billion or $2.66 per share in the second quarter of 2015.

For the quarter, net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $814 million or $1.73 per share, which compares to $1.4 billion or $2.66 per share in the second quarter of 2015. Excluding an after-tax, lower of cost to market inventory valuation benefit of $367 million or $0.78 per share and an asset impairment loss of $56 million or $0.12 per share, second quarter 2016 adjusted net income was $503 million or $1.07 per share. Please refer to the reconciliations of actual to adjusted amounts that begin on Page 3 of the financial tables that accompany our release. 
Operating income for the refining segment in the second quarter of 2016 was $1.3 billion, and adjusted operating income was $954 million, which was $1.2 billion lower than the second quarter of 2015. Primary drivers of the decline were weaker gasoline and distillate margins due to lingering high-product inventories and lower discounts for sweet crude oils relative to Brent crude oil. Higher rent prices also created additional earnings headwinds in the second quarter of 2016. 
Refining throughput volumes averaged 2.8 million barrels per day in the second quarter of 2016, which was in line with the second quarter of 2015. Our refineries operated at 94% throughput capacity utilization, which was impacted by a turnaround at our Texas City refinery. 
Refining cash operating expenses of $3.51 per barrel in the second quarter of 2016 were $0.15 per barrel lower compared to the second quarter of 2015, largely driven by lower energy costs.
The ethanol segment generated $69 million of operating income in the second quarter of 2016 and adjusted operating income of $49 million, which was $59 million lower than in the second quarter of 2015, due primarily to lower gross margin per gallon, driven by higher corn prices in the second quarter of 2016. 
Additionally, for the second quarter of 2016, general and administrative expenses, excluding corporate depreciation, were $159 million, and net interest expense was $111 million. Depreciation and amortization expense was $471 million, and the effective tax rate was 26% in the second quarter of 2016. The effective tax rate was lower than expected and lower than in the second quarter of 2015, primarily due to the positive change in the company's lower of cost to market inventory valuation reserve in the second quarter of 2016, which contributed to a stronger relative earnings contribution from international operations with lower statutory tax rates.
With respect to our balance sheet, at quarter end, total debt was $7.5 billion, and cash and temporary cash investments were $4.9 billion, of which $67 million was held by VLP. Valero's debt-to-capitalization ratio, net of $2 billion in cash, was 21%. We had $5.3 billion of available liquidity, excluding cash, of which $436 million was only available to VLP. We generated $2.3 billion of cash from operating activities in the second quarter, of which $1.3 billion was due to favorable working capital changes, primarily increases in accounts and taxes payable and a reduction in inventories.
With regard to investing activities, we made $461 million of capital investments, of which $164 million was for turnarounds and catalysts. This amount excludes our purchase of the remaining 50% interest in the Parkway Pipeline from Kinder Morgan. 
Moving to financing activities. We returned $683 million in cash to stockholders in the second quarter, which included $282 million of dividend payments and $401 million for the purchase of over 7.5 million shares of Valero common stock. As of June 30, we have approximately $700 million of share repurchase authorization remaining. 
For 2016, we expect to invest $1.6 billion to maintain the business and another $1 billion for refining asset optimization and logistics projects, which are expected to drive long-term earnings growth.
For modeling our third quarter operations, we expect throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges: U.S. Gulf Coast at 1.6 million to 1.65 million barrels per day; U.S. Mid-Continent at 415,000 to 435,000 barrels per day; U.S. West Coast at 260,000 to 280,000 barrels per day; and the North Atlantic at 460,000 to 480,000 barrels per day. The guidance range for the U.S. Gulf Coast reflects the previously announced major turnaround at the Port Arthur refinery, which occurs once every 5 years. Refining cash operating expenses are estimated at approximately $3.70 per barrel in the third quarter. 
We continue to expect costs related to meeting our biofuel blending obligations, primarily related to RINs in the U.S, to be between $750 million and $850 million for 2016. Costs will likely end up in the upper end of that range based on recent RIN prices.
The ethanol segment is expected to produce a total of 3.9 million gallons per day. Operating expenses should average $0.37 per gallon, which includes $0.05 per gallon for noncash costs such as depreciation and amortization.
G&A expenses for the third quarter, excluding corporate depreciation, are expected to be around $180 million, and net interest expense should be about $110 million. Total depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately $465 million, and our effective tax rate should be around 30%.
That concludes our opening remarks. [Operator Instructions]"

So ultimately, we're going to need a rebalancing and you're going to see lower refinery utilization moving forward. So I do believe that you'll see some refinery run-cuts as we head into the third and fourth quarter. I think that some of what happened this year is that with the steep contango in the market, especially early in the year, some marginal refining capacity that, typically, you would see cut in the winter, had incentive to go ahead and run and produce a summer grade of gasoline. And so it caused utilization to be very high, especially like in the January-February time frame, and that's where we built the large overhang of products that we've really had to manage the rest of this year."

And I'll speak just briefly about the lawsuit, really, and then if we have procedural questions, Jay can help me with that. But our action with the EPA is really focused on dealing with the current structure of the system. The current system, as you know, misaligns the RIN obligation with the ability to comply by blending. So what's happened is it enabled speculators to drive up RIN prices, which really distorts the markets, and it facilitates opportunities for RIN frag, which we've seen a fair amount of. Moving the point of obligation really would address these issues, and then it would enable the penetration of biofuel products into the marketplace to increase their blending. So that's really the emphasis for us on trying to push this, just to try to fix a structure that we think, really, is misaligned and infeasible today. And then, Jay, on process, any comments?"

However, in the U.S. Gulf Coast, in the New York Harbor, we've seen weaker octane premiums. And so if you kind of try to get your mind around what's going on, I think a lot of that is the fact that where you really can store gasoline is in the U.S. Gulf Coast and the New York Harbor. So when we had that steep contango early in the year, people were storing gasoline. They were largely storing premium-grade summer gasoline and high-octane blend components. So in those markets, in the harbor and the Gulf Coast, as that inventories come out, it's kind of caused the premiums to be a little weaker this year than what we saw in the past.

And NAFTA shows up in our sort of our overall results as a gasoline, although it's not really. We export it. So we're maximizing jet. We're still actually maximizing gasoline as the next step, but that's largely due to butane blending economics. And it has to do with this -- what we would call the swing cut between the heavy part of cat gasoline and LCO, and there's compelling economics to swill to bring butane into full. So that's how we're postured today. But we're very close on all these things just because of where the relative cracks are. In terms of catalyst choices, FCCs we can change relatively quickly. I would say if we weren't -- and most of the time there we make a decision on whether we want to try to fill our Appalachian capacity catalytically with like VSM 5 [ph] and not run as much rate. And that's normally what we do in the winter and we're certainly looking at that, and I would be surprised if we didn't end up there. And on hydrocrackers, it's -- every 3 years, we make that decision. And that really is a choice between -- it's not really gasoline and diesel and our hydrocrackers. It's really NAFTA and diesel.

In the second quarter, we continued to face a challenging margin environment, which was further complicated by high compliance cost headwinds, but our team performed well, running safely and reliably while maintaining our cost-efficient operations. 
Turning to the markets. Sweet crude discounts in the second quarter remained narrow as shale crude production continued to slow. Unplanned crude production outages caused by wildfires in Canada led to the tightening of medium and heavy sour crude discounts relative to Brent. More recently, with the resumption of crude production in Canada and the continued flow of foreign medium sour crudes to the U.S. Gulf Coast, we've seen discounts widening versus Brent. We expect medium, heavy and sour crude oils to remain attractive.
On the product side, margins improved compared to the first quarter, and product demand in domestic and export markets remained robust. In fact, we exported record volumes of distillate and gasoline combined for a second quarter. 
Turning to our refining growth strategy. We successfully commissioned the new Houston crude unit in June. In addition, the Corpus Christi crude unit, which was completed late last year, ran well and above plan rates. We continued engineering and procurement work on the $300 million Houston Appalachian unit, which we expect to complete in the first half of 2019. We also continue to develop other strategic projects that will provide octane enhancement, feedstock flexibility and cogeneration to create higher-value products and reduce cost. Also in June, we acquired the remaining 50% interest in the Parkway Pipeline, which connects our St. Charles refinery to the plantation pipeline. With 100% ownership interest in this pipeline and the planned connection to the Colonial Pipeline, we've enhanced our product supply options to the U.S. East Coast. This transaction fits our strategy to optimize through investments in logistics assets, which we expect to be eligible for future drop to Valero Energy Partners LP, our sponsored MLP. 
With respective to VLP, last week, we announced a distribution increase of 7.4% for the second quarter, which keeps us on pace for an annual distribution growth rate of 25%. 
And finally, despite the lower-margin environment, we generated solid cash flow from operations and stepped up our return of cash to stockholders through our buyback program. 
So with that, John, I'll hand it back over to you."

For the quarter, net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $814 million or $1.73 per share, which compares to $1.4 billion or $2.66 per share in the second quarter of 2015. Excluding an after-tax, lower of cost to market inventory valuation benefit of $367 million or $0.78 per share and an asset impairment loss of $56 million or $0.12 per share, second quarter 2016 adjusted net income was $503 million or $1.07 per share. Please refer to the reconciliations of actual to adjusted amounts that begin on Page 3 of the financial tables that accompany our release. 
Operating income for the refining segment in the second quarter of 2016 was $1.3 billion, and adjusted operating income was $954 million, which was $1.2 billion lower than the second quarter of 2015. Primary drivers of the decline were weaker gasoline and distillate margins due to lingering high-product inventories and lower discounts for sweet crude oils relative to Brent crude oil. Higher rent prices also created additional earnings headwinds in the second quarter of 2016. 
Refining throughput volumes averaged 2.8 million barrels per day in the second quarter of 2016, which was in line with the second quarter of 2015. Our refineries operated at 94% throughput capacity utilization, which was impacted by a turnaround at our Texas City refinery. 
Refining cash operating expenses of $3.51 per barrel in the second quarter of 2016 were $0.15 per barrel lower compared to the second quarter of 2015, largely driven by lower energy costs.
The ethanol segment generated $69 million of operating income in the second quarter of 2016 and adjusted operating income of $49 million, which was $59 million lower than in the second quarter of 2015, due primarily to lower gross margin per gallon, driven by higher corn prices in the second quarter of 2016. 
Additionally, for the second quarter of 2016, general and administrative expenses, excluding corporate depreciation, were $159 million, and net interest expense was $111 million. Depreciation and amortization expense was $471 million, and the effective tax rate was 26% in the second quarter of 2016. The effective tax rate was lower than expected and lower than in the second quarter of 2015, primarily due to the positive change in the company's lower of cost to market inventory valuation reserve in the second quarter of 2016, which contributed to a stronger relative earnings contribution from international operations with lower statutory tax rates.
With respect to our balance sheet, at quarter end, total debt was $7.5 billion, and cash and temporary cash investments were $4.9 billion, of which $67 million was held by VLP. Valero's debt-to-capitalization ratio, net of $2 billion in cash, was 21%. We had $5.3 billion of available liquidity, excluding cash, of which $436 million was only available to VLP. We generated $2.3 billion of cash from operating activities in the second quarter, of which $1.3 billion was due to favorable working capital changes, primarily increases in accounts and taxes payable and a reduction in inventories.
With regard to investing activities, we made $461 million of capital investments, of which $164 million was for turnarounds and catalysts. This amount excludes our purchase of the remaining 50% interest in the Parkway Pipeline from Kinder Morgan. 
Moving to financing activities. We returned $683 million in cash to stockholders in the second quarter, which included $282 million of dividend payments and $401 million for the purchase of over 7.5 million shares of Valero common stock. As of June 30, we have approximately $700 million of share repurchase authorization remaining. 
For 2016, we expect to invest $1.6 billion to maintain the business and another $1 billion for refining asset optimization and logistics projects, which are expected to drive long-term earnings growth.
For modeling our third quarter operations, we expect throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges: U.S. Gulf Coast at 1.6 million to 1.65 million barrels per day; U.S. Mid-Continent at 415,000 to 435,000 barrels per day; U.S. West Coast at 260,000 to 280,000 barrels per day; and the North Atlantic at 460,000 to 480,000 barrels per day. The guidance range for the U.S. Gulf Coast reflects the previously announced major turnaround at the Port Arthur refinery, which occurs once every 5 years. Refining cash operating expenses are estimated at approximately $3.70 per barrel in the third quarter. 
We continue to expect costs related to meeting our biofuel blending obligations, primarily related to RINs in the U.S, to be between $750 million and $850 million for 2016. Costs will likely end up in the upper end of that range based on recent RIN prices.
The ethanol segment is expected to produce a total of 3.9 million gallons per day. Operating expenses should average $0.37 per gallon, which includes $0.05 per gallon for noncash costs such as depreciation and amortization.
G&A expenses for the third quarter, excluding corporate depreciation, are expected to be around $180 million, and net interest expense should be about $110 million. Total depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately $465 million, and our effective tax rate should be around 30%.
That concludes our opening remarks. [Operator Instructions]"

So ultimately, we're going to need a rebalancing and you're going to see lower refinery utilization moving forward. So I do believe that you'll see some refinery run-cuts as we head into the third and fourth quarter. I think that some of what happened this year is that with the steep contango in the market, especially early in the year, some marginal refining capacity that, typically, you would see cut in the winter, had incentive to go ahead and run and produce a summer grade of gasoline. And so it caused utilization to be very high, especially like in the January-February time frame, and that's where we built the large overhang of products that we've really had to manage the rest of this year."

And I'll speak just briefly about the lawsuit, really, and then if we have procedural questions, Jay can help me with that. But our action with the EPA is really focused on dealing with the current structure of the system. The current system, as you know, misaligns the RIN obligation with the ability to comply by blending. So what's happened is it enabled speculators to drive up RIN prices, which really distorts the markets, and it facilitates opportunities for RIN frag, which we've seen a fair amount of. Moving the point of obligation really would address these issues, and then it would enable the penetration of biofuel products into the marketplace to increase their blending. So that's really the emphasis for us on trying to push this, just to try to fix a structure that we think, really, is misaligned and infeasible today. And then, Jay, on process, any comments?"

However, in the U.S. Gulf Coast, in the New York Harbor, we've seen weaker octane premiums. And so if you kind of try to get your mind around what's going on, I think a lot of that is the fact that where you really can store gasoline is in the U.S. Gulf Coast and the New York Harbor. So when we had that steep contango early in the year, people were storing gasoline. They were largely storing premium-grade summer gasoline and high-octane blend components. So in those markets, in the harbor and the Gulf Coast, as that inventories come out, it's kind of caused the premiums to be a little weaker this year than what we saw in the past.

And NAFTA shows up in our sort of our overall results as a gasoline, although it's not really. We export it. So we're maximizing jet. We're still actually maximizing gasoline as the next step, but that's largely due to butane blending economics. And it has to do with this -- what we would call the swing cut between the heavy part of cat gasoline and LCO, and there's compelling economics to swill to bring butane into full. So that's how we're postured today. But we're very close on all these things just because of where the relative cracks are. In terms of catalyst choices, FCCs we can change relatively quickly. I would say if we weren't -- and most of the time there we make a decision on whether we want to try to fill our Appalachian capacity catalytically with like VSM 5 [ph] and not run as much rate. And that's normally what we do in the winter and we're certainly looking at that, and I would be surprised if we didn't end up there. And on hydrocrackers, it's -- every 3 years, we make that decision. And that really is a choice between -- it's not really gasoline and diesel and our hydrocrackers. It's really NAFTA and diesel.

During the quarter, our team again operated safely and reliably and did a good job of capturing margin in a low, but improving margin environment. We also executed our projects well, completing major turnarounds and progressing on growth investments, while optimizing our portfolio. These actions enabled us to produce positive cash flow and to return a healthy amount of cash to stockholders.
In the market, we continued to see solid product demand domestically and internationally. The sustained low price of crude oil and petroleum products, along with strong export demand, helped create a pull on domestic product inventories. We're also encouraged by the modest return of domestic shale crude production, which is good for diesel demand and crude differentials. On the downside, we continue to see negative impacts on Valero's earnings from exorbitant RINs prices. For the year, we expect to incur costs in the range of $750 million to $850 million to purchase RINs. At these levels, the expense is significant to our company and has our full attention. 
You've likely seen that we filed a petition with the EPA to address this issue. Our efforts are focused on moving the point of obligation, which we believe will not only level the playing field among refiners and retailers, but will also improve the penetration of renewable fuels, reduce RIN fraud, lower RIN speculation and reduce costs for the consumer. We have had many constructive conversations with regulators, and these conversations continue to today. And as you'd expect, we continue to work this issue aggressively. 
As I mentioned a moment ago, our refining operations were very good. We ran reliably during the quarter and experienced very little unplanned downtime. We completed major turnarounds at our Port Arthur and Ardmore refineries, which our teams planned very well and executed safely and successfully, and we'll be wrapping up the restart process over the next few days. 
Our ethanol business performed very well, recording its highest operating income contribution since the fourth quarter of 2014. Our plans are the most competitive in the industry and run by dedicated people. So it's great to see them again contributing to Valero's earnings in a meaningful way.
Regarding strategic investments, we're pleased to have both our new crude units up and running. The Corpus Christi crude unit, which was completed late last year, and the Houston crude unit, which was completed in June, both ran well during the quarter.
Turning to the development of our Houston Appalachian unit. The project is in the engineering and procurement phase and on track for completion in the first half of 2019. The economics of this project look good, given the tight outlook for octane, and it also positions us well for Tier 3 gasoline compliance. 
Looking ahead to 2017, we expect spending on capital investments to be similar to the budget for 2016, which was $2.6 billion.
I also want to share an update on our portfolio. Effective October 1, we disposed of our Aruba business. We've been on the island and in the community for a long time and worked hard to produce a win-win for Valero and the government of Aruba. In addition, the government of Aruba secured a new operator who plans to invest capital in the site and operate it as a bitumen upgrader, which should have a positive economic impact on the community. We're happy for the people of Aruba and for the assets to have a renewed purpose on the island.
With respect to Valero Energy Partners, the drop-down of the Meraux and Three Rivers Terminals in September helped us achieve our drop-down target for the year. Yesterday, we announced the distribution increase of 5.5% for the third quarter, which puts us on track to deliver 25% distribution growth through 2017. Although we don't plan to provide drop-down guidance for 2017 at this time, we are comfortable setting the target for annual distribution growth for 2018 of at least 20%. You'll hear more from VLP on their call later this week, but VLP's excellent operations is in great shape. 
And finally, despite significant turnarounds during the quarter and the low-margin environment, we generated solid cash flow from operations. So far this year, we've returned 148% of net income to stockholders, and we're well ahead of our 75% payout ratio target for the year. We're also extending our payout ratio target of at least 75% of net income to 2017. 
So with that, John, I'll hand the call back over to you."

For the quarter, net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $613 million or $1.33 per share, which compares to $1.4 billion or $2.79 per share in the third quarter of 2015.

For the quarter, net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $613 million or $1.33 per share, which compares to $1.4 billion or $2.79 per share in the third quarter of 2015. Excluding an income tax benefit of $42 million or $0.09 per share related to the Aruba disposition, third quarter 2016 adjusted net income was $571 million or $1.24 per share. 
Please refer to the reconciliations of actual to adjusted amounts that begin on Page 3 of the earnings release tables. 
Operating income for the refining segment in the third quarter of 2016 was $990 million, which was $1.3 billion lower than the third quarter of 2015. Primary drivers of the decline were weaker gasoline and distillate margins due to elevated product inventories, lower discounts for most sweet and sour crude oils relative to Brent crude oil, and higher RIN prices.
Refining throughput volumes averaged 2.9 million barrels per day in the third quarter of 2016, which was in line with the third quarter of 2015. Our refineries operated at 95% throughput capacity utilization, with major turnarounds that occurred at the Port Arthur and Ardmore refineries. Both refineries are currently in the process of restarting operations.
Refining cash operating expenses of $3.63 per barrel in the third quarter of 2016 were $0.17 per barrel lower compared to the third quarter of 2015, primarily due to lower employee-related expenses and adjustments related to the Aruba disposition.
The ethanol segment generated $106 million of operating income in the third quarter of 2016, which was $71 million higher than in the third quarter of 2015, largely due to higher gross margin per gallon resulting from lower corn prices. 
For the third quarter of 2016, general and administrative expenses, excluding corporate depreciation, were $192 million, and net interest expense was $115 million. Depreciation and amortization expense was $470 million, and the effective tax rate was 18% in the third quarter of 2016. The effective tax rate was lower than expected and lower than the third quarter of 2015, primarily due to income tax benefit on the Aruba disposition and the favorable settlement of an income tax audit.
With respect to our balance sheet, at quarter end, total debt was $9 billion, and cash and temporary cash investments were $5.9 billion. Valero's debt-to-capitalization ratio, net of $2 billion in cash, was 25%. We had approximately $5 billion of available liquidity, excluding cash. 
We generated $863 million of cash from operating activities in the third quarter, which was after the impact of $176 million of unfavorable working capital changes, primarily a decrease in accounts payable. With regard to investing activities, we made $453 million of capital investments. 
Moving to financing activities. We returned $778 million in cash to stockholders in the third quarter, which included $276 million in dividend payments and $502 million for the purchase of 9.2 million shares of Valero common stock. We completed a $1.25 billion public debt offering in September, and in October, we repaid $950 million of senior notes due in 2017. On a pro forma basis, after the repayment, our debt-to-capital ratio was 22%. 
Our Board of Directors approved an incremental $2.5 billion share repurchase authorization in September, and at quarter end, we had approximately $2.7 billion of repurchase authorization remaining.
For 2016, we expect capital investments to total about $2.4 billion, which is slightly below our previous guidance due to lower turnaround cost and the timing of some growth CapEx spend. For modeling our fourth quarter operations, we expect throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges: U.S. Gulf Coast at 1.58 million to 1.63 million barrels per day; U.S. Mid-Continent at 420,000 to 440,000 barrels per day; U.S. West Coast at 270,000 to 290,000 barrels per day; and the North Atlantic at 450,000 to 470,000 barrels per day. 
Refining cash operating expenses are estimated at approximately $3.75 per barrel in the fourth quarter. We continued to expect costs attributed to meeting our biofuel blending obligations, primarily related to RINs in the United States, to be between $750 million and $850 million for 2016. 
Our ethanol segment is expected to produce a total of 3.9 million gallons per day. Operating expenses should average $0.38 per gallon, which includes $0.05 per gallon for noncash costs such as depreciation and amortization. 
G&A expenses for the fourth quarter, excluding corporate depreciation, are expected to be about $200 million, and net interest expense should be about $150 million. Total depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately $465 million, and our effective tax rate should be around 31%.

And I think refineries in that region will need to cut to balance the market as we move into the fourth and first quarters. Elsewhere, I think a lot of what you saw last year in terms of refiners running high on utilization and producing summer-grade gasoline was really a function of the steep carry in the market. And certainly, at least in the Brent curve, it's a lot flatter this year than what we saw last year. And I think as there's not as much carry in the market, it will go ahead and cause refiners to cut down on utilization and avoid some of the products' builds that we saw last year."

So far, we know a lot more about what's going to happen there when they have their November meeting. But if you look at the proposed volumes of the cuts, it looks like the volumes are about the same as what Saudi Arabia typically burns in the summer for power generation. So I don't know that we'll see any real impact on exports even if they have the cuts. But overall, the world is still oversupplied with oil, and we expect we'll see greater exports from Nigeria, Libya, Kazakhstan, Iraq and Brazil. So we still feel like on the crude feedstock side, you're going to have this competition between medium sour crudes and light sweet, whether competing for available refining capacity, which will cause the medium sour discounts to be wide. And then with additional exports from Canada and South America on the heavy side, the heavies are going to have to compete with medium sour. So we expect good discounts there. That's kind of the view on the crude markets. On the product side, I think we think that the gasoline market, as long as you're in this low-price environment, you continue to see the demand response on gasoline. And then on distillate, we expect a little bit more normal winter weather in both the United States and Northwest Europe will help the distillates market, along with some recovery and economic growth, and we'll see a little bit stronger distillate cracks going into next year. Land, I don't know what else you..."

We've also told you guys we're not going to sit here and accumulate cash.

If you're long RINs with a more integrated system through retail, I think you're going to be a lot more comfortable with the status quo. If you're an independent refiner or a retail marketer that doesn't have the ability to move up the rat, then you're going to want to see this point of obligation moved. Paul, from my perspective, it's a very simple point of view. It is, you create a situation where the obligation and the point of compliance are 2 different points, and they shouldn't be. And it's -- so by moving the point of obligation, obviously, we align the natural point of compliance with financial point of obligation. And a lot of this speculation in the RINs market goes away. People will not be incentivized to build inventories of RINS but hold up for higher prices to squeeze the short as we've seen. So anyway, I think I answered."

During the quarter, our team again operated safely and reliably and did a good job of capturing margin in a low, but improving margin environment. We also executed our projects well, completing major turnarounds and progressing on growth investments, while optimizing our portfolio. These actions enabled us to produce positive cash flow and to return a healthy amount of cash to stockholders.
In the market, we continued to see solid product demand domestically and internationally. The sustained low price of crude oil and petroleum products, along with strong export demand, helped create a pull on domestic product inventories. We're also encouraged by the modest return of domestic shale crude production, which is good for diesel demand and crude differentials. On the downside, we continue to see negative impacts on Valero's earnings from exorbitant RINs prices. For the year, we expect to incur costs in the range of $750 million to $850 million to purchase RINs. At these levels, the expense is significant to our company and has our full attention. 
You've likely seen that we filed a petition with the EPA to address this issue. Our efforts are focused on moving the point of obligation, which we believe will not only level the playing field among refiners and retailers, but will also improve the penetration of renewable fuels, reduce RIN fraud, lower RIN speculation and reduce costs for the consumer. We have had many constructive conversations with regulators, and these conversations continue to today. And as you'd expect, we continue to work this issue aggressively. 
As I mentioned a moment ago, our refining operations were very good. We ran reliably during the quarter and experienced very little unplanned downtime. We completed major turnarounds at our Port Arthur and Ardmore refineries, which our teams planned very well and executed safely and successfully, and we'll be wrapping up the restart process over the next few days. 
Our ethanol business performed very well, recording its highest operating income contribution since the fourth quarter of 2014. Our plans are the most competitive in the industry and run by dedicated people. So it's great to see them again contributing to Valero's earnings in a meaningful way.
Regarding strategic investments, we're pleased to have both our new crude units up and running. The Corpus Christi crude unit, which was completed late last year, and the Houston crude unit, which was completed in June, both ran well during the quarter.
Turning to the development of our Houston Appalachian unit. The project is in the engineering and procurement phase and on track for completion in the first half of 2019. The economics of this project look good, given the tight outlook for octane, and it also positions us well for Tier 3 gasoline compliance. 
Looking ahead to 2017, we expect spending on capital investments to be similar to the budget for 2016, which was $2.6 billion.
I also want to share an update on our portfolio. Effective October 1, we disposed of our Aruba business. We've been on the island and in the community for a long time and worked hard to produce a win-win for Valero and the government of Aruba. In addition, the government of Aruba secured a new operator who plans to invest capital in the site and operate it as a bitumen upgrader, which should have a positive economic impact on the community. We're happy for the people of Aruba and for the assets to have a renewed purpose on the island.
With respect to Valero Energy Partners, the drop-down of the Meraux and Three Rivers Terminals in September helped us achieve our drop-down target for the year. Yesterday, we announced the distribution increase of 5.5% for the third quarter, which puts us on track to deliver 25% distribution growth through 2017. Although we don't plan to provide drop-down guidance for 2017 at this time, we are comfortable setting the target for annual distribution growth for 2018 of at least 20%. You'll hear more from VLP on their call later this week, but VLP's excellent operations is in great shape. 
And finally, despite significant turnarounds during the quarter and the low-margin environment, we generated solid cash flow from operations. So far this year, we've returned 148% of net income to stockholders, and we're well ahead of our 75% payout ratio target for the year. We're also extending our payout ratio target of at least 75% of net income to 2017. 
So with that, John, I'll hand the call back over to you."

For the quarter, net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $613 million or $1.33 per share, which compares to $1.4 billion or $2.79 per share in the third quarter of 2015.

For the quarter, net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $613 million or $1.33 per share, which compares to $1.4 billion or $2.79 per share in the third quarter of 2015. Excluding an income tax benefit of $42 million or $0.09 per share related to the Aruba disposition, third quarter 2016 adjusted net income was $571 million or $1.24 per share. 
Please refer to the reconciliations of actual to adjusted amounts that begin on Page 3 of the earnings release tables. 
Operating income for the refining segment in the third quarter of 2016 was $990 million, which was $1.3 billion lower than the third quarter of 2015. Primary drivers of the decline were weaker gasoline and distillate margins due to elevated product inventories, lower discounts for most sweet and sour crude oils relative to Brent crude oil, and higher RIN prices.
Refining throughput volumes averaged 2.9 million barrels per day in the third quarter of 2016, which was in line with the third quarter of 2015. Our refineries operated at 95% throughput capacity utilization, with major turnarounds that occurred at the Port Arthur and Ardmore refineries. Both refineries are currently in the process of restarting operations.
Refining cash operating expenses of $3.63 per barrel in the third quarter of 2016 were $0.17 per barrel lower compared to the third quarter of 2015, primarily due to lower employee-related expenses and adjustments related to the Aruba disposition.
The ethanol segment generated $106 million of operating income in the third quarter of 2016, which was $71 million higher than in the third quarter of 2015, largely due to higher gross margin per gallon resulting from lower corn prices. 
For the third quarter of 2016, general and administrative expenses, excluding corporate depreciation, were $192 million, and net interest expense was $115 million. Depreciation and amortization expense was $470 million, and the effective tax rate was 18% in the third quarter of 2016. The effective tax rate was lower than expected and lower than the third quarter of 2015, primarily due to income tax benefit on the Aruba disposition and the favorable settlement of an income tax audit.
With respect to our balance sheet, at quarter end, total debt was $9 billion, and cash and temporary cash investments were $5.9 billion. Valero's debt-to-capitalization ratio, net of $2 billion in cash, was 25%. We had approximately $5 billion of available liquidity, excluding cash. 
We generated $863 million of cash from operating activities in the third quarter, which was after the impact of $176 million of unfavorable working capital changes, primarily a decrease in accounts payable. With regard to investing activities, we made $453 million of capital investments. 
Moving to financing activities. We returned $778 million in cash to stockholders in the third quarter, which included $276 million in dividend payments and $502 million for the purchase of 9.2 million shares of Valero common stock. We completed a $1.25 billion public debt offering in September, and in October, we repaid $950 million of senior notes due in 2017. On a pro forma basis, after the repayment, our debt-to-capital ratio was 22%. 
Our Board of Directors approved an incremental $2.5 billion share repurchase authorization in September, and at quarter end, we had approximately $2.7 billion of repurchase authorization remaining.
For 2016, we expect capital investments to total about $2.4 billion, which is slightly below our previous guidance due to lower turnaround cost and the timing of some growth CapEx spend. For modeling our fourth quarter operations, we expect throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges: U.S. Gulf Coast at 1.58 million to 1.63 million barrels per day; U.S. Mid-Continent at 420,000 to 440,000 barrels per day; U.S. West Coast at 270,000 to 290,000 barrels per day; and the North Atlantic at 450,000 to 470,000 barrels per day. 
Refining cash operating expenses are estimated at approximately $3.75 per barrel in the fourth quarter. We continued to expect costs attributed to meeting our biofuel blending obligations, primarily related to RINs in the United States, to be between $750 million and $850 million for 2016. 
Our ethanol segment is expected to produce a total of 3.9 million gallons per day. Operating expenses should average $0.38 per gallon, which includes $0.05 per gallon for noncash costs such as depreciation and amortization. 
G&A expenses for the fourth quarter, excluding corporate depreciation, are expected to be about $200 million, and net interest expense should be about $150 million. Total depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately $465 million, and our effective tax rate should be around 31%.
That concludes our opening remarks. [Operator Instructions]"

I think that we will need to see some economic RIN cuts in the industry. If you look at what's happened in the market, Chicago has been selling off fairly sharply over the last week, and we're starting to see inventories build in the Mid-Continent. And so, typically, especially in that land loss region, the market is short. Product in the summer and becomes long product in the winter. And I think refineries in that region will need to cut to balance the market as we move into the fourth and first quarters. Elsewhere, I think a lot of what you saw last year in terms of refiners running high on utilization and producing summer-grade gasoline was really a function of the steep carry in the market. And certainly, at least in the Brent curve, it's a lot flatter this year than what we saw last year. And I think as there's not as much carry in the market, it will go ahead and cause refiners to cut down on utilization and avoid some of the products' builds that we saw last year."

So as an industry, let me just say this, the independent refiners, AFPM and certainly Valero, we're working with them to help them understand the issue certainly as we see it. And there's a clear acknowledgment that we've got a situation that needs to be resolved. Now as far as the political climate, what, we're a couple of weeks away from the election. And although we would love to see something change this year, I don't know that we'll get that, but it's certainly receiving enough attention, and it is being discussed to the point where we believe that it's getting worked and that we should have some type of resolution or relief in the not-too-near future."

So I don't know that we'll see any real impact on exports even if they have the cuts. But overall, the world is still oversupplied with oil, and we expect we'll see greater exports from Nigeria, Libya, Kazakhstan, Iraq and Brazil. So we still feel like on the crude feedstock side, you're going to have this competition between medium sour crudes and light sweet, whether competing for available refining capacity, which will cause the medium sour discounts to be wide. And then with additional exports from Canada and South America on the heavy side, the heavies are going to have to compete with medium sours, and so we expect good discounts there. That's kind of a view of the crude markets. On the product side, I think -- we think that the gasoline market, as long as you're in this low-price environment, you'll continue to see good demand response on gasoline. And then on distillate, we expect a little bit more normal winter weather in both the United States and Northwest Europe will help the distillate market, along with some recovery and economic growth, and we'll see a little bit stronger distillate cracks going into next year.

And then, second question just want to follow up on your comments around, I guess, export demand for refined products and maybe a few different angles here. I guess we're surprised that it actually held up this strong just because we continue to hear about the loaded stockpiles globally. Anecdotally, you hear about Chinese gasoline cargoes hitting the east coast of the U.S. and so, clearly, a lot of product out there. I guess, I'm just wondering how sustainable or how sustainable that demand is, if you can give us some granularity on where that pull is coming from?

But that's not the way this business functions. And because we've made the commitment to the dividend, we're very careful with it. We've also told you guys we're not going to sit here and accumulate cash. And that's why we've gone ahead and exceeded the payout ratio target of 75% because we've had stronger cash flows than we had anticipated. And so we've gone ahead and used the funds accordingly. We have a lot of discipline around the capital budgeting process, and you're not going to see that whipsaw significantly.

During the quarter, our team again operated safely and reliably and did a good job of capturing margin in a low, but improving margin environment.

During the quarter, our team again operated safely and reliably and did a good job of capturing margin in a low, but improving margin environment. We also executed our projects well, completing major turnarounds and progressing on growth investments, while optimizing our portfolio. These actions enabled us to produce positive cash flow and to return a healthy amount of cash to stockholders.
In the market, we continued to see solid product demand domestically and internationally. The sustained low price of crude oil and petroleum products, along with strong export demand, helped create a pull on domestic product inventories. We're also encouraged by the modest return of domestic shale crude production, which is good for diesel demand and crude differentials. On the downside, we continue to see negative impacts on Valero's earnings from exorbitant RINs prices. For the year, we expect to incur costs in the range of $750 million to $850 million to purchase RINs. At these levels, the expense is significant to our company and has our full attention. 
You've likely seen that we filed a petition with the EPA to address this issue. Our efforts are focused on moving the point of obligation, which we believe will not only level the playing field among refiners and retailers, but will also improve the penetration of renewable fuels, reduce RIN fraud, lower RIN speculation and reduce costs for the consumer. We have had many constructive conversations with regulators, and these conversations continue to today. And as you'd expect, we continue to work this issue aggressively. 
As I mentioned a moment ago, our refining operations were very good. We ran reliably during the quarter and experienced very little unplanned downtime. We completed major turnarounds at our Port Arthur and Ardmore refineries, which our teams planned very well and executed safely and successfully, and we'll be wrapping up the restart process over the next few days. 
Our ethanol business performed very well, recording its highest operating income contribution since the fourth quarter of 2014. Our plants are the most competitive in the industry and run by dedicated people. So it's great to see them again contributing to Valero's earnings in a meaningful way.
Regarding strategic investments, we're pleased to have both our new crude units up and running. The Corpus Christi crude unit, which was completed late last year, and the Houston crude unit, which was completed in June, both ran well during the quarter.
Turning to the development of our Houston Appalachian unit. The project is in the engineering and procurement phase and on track for completion in the first half of 2019. The economics of this project look good, given the tight outlook for octane, and it also positions us well for Tier 3 gasoline compliance. 
Looking ahead to 2017, we expect spending on capital investments to be similar to the budget for 2016, which was $2.6 billion.
I also want to share an update on our portfolio. Effective October 1, we disposed of our Aruba business. We've been on the island and in the community for a long time and worked hard to produce a win-win for Valero and the government of Aruba. In addition, the government of Aruba secured a new operator who plans to invest capital in the site and operate it as a bitumen upgrader, which should have a positive economic impact on the community. We're happy for the people of Aruba and for the assets to have a renewed purpose on the island.
With respect to Valero Energy Partners, the drop-down of the Meraux and Three Rivers Terminals in September helped us achieve our drop-down target for the year. Yesterday, we announced the distribution increase of 5.5% for the third quarter, which puts us on track to deliver 25% distribution growth through 2017. Although we don't plan to provide drop-down guidance for 2017 at this time, we are comfortable setting the target for annual distribution growth for 2018 of at least 20%. You'll hear more from VLP on their call later this week, but VLP's excellent operations is in great shape. 
And finally, despite significant turnarounds during the quarter and the low-margin environment, we generated solid cash flow from operations. So far this year, we've returned 148% of net income to stockholders, and we're well ahead of our 75% payout ratio target for the year. We're also extending our payout ratio target of at least 75% of net income to 2017. 
So with that, John, I'll hand the call back over to you."

For the quarter, net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $613 million or $1.33 per share, which compares to $1.4 billion or $2.79 per share in the third quarter of 2015.

For the quarter, net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $613 million or $1.33 per share, which compares to $1.4 billion or $2.79 per share in the third quarter of 2015. Excluding an income tax benefit of $42 million or $0.09 per share related to the Aruba disposition, third quarter 2016 adjusted net income was $571 million or $1.24 per share. 
Please refer to the reconciliations of actual to adjusted amounts that begin on Page 3 of the earnings release tables. 
Operating income for the refining segment in the third quarter of 2016 was $990 million, which was $1.3 billion lower than the third quarter of 2015. Primary drivers of the decline were weaker gasoline and distillate margins due to elevated product inventories, lower discounts for most sweet and sour crude oils relative to Brent crude oil, and higher RIN prices.
Refining throughput volumes averaged 2.9 million barrels per day in the third quarter of 2016, which was in line with the third quarter of 2015. Our refineries operated at 95% throughput capacity utilization, with major turnarounds that occurred at the Port Arthur and Ardmore refineries. Both refineries are currently in the process of restarting operations.
Refining cash operating expenses of $3.63 per barrel in the third quarter of 2016 were $0.17 per barrel lower compared to the third quarter of 2015, primarily due to lower employee-related expenses and adjustments related to the Aruba disposition.
The ethanol segment generated $106 million of operating income in the third quarter of 2016, which was $71 million higher than in the third quarter of 2015, largely due to higher gross margin per gallon resulting from lower corn prices. 
For the third quarter of 2016, general and administrative expenses, excluding corporate depreciation, were $192 million, and net interest expense was $115 million. Depreciation and amortization expense was $470 million, and the effective tax rate was 18% in the third quarter of 2016. The effective tax rate was lower than expected and lower than the third quarter of 2015, primarily due to income tax benefit on the Aruba disposition and the favorable settlement of an income tax audit.
With respect to our balance sheet, at quarter end, total debt was $9 billion, and cash and temporary cash investments were $5.9 billion. Valero's debt-to-capitalization ratio, net of $2 billion in cash, was 25%. We had approximately $5 billion of available liquidity, excluding cash. 
We generated $863 million of cash from operating activities in the third quarter, which was after the impact of $176 million of unfavorable working capital changes, primarily a decrease in accounts payable. With regard to investing activities, we made $453 million of capital investments. 
Moving to financing activities. We returned $778 million in cash to stockholders in the third quarter, which included $276 million in dividend payments and $502 million for the purchase of 9.2 million shares of Valero common stock. We completed a $1.25 billion public debt offering in September, and in October, we repaid $950 million of senior notes due in 2017. On a pro forma basis, after the repayment, our debt-to-capital ratio was 22%. 
Our Board of Directors approved an incremental $2.5 billion share repurchase authorization in September, and at quarter end, we had approximately $2.7 billion of repurchase authorization remaining.
For 2016, we expect capital investments to total about $2.4 billion, which is slightly below our previous guidance due to lower turnaround cost and the timing of some growth CapEx spend. For modeling our fourth quarter operations, we expect throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges: U.S. Gulf Coast at 1.58 million to 1.63 million barrels per day; U.S. Mid-Continent at 420,000 to 440,000 barrels per day; U.S. West Coast at 270,000 to 290,000 barrels per day; and the North Atlantic at 450,000 to 470,000 barrels per day. 
Refining cash operating expenses are estimated at approximately $3.75 per barrel in the fourth quarter. We continued to expect costs attributed to meeting our biofuel blending obligations, primarily related to RINs in the United States, to be between $750 million and $850 million for 2016. 
Our ethanol segment is expected to produce a total of 3.9 million gallons per day. Operating expenses should average $0.38 per gallon, which includes $0.05 per gallon for noncash costs such as depreciation and amortization. 
G&A expenses for the fourth quarter, excluding corporate depreciation, are expected to be about $200 million, and net interest expense should be about $150 million. Total depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately $465 million, and our effective tax rate should be around 31%.
That concludes our opening remarks. [Operator Instructions]"

I think that we will need to see some economic RIN cuts in the industry. If you look at what's happened in the market, Chicago has been selling off fairly sharply over the last week, and we're starting to see inventories build in the Mid-Continent. And so, typically, especially in that land locked region, the market is short. Product in the summer and becomes long product in the winter. And I think refineries in that region will need to cut to balance the market as we move into the fourth and first quarters. Elsewhere, I think a lot of what you saw last year in terms of refiners running high on utilization and producing summer-grade gasoline was really a function of the steep carry in the market. And certainly, at least in the Brent curve, it's a lot flatter this year than what we saw last year. And I think as there's not as much carry in the market, it will go ahead and cause refiners to cut down on utilization and avoid some of the products' builds that we saw last year."

So I don't know that we'll see any real impact on exports even if they have the cuts. But overall, the world is still oversupplied with oil, and we expect we'll see greater exports from Nigeria, Libya, Kazakhstan, Iraq and Brazil. So we still feel like on the crude or feedstock side, you're going to have this competition between medium sour crudes and light sweet, whether competing for available refining capacity, which will cause the medium sour discounts to be wide. And then with additional exports from Canada and South America on the heavy side, the heavies are going to have to compete with medium sours, and so we expect good discounts there. That's kind of a view of the crude markets. On the product side, I think -- we think that the gasoline market, as long as you're in this low-price environment, you'll continue to see good demand response on gasoline. And then on distillate, we expect a little bit more normal winter weather in both the United States and Northwest Europe will help the distillate market, along with some recovery and economic growth, and we'll see a little bit stronger distillate cracks going into next year.

But it was -- it's hard to say that, okay, all the incremental income produced from growth projects is going to go into the dividend. If we knew what margins were going to be in 2 months, if we were selling something where we could set the price and set the margin, and just the only issue is how much are you going to manufacture. it'd be wonderful. But that's not the way this business functions. And because we've made the commitment to the dividend, we're very careful with it. We've also told you guys we're not going to sit here and accumulate cash. And that's why we've gone ahead and exceeded the payout ratio target of 75% because we've had stronger cash flows than we had anticipated. And so we've gone ahead and used the funds accordingly. We have a lot of discipline around the capital budgeting process, and you're not going to see that whipsaw significantly. So it's not like Lane and Gary and Rich are running out trying to find another $1.5 billion of capital project so that we can spend the money. So anyway, I think, you should expect consistent performance from us on this. And again, we will continue to look at the dividend, and I would expect, as Mike said, that we would continue to try to increase the dividend. But we're not preparing to commit to it right now."

Paul, from my perspective, it's a very simple point of view. It is, you create a situation where the obligation and the point of compliance are 2 different points, and they shouldn't be. And so it's -- by moving the point of obligation, obviously, we align the natural point of compliance with the natural point of obligation. And a lot of this speculation in the RINs market goes away.

And then, I guess, that would introduce another list of possibilities on the return of cash side. And maybe if you could talk about how those 2 things are linked too?"

But I'm not going to say that there's not the possibility that somehow our growth CapEx will fall, but those -- we have plenty of sort of small fast-hitting projects that compete in that space. And you also got to remember, we have a strategic -- we're strategically trying to get the right -- work on our secondary costs through building those assets and dropping them into the MLP.

During the quarter, our team again operated safely and reliably and did a good job of capturing margin in a low, but improving margin environment. We also executed our projects well, completing major turnarounds and progressing on growth investments, while optimizing our portfolio. These actions enabled us to produce positive cash flow and to return a healthy amount of cash to stockholders.
In the market, we continued to see solid product demand domestically and internationally. The sustained low price of crude oil and petroleum products, along with strong export demand, helped create a pull on domestic product inventories. We're also encouraged by the modest return of domestic shale crude production, which is good for diesel demand and crude differentials. On the downside, we continue to see negative impacts on Valero's earnings from exorbitant RINs prices. For the year, we expect to incur costs in the range of $750 million to $850 million to purchase RINs. At these levels, the expense is significant to our company and has our full attention. 
You've likely seen that we filed a petition with the EPA to address this issue. Our efforts are focused on moving the point of obligation, which we believe will not only level the playing field among refiners and retailers, but will also improve the penetration of renewable fuels, reduce RIN fraud, lower RIN speculation and reduce costs for the consumer. We have had many constructive conversations with regulators, and these conversations continue to today. And as you'd expect, we continue to work this issue aggressively. 
As I mentioned a moment ago, our refining operations were very good. We ran reliably during the quarter and experienced very little unplanned downtime. We completed major turnarounds at our Port Arthur and Ardmore refineries, which our teams planned very well and executed safely and successfully, and we'll be wrapping up the restart process over the next few days. 
Our ethanol business performed very well, recording its highest operating income contribution since the fourth quarter of 2014. Our plants are the most competitive in the industry and run by dedicated people. So it's great to see them again contributing to Valero's earnings in a meaningful way.
Regarding strategic investments, we're pleased to have both our new crude units up and running. The Corpus Christi crude unit, which was completed late last year, and the Houston crude unit, which was completed in June, both ran well during the quarter.
Turning to the development of our Houston Appalachian unit. The project is in the engineering and procurement phase and on track for completion in the first half of 2019. The economics of this project look good, given the tight outlook for octane, and it also positions us well for Tier 3 gasoline compliance. 
Looking ahead to 2017, we expect spending on capital investments to be similar to the budget for 2016, which was $2.6 billion.
I also want to share an update on our portfolio. Effective October 1, we disposed of our Aruba business. We've been on the island and in the community for a long time and worked hard to produce a win-win for Valero and the government of Aruba. In addition, the government of Aruba secured a new operator who plans to invest capital in the site and operate it as a bitumen upgrader, which should have a positive economic impact on the community. We're happy for the people of Aruba and for the assets to have a renewed purpose on the island.
With respect to Valero Energy Partners, the drop-down of the Meraux and Three Rivers Terminals in September helped us achieve our drop-down target for the year. Yesterday, we announced the distribution increase of 5.5% for the third quarter, which puts us on track to deliver 25% distribution growth through 2017. Although we don't plan to provide drop-down guidance for 2017 at this time, we are comfortable setting the target for annual distribution growth for 2018 of at least 20%. You'll hear more from VLP on their call later this week, but VLP's excellent operations is in great shape. 
And finally, despite significant turnarounds during the quarter and the low-margin environment, we generated solid cash flow from operations. So far this year, we've returned 148% of net income to stockholders, and we're well ahead of our 75% payout ratio target for the year. We're also extending our payout ratio target of at least 75% of net income to 2017. 
So with that, John, I'll hand the call back over to you."

For the quarter, net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $613 million or $1.33 per share, which compares to $1.4 billion or $2.79 per share in the third quarter of 2015.

For the quarter, net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $613 million or $1.33 per share, which compares to $1.4 billion or $2.79 per share in the third quarter of 2015. Excluding an income tax benefit of $42 million or $0.09 per share related to the Aruba disposition, third quarter 2016 adjusted net income was $571 million or $1.24 per share. 
Please refer to the reconciliations of actual to adjusted amounts that begin on Page 3 of the earnings release tables. 
Operating income for the refining segment in the third quarter of 2016 was $990 million, which was $1.3 billion lower than the third quarter of 2015. Primary drivers of the decline were weaker gasoline and distillate margins due to elevated product inventories, lower discounts for most sweet and sour crude oils relative to Brent crude oil, and higher RIN prices.
Refining throughput volumes averaged 2.9 million barrels per day in the third quarter of 2016, which was in line with the third quarter of 2015. Our refineries operated at 95% throughput capacity utilization, with major turnarounds that occurred at the Port Arthur and Ardmore refineries. Both refineries are currently in the process of restarting operations.
Refining cash operating expenses of $3.63 per barrel in the third quarter of 2016 were $0.17 per barrel lower compared to the third quarter of 2015, primarily due to lower employee-related expenses and adjustments related to the Aruba disposition.
The ethanol segment generated $106 million of operating income in the third quarter of 2016, which was $71 million higher than in the third quarter of 2015, largely due to higher gross margin per gallon resulting from lower corn prices. 
For the third quarter of 2016, general and administrative expenses, excluding corporate depreciation, were $192 million, and net interest expense was $115 million. Depreciation and amortization expense was $470 million, and the effective tax rate was 18% in the third quarter of 2016. The effective tax rate was lower than expected and lower than the third quarter of 2015, primarily due to income tax benefit on the Aruba disposition and the favorable settlement of an income tax audit.
With respect to our balance sheet, at quarter end, total debt was $9 billion, and cash and temporary cash investments were $5.9 billion. Valero's debt-to-capitalization ratio, net of $2 billion in cash, was 25%. We had approximately $5 billion of available liquidity, excluding cash. 
We generated $863 million of cash from operating activities in the third quarter, which was after the impact of $176 million of unfavorable working capital changes, primarily a decrease in accounts payable. With regard to investing activities, we made $453 million of capital investments. 
Moving to financing activities. We returned $778 million in cash to stockholders in the third quarter, which included $276 million in dividend payments and $502 million for the purchase of 9.2 million shares of Valero common stock. We completed a $1.25 billion public debt offering in September, and in October, we repaid $950 million of senior notes due in 2017. On a pro forma basis, after the repayment, our debt-to-capital ratio was 22%. 
Our Board of Directors approved an incremental $2.5 billion share repurchase authorization in September, and at quarter end, we had approximately $2.7 billion of repurchase authorization remaining.
For 2016, we expect capital investments to total about $2.4 billion, which is slightly below our previous guidance due to lower turnaround cost and the timing of some growth CapEx spend. For modeling our fourth quarter operations, we expect throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges: U.S. Gulf Coast at 1.58 million to 1.63 million barrels per day; U.S. Mid-Continent at 420,000 to 440,000 barrels per day; U.S. West Coast at 270,000 to 290,000 barrels per day; and the North Atlantic at 450,000 to 470,000 barrels per day. 
Refining cash operating expenses are estimated at approximately $3.75 per barrel in the fourth quarter. We continued to expect costs attributed to meeting our biofuel blending obligations, primarily related to RINs in the United States, to be between $750 million and $850 million for 2016. 
Our ethanol segment is expected to produce a total of 3.9 million gallons per day. Operating expenses should average $0.38 per gallon, which includes $0.05 per gallon for noncash costs such as depreciation and amortization. 
G&A expenses for the fourth quarter, excluding corporate depreciation, are expected to be about $200 million, and net interest expense should be about $150 million. Total depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately $465 million, and our effective tax rate should be around 31%.
That concludes our opening remarks. [Operator Instructions]"

And so, typically, especially in that land locked region, the market is short. Product in the summer and becomes long product in the winter. And I think refineries in that region will need to cut to balance the market as we move into the fourth and first quarters. Elsewhere, I think a lot of what you saw last year in terms of refiners running high on utilization and producing summer-grade gasoline was really a function of the steep carry in the market. And certainly, at least in the Brent curve, it's a lot flatter this year than what we saw last year. And I think as there's not as much carry in the market, it will go ahead and cause refiners to cut down on utilization and avoid some of the products' builds that we saw last year."

And then with additional exports from Canada and South America on the heavy side, the heavies are going to have to compete with medium sours, and so we expect good discounts there.

There's so many reasons that it's high right now, but it is clearly -- those with length are taking advantage of those that are short. And we're seeing that in the speculation in the market.

Secondly, the AFPM did also file, and their petition is similar to ours to move the point of obligation. So your third question is, is everybody in the industry of a like mind on this? The answer would be no. And I think it depends on where you happen to sit. If you're long RINs with a more integrated system through retail, I think you're going to be a lot more comfortable with the status quo. And if you're an independent refiner or a retail marketer that doesn't have the ability to move up the rack, then you're going to want to see this point of obligation moved. Paul, from my perspective, it's a very simple point of view. It is, you create a situation where the obligation and the point of compliance are 2 different points, and they shouldn't be. And so it's -- by moving the point of obligation, obviously, we align the natural point of compliance with the natural point of obligation. And a lot of this speculation in the RINs market goes away. People will not be incentivized to build inventories of RINs, but hold out for higher prices to squeeze the shorts as we've seen. So anyway, I think I answered you, which..."
