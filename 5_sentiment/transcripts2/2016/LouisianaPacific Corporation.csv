Thank you for joining our conference call to discuss LP's financial results for the fourth quarter of 2015 and the full year 2015. I am Sallie Bailey, LP's Chief Financial Officer; and with me today are Scott",1952,"Thank you very much, Ashley, and good morning. Thank you for joining our conference call to discuss LP's financial results for the fourth quarter of 2015 and the full year 2015. I am Sallie Bailey, LP's Chief Financial Officer; and with me today are Scott Stevens, LP's Chief Executive Officer; as well as Mike Kinney and Becky Barkley, our primary Investor Relations contact. I will begin the discussion with a review of the financial results for the fourth quarter and the full year results for 2015. This will be followed by some comments on the performance of the individual segments and selected balance sheet items. 
After I finish my remarks, Curt will discuss the general market environment in which LP has been operating, provide his perspective on our operating results and give some thoughts on the outlook. As we have done in the past, we have opened up this call to the public and are doing a webcast. And that webcast can be accessed at www.lpcorp.com. Additionally, to help with the discussions, we are provided a presentation with supplemental information that should be reviewed in conjunction with the earnings release. I will be refreshing the slides this morning in my comments. We filed an 8-K this morning with some supplemental information and we plan to file our 10-K in the next few weeks. 
I want to remind all the participants about the forward-looking statements comment on Slide 2 of the presentation. And please also be aware of the discussion of our use of non-GAAP financial information included on Slide 3 of the presentation. The appendix attached to the presentation has some of the necessary reconciliations, which have been supplemented by the Form 8-K filing we made this morning. Rather than reading these 2 statements I corporate them with this reference. A 16% improvement in OSB price in the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter 2015 and positive adjusted EBITDA for all 4 segments contributed to strong earnings for the fourth quarter of 2015. On a non-GAAP annual basis, LP recorded 2% lower sales, for a 52% higher adjusted EBITDA. We exited 2015 with lean OSB finished goods inventory, low raw material cost and a favorable U.S. dollar versus Canadian dollar exchange rate. We are well-positioned in 2016 to take advantage of the ongoing U.S. housing -- the ongoing recovery in U.S. housing. Here are some details behind our earnings reports. 
Moving to Slide 4 of the presentation for a discussion of the fourth quarter and full year 2015 consolidated results. We are reporting net sales of $463 million for the fourth quarter of 2015, a 2% increase from the net sales of $454 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2014. In the fourth quarter, we recorded a net loss of $8 million or a loss per diluted share of $0.05 compared to a net loss of $43 million or a loss per diluted share of $0.30 in the fourth quarter of 2014. The adjusted income from continuing operations for the quarter was $1 million or $0.01 per diluted share, based upon a normalized tax rate of 35% as compared to a loss of $32 million or loss per diluted share of $0.23 recorded in the fourth quarter of 2014. 
Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations were $34 million in the quarter compared to negative adjusted EBITDA of $17 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded a net loss of $88 million or loss per diluted share of $0.62 compared to a loss of $75 million or a loss per diluted share of $0.53 for 2014. The adjusted loss for the year was $46 million or a loss of $0.32 per diluted share based upon the normalized tax rate of 35% compared to a loss of $60 million or $0.42 loss per diluted share in 2014. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $67 million for 2015 compared to $44 million in 2014. 
Now moving on to Slide 5 and a review of our segment results, starting with OSB. OSB recorded net sales for the fourth quarter of 2015 of $206 million, slightly higher than the $203 million in net sales recorded in the fourth quarter of 2014. OSB reported operating income of $11 million compared to a loss of $29 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. This is the first quarter of operating income in our OSB segment's since the fourth quarter of 2013. And adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations for the quarter was a positive $25 million compared to negative $15 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Pricing from OSB was higher by 10%, which resulted in an improved operating result by $18 million. In an addition to the improved OSB price, results benefited from reductions in raw material costs as well as the positive impact of the Canadian currency incurred by Canadian operation as compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. 
For the fourth quarter of 2015, the average of the U.S. Canadian exchange rate was $0.75 as compared to $0.88 in the fourth quarter of 2014. For the full year, OSB recorded operating sales of $808 million compared to $855 million, down 6% from the prior year. And we recorded an operating loss of $46 million compared to $53 million in 2014. Adjusted EBITDA for 2015 was $12 million compared to $4 million in 2014. Sales volumes increased 2% and prices decreased 7%. The decrease in selling price unfavorably impacted operating results by $61 million. Offsetting the reduction in sales price for the year was a reduction of raw material cost relates petroleum based of raw materials and a positive impact of Canadian currency exchange rates on the cost incurred by Canadian operation as compared to the prior year. For the full year of 2015, the average U.S. dollar Canadian exchange rate was $0.78 as compared to $0.91 in 2014. 
On Slide 6, we reported the results of the siding business. This segment includes our SmartSide and CanExel signing products as well as a minor amount of OSB. Our Siding segment had a record sales and a record year for sale, operating income and adjusted EBITDA. For the fourth quarter of 2015, the Siding segment reported sales of $141 million, operating income of $14 million and adjusted EBITDA of $19 million, all comparable to the fourth quarter of 2014. For the quarter, SmartSide average sales were up 2% and volumes decreased 5%. Volumes increased in of our SmartSide siding line due to customers continue to rebalance our inventory based upon expected housing starts and labor availability, which has slowed in housing completion. 
During the third quarter of 2015, we began the conversion of our smart value OSB mill to a SmartSide mill. During the majority of the fourth quarter, this mill was not operational. It is estimated that the additional cost incurred at the Swan Valley facility during the fourth quarter related to that conversion as well as market related downtime was approximately $6 million. For the year, the Siding segment reported sales of $636 million, an increase of 3% from $617 million reported in 2014. Siding segment reported operating income of $93 million compared to $80 million and adjusted EBITDA of $114 million as compared to $98 million in 2014. The estimated impact of the additional cost incurred at the Swan Valley facility for the full year is approximately $11 million. 
Now please turn to Slide 7 of the presentation, which shows the results of our Engineered Wood Products. This segments includes I-Joist laminates/lumbar laminates, near lumber OSB produced at our main facility plus other related products. This segment also includes the sale of I-Joist and LVL products produced by the joint venture are under sales arrangement with Murphy Plywood. The Engineered Wood Products segment reported sales of $75 million in the fourth quarter 2015, up from $66 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Segments results were breakeven in the fourth quarter of '15 as compared to a loss of $6 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. For the fourth quarter of 2015, adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was positive $3 million as compared to negative $4 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. The best quarter in EWP versus since the third quarter of 2014. Volumes of I-Joist were up 21%, while volumes of LVL and were up 29% compared to the same quarter last year. Pricing was lower by 1% in LVL and LSL and higher by 5% -- I'm sorry, higher by 4% in I-Joist. During the quarter and the full year of 2015, which in the mix of OSB products at a halt in operations, Manufacturing more value-added OSB and less commodity products. The impact of this change resulted in improving operating result of $800,000 in the quarter and $3.5 million for the full year. 
For the year, sales were $286 million, up from $281 million in 2014. The segment's operating loss in 2015 was $7 million as compared to $14 million in the same period of 2014. Adjusted EBITDA improved to $6 million for 2015 from breakeven in 2014. 
Moving on to Slide 8 of the presentation. For the quarter, our South American segment recorded sales of $34 million as compared to $36 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Operating income is $3 million and adjusted EBITDA was $5 million for the fourth quarter of 2015, essentially flat with the fourth quarter of 2014. Volumes in Chile were up 9% and up 15% in Brazil compared to the same quarter last year. The sales volume increase in Chile was due to improved housing demand and the increase in Brazil was due to increased exports. Brazil continues to be in an economic recession with continued political appeal Pricing was down 12% in Chile and down 23% in Brazil. In local currency, Chile's pricing was up 3% with the same quarter in 2014 and Brazil's pricing was up 13%, primarily due to the impact of higher exports. For the year, our South American segment recorded sales of $135 million as compared to $150 million in 2014. Operating income was $10 million for 2015 compared to $11 million in 2014. And adjusted EBITDA declined to $18 million from $20 million in the same period of 2014. 
Total selling, general and administrative expenses were $38 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $41 million in the same quarter of 2014. For the quarter, as the decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses is primarily due to lower compensation expense. For the year, our selling, general and administrative expenses are higher at $153 million as compared to $150 million for 2014, primarily due to higher sales and marketing expenses. 
Please refer to Slide 9 of the presentation. As of December 31, 2015, we had cash, cash equivalents, investments and restricted cash of $455 million; working capital of $626 million; net cash of $88 million. And in addition to the $455 million of cash on our balance sheet, we had $200 million of availability on our credit facility. Capital expenditures for 2015 were $114 million. We are planning on spending between $120 million and $135 million in capital expenditures for 2016. Approximately $100 million has been allocated that North American project; 50% for growth and the remaining for capital maintenance and cost reduction project. The remaining $35 million has been allocated to our South American segment, primarily for the building of the third mill in Chile. And we anticipate that the South American capital expenditures will be funded by cash on hand in Chile as well as the local bank financing. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Curt for his comments"

Good morning to all of you and thanks for joining us on the call. Let me start with LP safety performance. For the full year, our total incident rate for recordable injuries or TIR was 0.47, which is the 10th-year in the role, which LP was 1.0. Now that impressive statistics that demonstrates LP's commitment to safety is there for the second year in a row that contractors that we use in our capital projects were injury free, a remarkable accomplishment. As I typically do on this call, we provide a few comments on our results and accomplishments in the fourth quarter and the year, discuss the housing market and give you my views for 2016. After that, I will turn it back over to Sally to take your questions. As Sally just reported, all of our segments recorded positive EBITDA in the fourth quarter. For the full year, our EBITDA improved by over 50%, despite a $62 million negative impact in both sales and EBITDA due to lower OSB prices than the prior year. 
As Sally also mentioned, we did benefit from lower raw materials cost in the favorable Canadian exchange rate. In our OSB business, we reacted to lower sales prices by holding our sales volumes relatively flat with lower production due to the conversion of Swan Valley siding in the second half of the year. We were able to shift the same amount by bringing down the inventory of finished goods across the system. This means that we entered the first quarter with very lean inventories, which should be beneficial as the building season resumes in a month or so. We had the most profitable year ever in our siding business with a 16% increase in EBITDA despite absorbing about $10 million cost in the second half of the year associated with the Swan Valley conversion. With Swan operating, we have unleashed our salesforce to return us to the growth way rate that we have demonstrated in the past. 
Engineer Wood with over $3 billion in EBITDA recorded the best quarterly results in many years. For the year, EWP adjusted EBITDA was almost $6 million compared to breakeven last year. In South America, we had another strong year, although reported results reflected a significant weakening of the Chilean peso of about 15% and the Brazilian real over 15% against U.S. dollar. Following approval by the various governmental agencies for environmental permit for the third mill in Chile last October, we did get through the mandatory waiting period. This is good news as we are in a sold-out position in Chile and we are seeing improving economies in Argentina and Colombia. I am anticipating that our board will approve this project next summer and the construction will begin shortly thereafter. 
The news about the housing market continues to be good. However, it is not been strong as forecasted. U.S. Census released their data on housing on January 20. For December, housing starts came in at $1.149 million, while our permits were higher $1.232 million. Other positive housing related news includes, while the rate of the household formation fell a bit in the fourth quarter, we did in last year with an average of 1.7 million household formations, which is significantly higher, more than double than the last few years. This could mean that the millennial are finally on the move. 
Medium home prices for the year were up 7.6% and December marked the 46th consecutive month of the year-over-year gains. First time homebuyers purchased about 30% of the existing homes in 2015 and this was up slightly from last year. The total inventory of housing for sale is 3% lower than a year ago, which is creating some shortages. On the financing side, average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rates were at 3.92 and this is for the week ending January 15. As we look at the consensus forecast for this year, currently stands at $1.263 million is about 14% increase over last year. The consensus for 2017 is $1.385 million, which is the further 10% increase. 
For LP, we are using a budget assumption of $1.2 million to $1.25 million for 2016. Nonresidential construction in area that we do participate in was up 9.3% through the end of November. The 5 most important subsectors for structural panel demand are commercial, offices, religious, healthcare and schools, registered an increase of 22% for office buildings and 5% for healthcare and religious buildings. 
Finally, sales of building materials and supply dealers were up about 4% in 2015 compared to the prior year. So our view for 2016, I just returned from the policy advisory board meeting of the Hardware Joint Center Housing Studies held in Washington D.C. earlier this week. While almost all the participants shared their view of the 2016 will continue to show that 10% to 12% growth in new housing and a continuation of demand in repair and modeling. To a person, the CEOs expressed this may surrounding the current political situation, frustration with financial markets and increasing concern about the more restrictive regulatory environment. 
So with that being said, I do share that as we look back at 2016 post election, I do believe that housing will be one of the few bright spots in the economy. For LP, January order rates were strong presiding in EWP and a bit muted for OSB as reflected by slightly declined price during the month. In the first part of January, we did have our annual sales meeting and also attended the international builders show in Las Vegas. At these 2 events, we had a chance to talk our field sales folks, builders and channel partners. I would summarize that the overwhelming settlement was cautious and optimized. Almost there was a feeling housing and repair model markets in 2016 will be stronger than 2015, but there are some headwinds. Based on the forecast, it does appear that multifamily housing will be a little over 35% of the mix in the U.S. for the next few years. Additionally, with the aging baby boomers and the explosion of the sharing economy like we are increasingly seeing builders single-family units as square footage to accommodate an elderly relative or short-term renter in a separate space. This probably showed up and that the average size of single-family new construction 2015 was the highest ever. 
In Canada, we did see decline in housing starts in the fourth quarter, primarily focused at lower multifamily starts in Ontario and a cut back in the provinces associated with Oil Sands. In 2015 starts were almost 200,000 units and we forecast this to be lower by about 5%. South America, the outlook continues to be mixed, brazil is clearly struggling, while the political situation and continued economic downturn. The bright spot for LP's operation in Brazil is that the dramatically lower Brazilian real has created some export opportunities for us. In Chile, lower copper prices heard the economy, but the government continues to take an active role in funding replacement housing that was destroyed by natural disasters, which benefits LP. Changing government in Argentina and the immediate relaxing of import, export controls, should lead to higher volumes into this country and the continued emergence of the Colombian economy also creates export demand for our products in South America. The retail demand both on Home Depot and Lowe's forecast the same store sales being in that 4% to 5% range for 2016. 
On the longer-term, there has been nothing and that has happened recently that has changed my outlook as I continue to believe that we have several more years of housing growth in front of us based on the under building during the last decade, population demographics in the slow rate of recovery so far. As I said in the past, the constraining factors to more immediate robust housing, labor at all levels, available lots and access to credit for the first time homebuyer. Again, as I said before, I believe the labor issue is based where the builders will ease either through increased employment or changing construction practices that will reduce the need for labor. The shortage continues to result in a multiple factors including the regulation, shortage demand employments and funding for infrastructure. 
On the financing side, we know there will be no significant changes after the 2016 elections. The Fed interest-rate hike in December had very little impact on mortgage rates and based on Fed Chairman's results or comments, yesterday, it looks like they will be very cautious and the custard additional rate hikes. The other interesting trend that is happening is the traditional depository banks with the exception of Wells Fargo have essentially withdrawn from the FHA mortgage market due to increased reserves, documentation requirements and continued litigation from federal and state regulators. The good news is new entrants like quicken loans with their Super Bowl commercials are taking up the slack. 
As we look at the forecast demand for our products, the challenges faced by builders in the emerging trends, there is much than LP can and is doing to take advantage of these opportunities. Let me give you some concrete examples. In single-family new construction, we had very good success in growing the barrier achieving brand to address energy requirements in a number of jurisdictions. We expect to continue this push. In the Urban interface zones in places like California and Colorado, the requirement for fire has given lift to our plane lock product. This is also true in Pennsylvania and Ohio where codes have changed related to fire burned through in the floors above unfinished basements. Our newly released flame back I-Joist addresses this need. In multifamily, these projects also require increased fire redundancy, acoustical performance and low maintenance durable siding. In January, I was joined by sessions of Alabama and other dignitaries at the groundbreaking of $15 million project to add flame block capability to our existing Heart County Alabama mill. This post processing facility will augment the capacity that we have available through our relationship with international bearer technologies. Not only does this meet the technical needs defined by the various billing codes, it also lowers the labor content as structural integrity and gives the architect more design flexibility. 
With our smart siding products include lap and builder multifamily projects are both best looking product available, but also the durability to survive harsh treatment for renters. In like commercial, our EWP products have long player role in this segment as the ease of use and design flexibility are critical to the architect and builder. At the recent international builder show, we introduced a sub street panel that can be used to replicate a stack of look with less cost and less labor. This is important both like commercial as well as like other areas like the Southwest where was a preferred finish. South America, we see very good opportunities to expand and grow our business there. 
As mentioned earlier, we have cleared all the necessary hurdles and our environmental permitting for a third mill in Chile. That will serve the domestic market as well as other countries on the continent. Our plan is to redeploy existing equipment as we  have done in the past to limit the capital investment to $55 million and $60 million. The timing of this construction is likely to be later this year. 
On the industrial side, we continue to develop products for markets beyond residential construction. In this category, we will include panels used in furniture manufacturing, various transportation applications and substrates used for decorative panels, cabinetry and then interior panels. So in conclusion, we continue to rise in housing activity, more normalized repair and modeling activity and new uses for our current products is good for our stakeholders as LP is well-positioned to capitalize on this growth. Further, we are committed to innovation to meet our customer needs and products, efficiencies and affordable costs. 
With that, let me turn it over to Sallie for Q&A."

So we really didn't have any more product to sell until the Swan Valley facility came online in the October, late October, early November timeframe, and we have been ramping up that production. So what we have been doing and comment I made is unleashing the salesforce that is back exactly what we did at the international or at the international sales meeting in early January. We have armed our salesforce with the tools necessary to get us back on the growth rate from the volume standpoint. I would hate to add though if you look at our record results from an EBITDA standpoint. I mean, on allocation, you do have the opportunity to high grade your customer mix, if you will, and that's exactly what our salesforce did. As you were able to take the product that we had available and get a higher price for that, that's why you saw the record EBITDA. So on 2016, the challenges to go back to probably some of those customers who we hydrated out of it, offer them the opportunity to participate in buying these products going forward and manage the gross margin along with the growth rates."

I will begin the discussion with a review of the financial results for the fourth quarter and the full year results for 2015.

After I finish my remarks, Curt will discuss the general market environment in which LP has been operating, provide his perspective on our operating results and give some thoughts on the outlook. 
As we have done in the past, we have opened up this call to the public and are doing a webcast. And that webcast can be accessed at www.lpcorp.com. 
Additionally, to help with the discussion, we have provided a presentation with supplemental information that should be reviewed in conjunction with the earnings release. I will be referencing these slides this morning in my comments.

I want to remind all of the participants about the forward-looking statements comment on Slide 2 of the presentation. And please also be aware of the discussion of our use of non-GAAP financial information included on Slide 3 of the presentation. The appendix attached to the presentation has some of the necessary reconciliations, which have been supplemented by the Form 8-K filing we made this morning. Rather than reading these 2 statements, I incorporate them with this reference. 
A 16% improvement in OSB pricing for the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter 2015 and positive adjusted EBITDA for all 4 segments contributed to stronger earnings for the fourth quarter of 2015. On a non-GAAP annual basis, LP recorded 2% lower sales but 52% higher adjusted EBITDA. We exited 2015 with lean OSB finished goods inventory, low raw material costs and a favorable U.S. dollar versus Canadian dollar exchange rate. We are well positioned in 2016 to take advantage of the ongoing U.S. housing -- the ongoing recovery in U.S. housing. 
Here are some details behind our earnings reports. Moving to Slide 4 of the presentation for a discussion of the fourth quarter and full year 2015 consolidated results. We are reporting net sales of $463 million for the fourth quarter of 2015, a 2% increase from the net sales of $454 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2014. 
In the fourth quarter, we recorded a net loss of $8 million or a loss per diluted share of $0.05 compared to a net loss of $43 million or a loss per diluted share of $0.30 in the fourth quarter of 2014. The adjusted income from continuing operations for the quarter was $1 million or $0.01 per diluted share based upon a normalized tax rate of 35% as compared to a loss of $32 million or a loss per diluted share of $0.23 recorded in the fourth quarter of 2014. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $34 million in the quarter compared to negative adjusted EBITDA of $17 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. 
For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded a net loss of $88 million or a loss per diluted share of $0.62 compared to a loss of $75 million or a loss per diluted share of $0.53 for 2014. The adjusted loss for the year was $46 million or a loss of $0.32 per diluted share based upon the normalized tax rate of 35% compared to a loss of $60 million or $0.42 loss per diluted share in 2014. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $67 million for 2015 compared to $44 million in 2014. 
Now moving on to Slide 5 and the review of our segment results, starting with OSB. OSB recorded net sales for the fourth quarter of 2015 of $206 million, slightly higher than the $203 million of net sales recorded in the fourth quarter of 2014. OSB reported operating income of $11 million compared to a loss of $29 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. This is the first quarter of operating income in our OSB segment since the fourth quarter of 2013. And adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations for the quarter was a positive $25 million compared to negative $15 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. 
Pricing at OSB was higher by 10%, which resulted in improved operating results by $18 million. And in addition to the improved OSB price, results benefited from reductions in raw material costs as well as the positive impact of the Canadian currency incurred by our Canadian operation as compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. For the fourth quarter of 2015, the average of the U.S.-Canadian exchange rate was $0.75 as compared to $0.88 in the fourth quarter of 2014. 
For the full year, OSB reported operating sales of $808 million compared to $855 million, down 6% from the prior year. And we recorded an operating loss of $46 million compared to $53 million in 2014. Adjusted EBITDA for 2015 was $12 million compared to $4 million in 2014. Sales volumes increased 2%, and prices decreased 7%. The decrease in selling price unfavorably impacted operating results by $61 million. Offsetting the reduction in sales price for the year was a reduction of raw material costs related to petroleum-based raw materials as well as the positive impact of the Canadian currency exchange rate on the costs incurred by our Canadian operation as compared to the prior year. For the full year of 2015, the average U.S. dollar-Canadian exchange rate was $0.78 as compared to $0.91 in 2014. 
On Slide 6, we reported the results of the Siding business. This segment includes our SmartSide and CanExel siding product as well as a minor amount of OSB. Our Siding segment had record sales -- had a record year for sales, operating income and adjusted EBITDA. 
For the fourth quarter of 2015, the Siding segment recorded sales of $141 million, operating income of $14 million and adjusted EBITDA of $19 million, all comparable to the fourth quarter of 2014. 
For the quarter, SmartSide average sales were up 2%, and volumes decreased 5%. Volumes decreased in our SmartSide siding line due to customers continuing to rebalance their inventories based upon expected housing starts and labor availability, which has slowed housing completion. 
During the third quarter of 2015, we began the conversion of our Swan Valley OSB mill to a SmartSide mill, and during the majority of the fourth quarter, this mill was not operational. It is estimated that the additional costs incurred at the Swan Valley facility during the fourth quarter related to that conversion as well as market-related downtime was approximately $6 million. 
For the year, the Siding segment reported sales of $636 million, an increase of 3% from $617 million reported in 2014. Siding segment reported operating income of $93 million compared to $80 million and adjusted EBITDA of $114 million as compared to $98 million in 2014. The estimated impact of the additional costs incurred at the Swan Valley facility for the full year is approximately $11 million. 
Now please turn to Slide 7 of the presentation, which shows the results of our Engineered Wood Products segment. This segment includes I-Joist laminates; Strand Lumber laminates; veneer lumber; OSB produced at our Houlton, Maine facility; plus other related products. This segment also includes the sale of I-Joist and LVL products produced by the Abitibi joint venture under a sales arrangement with Murphy Plywood. 
The Engineered Wood Products segment reported sales of $75 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, up from $66 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Segment's results were break-even in the fourth quarter of '15 as compared to a loss of $6 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. For the fourth quarter of 2015, adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations improved to $3 million as compared to negative $4 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, the best quarter in EWP since the third quarter of 2014. 
Volumes of I-Joist were up 21% while volumes of LVL and LSL were up 29% compared to the same quarter last year. Pricing was lower by 1% in LVL and LSL and higher by 5% -- I'm sorry, higher by 4% in I-Joist. 
During the quarter and the full year of 2015, we changed the mix of OSB products at our Houlton operations, manufacturing more value-added OSB and less commodity products. The impact of this change resulted in improving operating results of $800,000 in the quarter and $3.5 million for the full year. 
For the year, sales were $286 million, up from $281 million in 2014. The segment's operating loss in 2015 was $7 million as compared to $14 million in the same period of 2014. Adjusted EBITDA improved to $6 million for 2015 from breakeven in 2014. 
Moving on to Slide 8 of the presentation. For the quarter, our South American segment recorded sales of $34 million as compared to $36 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Operating income is $3 million, and adjusted EBITDA was $5 million for the fourth quarter of 2015, essentially flat with the fourth quarter of 2014. 
Volumes in Chile were up 9% and up 15% in Brazil compared to the same quarter last year. The sales volume increase in Chile was due to improved housing demand, and the increase in Brazil was due to increased exports. Brazil continues to be in an economic recession with continued political upheaval. 
Pricing was down 12% in Chile and down 23% in Brazil. In local currency, Chile's pricing was up 3% with the same quarter in 2014, and Brazil's pricing was up 13% primarily due to the impact of higher exports. 
For the year, our South American segment recorded sales of $135 million as compared to $150 million in 2014. Operating income was $10 million for 2015 compared to $11 million in 2014, and adjusted EBITDA declined to $18 million from $20 million in the same period of 2014. 
Total selling, general and administrative expenses were $38 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $41 million in the same quarter of 2014. For the quarter, the decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses is primarily due to the lower compensation expense. For the year, our selling, general and administrative expenses are higher at $153 million as compared to $150 million for 2014 primarily due to higher sales and marketing expenses. 
Please refer to Slide 9 of the presentation. As of December 31, 2015, we had cash, cash equivalents, investments and restricted cash of $455 million; working capital of $626 million; net cash of $88 million. And in addition to the $455 million of cash on our balance sheet, we had $200 million of availability on our credit facility. 
Capital expenditures for 2015 were $114 million. We are planning on spending between $120 million and $135 million in capital expenditures for 2016. Approximately $100 million has been allocated to North American projects, 50% for growth and the remaining for capital maintenance and cost reduction projects. The remaining $35 million has been allocated to our South American segment, primarily for the building of the third mill in Chile. And we anticipate that the South American capital expenditures will be funded by cash on hand in Chile as well as the local bank financing. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Curt for his comments."
286119,322758483,932030,"Louisiana-Pacific Corp., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 11, 2016",2016-02-11,"Earnings Calls","Louisiana-Pacific Corporation","Executives","Thanks for that review, Sallie. Good morning to all of you, and thanks for joining us on the call. Let me start with LP's safety performance. For the full year, our total incident rate for recordable injuries or TIR was 0.47, which is the 10th year in a",2034,"Thanks for that review, Sallie. Good morning to all of you, and thanks for joining us on the call. 
Let me start with LP's safety performance. For the full year, our total incident rate for recordable injuries or TIR was 0.47, which is the 10th year in a row that LP was below 1.0. Now that impressive statistic that demonstrates LP's commitment to safety is therefore the second year in a row that contractors that we use on our capital projects went injury-free, a remarkable accomplishment. 
As I typically do on these calls, I'll provide a few comments on our results and accomplishments in the fourth quarter and the year, discuss the housing market and give you my views for 2016. After that, I will turn it back over to Sallie to take your questions. 
As Sallie just reported, all of our segments recorded positive EBITDA in the fourth quarter. For the full year, our EBITDA improved by over 50% despite a $62 million negative impact to both sales and EBITDA due to lower OSB prices than the prior year. As Sallie also mentioned, we did benefit from lower raw materials costs and the favorable Canadian exchange rate. 
In our OSB business, we reacted to lower sales prices by holding our sales volumes relatively flat, with lower production due to the conversion of Swan Valley siding in the second half of the year. We were able to ship the same amount by bringing down the inventory of finished goods across the system. This means that we entered the first quarter with very lean inventories, which should be beneficial as the building season resumes in a month or so. 
We had the most profitable year ever in our Siding business with a 16% increase in EBITDA despite absorbing about a $10 million cost in the second half of the year associated with the Swan Valley conversion. With Swan operating, we have unleashed our sales force to return us to the growth rates that we've demonstrated in the past. 
Engineered Wood, with over $3 million in EBITDA recorded the best quarterly results in many years. For the year, EWP had adjusted EBITDA of almost $6 million compared to breakeven last year. In South America, we had another strong year although reported results reflected significant weakening of the Chilean peso about 15% and the Brazilian real over 15% against the U.S. dollar. 
Following approval by the various governmental agencies of our environmental permit for a third mill in Chile last October, we did get through the mandatory waiting period. This is good news as we're in a sold-out position in Chile, and we are seeing improving economies in Argentina and Colombia. I am anticipating that our board will approve this project next summer and that construction will begin shortly thereafter. 
The news about the housing market continues to be good. However, it has not been as strong as forecasted. U.S. Census Bureau released their data on housing on January 20. For December, housing starts came in at 1.149 million while permits were higher 1.232 million. Other positive housing-related news includes, while the rate of the household formations fell a bit in the fourth quarter, we did end last year with an average of 1.7 million household formations, which is significantly higher, more than double than the last few years. This could mean that the millennials are finally on the move. 
Medium home prices for the year were up 7.6%, and December marked the 46th consecutive month of year-over-year gains. First-time homebuyers purchased about 30% of the existing homes in 2015, and this was up slightly from last year. The total inventory of housing for sale is 3% lower than a year ago, which is creating some shortages. 
On the financing side, average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rates were at 3.92%, and this is for the week ending January 15. As we look at the consensus forecast for this year, it currently stands at 1.263 million, which is about a 14% increase over last year. The consensus for 2017 is 1.385 million, which is a further 10% increase. For LP, we are using a budget assumption of 1.2 million to 1.25 million for 2016. 
Nonresidential construction, an area that we do participate in, was up 9.3% through the end of November. The 5 most important subsectors for structural panel demand are commercial, offices, religious, health care and schools. We registered an increase of 22% for office buildings and 5% for health care and religious buildings. 
Finally, sales of building materials and supply dealers were up about 4% in 2015 compared to the prior year. 
So our view for 2016 -- I just returned from the Policy Advisory Board meeting of the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies held in Washington, D.C. earlier this week. While almost all of the participants shared their view that 2016 will continue to show the 10% to 12% growth in new housing and a continuation of demand in repair and remodeling, to a person, these CEOs expressed dismay surrounding the current political situation, frustration with financial markets and increasing concern about the more restrictive regulatory environment. So with that being said, I do share that as we look back at 2016 post-election, I do believe that housing will be one of the few bright spots in the economy. 
For LP, January order rates were strong, presiding in EWP and a bit muted for OSB, as reflected by a slightly declining price during the month. In the first part of January, we did have our annual sales meeting and also attended the International Builders' Show in Las Vegas. At these 2 events, we had a chance to talk to our field sales folks, builders and channel partners. I'd summarize that the overwhelming sentiment was cautious optimism. Almost universally, there was a feeling that housing and repair-and-remodel markets in 2016 will be stronger than 2015, but there are some headwinds. 
Based on the forecast, it does appear that multifamily housing will be a little over 35% of the mix in the U.S. for the next few years. Additionally, with the aging baby boomers and the explosion of the sharing economy like Airbnb, we are increasingly seeing builders of single-family units add square footage to accommodate an elderly relative or short-term renter in a separate space. This probably showed up in that the average size of single-family new construction in 2015 was the highest ever. 
In Canada, we did see a decline in housing starts in the fourth quarter, primarily focused at lower multifamily starts in Ontario and a cutback in the Prairie provinces associated with oil sands. In 2015, starts were almost 200,000 units, and we forecast this to be lower by about 5%. 
In South America, the outlook continues to be mixed. Brazil is clearly struggling with an untenable political situation and continued economic downturn. The bright spot for LP's operation in Brazil is that the dramatically lower Brazilian real has created some export opportunities for us. 
In Chile, lower copper prices have hurt the economy, but the government continues to take an active role in funding replacement housing that was destroyed by natural disasters, which benefits LP. 
Changing government in Argentina and the immediate relaxing of import/export controls should lead to higher volumes into this country. And the continued emergence of the Colombian economy also creates export demand for our products in South America. 
For retail demand, both Home Depot and Lowe's have given forecast of same-store sales being in that 4% to 5% range for 2016. 
On the longer term, there has been nothing that has happened recently to change my outlook as I continue to believe that we have several more years of housing growth in front of us based on the underbuilding during the last decade, population demographics and the slow rate of recovery so far. As I said in the past, the constraining factors to more immediate robust housing: labor at all levels, available lots and access to credit for the first-time homebuyer. 
Again, as I said before, I believe the labor issues faced by the builders will ease either through increased employment or changing construction practices that will reduce the need for labor. The lack or shortage continues to be a result of multiple factors, including regulation, shortage of manpower and planning requirements and funding for infrastructure. 
On the financing side, we know there will be no significant changes to Fannie and Freddie until after the 2016 elections. The Fed interest rate hike in December had very little impact on mortgage rates. And based on Fed chairman's results -- or comments yesterday, it looks like they will be very cautious as they consider additional rate hikes. 
The other interesting trend that is happening is the traditional depository banks, with the exception of Wells Fargo, have essentially withdrawn from the FHA mortgage market due to increased reserves, documentation requirements and continued litigation risk from federal and state regulators. The good news is new entrants like Quicken Loans with their Super Bowl commercial are taking up the slack. 
As we look at the forecast demand for our products, the challenges faced by builders and the emerging trends, there is much that LP can and is doing to take advantage of these opportunities. Let me give you some concrete examples. 
In single-family new construction, we have had very good success in growing the TechShield Radiant Barrier Sheathing brand to address energy requirements in a number of jurisdictions. We expect to continue this push. 
In the Urban Interface zones in places like California and Colorado, the requirement for fire retardancy has given lift to our FlameBlock product. This is also true in Pennsylvania and Ohio where codes have changed related to fire burn-through on the floors above unfinished basements. Our newly released FlameBlock I-Joist addresses this need. 
In multifamily, these projects also require increased fire retardancy, acoustical performance and low-maintenance durable siding. In January, I was joined by Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama and other dignitaries at the groundbreaking of a $15 million project to add FlameBlock capability to our existing Clarke County, Alabama mill. This post-processing facility will augment the capacity that we have available through our relationship with International Barrier Technologies. Not only does this meet the technical needs defined by the various billing codes, it also lowers the labor content, adds structural integrity and gives the architect more design flexibility. 
With our SmartSide siding products that include lap, panel, trim, soffit and fascia, a builder of multifamily projects will have both the best-looking product available but also the durability to survive harsh treatment for renters. 
In light commercial, our EWP products have long played a role in this segment as the ease of use and design flexibility are critical to the architect and builder. At the recent International Builders' Show, we introduced a substrate panel that can be used to replicate a stucco look with less cost and less labor. This is important in both light commercial as well as other areas like the Southwest where stucco was a preferred finish. 
South America, we see very good opportunities to expand and grow our business there. As we've mentioned earlier, we have cleared all the necessary hurdles for our environmental permitting for a third mill in Chile. That will serve the domestic market as well as other countries on the continent. Our plan is to redeploy existing equipment as we have done in the past to limit the capital investment to $55 million to $60 million. The timing of this construction is likely to be later this year. 
On the industrial side, we continue to develop products for markets beyond residential construction. In this category, we include panels used in furniture manufacturing, various transportation applications and substrates used for decorative panels, cabinetry and interior panels. 
So in conclusion, the continued rise in housing activity, more normalized repair and remodeling activity and new uses for our current products is good for our stakeholders as LP is well positioned to capitalize on this growth. Further, we are committed to innovation to meet our customers' needs for products, efficiencies and affordable costs. 
With that, let me turn it over to Sallie for the Q&A."

So what we have been doing -- and comment I made is unleashing the sales force, that is, in fact, exactly what we did at the international -- or at our international sales meeting in early January. We have armed our sales force with the tools necessary to get us back on the growth rate from a volume standpoint. I would hasten to add, though, if you look at our record results from an EBITDA standpoint, looking on allocation, you do have the opportunity to high-grade your customer mix, if you will. And that's exactly what our sales force did as they were able to take the product that we had available and get a higher price for that. That's why you saw the record EBITDA.

And I think that was the common theme among the participants. What I believe is that we are probably fully recovered in the multifamily, and you should see about that same level of construction going forward. But I think single-family is going to see more growth. Interesting statistic that they presented at the meeting is that the percentage of millennials that want to own a home hasn't changed. It's 92%. 8% said they're happy renting for the rest of their lives. 92% said they want to own a home. That's pretty compelling, and that's very consistent with other surveys that have been done. What's stopping them today is the job -- we've had the job growth, but we haven't had the wage growth, and then the financing for first-time homebuyers has become much more difficult."

Thank you for joining our conference call to discuss LP's financial results for the fourth quarter of 2015 and the full year 2015. I am Sallie Bailey, LP's Chief Financial Officer; and with me today are Curt Stevens, LP's Chief Executive Officer; as well as Mike Kinney and Becky Barckley, our primary Investor Relations contact. 
I will begin the discussion with a review of the financial results for the fourth quarter and the full year results for 2015. This will be followed by some comments on the performance of the individual segments and selected balance sheet items. After I finish my remarks, Curt will discuss the general market environment in which LP has been operating, provide his perspective on our operating results and give some thoughts on the outlook. 
As we have done in the past, we have opened up this call to the public and are doing a webcast. And that webcast can be accessed at www.lpcorp.com. 
Additionally, to help with the discussion, we have provided a presentation with supplemental information that should be reviewed in conjunction with the earnings release. I will be referencing these slides this morning in my comments. 
We filed an 8-K this morning with some supplemental information, and we plan to file our 10-K in the next few weeks. 
I want to remind all of the participants about the forward-looking statements comment on Slide 2 of the presentation. And please also be aware of the discussion of our use of non-GAAP financial information included on Slide 3 of the presentation. The appendix attached to the presentation has some of the necessary reconciliations, which have been supplemented by the Form 8-K filing we made this morning. Rather than reading these 2 statements, I incorporate them with this reference. 
A 16% improvement in OSB pricing for the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter 2015 and positive adjusted EBITDA for all core [ph] segments contributed to stronger earnings for the fourth quarter of 2015. On a non-GAAP annual basis, LP recorded 2% lower sales but 52% higher adjusted EBITDA. We exited 2015 with lean OSB finished goods inventory, low raw material costs and a favorable U.S. dollar versus Canadian dollar exchange rate. We are well positioned in 2016 to take advantage of the ongoing U.S. housing -- the ongoing recovery in U.S. housing. 
Here are some details behind our earnings reports. Moving to Slide 4 of the presentation for a discussion of the fourth quarter and full year 2015 consolidated results. We are reporting net sales of $463 million for the fourth quarter of 2015, a 2% increase from the net sales of $454 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2014. 
In the fourth quarter, we recorded a net loss of $8 million or a loss per diluted share of $0.05 compared to a net loss of $43 million or a loss per diluted share of $0.30 in the fourth quarter of 2014. The adjusted income from continuing operations for the quarter was $1 million or $0.01 per diluted share based upon a normalized tax rate of 35% as compared to a loss of $32 million or a loss per diluted share of $0.23 recorded in the fourth quarter of 2014. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $34 million in the quarter compared to negative adjusted EBITDA of $17 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. 
For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded a net loss of $88 million or a loss per diluted share of $0.62 compared to a loss of $75 million or a loss per diluted share of $0.53 for 2014. The adjusted loss for the year was $46 million or a loss of $0.32 per diluted share based upon the normalized tax rate of 35% compared to a loss of $60 million or $0.42 loss per diluted share in 2014. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $67 million for 2015 compared to $44 million in 2014. 
Now moving on to Slide 5 and the review of our segment results, starting with OSB. OSB reported net sales for the fourth quarter of 2015 of $206 million, slightly higher than the $203 million of net sales recorded in the fourth quarter of 2014. OSB reported operating income of $11 million compared to a loss of $29 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. This is the first quarter of operating income in our OSB segment since the fourth quarter of 2013. And adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations for the quarter was a positive $25 million compared to negative $15 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. 
Pricing at OSB was higher by 10%, which resulted in improved operating results by $18 million. And in addition to the improved OSB price, results benefited from reductions in raw material costs as well as the positive impact of the Canadian currency incurred by our Canadian operation as compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. For the fourth quarter of 2015, the average of the U.S.-Canadian exchange rate was $0.75 as compared to $0.88 in the fourth quarter of 2014. 
For the full year, OSB reported operating sales of $808 million compared to $855 million, down 6% from the prior year. And we recorded an operating loss of $46 million compared to $53 million in 2014. Adjusted EBITDA for 2015 was $12 million compared to $4 million in 2014. Sales volumes increased 2%, and prices decreased 7%. The decrease in selling price unfavorably impacted operating results by $61 million. Offsetting the reduction in sales price for the year was a reduction of raw material costs related to petroleum-based raw materials as well as the positive impact of the Canadian currency exchange rate on the costs incurred by our Canadian operation as compared to the prior year. For the full year of 2015, the average U.S. dollar-Canadian exchange rate was $0.78 as compared to $0.91 in 2014. 
On Slide 6, we reported the results of the Siding business. This segment includes our SmartSide and CanExel siding product as well as a minor amount of OSB. Our Siding segment had record sales -- had a record year for sales, operating income and adjusted EBITDA. 
For the fourth quarter of 2015, the Siding segment recorded sales of $141 million, operating income of $14 million and adjusted EBITDA of $19 million, all comparable to the fourth quarter of 2014. 
For the quarter, SmartSide average sales were up 2%, and volumes decreased 5%. Volumes decreased in our SmartSide siding line due to customers continuing to rebalance their inventories based upon expected housing starts and labor availability, which has slowed housing completion. 
During the third quarter of 2015, we began the conversion of our Swan Valley OSB mill to a SmartSide mill, and during the majority of the fourth quarter, this mill was not operational. It is estimated that the additional costs incurred at the Swan Valley facility during the fourth quarter related to that conversion as well as market-related downtime was approximately $6 million. 
For the year, the Siding segment reported sales of $636 million, an increase of 3% from $617 million reported in 2014. Siding segment reported operating income of $93 million compared to $80 million and adjusted EBITDA of $114 million as compared to $98 million in 2014. The estimated impact of the additional costs incurred at the Swan Valley facility for the full year is approximately $11 million. 
Now please turn to Slide 7 of the presentation, which shows the results of our Engineered Wood Products segment. This segment includes I-Joist, laminated Strand Lumber, laminated veneer lumber; OSB produced at our Houlton, Maine facility; plus other related products. This segment also includes the sale of I-Joist and LVL products produced by the Abitibi joint venture under a sales arrangement with Murphy Plywood. 
The Engineered Wood Products segment reported sales of $75 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, up from $66 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Segment's results were break-even in the fourth quarter of '15 as compared to a loss of $6 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. For the fourth quarter of 2015, adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations improved to $3 million as compared to negative $4 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, the best quarter in EWP since the third quarter of 2014. 
Volumes of I-Joist were up 21% while volumes of LVL and LSL were up 29% compared to the same quarter last year. Pricing was lower by 1% in LVL and LSL and higher by 5% -- I'm sorry, higher by 4% in I-Joist. 
During the quarter and the full year of 2015, we changed the mix of OSB products at our Houlton operations, manufacturing more value-added OSB and less commodity products. The impact of this change resulted in improving operating results of $800,000 in the quarter and $3.5 million for the full year. 
For the year, sales were $286 million, up from $281 million in 2014. The segment's operating loss in 2015 was $7 million as compared to $14 million in the same period of 2014. Adjusted EBITDA improved to $6 million for 2015 from breakeven in 2014. 
Moving on to Slide 8 of the presentation. For the quarter, our South American segment recorded sales of $34 million as compared to $36 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Operating income is $3 million, and adjusted EBITDA was $5 million for the fourth quarter of 2015, essentially flat with the fourth quarter of 2014. 
Volumes in Chile were up 9% and up 15% in Brazil compared to the same quarter last year. The sales volume increase in Chile was due to improved housing demand, and the increase in Brazil was due to increased exports. Brazil continues to be in an economic recession with continued political upheaval. 
Pricing was down 12% in Chile and down 23% in Brazil. In local currency, Chile's pricing was up 3% with the same quarter in 2014, and Brazil's pricing was up 13% primarily due to the impact of higher exports. 
For the year, our South American segment recorded sales of $135 million as compared to $150 million in 2014. Operating income was $10 million for 2015 compared to $11 million in 2014, and adjusted EBITDA declined to $18 million from $20 million in the same period of 2014. 
Total selling, general and administrative expenses were $38 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $41 million in the same quarter of 2014. For the quarter, the decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses is primarily due to the lower compensation expense. For the year, our selling, general and administrative expenses are higher at $153 million as compared to $150 million for 2014 primarily due to higher sales and marketing expenses. 
Please refer to Slide 9 of the presentation. As of December 31, 2015, we had cash, cash equivalents, investments and restricted cash of $455 million; working capital of $626 million; net cash of $88 million. And in addition to the $455 million of cash on our balance sheet, we had $200 million of availability on our credit facility. 
Capital expenditures for 2015 were $114 million. We are planning on spending between $120 million and $135 million in capital expenditures for 2016. Approximately $100 million has been allocated to North American projects, 50% for growth and the remaining for capital maintenance and cost reduction projects. The remaining $35 million has been allocated to our South American segment, primarily for the building of the third mill in Chile. And we anticipate that the South American capital expenditures will be funded by cash on hand in Chile as well as the local bank financing. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Curt for his comments."

Good morning to all of you, and thanks for joining us on the call. 
Let me start with LP's safety performance. For the full year, our total incident rate for recordable injuries or TIR was 0.47, which is the 10th year in a row that LP was below 1.0. Another impressive statistic that demonstrates LP's commitment to safety is that for the second year in a row the contractors that we use on our capital projects went injury-free, a remarkable accomplishment. 
As I typically do on these calls, I'll provide a few comments on our results and accomplishments in the fourth quarter and the year, discuss the housing market and give you my views for 2016. After that, I will turn it back over to Sallie to take your questions. 
As Sallie just reported, all of our segments recorded positive EBITDA in the fourth quarter. For the full year, our EBITDA improved by over 50% despite a $62 million negative impact to both sales and EBITDA due to lower OSB prices than the prior year. As Sallie also mentioned, we did benefit from lower raw materials costs and the favorable Canadian exchange rate. 
In our OSB business, we reacted to lower sales prices by holding our sales volumes relatively flat, with lower production due to the conversion of Swan Valley siding in the second half of the year. We were able to ship the same amount by bringing down the inventory of finished goods across the system. This means that we entered the first quarter with very lean inventories, which should be beneficial as the building season resumes in a month or so. 
We had the most profitable year ever in our Siding business with a 16% increase in EBITDA despite absorbing about a $10 million cost in the second half of the year associated with the Swan Valley conversion. With Swan operating, we have unleashed our sales force to return us to the growth rates that we've demonstrated in the past. 
Engineered Wood, with over $3 million in EBITDA recorded the best quarterly results in many years. For the year, EWP had adjusted EBITDA of almost $6 million compared to breakeven last year. In South America, we had another strong year although reported results reflected significant weakening of the Chilean peso about 15% and the Brazilian real over 50% against the U.S. dollar. 
Following approval by the various governmental agencies of our environmental permit for a third mill in Chile last October, we did get through the mandatory waiting period. This is good news as we're in a sold-out position in Chile, and we are seeing improving economies in Argentina and Colombia. I am anticipating that our board will approve this project next summer and that construction will begin shortly thereafter. 
The news about the housing market continues to be good. However, it has not been as strong as forecasted. U.S. Census Bureau released their data on housing on January 20. For December, housing starts came in at 1.149 million while permits were higher 1.232 million. Other positive housing-related news includes, while the rate of the household formations fell a bit in the fourth quarter, we did end last year with an average of 1.7 million household formations, which is significantly higher, more than double than the last few years. This could mean that the millennials are finally on the move. 
Median home prices for the year were up 7.6%, and December marked the 46th consecutive month of year-over-year gains. First-time homebuyers purchased about 30% of the existing homes in 2015, and this was up slightly from last year. The total inventory of housing for sale is 3% lower than a year ago, which is creating some shortages. 
On the financing side, average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rates were at 3.92%, and this is for the week ending January 15. As we look at the consensus forecast for this year, it currently stands at 1.263 million, which is about a 14% increase over last year. The consensus for 2017 is 1.385 million, which is a further 10% increase. For LP, we are using a budget assumption of 1.2 million to 1.25 million for 2016. 
Nonresidential construction, an area that we do participate in, was up 9.3% through the end of November. The 5 most important subsectors for structural panel demand are commercial, offices, religious, health care and schools. We registered an increase of 22% for office buildings and 5% for health care and religious buildings. 
Finally, sales of building materials and supply dealers were up about 4% in 2015 compared to the prior year. 
So our view for 2016 -- I just returned from the Policy Advisory Board meeting of the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies held in Washington, D.C. earlier this week. While almost all of the participants shared the view that 2016 will continue to show the 10% to 12% growth in new housing and a continuation of demand in repair and remodeling, to a person, these CEOs expressed dismay surrounding the current political situation, frustration with financial markets and increasing concern about the more restrictive regulatory environment. So with that being said, I do share that as we look back at 2016 post-election, I do believe that housing will be one of the few bright spots in the economy. 
For LP, January order rates were strong, presiding in EWP and a bit muted for OSB, as reflected by a slightly declining price during the month. In the first part of January, we did have our annual sales meeting and also attended the International Builders' Show in Las Vegas. At these 2 events, we had a chance to talk to our field sales folks, builders and channel partners. I'd summarize that the overwhelming sentiment was cautious optimism. Almost universally, there was a feeling that housing and repair-and-remodel markets in 2016 will be stronger than 2015, but there are some headwinds. 
Based on the forecast, it does appear that multifamily housing will be a little over 35% of the mix in the U.S. for the next few years. Additionally, with the aging baby boomers and the explosion of the sharing economy like Airbnb, we are increasingly seeing builders of single-family units add square footage to accommodate an elderly relative or short-term renter in a separate space. This probably showed up in that the average size of single-family new construction in 2015 was the highest ever. 
In Canada, we did see a decline in housing starts in the fourth quarter, primarily focused at lower multifamily starts in Ontario and a cutback in the Prairie provinces associated with oil sands. In 2015, starts were almost 200,000 units, and we forecast this to be lower by about 5%. 
In South America, the outlook continues to be mixed. Brazil is clearly struggling with an untenable political situation and continued economic downturn. The bright spot for LP's operation in Brazil is that the dramatically lower Brazilian real has created some export opportunities for us. 
In Chile, lower copper prices have hurt the economy, but the government continues to take an active role in funding replacement housing that was destroyed by natural disasters, which benefits LP. 
Changing government in Argentina and the immediate relaxing of import/export controls should lead to higher volumes into this country. And the continued emergence of the Colombian economy also creates export demand for our products in South America. 
For retail demand, both Home Depot and Lowe's have given forecast of same-store sales being in that 4% to 5% range for 2016. 
On the longer term, there has been nothing that has happened recently to change my outlook as I continue to believe that we have several more years of housing growth in front of us based on the underbuilding during the last decade, population demographics and the slow rate of recovery so far. As I said in the past, the constraining factors to more immediate robust housing: labor at all levels, available lots and access to credit for the first-time homebuyer. 
Again, as I said before, I believe the labor issues faced by the builders will ease either through increased employment or changing construction practices that will reduce the need for labor. The lot shortage continues to be a result of multiple set [ph] of factors, including regulation, shortage of manpower and planning departments and funding for infrastructure. 
On the financing side, we know there will be no significant changes to Fannie and Freddie until after the 2016 elections. The Fed interest rate hike in December had very little impact on mortgage rates. And based on Fed chairman's results -- or comments yesterday, it looks like they will be very cautious as they consider additional rate hikes. 
The other interesting trend that is happening is the traditional depository banks, with the exception of Wells Fargo, have essentially withdrawn from the FHA mortgage market due to increased reserves, documentation requirements and continued litigation risk from federal and state regulators. The good news is new entrants like Quicken Loans with their Super Bowl commercial are taking up the slack. 
As we look at the forecast demand for our products, the challenges faced by builders and the emerging trends, there is much that LP can and is doing to take advantage of these opportunities. Let me give you some concrete examples. 
In single-family new construction, we have had very good success in growing the TechShield Radiant Barrier Sheathing brand to address energy requirements in a number of jurisdictions. We expect to continue this push. 
In the Urban Interface zones in places like California and Colorado, the requirement for fire retardancy has given lift to our FlameBlock product. This is also true in Pennsylvania and Ohio where codes have changed related to fire burn-through on the floors above unfinished basements. Our newly released FlameBlock I-Joist addresses this need. 
In multifamily, these projects also require increased fire retardancy, acoustical performance and low-maintenance durable siding. In January, I was joined by Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama and other dignitaries at the groundbreaking of a $15 million project to add FlameBlock capability to our existing Clarke County, Alabama mill. This post-processing facility will augment the capacity that we have available through our relationship with International Barrier Technologies. Not only does this meet the technical needs defined by the various billing codes, it also lowers the labor content, adds structural integrity and gives the architect more design flexibility. 
With our SmartSide siding products that include lap, panel, trim, soffit and fascia, a builder of multifamily projects will have both the best-looking product available but also the durability to survive harsh treatment from renters. 
In light commercial, our EWP products have long played a role in this segment as the ease of use and design flexibility are critical to the architect and builder. At the recent International Builders' Show, we introduced a substrate panel that can be used to replicate a stucco look with less cost and less labor. This is important in both light commercial as well as other areas like the Southwest where stucco was a preferred finish. 
South America, we see very good opportunities to expand and grow our business there. As we've mentioned earlier, we have cleared all the necessary hurdles for our environmental permitting for a third mill in Chile. That will serve the domestic market as well as other countries on the continent. Our plan is to redeploy existing equipment as we have done in the past to limit the capital investment to $55 million to $60 million. The timing of this construction is likely to be later this year. 
On the industrial side, we continue to develop products for markets beyond residential construction. In this category, we include panels used in furniture manufacturing, various transportation applications and substrates used for decorative panels, cabinetry and interior panels. 
So in conclusion, the continued rise in housing activity, more normalized repair and remodeling activity and new uses for our current products is good for our stakeholders as LP is well positioned to capitalize on this growth. Further, we are committed to innovation to meet our customers' needs for products, efficiencies and affordable costs. 
With that, let me turn it over to Sallie for the Q&A."

So what we have been doing -- and comment I made is unleashing the sales force, that is, in fact, exactly what we did at the international -- or at our international sales meeting in early January. We have armed our sales force with the tools necessary to get us back on the growth rate from a volume standpoint. I would hasten to add, though, if you look at our record results from an EBITDA standpoint, looking on allocation, you do have the opportunity to high-grade your customer mix, if you will. And that's exactly what our sales force did as they were able to take the product that we had available and get a higher price for that. That's why you saw the record EBITDA.

What I believe is that we are probably fully recovered in the multifamily, and you should see about that same level of construction going forward. But I think single-family is going to see more growth. Interesting statistic that they presented at the meeting is that the percentage of millennials that want to own a home hasn't changed. It's 92%. 8% said they're happy renting for the rest of their lives. 92% said they want to own a home. That's pretty compelling, and that's very consistent with other surveys that have been done.

Thank you for joining our conference call to discuss LP's financial results for the fourth quarter of 2015 and the full year 2015. I am Sallie Bailey, LP's Chief Financial Officer; and with me today are Curt Stevens, LP's Chief Executive Officer; as well as Mike Kinney and Becky Barckley, our primary Investor Relations contact. 
I will begin the discussion with a review of the financial results for the fourth quarter and the full year results for 2015. This will be followed by some comments on the performance of the individual segments and selected balance sheet items. After I finish my remarks, Curt will discuss the general market environment in which LP has been operating, provide his perspective on our operating results and give some thoughts on the outlook. 
As we have done in the past, we have opened up this call to the public and are doing a webcast. And that webcast can be accessed at www.lpcorp.com. 
Additionally, to help with the discussion, we have provided a presentation with supplemental information that should be reviewed in conjunction with the earnings release. I will be referencing these slides this morning in my comments. 
We filed an 8-K this morning with some supplemental information, and we plan to file our 10-K in the next few weeks. 
I want to remind all of the participants about the forward-looking statements comment on Slide 2 of the presentation. And please also be aware of the discussion of our use of non-GAAP financial information included on Slide 3 of the presentation. The appendix attached to the presentation has some of the necessary reconciliations, which have been supplemented by the Form 8-K filing we made this morning. Rather than reading these 2 statements, I incorporate them with this reference. 
A 16% improvement in OSB pricing for the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter 2015 and positive adjusted EBITDA for all core [ph] segments contributed to stronger earnings for the fourth quarter of 2015. On a non-GAAP annual basis, LP recorded 2% lower sales but 52% higher adjusted EBITDA. We exited 2015 with lean OSB finished goods inventory, low raw material costs and a favorable U.S. dollar versus Canadian dollar exchange rate. We are well positioned in 2016 to take advantage of the ongoing U.S. housing -- the ongoing recovery in U.S. housing. 
Here are some details behind our earnings reports. Moving to Slide 4 of the presentation for a discussion of the fourth quarter and full year 2015 consolidated results. We are reporting net sales of $463 million for the fourth quarter of 2015, a 2% increase from the net sales of $454 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2014. 
In the fourth quarter, we recorded a net loss of $8 million or a loss per diluted share of $0.05 compared to a net loss of $43 million or a loss per diluted share of $0.30 in the fourth quarter of 2014. The adjusted income from continuing operations for the quarter was $1 million or $0.01 per diluted share based upon a normalized tax rate of 35% as compared to a loss of $32 million or a loss per diluted share of $0.23 recorded in the fourth quarter of 2014. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $34 million in the quarter compared to negative adjusted EBITDA of $17 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. 
For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded a net loss of $88 million or a loss per diluted share of $0.62 compared to a loss of $75 million or a loss per diluted share of $0.53 for 2014. The adjusted loss for the year was $46 million or a loss of $0.32 per diluted share based upon the normalized tax rate of 35% compared to a loss of $60 million or $0.42 loss per diluted share in 2014. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $67 million for 2015 compared to $44 million in 2014. 
Now moving on to Slide 5 and the review of our segment results, starting with OSB. OSB reported net sales for the fourth quarter of 2015 of $206 million, slightly higher than the $203 million of net sales recorded in the fourth quarter of 2014. OSB reported operating income of $11 million compared to a loss of $29 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. This is the first quarter of operating income in our OSB segment since the fourth quarter of 2013. And adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations for the quarter was a positive $25 million compared to negative $15 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. 
Pricing at OSB was higher by 10%, which resulted in improved operating results by $18 million. And in addition to the improved OSB price, results benefited from reductions in raw material costs as well as the positive impact of the Canadian currency incurred by our Canadian operation as compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. For the fourth quarter of 2015, the average of the U.S.-Canadian exchange rate was $0.75 as compared to $0.88 in the fourth quarter of 2014. 
For the full year, OSB reported operating sales of $808 million compared to $855 million, down 6% from the prior year. And we recorded an operating loss of $46 million compared to $53 million in 2014. Adjusted EBITDA for 2015 was $12 million compared to $4 million in 2014. Sales volumes increased 2%, and prices decreased 7%. The decrease in selling price unfavorably impacted operating results by $61 million. Offsetting the reduction in sales price for the year was a reduction of raw material costs related to petroleum-based raw materials as well as the positive impact of the Canadian currency exchange rate on the costs incurred by our Canadian operation as compared to the prior year. For the full year of 2015, the average U.S. dollar-Canadian exchange rate was $0.78 as compared to $0.91 in 2014. 
On Slide 6, we reported the results of the Siding business. This segment includes our SmartSide and CanExel siding product as well as a minor amount of OSB. Our Siding segment had record sales -- had a record year for sales, operating income and adjusted EBITDA. 
For the fourth quarter of 2015, the Siding segment recorded sales of $141 million, operating income of $14 million and adjusted EBITDA of $19 million, all comparable to the fourth quarter of 2014. 
For the quarter, SmartSide average sales were up 2%, and volumes decreased 5%. Volumes decreased in our SmartSide siding line due to customers continuing to rebalance their inventories based upon expected housing starts and labor availability, which has slowed housing completion. 
During the third quarter of 2015, we began the conversion of our Swan Valley OSB mill to a SmartSide mill, and during the majority of the fourth quarter, this mill was not operational. It is estimated that the additional costs incurred at the Swan Valley facility during the fourth quarter related to that conversion as well as market-related downtime was approximately $6 million. 
For the year, the Siding segment reported sales of $636 million, an increase of 3% from $617 million reported in 2014. Siding segment reported operating income of $93 million compared to $80 million and adjusted EBITDA of $114 million as compared to $98 million in 2014. The estimated impact of the additional costs incurred at the Swan Valley facility for the full year is approximately $11 million. 
Now please turn to Slide 7 of the presentation, which shows the results of our Engineered Wood Products segment. This segment includes I-Joist, laminated Strand Lumber, laminated veneer lumber; OSB produced at our Houlton, Maine facility; plus other related products. This segment also includes the sale of I-Joist and LVL products produced by the Abitibi joint venture under a sales arrangement with Murphy Plywood. 
The Engineered Wood Products segment reported sales of $75 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, up from $66 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Segment's results were break-even in the fourth quarter of '15 as compared to a loss of $6 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. For the fourth quarter of 2015, adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations improved to $3 million as compared to negative $4 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, the best quarter in EWP since the third quarter of 2014. 
Volumes of I-Joist were up 21% while volumes of LVL and LSL were up 29% compared to the same quarter last year. Pricing was lower by 1% in LVL and LSL and higher by 5% -- I'm sorry, higher by 4% in I-Joist. 
During the quarter and the full year of 2015, we changed the mix of OSB products at our Houlton operations, manufacturing more value-added OSB and less commodity products. The impact of this change resulted in improving operating results of $800,000 in the quarter and $3.5 million for the full year. 
For the year, sales were $286 million, up from $281 million in 2014. The segment's operating loss in 2015 was $7 million as compared to $14 million in the same period of 2014. Adjusted EBITDA improved to $6 million for 2015 from breakeven in 2014. 
Moving on to Slide 8 of the presentation. For the quarter, our South American segment recorded sales of $34 million as compared to $36 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Operating income is $3 million, and adjusted EBITDA was $5 million for the fourth quarter of 2015, essentially flat with the fourth quarter of 2014. 
Volumes in Chile were up 9% and up 15% in Brazil compared to the same quarter last year. The sales volume increase in Chile was due to improved housing demand, and the increase in Brazil was due to increased exports. Brazil continues to be in an economic recession with continued political upheaval. 
Pricing was down 12% in Chile and down 23% in Brazil. In local currency, Chile's pricing was up 3% with the same quarter in 2014, and Brazil's pricing was up 13% primarily due to the impact of higher exports. 
For the year, our South American segment recorded sales of $135 million as compared to $150 million in 2014. Operating income was $10 million for 2015 compared to $11 million in 2014, and adjusted EBITDA declined to $18 million from $20 million in the same period of 2014. 
Total selling, general and administrative expenses were $38 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $41 million in the same quarter of 2014. For the quarter, the decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses is primarily due to the lower compensation expense. For the year, our selling, general and administrative expenses are higher at $153 million as compared to $150 million for 2014 primarily due to higher sales and marketing expenses. 
Please refer to Slide 9 of the presentation. As of December 31, 2015, we had cash, cash equivalents, investments and restricted cash of $455 million; working capital of $626 million; net cash of $88 million. And in addition to the $455 million of cash on our balance sheet, we had $200 million of availability on our credit facility. 
Capital expenditures for 2015 were $114 million. We are planning on spending between $120 million and $135 million in capital expenditures for 2016. Approximately $100 million has been allocated to North American projects, 50% for growth and the remaining for capital maintenance and cost reduction projects. The remaining $35 million has been allocated to our South American segment, primarily for the building of the third mill in Chile. And we anticipate that the South American capital expenditures will be funded by cash on hand in Chile as well as the local bank financing. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Curt for his comments."

Good morning to all of you, and thanks for joining us on the call. 
Let me start with LP's safety performance. For the full year, our total incident rate for recordable injuries or TIR was 0.47, which is the 10th year in a row that LP was below 1.0. Another impressive statistic that demonstrates LP's commitment to safety is that for the second year in a row the contractors that we use on our capital projects went injury-free, a remarkable accomplishment. 
As I typically do on these calls, I'll provide a few comments on our results and accomplishments in the fourth quarter and the year, discuss the housing market and give you my views for 2016. After that, I will turn it back over to Sallie to take your questions. 
As Sallie just reported, all of our segments recorded positive EBITDA in the fourth quarter. For the full year, our EBITDA improved by over 50% despite a $62 million negative impact to both sales and EBITDA due to lower OSB prices than the prior year. As Sallie also mentioned, we did benefit from lower raw materials costs and the favorable Canadian exchange rate. 
In our OSB business, we reacted to lower sales prices by holding our sales volumes relatively flat, with lower production due to the conversion of Swan Valley siding in the second half of the year. We were able to ship the same amount by bringing down the inventory of finished goods across the system. This means that we entered the first quarter with very lean inventories, which should be beneficial as the building season resumes in a month or so. 
We had the most profitable year ever in our Siding business with a 16% increase in EBITDA despite absorbing about a $10 million cost in the second half of the year associated with the Swan Valley conversion. With Swan operating, we have unleashed our sales force to return us to the growth rates that we've demonstrated in the past. 
Engineered Wood, with over $3 million in EBITDA recorded the best quarterly results in many years. For the year, EWP had adjusted EBITDA of almost $6 million compared to breakeven last year. In South America, we had another strong year although reported results reflected significant weakening of the Chilean peso about 15% and the Brazilian real over 15% against the U.S. dollar. 
Following approval by the various governmental agencies of our environmental permit for a third mill in Chile last October, we did get through the mandatory waiting period. This is good news as we're in a sold-out position in Chile, and we are seeing improving economies in Argentina and Colombia. I am anticipating that our board will approve this project next summer and that construction will begin shortly thereafter. 
The news about the housing market continues to be good. However, it has not been as strong as forecasted. U.S. Census Bureau released their data on housing on January 20. For December, housing starts came in at 1.149 million while permits were higher 1.232 million. Other positive housing-related news includes, while the rate of the household formations fell a bit in the fourth quarter, we did end last year with an average of 1.7 million household formations, which is significantly higher, more than double than the last few years. This could mean that the millennials are finally on the move. 
Median home prices for the year were up 7.6%, and December marked the 46th consecutive month of year-over-year gains. First-time homebuyers purchased about 30% of the existing homes in 2015, and this was up slightly from last year. The total inventory of housing for sale is 3% lower than a year ago, which is creating some shortages. 
On the financing side, average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rates were at 3.92%, and this is for the week ending January 15. As we look at the consensus forecast for this year, it currently stands at 1.263 million, which is about a 14% increase over last year. The consensus for 2017 is 1.385 million, which is a further 10% increase. For LP, we are using a budget assumption of 1.2 million to 1.25 million for 2016. 
Nonresidential construction, an area that we do participate in, was up 9.3% through the end of November. The 5 most important subsectors for structural panel demand are commercial, offices, religious, health care and schools. We registered an increase of 22% for office buildings and 5% for health care and religious buildings. 
Finally, sales of building materials and supply dealers were up about 4% in 2015 compared to the prior year. 
So our view for 2016 -- I just returned from the Policy Advisory Board meeting of the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies held in Washington, D.C. earlier this week. While almost all of the participants shared the view that 2016 will continue to show the 10% to 12% growth in new housing and a continuation of demand in repair and remodeling, to a person, these CEOs expressed dismay surrounding the current political situation, frustration with financial markets and increasing concern about the more restrictive regulatory environment. So with that being said, I do share that as we look back at 2016 post-election, I do believe that housing will be one of the few bright spots in the economy. 
For LP, January order rates were strong, presiding in EWP and a bit muted for OSB, as reflected by a slightly declining price during the month. In the first part of January, we did have our annual sales meeting and also attended the International Builders' Show in Las Vegas. At these 2 events, we had a chance to talk to our field sales folks, builders and channel partners. I'd summarize that the overwhelming sentiment was cautious optimism. Almost universally, there was a feeling that housing and repair-and-remodel markets in 2016 will be stronger than 2015, but there are some headwinds. 
Based on the forecast, it does appear that multifamily housing will be a little over 35% of the mix in the U.S. for the next few years. Additionally, with the aging baby boomers and the explosion of the sharing economy like Airbnb, we are increasingly seeing builders of single-family units add square footage to accommodate an elderly relative or short-term renter in a separate space. This probably showed up in that the average size of single-family new construction in 2015 was the highest ever. 
In Canada, we did see a decline in housing starts in the fourth quarter, primarily focused at lower multifamily starts in Ontario and a cutback in the Prairie provinces associated with oil sands. In 2015, starts were almost 200,000 units, and we forecast this to be lower by about 5%. 
In South America, the outlook continues to be mixed. Brazil is clearly struggling with an untenable political situation and continued economic downturn. The bright spot for LP's operation in Brazil is that the dramatically lower Brazilian real has created some export opportunities for us. 
In Chile, lower copper prices have hurt the economy, but the government continues to take an active role in funding replacement housing that was destroyed by natural disasters, which benefits LP. 
Changing government in Argentina and the immediate relaxing of import/export controls should lead to higher volumes into this country. And the continued emergence of the Colombian economy also creates export demand for our products in South America. 
For retail demand, both Home Depot and Lowe's have given forecast of same-store sales being in that 4% to 5% range for 2016. 
On the longer term, there has been nothing that has happened recently to change my outlook as I continue to believe that we have several more years of housing growth in front of us based on the underbuilding during the last decade, population demographics and the slow rate of recovery so far. As I said in the past, the constraining factors to more immediate robust housing: labor at all levels, available lots and access to credit for the first-time homebuyer. 
Again, as I said before, I believe the labor issues faced by the builders will ease either through increased employment or changing construction practices that will reduce the need for labor. The lot shortage continues to be a result of multiple set [ph] of factors, including regulation, shortage of manpower and planning departments and funding for infrastructure. 
On the financing side, we know there will be no significant changes to Fannie and Freddie until after the 2016 elections. The Fed interest rate hike in December had very little impact on mortgage rates. And based on Fed chairman's results -- or comments yesterday, it looks like they will be very cautious as they consider additional rate hikes. 
The other interesting trend that is happening is the traditional depository banks, with the exception of Wells Fargo, have essentially withdrawn from the FHA mortgage market due to increased reserves, documentation requirements and continued litigation risk from federal and state regulators. The good news is new entrants like Quicken Loans with their Super Bowl commercial are taking up the slack. 
As we look at the forecast demand for our products, the challenges faced by builders and the emerging trends, there is much that LP can and is doing to take advantage of these opportunities. Let me give you some concrete examples. 
In single-family new construction, we have had very good success in growing the TechShield Radiant Barrier Sheathing brand to address energy requirements in a number of jurisdictions. We expect to continue this push. 
In the Urban Interface zones in places like California and Colorado, the requirement for fire retardancy has given lift to our FlameBlock product. This is also true in Pennsylvania and Ohio where codes have changed related to fire burn-through on the floors above unfinished basements. Our newly released FlameBlock I-Joist addresses this need. 
In multifamily, these projects also require increased fire retardancy, acoustical performance and low-maintenance durable siding. In January, I was joined by Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama and other dignitaries at the groundbreaking of a $15 million project to add FlameBlock capability to our existing Clarke County, Alabama mill. This post-processing facility will augment the capacity that we have available through our relationship with International Barrier Technologies. Not only does this meet the technical needs defined by the various billing codes, it also lowers the labor content, adds structural integrity and gives the architect more design flexibility. 
With our SmartSide siding products that include lap, panel, trim, soffit and fascia, a builder of multifamily projects will have both the best-looking product available but also the durability to survive harsh treatment from renters. 
In light commercial, our EWP products have long played a role in this segment as the ease of use and design flexibility are critical to the architect and builder. At the recent International Builders' Show, we introduced a substrate panel that can be used to replicate a stucco look with less cost and less labor. This is important in both light commercial as well as other areas like the Southwest where stucco was a preferred finish. 
South America, we see very good opportunities to expand and grow our business there. As we've mentioned earlier, we have cleared all the necessary hurdles for our environmental permitting for a third mill in Chile. That will serve the domestic market as well as other countries on the continent. Our plan is to redeploy existing equipment as we have done in the past to limit the capital investment to $55 million to $60 million. The timing of this construction is likely to be later this year. 
On the industrial side, we continue to develop products for markets beyond residential construction. In this category, we include panels used in furniture manufacturing, various transportation applications and substrates used for decorative panels, cabinetry and interior panels. 
So in conclusion, the continued rise in housing activity, more normalized repair and remodeling activity and new uses for our current products is good for our stakeholders as LP is well positioned to capitalize on this growth. Further, we are committed to innovation to meet our customers' needs for products, efficiencies and affordable costs. 
With that, let me turn it over to Sallie for the Q&A."

So we really didn't have any more product to sell until the Swan Valley facility came online in the October -- late October, early November time frame, and we've been ramping up that production. So what we have been doing -- and comment I made is unleashing the sales force, that is, in fact, exactly what we did at the international -- or at our international sales meeting in early January. We have armed our sales force with the tools necessary to get us back on the growth rate from a volume standpoint. I would hasten to add, though, if you look at our record results from an EBITDA standpoint, looking on allocation, you do have the opportunity to high-grade your customer mix, if you will. And that's exactly what our sales force did as they were able to take the product that we had available and get a higher price for that. That's why you saw the record EBITDA. So on 2016, the challenge is to go back to probably some of those customers who we high-graded out of it, offer them the opportunity to participate in buying these products going forward and manage the gross margin along with the growth rates."

What I believe is that we are probably fully recovered in the multifamily, and you should see about that same level of construction going forward.

It's 92%. 8% said they're happy renting for the rest of their lives. 92% said they want to own a home. That's pretty compelling, and that's very consistent with other surveys that have been done.

I'm Sallie Bailey, LP's Chief Financial Officer, and with me today are Curt Stevens, LP's Chief Executive Officer; as well as Mike Kinney and Becky Barkley, our primary Investor Relations contact. 
I will begin the discussion with a review of the financial results for the first quarter of 2016, and these will be followed by some comments on the performance of the individual segments and selected balance sheet items. After I finish my comments, Curt will discuss the general market environment in which LP has been operating and provide his perspective on our operating results and give some thoughts on the outlook. 
As we have done in the past, we've opened up this call to the public and/or doing a webcast. And the webcast can be accessed at www.lpcorp.com. Additionally, to help with the discussions, we're provided a presentation with supplemental information that should be reviewed in conjuction with the earnings release. I will be referencing these slides in my comments this morning. We have filed an 8-K this morning with some supplemental information as well as our Form 10-Q. I want to remind all of the participants about the forward-looking statements comment on Slide 2 of the presentation. Please also be aware of the discussion of our use of non-GAAP financial information included on Slide 3 of the presentation. 
The appendix attached to the presentation has some of the necessary reconciliation, which have been supplemented by the Form 8-K filing we made this morning. Rather than reading these 2 statements, incorporate them with this reference. 
The first quarter was a good start at 2016 for LP and for the continued improvement for the remainder of the year. U.S. start does remain choppy, but the market appears to be in a trajectory for 10% to 50% improvement over 2015. Overall, in the past couple of quarters, we have had a number of questions and meetings on this call about the market demand for SmartSide The Siding segment's results this quarter demonstrates that we are back on track given the 22% improvement in SmartSide volume from the fourth quarter of 2015. And with that, let me go into the details. 
Moving to Slide 4 of the presentation for a discussion of the first quarter 2016 consolidated results. We are reporting net sales of $505 million for the first quarter of 2016, a 7% increase from the net sales of $472 million reported in the first quarter of 2015. In the first quarter, we recorded net income of $10 million or $0.07 per diluted share compared to a loss of $35 million or a loss of $0.24 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2015. 
The adjusted income from continued operations for the quarter were $10 million or $0.07 per diluted share based upon a normalized tax rate of 35% as compared to a loss of $19 million or a loss per share of $0.13 reported in the first quarter of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $52 million in the quarter compared to $6 million in the first quarter of 2016. 
Moving on to Slide 5 of the presentation and our overview of our segment results. Starting with OSB. OSB reported net sales for the first quarter of 2016 of $217 million, up 14% of $190 million in the first quarter of 2015. OSB reported operating income of $15 million compared to a loss of $29 million in the first quarter of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $30 million [ph] compared to negative adjusted EBITDA of $13 million in the first quarter of 2015.  Sales volumes were flat. Pricing for OSB was higher by 14%, which improved its operating results by $27 million. The first quarter 2016 OSB operating results were positively impacted by reductions in material cost, and utilization rates as well as the positive impact of the Canadian currency. 
Slide 6 reports the results of siding business. This segment includes our SmartSide and our CanExel progress as well as amounts of Siding reported net sales for the first quarter of 2016 of $181 million of [indiscernible] in the first quarter of 2015. Siding reported operating income of $27 million when compared to operating income of $33 million in the first quarter of 2016. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $34 million compared to $38 million in the first quarter of 2015. volume was up 1% from prior year and 22% sequentially. Sales prices on SmartSide were down 2% due to changes in product mix with individual pricing remaining relatively flat. CanExel, sales increased 15% primarily due to increased demand in Europe. Sales prices for CanExel were lower by 1% [ph] U.S. dollars. CanExel Canadian dollar sales prices were up 2%. 
As a reminder, the conversion from an OSB mill -- as a reminder, with the conversion of the OSB mill to Siding segment the Siding segment started producing and OSB again inspite our hayward Wisconsin Mill. In the first quarter of 2016, the Siding segment produced about 53 million square feet of OSB as compared to net OSB production in the first quarter of 2015. The negative impact on swank conversion on the Siding segment's financial results for the quarter were less than $1 million and we are not anticipating any negative impact of the swank conversion in the second quarter on earnings. The reduction operating results for the Siding segment is for the first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015 was primarily due to higher cost of sales related to the fourth quarter higher cost of production due to downturn. Higher cost of production in the fourth quarter was capitalized to the inventory, which was then sold in the first quarter. The cost of production in the first quarter was lower than the cost of reduction in the fourth quarter of 2015. An increase in OSB production and an increased sales and marketing costs to support future growth also contributed to the lower operating results in the quarter. These higher costs were partially offset by lower raw material cost. 
Please turn to Slide 7 of the presentation, which shows the results from our Engineered Wood Products segment. This segment includes I-Joist, Laminated Strand Lumber, Laminated Veneer Lumber; OSB produced at our Houlton, Maine facility plus other related products. This segment also includes the sale of I-Joist and LVL products produced by to meet joint venture under our sales agreement with Murphy Plywood. The Engineered Wood Products segment reported sales of $72 million of the first quarter of 2016, up from $65 million in the first quarter of 2015. The segment's results were loss of $2.5 million in the first quarter of 2016 as compared to a loss of $4 million in the first quarter of 2015. In the first quarter of 2016, adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations improved by $1 million as compared to the first quarter of 2015. Volumes of I-Joist were up 19%, while volumes of LVL and LSL were up 18% compared to the same quarter last year. Pricing was up 3% in LVL and up 2% in LSL. 
Moving on to Slide 8 of the presentation. For the quarter, our South American segment reported sales of $31 million as compared to $36 million in the first quarter of 2015. Operating income was $5 million as compared $2 million in the first quarter of 2015 and adjusted EBITDA was higher by $2 million for the first quarter of 2016 as compared to the first quarter of 2015. Volumes were down 12% in Chile in 3% in Brazil compared to the same quarter last year. The sales volume decreased in Chile was due to increased exports impacting local demand and in Brazil due to decreased local sales as Brazil continues to face an economic recession in their local market. 
On a U.S. dollar basis, pricing was up 1% in Chile and down 11% in Brazil. In local currency, Chile's pricing was up 14% compared to the same quarter in 2015 and Brazil's pricing was 25% higher in local currency. 
Total selling, general and adminstrative expense was $42 million in the first quarter of 2016 compared to $39 million in the same quarter of 2015. For the quarter, the increase in selling, general and demonstrative expense was primarily due to increases in certain management incentives in 2016 and higher costs associated with corporate sales and marketing to support our revenue growth.  Interest expense net was flat between the period. 
Please turn to Slide 9 of the presentation. As of March 31, 2016, we had cash, cash equivalents, investments and restricted cash of $424 million; working capital of $650 million; net cash of $68 million. And in addition to the $424 million of cash on our balance sheet, we had $2 million of availability on our credit facility. Capital expenditures through March 31, 2016 were $26 million. We're projecting capital expenditures for 2016 at $120 million to $130 million, approximately $100 million has been allocated to North American project, 50% for growth and the remaining for capital maintenance and cost reduction. The remaining $20 million to $30 million has been allocated to our South American segment, primarily for the building of the third mill in Chile. Now with that, I'll turn the call over to Curt for his comments"

As I usually do, I'll start with our safety performance. The American Panel Association just announced the results of their safety and health awards program for 2015 and I'm pleased that for the second year in a row, LP was recognized the safest large company as a company with more than 4 mills. This is the sixth time that we've been so recognized in the last 8 years. Our I-Joist JV which has 2 mills and Quebec was named the safest small company with fewer mills. 11 facilities included incident-free honor society. The American Force and Paper Association also released their safety data for 2015 for their of companies and LP was identified is having the best total incident rate. I continue to be extremely proud of all of our employees who recognize the value of being safe, committed to it and act accordingly. 
In addition to the obvious savings and workers' compensation cost, LP employees had made their commitments safety to cornerstone of our company's culture, which we believe gives us a competitive edge in the hiring and retention of our people. Finally, the safety culture extends too many contractors that we use in implementing our capital projects. We have gone over 2 years without a single contractor injury associated with these nonroutine tasks. We did have our board meeting and our Annual Meeting of Shareholders last Friday. I'm pleased to report that all the nominees for directors were handily elected. The auditors were ratified and our annual say on pay advisory board passed with over 98% approval rate. 
Also, our board did name a new officer, Greg Harrison, a long-time LP Manager has been named Vice President of Siding Manufacturing as a recognition of his importance for the success of this business. Greg was instrumental in the successful conversion and the start up of Swan Valley mill. 
Today, I'm be providing comments on our results and accomplishments, discuss key demand drivers and give you my views on the outlook for the rest of this year. For the second consecutive quarter, all business segments reported a positive adjusted EBITDA total of $52 million for the company. EBITDA improved by $46 million over Q1 of 2015 and by $18 million compared to last quarter. Steve of reported North Central 716's Q1 pricing down $17 versus the last quarter, but we're actually reporting flat due to an increase in our value-added mix and improved freight utilization. As a result of these significant factors, improved operational opportunity and cost control, our EBITDA improved to $30 million versus $25 million in Q4. 
During the quarter, we also successfully completed the press rebuild of our Hansville, Alabama mill. In Siding, our SmartSide revenue grew 28% versus Q4 driven by a 22% volume increase. The SmartSide volume has the highest volume ever that we've achieved in Q1 of last year. The Swan Valley siding mill conversion is ahead of the pro forma production schedule and we expect this mill to make a positive contribution next quarter. We are very pleased with the rebound on our siding sales as you put a major focus on returning to growth as we put capacity back in front of this business. 
As I said in the last quarter, we have unleashed our sales and marketing team along with our distortion partners and we are seeing the results. LP EBITDA positive for the quarter and performed better than Q1 of last year. However, we did see a drop in EBITDA performance compared to Q4 last year due to an equipment failure in our one of mills that produced quarter-over-quarter sales and the change in the mix. 
Sally said in South America, we had a very good first quarter with adjusted EBITDA at $7 million. Prices improved in Chile and Brazil in local currency versus last quarter. Strong export volumes in China and other South American countries offset weak domestic demand in Brazil. We continue with the engineering design work for our third mill in Chile in anticipation of board approval of this project over the summer. Our housing market, as Sally mentioned the Q1 news was a little bit mixed. Overall, Q1 housing starts ran at an annual rate of $1.13 million, actually flat to Q4 of last year. The consensus for 2016 starts now at 1.23 million, a 10% improvement over 2015, which I believe is possible. Consensus forecast for 2017 is 1.37 million, another 12% increase. The good news for us that in Q1, single-family starts average a seasonally adjusted rate of 792,000. This is the highest quarterly rate since Q4 of 2007, and this represents an increase of 23% over the same quarter last year. We believe the good weather in February, March aided starts. Also notable the improvements in new home demand for entry-level buyers. We estimate that the OSB consumption ratio between single and multi-family is about 3:1. The improvement in single-family starts was offset by a decline in multi-family starts. Compared to Q4 of last year, multi-family starts declined 10% volume from 379,000 to 341,000, which happen to be flat with last year. Household formation growth continues to drive rising rents and low vacancy rates across the country.  Other positive housing data: existing home inventory was down 1.1% year-over-year through January. So home inventory is very tight on a historical basis. 
On the financing side, average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rates were 3.58 for the week ended April 15, which was down for 3.92 3 months earlier. In Canada for the first quarter, starts were at seasonally adjusted rate of $2,000, a growth of 2% from Q4. Almost all of this increase was in single-family detached units, which makes up about 35% of Canadian starts. So while there is forecasted growth in housing for the next several years, it is incumbent on us to focus on continue to increase our growth outside of our traditional market by developing products, product applications and market segments and address needs and industrial repair model where year-over-year growth has exceeded 10% and like commercial activities. The year-over-year non-residential construction was up 11.2% through February. 
So while the consensus for 2016 housing starts has been moved slightly successfully, I am encouraged by the increase in single-family starts and the supporting data for sales of building materials by dealers are up double digits in the first quarter of the year. So I remain optimistic about the rest of 2016. 
As I have said before, I continue to be concerned about labor and land availability for builders uncertainly relative to lending standards for buyers, and the impact for the presidential race on our nation and more specifically potentially consumer confidence. But continued strong employment growth will bolstered household formation. And fundamentally, housing demand should strength throughout this year providing a positive marketing environment for our products. 
In our Siding business, strong order rates continued through April, and OSB random links has reported North Central placing flat or increase in the each week since the end of the quarter. So compared to this time last year, pricing is higher by 37%. Strong single-family starts is driving demand for both of these businesses as well as Engineered Wood. South America expect good OSB and siding demand in Chile throughout the year.
For Brazil, we will continue to focus on export opportunities as these are generally priced in U.S. dollars and we can benefit from the week resilient With that, make sure we're for questions"

As far as the margin, we do focus on the margin compared to our public peers and we actually made some progress in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter. Fundamentally in the past, we have taken more of the industry downtimes our operating rates have been a little bit lower. I think our public competitors talk about operating rates about 92%, so we're about 6 points below that. We do believe that if Hansville had to run all quarter in stead of taking the month of downtime, they're probably been another $3 per 1,000 that we would have added to our margin. So we are focused on that. I think that fundamentally it's tied to the operating rates and how much we run these operations. And we are advanced a little bit by our value-added percentage, but our competitors also focus on value-added product."

East  Texas is 20 inches above normal so far this seasonal. Alabama is 15 inches above normal. The good news is we did put in inventory in our log decks in our fourth quarter, take advantage lower pricing and offset maybe some of the risk of this. So we think we're in pretty good shape there. In North Carolina, we've also had heavy rain fall, but we think we're in pretty good shape in North Carolina. But the fire season and the Western Canada is of concern.

There's little bit of multi-family activity, but this is largely a single-family construction-driven business. And so the housing starts that we had in the first quarter where permits are, I think bodes well for continued demand. I think the difficulty with the price increase is that we do have a lot of excess capacity in this business and we just have to be cognizant of that. We did have a recent consolidation and that has created some turmoil in the market as producers are pursuing new business or customers are looking for new uses partners. So there is -- I would characterize Q1 is a bit of a turmoil and it's probably going to extended into Q2. That's probably  when you have that kind of turmoil, it's probably not a time for price increase, but I can see the second half of the year at least LP considering price increases, as we will see higher raw materials particularly in the OSB side."

We are spending a lot of resources looking at alternative markets to traditional single-family, multi-family housing. And we are having some success. But as I think everybody in the phone realizes, it's hard to get a new product in the market and have a big revenue impact in the first year or 2. But we're certainly setting a foundation for continuing to grow. I'll give you a few examples. We went into the furniture market in 2009, right? We were in the midst of the downturn. It took us a while, but now most of the furniture manufactures that converted to OSB from plywood, that's benefited, not just us, but it's benefited the entire industry. With our fire product, we actually introduced that about 5 years. And now, we are adding a second production facility, so we can satisfy market demand. And hopefully right after that, we'll provide a third manufacturing facility. So we can do that. It's a little slow taking off, but I'm pleased with the progress. If I look at the funnel projects we got, it's very robust. We're limiting where put our resources to those highest priorities, but I feel pretty good about it, and our goal is to have 50% of the overall company at a high value-added margin products in the next couple of years."

I will begin the discussion with a review of the financial results for the first quarter of 2016, and this will be followed by some comments on the performance of the individual segments and selected balance sheet items. After I finish my comments, Curt will discuss the general market environment in which LP has been operating and provide his perspective on our operating results and give some thoughts on the outlook. 
As we have done in the past, we've opened up this call to the public and are doing a webcast. And the webcast can be accessed at www.lpcorp.com. 
Additionally, to help with the discussions, we have provided a presentation with supplemental information that should be reviewed in conjunction with the earnings release. I will be referencing these slides in my comments this morning. We have filed an 8-K this morning with some supplemental information as well as our Form 10-Q. 
I want to remind all the participants about the forward-looking statements comment on Slide 2 of the presentation. Please also be aware of the discussion of our use of non-GAAP financial information included on Slide 3 of the presentation. 
The appendix attached to the presentation has some of the necessary reconciliations have been supplemented by the Form 8-K filing we made this morning. Rather than reading these 2 statements, I incorporate them with this reference. 
The first quarter was a good start to 2016 for LP and has set us up for continued improvement for the remainder of the year. U.S. housing start data does remain choppy, but the market appears to be on a trajectory for a 10% to 15% improvement over 2015. Overall, in the past couple of quarters, we have had a number of questions in meetings and on this call about the market demand for our SmartSide siding. The Siding segment's results this quarter demonstrate that we are back on track, given the 22% improvement in SmartSide volume from the fourth quarter of 2015. And with that, let me go into the details. 
Moving to Slide 4 of the presentation for a discussion of the first quarter 2016 consolidated results. We are reporting net sales of $505 million for the first quarter of 2016, a 7% increase from the net sales of $472 million reported in the first quarter of 2015. In the first quarter, we recorded net income of $10 million or $0.07 per diluted share compared to a loss of $35 million or a loss of $0.24 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2015. 
The adjusted income from continuing operations for the quarter were $10 million or $0.07 per diluted share based upon a normalized tax rate of 35% as compared to a loss of $19 million or a loss per share of $0.13 reported in the first quarter of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $52 million in the quarter compared to $6 million in the first quarter of 2015. 
Moving on to Slide 5 of the presentation and a review of our segment results. Starting with OSB. OSB reported net sales for the first quarter of 2016 of $217 million, up 14% from $190 million in the first quarter of 2015. OSB reported operating income of $15 million compared to a loss of $29 million in the first quarter of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $30 million compared to negative adjusted EBITDA of $13 million in the first quarter of 2015. Sales volumes were flat. Pricing for OSB was higher by 14%, which improved operating results by $27 million. The first quarter 2016 OSB operating results were positively impacted by reductions in raw material cost, higher utilization rates as well as the positive impact of the Canadian currency. 
Slide 6 reports the results of the Siding business. This segment includes our SmartSide and CanExel siding products as well as a minor amount of OSB. Siding reported net sales for the first quarter of 2016 of $181 million, up 4% from $174 million in the first quarter of 2015. Siding reported operating income of $27 million compared to operating income of $33 million in the first quarter of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $34 million compared to $38 million in the first quarter of 2015. SmartSide volume was up 1% from the prior year and 22% sequentially. Sales prices on SmartSide were down 2% due to changes in product mix, with individual pricing remaining relatively flat. For CanExel, sales volume increased 15%, primarily due to increased demand in Europe. Sales prices for CanExel were lower by 11% in U.S. dollars. CanExel Canadian dollar sales prices were up 2%. 
As a reminder, the Swan conversion from an OSB mill to the siding -- as a reminder, with the Swan conversion from the OSB mill to a siding mill, the Siding segment started producing and selling OSB again in spite our Hayward, Wisconsin mill. During the first quarter of 2016, the Siding segment produced about 53 million square feet of OSB as compared to net OSB production in the first quarter of 2015. The negative impact of the Swan conversion on the Siding segment's financial results for the quarter was less than $1 million, and we are not anticipating any negative impact of the Swan conversion in the second quarter on earnings. 
The reduction in operating results for the Siding segment is -- for the first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015 was primarily due to higher cost of sales related to the fourth quarter higher cost of production due to downtime. The higher cost of production in the fourth quarter was capitalized into the inventory, which was then sold in the first quarter. The cost of production in the first quarter was lower than the cost of reduction in the fourth quarter of 2015. An increase in OSB production and increased sales in marketing cost to support future growth also contributed to the lower operating results in the quarter. These higher costs were partially offset by lower raw material costs. 
Please turn to Slide 7 of the presentation, which shows the results from our Engineered Wood Products segment. This segment includes I-Joist; Laminated Strand Lumber; Laminated Veneer Lumber; OSB produced at our Houlton, Maine facility; plus other related products. This segment also includes the sale of I-Joist and LVL products produced by the Abitibi joint venture under a sales arrangement with Murphy Plywood. 
The Engineered Wood Products segment reported sales of $72 million in the first quarter of 2016, up from $65 million in the first quarter of 2015. The segment's results were a loss of $2.5 million in the first quarter of 2016 as compared to a loss of $4 million in the first quarter of 2015. In the first quarter of 2016, adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations improved by $1 million as compared to the first quarter of 2015. Volumes of I-Joist were up 19%, while volumes of LVL/LSL were up 18% compared to the same quarter last year. Pricing was up 3% in LVL and up 2% in I-Joist. 
Moving on to Slide 8 of the presentation. For the quarter, our South American segment recorded sales of $31 million as compared to $36 million in the first quarter of 2015. Operating income was $5 million as compared to $2 million in the first quarter of 2015, and adjusted EBITDA was higher by $2 million for the first quarter of 2016 as compared to the first quarter of 2015. Volumes were down 12% in Chile in 3% in Brazil compared to the same quarter last year. The sales volume decrease in Chile was due to increased exports impacting local demand and in Brazil due to decreased local sales as Brazil continues to face an economic recession in their local market. 
On a U.S. dollar basis, pricing was up 1% in Chile and down 11% in Brazil. In local currency, Chile's pricing was up 14% compared to the same quarter in 2015, and Brazil's pricing was 25% higher in local currency. 
Total selling, general and administrative expense was $42 million in the first quarter of 2016 compared to $39 million in the same quarter of 2015. For the quarter, the increase in selling, general and administrative expense was primarily due to increases in certain management incentives in 2016 and higher costs associated with corporate sales and marketing to support our revenue growth. Interest expense net was flat between the periods. 
Please turn to Slide 9 of the presentation. As of March 31, 2016, we had cash, cash equivalents, investments and restricted cash of $424 million; working capital of $650 million; net cash of $58 million. And in addition to the $424 million of cash on our balance sheet, we had $2 million of availability on our credit facility. Capital expenditures through March 31, 2016, were $26 million. We are projecting capital expenditures for 2016 at $120 million to $130 million. Approximately $100 million has been allocated to North American project, 50% for growth and the remaining for capital maintenance and cost reduction. The remaining $20 million to $30 million has been allocated to our South American segment, primarily for the building of a third mill in Chile. 
Now with that, I'll turn the call over to Curt for his comments"

As I usually do, I'll start with our safety performance. The American Panel Association just announced the results of their safety and health awards program for 2015, and I'm pleased that for the second year in a row, LP was recognized the safest large company that's a company with more than 4 mills. This is the sixth time that we have been so recognized in the last 8 years. Our I-Joist JV, which has 2 mills with Resolute in Quebec, was named the safest small company with 3 or fewer mills. There's been 11 facilities included in the Incident Free Honor Society. The American Forest and Paper Association also released their safety data for 2015 [indiscernible] companies, and LP was identified as having the best total incident rate. I continue to be extremely proud of all of our employees who recognize the value of being safe and commit to it and act accordingly. 
In addition to the obvious savings in workers' compensation cost, LP employees have made their commitment to safety the cornerstone of our company's culture, which we believe gives us a competitive edge in the hiring and retention of our people. 
Finally, the safety culture extends to the many contractors that we use in implementing our capital projects. We have gone over 2 years without a single contractor injury associated with these nonroutine tasks. 
We did have our board meeting and our Annual Meeting of Shareholders last Friday. I'm pleased to report that all the nominees for director were handily elected. The auditors were ratified, and our annual say-on-pay advisory vote passed with over a 98% approval rate. 
Also, our board did name a new officer. Greg Harrison, a long-time LP Manager, has been named Vice President Siding Manufacturing as a recognition of his importance to the success of this business. Greg was instrumental in the successful conversion and startup of the Swan Valley mill. 
Today, I'll be providing comments on our results and accomplishments, discuss key demand drivers and give you my views on the outlook for the rest of this year. For the second consecutive quarter, all business segments reported a positive adjusted EBITDA that total $52 million for the company. EBITDA improved by $46 million over Q1 of 2015 and by $18 million compared to last quarter. In OSB, Random Lengths reported North Central 7/16's Q1 pricing down $17 versus the last quarter, but we're actually reporting flat due to an increase in our value-added mix and improved freight utilization. As a result of these significant factors, improved operational productivity and cost control, our EBITDA improved to $30 million versus $25 million in Q4. 
During the quarter, we also successfully completed the press rebuild of our Hanceville, Alabama mill. 
In Siding, our SmartSide revenue grew 28% versus Q4, driven by a 22% volume increase. The SmartSide volume has the highest volume ever that we've achieved in Q1 of last year. The Swan Valley siding mill conversion is ahead of the pro forma production schedule, and we expect this mill to make a positive contribution next quarter. We're very pleased with the rebound on our Siding sales, as we put a major focus on returning to growth as we put capacity back in front of this business. 
As I said last quarter, we have unleashed our sales and marketing team along with our distribution partners, and we are seeing the results. In EWP, we are EBITDA-positive for the quarter and performed better than Q1 of last year. However, we did see a drop in EBITDA performance compared to Q4 last year due to an equipment failure in our one of mills that produced quarter-over-quarter sales and a change in the mix. 
As Sallie said in South America, we had a very good first quarter, with adjusted EBITDA at $7 million. Prices improved in Chile and Brazil in local currency versus last quarter. Strong export volumes in China and other South American countries offset weak domestic demand in Brazil. We continue with the engineering design work for our third mill in Chile in anticipation of board approval of this project over the summer. 
The housing market, as Sallie mentioned, the Q1 news was a little bit mixed. Overall, Q1 housing starts ran at an annual rate of 1.13 million, actually flat to Q4 of last year. The consensus for 2016 starts is now at 1.23 million, a 10% improvement over 2015, which I believe is possible. The consensus forecast for 2017 is 1.37 million, another 12% increase. The good news for us is that in Q1, single-family starts averaged a seasonally adjusted rate of 792,000. This is the highest quarterly rate since Q4 of 2007, and this represents an increase of 23% over the same quarter last year. We believe the good weather in February and March aided starts. 
Also notable are the improvements in new home demand for entry-level buyers. We estimate that the OSB consumption ratio between single and multifamily is about 3:1. The improvement in single-family starts was offset by a decline in multifamily starts. Compared to Q4 of last year, multifamily starts declined 10%, falling from 379,000 to 341,000, which happened to be flat with last year. Household formation growth continues to drive rising rents and low vacancy rates across the country. Other positive housing data: existing home inventory was down 1.1% year-over-year through January, so home inventory is very tight on a historical basis. 
On the financing side, average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rates were 3.58% for the week ended April 15, which was down from 3.92% 3 months earlier. 
In Canada, for the first quarter, starts were at seasonally adjusted rate of 200,000, a growth of 2% from Q4. Almost all of this increase was in single-family detached units, which makes up about 35% of Canadian starts. So while there is forecasted growth in housing for the next several years, it is incumbent on us to focus on continuing to increase our growth outside of our traditional market by developing products, product applications and market segments that can address needs and industrial repair model, where year-over-year growth has exceeded 10% and light commercial activities. The year-over-year nonresidential construction was up 11.2% through February. 
So while the consensus for 2016 housing starts has moved down slightly since January, I am encouraged by the increase in single-family starts and the supporting data for sales of building materials by dealers are up double digits in the first part of the year. So I remain optimistic about the rest of 2016. 
As I've said before, I continue to be concerned about labor and land availability for builders, uncertainly relative to lending standards for buyers and the impact for the presidential race on our nation and more specifically, potentially on consumer confidence; that continued strong employment growth will bolster household, formation; and fundamentally, housing demand should strength throughout this year, providing a positive market environment for our products. 
In our Siding business, strong order rates continued through April, and OSB Random Lengths has reported North Central pricing flat or increasing each week since the end of the quarter. So compared to this time last year, pricing is higher by 37%. Strong single-family starts is driving demand for both these businesses as well as Engineered Wood. 
South America, expect good OSB and siding demand in Chile throughout the year. For Brazil, we will continue to focus on export opportunities as these are generally priced in U.S. dollars, and we can benefit from the week Brazilian real. 
With that, let me turn it over to Sallie for questions"

And as a reminder, what we did have in the quarter is we did take a month of downtime at our Hanceville, Alabama mill to do the press rebuild. As far as the margin, we do focus on the margin compared to our public peers, and we actually made some progress in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter. Fundamentally in the past, we have taken more of the industry downtime, so our operating rates have been a little bit lower. I think our public competitors talk about operating rates in -- about 92%, so we're about 6 points below that. We do believe that if Hanceville had to run all quarter instead of taking a month of downtime, there'd probably been another $3 per 1,000 that we would have added to our margin. So we are focused on that. I think that fundamentally, it's tied to the operating rates and how much we run these operations. And we are advantaged a little bit by our value-added percentage, but our competitor is also focus on value-added product."

East Texas is 20 inches above normal so far this season. Alabama is 15 inches above normal. The good news is we did put in inventory in our log decks in the fourth quarter to take advantage both of lower pricing and to offset maybe some of the risk of this. So we think we're in pretty good shape there. In North Carolina, we've also had heavy rain fall, but we think we're in pretty good shape in North Carolina. But the fire season in Western Canada is of concern. And so we're going to be very cognizant of that. Fortunately, we've built a pretty good log deck at Peace Valley and Dawson Creek."

And so there's -- I would characterize Q1 as a bit of turmoil, and it's probably going to extend into Q2.

But as I think everybody in the phone realizes, it's hard to get a new product in the market and have a big revenue impact in the first year or 2. But we're certainly setting a foundation for continuing to grow. I'll give you a few examples. We went into the furniture market in 2009, right, when we're in the midst of the downturn. It took us a while, but now most of the furniture manufacturers have converted to OSB from plywood. That's benefited not just us, but it's benefited the entire industry. With our fire retardant product, we actually introduced that about 5 years ago, and now we are adding a second production facility so we can satisfy market demand. Hopefully right after that, we'll provide a third manufacturing facility so we can do that. So it's a little slow taking off, but I'm pleased with the progress. If I look at the funnel projects we've got, it's very robust. We're limiting where put our resources to those highest priorities, but I feel pretty good about it. And our goal is to have 50% of the overall company at a high value-added margin products in the next couple of years."

And it's a little tough because some of our competitors include plywood in that and MDF and particleboard. Some include their distribution operation, so you can't really see what the pricing is. So we look at a relative change between quarters both the last quarter and then the same quarter of the prior year. And from a relative change basis, we were pretty consistent both on a volume standpoint and a pricing standpoint with our competitors and the industry. What hurt us in the first quarter is we did have -- one of our press lines for LVL did go down on the East Coast, and we had about a month of outage. And what we did is we replaced that volume to satisfy our customers' needs with a production that we get out of Murphy Plywood. When we sell that, we're basically recovering our sales costs, but not any manufacturing margin. So our volumes were good, but we had to replace it with manufacturer product outside. The other thing, when you look at our margins versus our competitor, just to remember, is that the Abitibi -- or the Resolute joint venture in Quebec, we only get half of that margin because we share with our partner. We also only have half of the investment in that. So I believe our numbers were about $2 million lower than they should have been due to that -- due to the fact of having to satisfy our customers out of the Murphy volume."

And with me today are Curt Stevens, LP's Chief Executive Officer; as well as Mike Kinney and Becky Barckley, our primary Investor Relations contact. 
I will begin the discussion with a review of the financial results for the first quarter of 2016, and this will be followed by some comments on the performance of the individual segments and selected balance sheet items. After I finish my comments, Curt will discuss the general market environment in which LP has been operating and provide his perspective on our operating results and give some thoughts on the outlook. 
As we have done in the past, we've opened up this call to the public and are doing a webcast. And the webcast can be accessed at www.lpcorp.com. 
Additionally, to help with the discussions, we have provided a presentation with supplemental information that should be reviewed in conjunction with the earnings release. I will be referencing these slides in my comments this morning. We have filed an 8-K this morning with some supplemental information as well as our Form 10-Q. 
I want to remind all the participants about the forward-looking statements comment on Slide 2 of the presentation. Please also be aware of the discussion of our use of non-GAAP financial information included on Slide 3 of the presentation. 
The appendix attached to the presentation has some of the necessary reconciliations have been supplemented by the Form 8-K filing we made this morning. Rather than reading these 2 statements, I incorporate them with this reference. 
The first quarter was a good start to 2016 for LP and has set us up for continued improvement for the remainder of the year. U.S. housing start data does remain choppy, but the market appears to be on a trajectory for a 10% to 15% improvement over 2015. Overall, in the past couple of quarters, we have had a number of questions in meetings and on this call about the market demand for our SmartSide siding. The Siding segment's results this quarter demonstrate that we are back on track, given the 22% improvement in SmartSide volume from the fourth quarter of 2015. And with that, let me go into the details. 
Moving to Slide 4 of the presentation for a discussion of the first quarter 2016 consolidated results. We are reporting net sales of $505 million for the first quarter of 2016, a 7% increase from the net sales of $472 million reported in the first quarter of 2015. In the first quarter, we recorded net income of $10 million or $0.07 per diluted share compared to a loss of $35 million or a loss of $0.24 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2015. 
The adjusted income from continuing operations for the quarter were $10 million or $0.07 per diluted share based upon a normalized tax rate of 35% as compared to a loss of $19 million or a loss per share of $0.13 reported in the first quarter of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $52 million in the quarter compared to $6 million in the first quarter of 2015. 
Moving on to Slide 5 of the presentation and a review of our segment results. Starting with OSB. OSB reported net sales for the first quarter of 2016 of $217 million, up 14% from $190 million in the first quarter of 2015. OSB reported operating income of $15 million compared to a loss of $29 million in the first quarter of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $30 million compared to negative adjusted EBITDA of $13 million in the first quarter of 2015. Sales volumes were flat. Pricing for OSB was higher by 14%, which improved operating results by $27 million. The first quarter 2016 OSB operating results were positively impacted by reductions in raw material cost, higher utilization rates as well as the positive impact of the Canadian currency. 
Slide 6 reports the results of the Siding business. This segment includes our SmartSide and CanExel siding products as well as a minor amount of OSB. Siding reported net sales for the first quarter of 2016 of $181 million, up 4% from $174 million in the first quarter of 2015. Siding reported operating income of $27 million compared to operating income of $33 million in the first quarter of 2016. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $34 million compared to $38 million in the first quarter of 2015. SmartSide volume was up 1% from the prior year and 22% sequentially. Sales prices on SmartSide were down 2% due to changes in product mix, with individual pricing remaining relatively flat. For CanExel, sales volume increased 15%, primarily due to increased demand in Europe. Sales prices for CanExel were lower by 11% in U.S. dollars. CanExel Canadian dollar sales prices were up 2%. 
As a reminder, the Swan conversion from an OSB mill to the siding -- as a reminder, with the Swan conversion from the OSB mill to a siding mill, the Siding segment started producing and selling OSB again out of our Hayward, Wisconsin mill. During the first quarter of 2016, the Siding segment produced about 53 million square feet of OSB as compared to no OSB production in the first quarter of 2015. The negative impact of the Swan conversion on the Siding segment's financial results for the quarter was less than $1 million, and we are not anticipating any negative impact of the Swan conversion in the second quarter on earnings. 
The reduction in operating results for the Siding segment is -- for the first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015 was primarily due to higher cost of sales related to the fourth quarter higher cost of production due to downtime. The higher cost of production in the fourth quarter was capitalized into the inventory, which was then sold in the first quarter. The cost of production in the first quarter was lower than the cost of production in the fourth quarter of 2015. An increase in OSB production and increased sales and marketing cost to support future growth also contributed to the lower operating results in the quarter. These higher costs were partially offset by lower raw material costs. 
Please turn to Slide 7 of the presentation, which shows the results from our Engineered Wood Products segment. This segment includes I-Joist; Laminated Strand Lumber; Laminated Veneer Lumber; OSB produced at our Houlton, Maine facility; plus other related products. This segment also includes the sale of I-Joist and LVL products produced by the Abitibi joint venture under a sales arrangement with Murphy Plywood. 
The Engineered Wood Products segment reported sales of $72 million in the first quarter of 2016, up from $65 million in the first quarter of 2015. The segment's results were a loss of $2.5 million in the first quarter of 2016 as compared to a loss of $4 million in the first quarter of 2015. In the first quarter of 2016, adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations improved by $1 million as compared to the first quarter of 2015. Volumes of I-Joist were up 19%, while volumes of LVL/LSL were up 18% compared to the same quarter last year. Pricing was up 3% in LVL and up 2% in I-Joist. 
Moving on to Slide 8 of the presentation. For the quarter, our South American segment recorded sales of $31 million as compared to $36 million in the first quarter of 2015. Operating income was $5 million as compared to $2 million in the first quarter of 2015, and adjusted EBITDA was higher by $2 million for the first quarter of 2016 as compared to the first quarter of 2015. Volumes were down 12% in Chile in 3% in Brazil compared to the same quarter last year. The sales volume decrease in Chile was due to increased exports impacting local demand and in Brazil due to decreased local sales as Brazil continues to face an economic recession in their local market. 
On a U.S. dollar basis, pricing was up 1% in Chile and down 11% in Brazil. In local currency, Chile's pricing was up 14% compared to the same quarter in 2015, and Brazil's pricing was 25% higher in local currency. 
Total selling, general and administrative expense was $42 million in the first quarter of 2016 compared to $39 million in the same quarter of 2015. For the quarter, the increase in selling, general and administrative expense was primarily due to increases in certain management incentives in 2016 and higher costs associated with corporate sales and marketing to support our revenue growth. Interest expense net was flat between the periods. 
Please turn to Slide 9 of the presentation. As of March 31, 2016, we had cash, cash equivalents, investments and restricted cash of $424 million; working capital of $650 million; net cash of $58 million. And in addition to the $424 million of cash on our balance sheet, we had $2 million of availability on our credit facility. Capital expenditures through March 31, 2016, were $26 million. We are projecting capital expenditures for 2016 at $120 million to $130 million. Approximately $100 million has been allocated to North American project, 50% for growth and the remaining for capital maintenance and cost reduction. The remaining $20 million to $30 million has been allocated to our South American segment, primarily for the building of a third mill in Chile. 
Now with that, I'll turn the call over to Curt for his comments"

As I usually do, I'll start with our safety performance. The American Panel Association just announced the results of their safety and health awards program for 2015, and I'm pleased that for the second year in a row, LP was recognized the safest large company, that's a company with more than 4 mills. This is the sixth time that we have been so recognized in the last 8 years. Our I-Joist JV, which has 2 mills with Resolute in Quebec, was named the safest small company with 3 or fewer mills. There's been 11 facilities included in the Incident Free Honor Society. The American Forest and Paper Association also released their safety data for 2015 for their universe of companies, and LP was identified as having the best total incident rate. I continue to be extremely proud of all of our employees who recognize the value of being safe and commit to it and act accordingly. 
In addition to the obvious savings in workers' compensation cost, LP employees have made their commitment to safety the cornerstone of our company's culture, which we believe gives us a competitive edge in the hiring and retention of our people. 
Finally, the safety culture extends to the many contractors that we use in implementing our capital projects. We have gone over 2 years without a single contractor injury associated with these nonroutine tasks. 
We did have our board meeting and our Annual Meeting of Shareholders last Friday. I'm pleased to report that all the nominees for director were handily elected. The auditors were ratified, and our annual say-on-pay advisory vote passed with over a 98% approval rate. 
Also, our board did name a new officer. Greg Harrison, a long-time LP Manager, has been named Vice President Siding Manufacturing as a recognition of his importance to the success of this business. Greg was instrumental in the successful conversion and startup of the Swan Valley mill. 
Today, I'll be providing comments on our results and accomplishments, discuss key demand drivers and give you my views on the outlook for the rest of this year. For the second consecutive quarter, all business segments reported a positive adjusted EBITDA that totaled $52 million for the company. EBITDA improved by $46 million over Q1 of 2015 and by $18 million compared to last quarter. In OSB, Random Lengths reported North Central 7/16's Q1 pricing down $17 versus the last quarter, but we're actually reporting flat due to an increase in our value-added mix and improved freight utilization. As a result of these significant factors, improved operational productivity and cost control, our EBITDA improved to $30 million versus $25 million in Q4. 
During the quarter, we also successfully completed the press rebuild of our Hanceville, Alabama mill. 
In Siding, our SmartSide revenue grew 28% versus Q4, driven by a 22% volume increase. The SmartSide volume matched the highest volume ever that we've achieved in Q1 of last year. The Swan Valley siding mill conversion is ahead of the pro forma production schedule, and we expect this mill to make a positive contribution next quarter. We're very pleased with the rebound on our Siding sales, as we put a major focus on returning to growth as we put capacity back in front of this business. 
As I said last quarter, we have unleashed our sales and marketing team along with our distribution partners, and we are seeing the results. In EWP, we are EBITDA-positive for the quarter and performed better than Q1 of last year. However, we did see a drop in EBITDA performance compared to Q4 last year due to an equipment failure in our one of mills that produced quarter-over-quarter sales and a change in the mix. 
As Sallie said in South America, we had a very good first quarter, with adjusted EBITDA at $7 million. Prices improved in Chile and Brazil in local currency versus last quarter. Strong export volumes in China and other South American countries offset weak domestic demand in Brazil. We continue with the engineering design work for our third mill in Chile in anticipation of board approval of this project over the summer. 
The housing market, as Sallie mentioned, the Q1 news was a little bit mixed. Overall, Q1 housing starts ran at an annual rate of 1.13 million, actually flat to Q4 of last year. The consensus for 2016 starts is now at 1.23 million, a 10% improvement over 2015, which I believe is possible. The consensus forecast for 2017 is 1.37 million, another 12% increase. The good news for us is that in Q1, single-family starts averaged a seasonally adjusted rate of 792,000. This is the highest quarterly rate since Q4 of 2007, and this represents an increase of 23% over the same quarter last year. We believe the good weather in February and March aided starts. 
Also notable are the improvements in new home demand for entry-level buyers. We estimate that the OSB consumption ratio between single and multifamily is about 3:1. The improvement in single-family starts was offset by a decline in multifamily starts. Compared to Q4 of last year, multifamily starts declined 10%, falling from 379,000 to 341,000, which happened to be flat with last year. Household formation growth continues to drive rising rents and low vacancy rates across the country. Other positive housing data: existing home inventory was down 1.1% year-over-year through January, so home inventory is very tight on a historical basis. 
On the financing side, average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rates were 3.58% for the week ended April 15, which was down from 3.92% 3 months earlier. 
In Canada, for the first quarter, starts were at seasonally adjusted rate of 200,000, a growth of 2% from Q4. Almost all of this increase was in single-family detached units, which makes up about 35% of Canadian starts. So while there is forecasted growth in housing for the next several years, it is incumbent on us to focus on continuing to increase our growth outside of our traditional market by developing products, product applications and market segments that can address needs in industrial repair model, where year-over-year growth has exceeded 10% and light commercial activities. The year-over-year nonresidential construction was up 11.2% through February. 
So while the consensus for 2016 housing starts has moved down slightly since January, I am encouraged by the increase in single-family starts and the supporting data for sales of building materials by dealers are up double digits in the first part of the year. So I remain optimistic about the rest of 2016. 
As I've said before, I continue to be concerned about labor and land availability for builders, uncertainty relative to lending standards for buyers and the impact for the presidential race on our nation and more specifically, potentially on consumer confidence; that continued strong employment growth will bolster household, formation; and fundamentally, housing demand should strengthen throughout this year, providing a positive market environment for our products. 
In our Siding business, strong order rates continued through April, and OSB Random Lengths has reported North Central pricing flat or increasing each week since the end of the quarter. So compared to this time last year, pricing is higher by 37%. Strong single-family starts is driving demand for both these businesses as well as Engineered Wood. 
South America, expect good OSB and siding demand in Chile throughout the year. For Brazil, we will continue to focus on export opportunities as these are generally priced in U.S. dollars, and we can benefit from the weak Brazilian real. 
With that, let me turn it over to Sallie for questions"

As far as the margin, we do focus on the margin compared to our public peers, and we actually made some progress in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter. Fundamentally in the past, we have taken more of the industry downtime, so our operating rates have been a little bit lower. I think our public competitors talk about operating rates in -- about 92%, so we're about 6 points below that. We do believe that if Hanceville had to run all quarter instead of taking a month of downtime, there'd probably been another $3 per 1,000 that we would have added to our margin. So we are focused on that. I think that fundamentally, it's tied to the operating rates and how much we run these operations.

It may have some impact on our competitors, but it's certainly not a threat to us. The other part that we're worried about is the rain we've had in Texas and Alabama. East Texas is 20 inches above normal so far this season. Alabama is 15 inches above normal. The good news is we did put in inventory in our log decks in the fourth quarter to take advantage both of lower pricing and to offset maybe some of the risk of this. So we think we're in pretty good shape there. In North Carolina, we've also had heavy rain fall, but we think we're in pretty good shape in North Carolina. But the fire season in Western Canada is of concern. And so we're going to be very cognizant of that. Fortunately, we've built a pretty good log deck at Peace Valley and Dawson Creek."

But as I think everybody in the phone realizes, it's hard to get a new product in the market and have a big revenue impact in the first year or 2. But we're certainly setting a foundation for continuing to grow. I'll give you a few examples. We went into the furniture market in 2009, right, when we're in the midst of the downturn. It took us a while, but now most of the furniture manufacturers have converted to OSB from plywood. That's benefited not just us, but it's benefited the entire industry. With our fire retardant product, we actually introduced that about 5 years ago, and now we are adding a second production facility so we can satisfy market demand. Hopefully right after that, we'll provide a third manufacturing facility so we can do that. So it's a little slow taking off, but I'm pleased with the progress. If I look at the funnel projects we've got, it's very robust. We're limiting where put our resources to those highest priorities, but I feel pretty good about it.

What hurt us in the first quarter is we did have -- one of our press lines for LVL did go down on the East Coast, and we had about a month of outage. And what we did is we replaced that volume to satisfy our customers' needs with a production that we get out of Murphy Plywood. When we sell that, we're basically recovering our sales costs, but not any manufacturing margin. So our volumes were good, but we had to replace it with manufacturer product outside. The other thing, when you look at our margins versus our competitor, just to remember, is that the Abitibi -- or the Resolute joint venture in Quebec, we only get half of that margin because we share with our partner.

And with me today are Curt Stevens, LP's Chief Executive Officer; as well as Mike Kinney and Becky Barckley, our primary Investor Relations contact. 
I will begin the discussion with a review of the financial results for the first quarter of 2016, and this will be followed by some comments on the performance of the individual segments and selected balance sheet items. After I finish my comments, Curt will discuss the general market environment in which LP has been operating and provide his perspective on our operating results and give some thoughts on the outlook. 
As we have done in the past, we've opened up this call to the public and are doing a webcast. And the webcast can be accessed at www.lpcorp.com. 
Additionally, to help with the discussions, we have provided a presentation with supplemental information that should be reviewed in conjunction with the earnings release. I will be referencing these slides in my comments this morning. We have filed an 8-K this morning with some supplemental information as well as our Form 10-Q.

The first quarter was a good start to 2016 for LP and has set us up for continued improvement for the remainder of the year. U.S. housing start data does remain choppy, but the market appears to be on a trajectory for a 10% to 15% improvement over 2015. Overall, in the past couple of quarters, we have had a number of questions in meetings and on this call about the market demand for our SmartSide siding. The Siding segment's results this quarter demonstrate that we are back on track, given the 22% improvement in SmartSide volume from the fourth quarter of 2015. And with that, let me go into the details. 
Moving to Slide 4 of the presentation for a discussion of the first quarter 2016 consolidated results. We are reporting net sales of $505 million for the first quarter of 2016, a 7% increase from the net sales of $472 million reported in the first quarter of 2015. In the first quarter, we recorded net income of $10 million or $0.07 per diluted share compared to a loss of $35 million or a loss of $0.24 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2015. 
The adjusted income from continuing operations for the quarter were $10 million or $0.07 per diluted share based upon a normalized tax rate of 35% as compared to a loss of $19 million or a loss per share of $0.13 reported in the first quarter of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $52 million in the quarter compared to $6 million in the first quarter of 2015. 
Moving on to Slide 5 of the presentation and a review of our segment results. Starting with OSB. OSB reported net sales for the first quarter of 2016 of $217 million, up 14% from $190 million in the first quarter of 2015. OSB reported operating income of $15 million compared to a loss of $29 million in the first quarter of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $30 million compared to negative adjusted EBITDA of $13 million in the first quarter of 2015. Sales volumes were flat. Pricing for OSB was higher by 14%, which improved operating results by $27 million. The first quarter 2016 OSB operating results were positively impacted by reductions in raw material cost, higher utilization rates as well as the positive impact of the Canadian currency. 
Slide 6 reports the results of the Siding business. This segment includes our SmartSide and CanExel siding products as well as a minor amount of OSB. Siding reported net sales for the first quarter of 2016 of $181 million, up 4% from $174 million in the first quarter of 2015. Siding reported operating income of $27 million compared to operating income of $33 million in the first quarter of 2016. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $34 million compared to $38 million in the first quarter of 2015. SmartSide volume was up 1% from the prior year and 22% sequentially. Sales prices on SmartSide were down 2% due to changes in product mix, with individual pricing remaining relatively flat. For CanExel, sales volume increased 15%, primarily due to increased demand in Europe. Sales prices for CanExel were lower by 11% in U.S. dollars. CanExel Canadian dollar sales prices were up 2%. 
As a reminder, the Swan conversion from an OSB mill to the siding -- as a reminder, with the Swan conversion from the OSB mill to a siding mill, the Siding segment started producing and selling OSB again out of our Hayward, Wisconsin mill. During the first quarter of 2016, the Siding segment produced about 53 million square feet of OSB as compared to no OSB production in the first quarter of 2015. The negative impact of the Swan conversion on the Siding segment's financial results for the quarter was less than $1 million, and we are not anticipating any negative impact of the Swan conversion in the second quarter on earnings. 
The reduction in operating results for the Siding segment is -- for the first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015 was primarily due to higher cost of sales related to the fourth quarter higher cost of production due to downtime. The higher cost of production in the fourth quarter was capitalized into the inventory, which was then sold in the first quarter. The cost of production in the first quarter was lower than the cost of production in the fourth quarter of 2015. An increase in OSB production and increased sales and marketing cost to support future growth also contributed to the lower operating results in the quarter. These higher costs were partially offset by lower raw material costs. 
Please turn to Slide 7 of the presentation, which shows the results from our Engineered Wood Products segment. This segment includes I-Joist; Laminated Strand Lumber; Laminated Veneer Lumber; OSB produced at our Houlton, Maine facility; plus other related products. This segment also includes the sale of I-Joist and LVL products produced by the Abitibi joint venture under a sales arrangement with Murphy Plywood. 
The Engineered Wood Products segment reported sales of $72 million in the first quarter of 2016, up from $65 million in the first quarter of 2015. The segment's results were a loss of $2.5 million in the first quarter of 2016 as compared to a loss of $4 million in the first quarter of 2015. In the first quarter of 2016, adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations improved by $1 million as compared to the first quarter of 2015. Volumes of I-Joist were up 19%, while volumes of LVL/LSL were up 18% compared to the same quarter last year. Pricing was up 3% in LVL and up 2% in I-Joist. 
Moving on to Slide 8 of the presentation. For the quarter, our South American segment recorded sales of $31 million as compared to $36 million in the first quarter of 2015. Operating income was $5 million as compared to $2 million in the first quarter of 2015, and adjusted EBITDA was higher by $2 million for the first quarter of 2016 as compared to the first quarter of 2015. Volumes were down 12% in Chile in 3% in Brazil compared to the same quarter last year. The sales volume decrease in Chile was due to increased exports impacting local demand and in Brazil due to decreased local sales as Brazil continues to face an economic recession in their local market. 
On a U.S. dollar basis, pricing was up 1% in Chile and down 11% in Brazil. In local currency, Chile's pricing was up 14% compared to the same quarter in 2015, and Brazil's pricing was 25% higher in local currency. 
Total selling, general and administrative expense was $42 million in the first quarter of 2016 compared to $39 million in the same quarter of 2015. For the quarter, the increase in selling, general and administrative expense was primarily due to increases in certain management incentives in 2016 and higher costs associated with corporate sales and marketing to support our revenue growth. Interest expense net was flat between the periods. 
Please turn to Slide 9 of the presentation. As of March 31, 2016, we had cash, cash equivalents, investments and restricted cash of $424 million; working capital of $650 million; net cash of $58 million. And in addition to the $424 million of cash on our balance sheet, we had $2 million of availability on our credit facility. Capital expenditures through March 31, 2016, were $26 million. We are projecting capital expenditures for 2016 at $120 million to $130 million. Approximately $100 million has been allocated to North American project, 50% for growth and the remaining for capital maintenance and cost reduction. The remaining $20 million to $30 million has been allocated to our South American segment, primarily for the building of a third mill in Chile. 
Now with that, I'll turn the call over to Curt for his comments"

As I usually do, I'll start with our safety performance. The American Panel Association just announced the results of their safety and health awards program for 2015, and I'm pleased that for the second year in a row, LP was recognized the safest large company, that's a company with more than 4 mills. This is the sixth time that we have been so recognized in the last 8 years. Our I-Joist JV, which has 2 mills with Resolute in Quebec, was named the safest small company with 3 or fewer mills. There's been 11 facilities included in the Incident Free Honor Society. The American Forest and Paper Association also released their safety data for 2015 for their universe of companies, and LP was identified as having the best total incident rate. I continue to be extremely proud of all of our employees who recognize the value of being safe and commit to it and act accordingly. 
In addition to the obvious savings in workers' compensation cost, LP employees have made their commitment to safety the cornerstone of our company's culture, which we believe gives us a competitive edge in the hiring and retention of our people. 
Finally, the safety culture extends to the many contractors that we use in implementing our capital projects. We have gone over 2 years without a single contractor injury associated with these nonroutine tasks. 
We did have our board meeting and our Annual Meeting of Shareholders last Friday. I'm pleased to report that all the nominees for director were handily elected. The auditors were ratified, and our annual say-on-pay advisory vote passed with over a 98% approval rate. 
Also, our board did name a new officer. Greg Harrison, a long-time LP Manager, has been named Vice President Siding Manufacturing as a recognition of his importance to the success of this business. Greg was instrumental in the successful conversion and startup of the Swan Valley mill. 
Today, I'll be providing comments on our results and accomplishments, discuss key demand drivers and give you my views on the outlook for the rest of this year. For the second consecutive quarter, all business segments reported a positive adjusted EBITDA that totaled $52 million for the company. EBITDA improved by $46 million over Q1 of 2015 and by $18 million compared to last quarter. In OSB, Random Lengths reported North Central 7/16's Q1 pricing down $17 versus the last quarter, but we're actually reporting flat due to an increase in our value-added mix and improved freight utilization. As a result of these significant factors, improved operational productivity and cost control, our EBITDA improved to $30 million versus $25 million in Q4. 
During the quarter, we also successfully completed the press rebuild of our Hanceville, Alabama mill. 
In Siding, our SmartSide revenue grew 28% versus Q4, driven by a 22% volume increase. The SmartSide volume matched the highest volume ever that we've achieved in Q1 of last year. The Swan Valley siding mill conversion is ahead of the pro forma production schedule, and we expect this mill to make a positive contribution next quarter. We're very pleased with the rebound on our Siding sales, as we put a major focus on returning to growth as we put capacity back in front of this business. 
As I said last quarter, we have unleashed our sales and marketing team along with our distribution partners, and we are seeing the results. In EWP, we are EBITDA-positive for the quarter and performed better than Q1 of last year. However, we did see a drop in EBITDA performance compared to Q4 last year due to an equipment failure in our one of mills that produced quarter-over-quarter sales and a change in the mix. 
As Sallie said in South America, we had a very good first quarter, with adjusted EBITDA at $7 million. Prices improved in Chile and Brazil in local currency versus last quarter. Strong export volumes in China and other South American countries offset weak domestic demand in Brazil. We continue with the engineering design work for our third mill in Chile in anticipation of board approval of this project over the summer. 
The housing market, as Sallie mentioned, the Q1 news was a little bit mixed. Overall, Q1 housing starts ran at an annual rate of 1.13 million, actually flat to Q4 of last year. The consensus for 2016 starts is now at 1.23 million, a 10% improvement over 2015, which I believe is possible. The consensus forecast for 2017 is 1.37 million, another 12% increase. The good news for us is that in Q1, single-family starts averaged a seasonally adjusted rate of 792,000. This is the highest quarterly rate since Q4 of 2007, and this represents an increase of 23% over the same quarter last year. We believe the good weather in February and March aided starts. 
Also notable are the improvements in new home demand for entry-level buyers. We estimate that the OSB consumption ratio between single and multifamily is about 3:1. The improvement in single-family starts was offset by a decline in multifamily starts. Compared to Q4 of last year, multifamily starts declined 10%, falling from 379,000 to 341,000, which happened to be flat with last year. Household formation growth continues to drive rising rents and low vacancy rates across the country. Other positive housing data: existing home inventory was down 1.1% year-over-year through January, so home inventory is very tight on a historical basis. 
On the financing side, average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rates were 3.58% for the week ended April 15, which was down from 3.92% 3 months earlier. 
In Canada, for the first quarter, starts were at seasonally adjusted rate of 200,000, a growth of 2% from Q4. Almost all of this increase was in single-family detached units, which makes up about 35% of Canadian starts. So while there is forecasted growth in housing for the next several years, it is incumbent on us to focus on continuing to increase our growth outside of our traditional market by developing products, product applications and market segments that can address needs in industrial repair model, where year-over-year growth has exceeded 10% and light commercial activities. The year-over-year nonresidential construction was up 11.2% through February. 
So while the consensus for 2016 housing starts has moved down slightly since January, I am encouraged by the increase in single-family starts and the supporting data for sales of building materials by dealers are up double digits in the first part of the year. So I remain optimistic about the rest of 2016. 
As I've said before, I continue to be concerned about labor and land availability for builders, uncertainty relative to lending standards for buyers and the impact for the presidential race on our nation and more specifically, potentially on consumer confidence; that continued strong employment growth will bolster household, formation; and fundamentally, housing demand should strengthen throughout this year, providing a positive market environment for our products. 
In our Siding business, strong order rates continued through April, and OSB Random Lengths has reported North Central pricing flat or increasing each week since the end of the quarter. So compared to this time last year, pricing is higher by 37%. Strong single-family starts is driving demand for both these businesses as well as Engineered Wood. 
South America, expect good OSB and siding demand in Chile throughout the year. For Brazil, we will continue to focus on export opportunities as these are generally priced in U.S. dollars, and we can benefit from the weak Brazilian real. 
With that, let me turn it over to Sallie for questions"

As far as the margin, we do focus on the margin compared to our public peers, and we actually made some progress in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter. Fundamentally in the past, we have taken more of the industry downtime, so our operating rates have been a little bit lower. I think our public competitors talk about operating rates in -- about 92%, so we're about 6 points below that. We do believe that if Hanceville had to run all quarter instead of taking a month of downtime, there'd probably been another $3 per 1,000 that we would have added to our margin. So we are focused on that. I think that fundamentally, it's tied to the operating rates and how much we run these operations. And we are advantaged a little bit by our value-added percentage, but our competitor is also focused on value-added product."

It may have some impact on our competitors, but it's certainly not a threat to us. The other part that we're worried about is the rain we've had in Texas and Alabama. East Texas is 20 inches above normal so far this season. Alabama is 15 inches above normal. The good news is we did put in inventory in our log decks in the fourth quarter to take advantage both of lower pricing and to offset maybe some of the risk of this. So we think we're in pretty good shape there. In North Carolina, we've also had heavy rain fall, but we think we're in pretty good shape in North Carolina. But the fire season in Western Canada is of concern. And so we're going to be very cognizant of that. Fortunately, we've built a pretty good log deck at Peace Valley and Dawson Creek."

We did have a recent consolidation, and that has created some turmoil in the market as producers are pursuing new business or customers are looking for new business partners. And so there's -- I would characterize Q1 as a bit of turmoil, and it's probably going to extend into Q2.

But as I think everybody in the phone realizes, it's hard to get a new product in the market and have a big revenue impact in the first year or 2. But we're certainly setting a foundation for continuing to grow. I'll give you a few examples. We went into the furniture market in 2009, right, when we're in the midst of the downturn. It took us a while, but now most of the furniture manufacturers have converted to OSB from plywood. That's benefited not just us, but it's benefited the entire industry. With our fire retardant product, we actually introduced that about 5 years ago, and now we are adding a second production facility so we can satisfy market demand. Hopefully right after that, we'll provide a third manufacturing facility so we can do that. So it's a little slow taking off, but I'm pleased with the progress.

So we look at a relative change between quarters both the last quarter and then the same quarter of the prior year. And from a relative change basis, we were pretty consistent both on a volume standpoint and a pricing standpoint with our competitors and the industry. What hurt us in the first quarter is we did have -- one of our press lines for LVL did go down on the East Coast, and we had about a month of outage. And what we did is we replaced that volume to satisfy our customers' needs with a production that we get out of Murphy Plywood. When we sell that, we're basically recovering our sales costs, but not any manufacturing margin. So our volumes were good, but we had to replace it with manufacturer product outside. The other thing, when you look at our margins versus our competitor, just to remember, is that the Abitibi -- or the Resolute joint venture in Quebec, we only get half of that margin because we share with our partner.

I will begin the discussion with a review of the financial results for the first quarter of 2016, and this will be followed by some comments on the performance of the individual segments and selected balance sheet items. After I finish my comments, Curt will discuss the general market environment in which LP has been operating and provide his perspective on our operating results and give some thoughts on the outlook. 
As we have done in the past, we've opened up this call to the public and are doing a webcast. And the webcast can be accessed at www.lpcorp.com. 
Additionally, to help with the discussions, we have provided a presentation with supplemental information that should be reviewed in conjunction with the earnings release. I will be referencing these slides in my comments this morning. We have filed an 8-K this morning with some supplemental information as well as our Form 10-Q. 
I want to remind all the participants about the forward-looking statements comment on Slide 2 of the presentation. Please also be aware of the discussion of our use of non-GAAP financial information included on Slide 3 of the presentation. 
The appendix attached to the presentation has some of the necessary reconciliations have been supplemented by the Form 8-K filing we made this morning. Rather than reading these 2 statements, I incorporate them with this reference. 
The first quarter was a good start to 2016 for LP and has set us up for continued improvement for the remainder of the year. U.S. housing start data does remain choppy, but the market appears to be on a trajectory for a 10% to 15% improvement over 2015. Overall, in the past couple of quarters, we have had a number of questions in meetings and on this call about the market demand for our SmartSide siding. The Siding segment's results this quarter demonstrate that we are back on track, given the 22% improvement in SmartSide volume from the fourth quarter of 2015. And with that, let me go into the details. 
Moving to Slide 4 of the presentation for a discussion of the first quarter 2016 consolidated results. We are reporting net sales of $505 million for the first quarter of 2016, a 7% increase from the net sales of $472 million reported in the first quarter of 2015. In the first quarter, we recorded net income of $10 million or $0.07 per diluted share compared to a loss of $35 million or a loss of $0.24 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2015. 
The adjusted income from continuing operations for the quarter were $10 million or $0.07 per diluted share based upon a normalized tax rate of 35% as compared to a loss of $19 million or a loss per share of $0.13 reported in the first quarter of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $52 million in the quarter compared to $6 million in the first quarter of 2015. 
Moving on to Slide 5 of the presentation and a review of our segment results. Starting with OSB. OSB reported net sales for the first quarter of 2016 of $217 million, up 14% from $190 million in the first quarter of 2015. OSB reported operating income of $15 million compared to a loss of $29 million in the first quarter of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $30 million compared to negative adjusted EBITDA of $13 million in the first quarter of 2015. Sales volumes were flat. Pricing for OSB was higher by 14%, which improved operating results by $27 million. The first quarter 2016 OSB operating results were positively impacted by reductions in raw material cost, higher utilization rates as well as the positive impact of the Canadian currency. 
Slide 6 reports the results of the Siding business. This segment includes our SmartSide and CanExel siding products as well as a minor amount of OSB. Siding reported net sales for the first quarter of 2016 of $181 million, up 4% from $174 million in the first quarter of 2015. Siding reported operating income of $27 million compared to operating income of $33 million in the first quarter of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $34 million compared to $38 million in the first quarter of 2015. SmartSide volume was up 1% from the prior year and 22% sequentially. Sales prices on SmartSide were down 2% due to changes in product mix, with individual pricing remaining relatively flat. For CanExel, sales volume increased 15%, primarily due to increased demand in Europe. Sales prices for CanExel were lower by 11% in U.S. dollars. CanExel Canadian dollar sales prices were up 2%. 
As a reminder, the Swan conversion from an OSB mill to the siding -- as a reminder, with the Swan conversion from the OSB mill to a siding mill, the Siding segment started producing and selling OSB again out of our Hayward, Wisconsin mill. During the first quarter of 2016, the Siding segment produced about 53 million square feet of OSB as compared to no OSB production in the first quarter of 2015. The negative impact of the Swan conversion on the Siding segment's financial results for the quarter was less than $1 million, and we are not anticipating any negative impact of the Swan conversion in the second quarter on earnings. 
The reduction in operating results for the Siding segment is -- for the first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015 was primarily due to higher cost of sales related to the fourth quarter higher cost of production due to downtime. The higher cost of production in the fourth quarter was capitalized into the inventory, which was then sold in the first quarter. The cost of production in the first quarter was lower than the cost of production in the fourth quarter of 2015. An increase in OSB production and increased sales and marketing cost to support future growth also contributed to the lower operating results in the quarter. These higher costs were partially offset by lower raw material costs. 
Please turn to Slide 7 of the presentation, which shows the results from our Engineered Wood Products segment. This segment includes I-Joist; Laminated Strand Lumber; Laminated Veneer Lumber; OSB produced at our Houlton, Maine facility; plus other related products. This segment also includes the sale of I-Joist and LVL products produced by the Abitibi joint venture under a sales arrangement with Murphy Plywood. 
The Engineered Wood Products segment reported sales of $72 million in the first quarter of 2016, up from $65 million in the first quarter of 2015. The segment's results were a loss of $2.5 million in the first quarter of 2016 as compared to a loss of $4 million in the first quarter of 2015. In the first quarter of 2016, adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations improved by $1 million as compared to the first quarter of 2015. Volumes of I-Joist were up 19%, while volumes of LVL/LSL were up 18% compared to the same quarter last year. Pricing was up 3% in LVL and up 2% in I-Joist. 
Moving on to Slide 8 of the presentation. For the quarter, our South American segment recorded sales of $31 million as compared to $36 million in the first quarter of 2015. Operating income was $5 million as compared to $2 million in the first quarter of 2015, and adjusted EBITDA was higher by $2 million for the first quarter of 2016 as compared to the first quarter of 2015. Volumes were down 12% in Chile in 3% in Brazil compared to the same quarter last year. The sales volume decrease in Chile was due to increased exports impacting local demand and in Brazil due to decreased local sales as Brazil continues to face an economic recession in their local market. 
On a U.S. dollar basis, pricing was up 1% in Chile and down 11% in Brazil. In local currency, Chile's pricing was up 14% compared to the same quarter in 2015, and Brazil's pricing was 25% higher in local currency. 
Total selling, general and administrative expense was $42 million in the first quarter of 2016 compared to $39 million in the same quarter of 2015. For the quarter, the increase in selling, general and administrative expense was primarily due to increases in certain management incentives in 2016 and higher costs associated with corporate sales and marketing to support our revenue growth. Interest expense net was flat between the periods. 
Please turn to Slide 9 of the presentation. As of March 31, 2016, we had cash, cash equivalents, investments and restricted cash of $424 million; working capital of $650 million; net cash of $58 million. And in addition to the $424 million of cash on our balance sheet, we had $2 million of availability on our credit facility. Capital expenditures through March 31, 2016, were $26 million. We are projecting capital expenditures for 2016 at $120 million to $130 million. Approximately $100 million has been allocated to North American project, 50% for growth and the remaining for capital maintenance and cost reduction. The remaining $20 million to $30 million has been allocated to our South American segment, primarily for the building of a third mill in Chile. 
Now with that, I'll turn the call over to Curt for his comments"

As I usually do, I'll start with our safety performance. The American Panel Association just announced the results of their safety and health awards program for 2015, and I'm pleased that for the second year in a row, LP was recognized the safest large company, that's a company with more than 4 mills. This is the sixth time that we have been so recognized in the last 8 years. Our I-Joist JV, which has 2 mills with Resolute in Quebec, was named the safest small company with 3 or fewer mills. There's been 11 facilities included in the Incident Free Honor Society. The American Forest and Paper Association also released their safety data for 2015 for their universe of companies, and LP was identified as having the best total incident rate. I continue to be extremely proud of all of our employees who recognize the value of being safe and commit to it and act accordingly. 
In addition to the obvious savings in workers' compensation cost, LP employees have made their commitment to safety the cornerstone of our company's culture, which we believe gives us a competitive edge in the hiring and retention of our people. 
Finally, the safety culture extends to the many contractors that we use in implementing our capital projects. We have gone over 2 years without a single contractor injury associated with these nonroutine tasks. 
We did have our board meeting and our Annual Meeting of Shareholders last Friday. I'm pleased to report that all the nominees for director were handily elected. The auditors were ratified, and our annual say-on-pay advisory vote passed with over a 98% approval rate. 
Also, our board did name a new officer. Greg Harrison, a long-time LP Manager, has been named Vice President Siding Manufacturing as a recognition of his importance to the success of this business. Greg was instrumental in the successful conversion and startup of the Swan Valley mill. 
Today, I'll be providing comments on our results and accomplishments, discuss key demand drivers and give you my views on the outlook for the rest of this year. For the second consecutive quarter, all business segments reported a positive adjusted EBITDA that totaled $52 million for the company. EBITDA improved by $46 million over Q1 of 2015 and by $18 million compared to last quarter. In OSB, Random Lengths reported North Central 7/16's Q1 pricing down $17 versus the last quarter, but we're actually reporting flat due to an increase in our value-added mix and improved freight utilization. As a result of these significant factors, improved operational productivity and cost control, our EBITDA improved to $30 million versus $25 million in Q4. 
During the quarter, we also successfully completed the press rebuild of our Hanceville, Alabama mill. 
In Siding, our SmartSide revenue grew 28% versus Q4, driven by a 22% volume increase. The SmartSide volume matched the highest volume ever that we've achieved in Q1 of last year. The Swan Valley siding mill conversion is ahead of the pro forma production schedule, and we expect this mill to make a positive contribution next quarter. We're very pleased with the rebound on our Siding sales, as we put a major focus on returning to growth as we put capacity back in front of this business. 
As I said last quarter, we have unleashed our sales and marketing team along with our distribution partners, and we are seeing the results. In EWP, we are EBITDA-positive for the quarter and performed better than Q1 of last year. However, we did see a drop in EBITDA performance compared to Q4 last year due to an equipment failure in our one of mills that produced quarter-over-quarter sales and a change in the mix. 
As Sallie said in South America, we had a very good first quarter, with adjusted EBITDA at $7 million. Prices improved in Chile and Brazil in local currency versus last quarter. Strong export volumes in China and other South American countries offset weak domestic demand in Brazil. We continue with the engineering design work for our third mill in Chile in anticipation of board approval of this project over the summer. 
The housing market, as Sallie mentioned, the Q1 news was a little bit mixed. Overall, Q1 housing starts ran at an annual rate of 1.13 million, actually flat to Q4 of last year. The consensus for 2016 starts is now at 1.23 million, a 10% improvement over 2015, which I believe is possible. The consensus forecast for 2017 is 1.37 million, another 12% increase. The good news for us is that in Q1, single-family starts averaged a seasonally adjusted rate of 792,000. This is the highest quarterly rate since Q4 of 2007, and this represents an increase of 23% over the same quarter last year. We believe the good weather in February and March aided starts. 
Also notable are the improvements in new home demand for entry-level buyers. We estimate that the OSB consumption ratio between single and multifamily is about 3:1. The improvement in single-family starts was offset by a decline in multifamily starts. Compared to Q4 of last year, multifamily starts declined 10%, falling from 379,000 to 341,000, which happened to be flat with last year. Household formation growth continues to drive rising rents and low vacancy rates across the country. Other positive housing data: existing home inventory was down 1.1% year-over-year through January, so home inventory is very tight on a historical basis. 
On the financing side, average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rates were 3.58% for the week ended April 15, which was down from 3.92% 3 months earlier. 
In Canada, for the first quarter, starts were at seasonally adjusted rate of 200,000, a growth of 2% from Q4. Almost all of this increase was in single-family detached units, which makes up about 35% of Canadian starts. So while there is forecasted growth in housing for the next several years, it is incumbent on us to focus on continuing to increase our growth outside of our traditional market by developing products, product applications and market segments that can address needs in industrial repair model, where year-over-year growth has exceeded 10% and light commercial activities. The year-over-year nonresidential construction was up 11.2% through February. 
So while the consensus for 2016 housing starts has moved down slightly since January, I am encouraged by the increase in single-family starts and the supporting data for sales of building materials by dealers are up double digits in the first part of the year. So I remain optimistic about the rest of 2016. 
As I've said before, I continue to be concerned about labor and land availability for builders, uncertainty relative to lending standards for buyers and the impact for the presidential race on our nation and more specifically, potentially on consumer confidence; that continued strong employment growth will bolster household, formation; and fundamentally, housing demand should strengthen throughout this year, providing a positive market environment for our products. 
In our Siding business, strong order rates continued through April, and OSB Random Lengths has reported North Central pricing flat or increasing each week since the end of the quarter. So compared to this time last year, pricing is higher by 37%. Strong single-family starts is driving demand for both these businesses as well as Engineered Wood. 
South America, expect good OSB and siding demand in Chile throughout the year. For Brazil, we will continue to focus on export opportunities as these are generally priced in U.S. dollars, and we can benefit from the weak Brazilian real. 
With that, let me turn it over to Sallie for questions"

And as a reminder, what we did have in the quarter is we did take a month of downtime at our Hanceville, Alabama mill to do the press rebuild. As far as the margin, we do focus on the margin compared to our public peers, and we actually made some progress in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter. Fundamentally in the past, we have taken more of the industry downtime, so our operating rates have been a little bit lower. I think our public competitors talk about operating rates in -- about 92%, so we're about 6 points below that. We do believe that if Hanceville had to run all quarter instead of taking a month of downtime, there'd probably been another $3 per 1,000 that we would have added to our margin. So we are focused on that. I think that fundamentally, it's tied to the operating rates and how much we run these operations. And we are advantaged a little bit by our value-added percentage, but our competitor is also focused on value-added product."

East Texas is 20 inches above normal so far this season. Alabama is 15 inches above normal. The good news is we did put in inventory in our log decks in the fourth quarter to take advantage both of lower pricing and to offset maybe some of the risk of this. So we think we're in pretty good shape there. In North Carolina, we've also had heavy rain fall, but we think we're in pretty good shape in North Carolina. But the fire season in Western Canada is of concern. And so we're going to be very cognizant of that. Fortunately, we've built a pretty good log deck at Peace Valley and Dawson Creek."

And so there's -- I would characterize Q1 as a bit of turmoil, and it's probably going to extend into Q2.

But as I think everybody in the phone realizes, it's hard to get a new product in the market and have a big revenue impact in the first year or 2. But we're certainly setting a foundation for continuing to grow. I'll give you a few examples. We went into the furniture market in 2009, right, when we're in the midst of the downturn. It took us a while, but now most of the furniture manufacturers have converted to OSB from plywood. That's benefited not just us, but it's benefited the entire industry. With our fire retardant product, we actually introduced that about 5 years ago, and now we are adding a second production facility so we can satisfy market demand. Hopefully right after that, we'll provide a third manufacturing facility so we can do that. So it's a little slow taking off, but I'm pleased with the progress. If I look at the funnel projects we've got, it's very robust. We're limiting where put our resources to those highest priorities, but I feel pretty good about it.

And it's a little tough because some of our competitors include plywood in that and MDF and particleboard. Some include their distribution operation, so you can't really see what the pricing is. So we look at a relative change between quarters both the last quarter and then the same quarter of the prior year. And from a relative change basis, we were pretty consistent both on a volume standpoint and a pricing standpoint with our competitors and the industry. What hurt us in the first quarter is we did have -- one of our press lines for LVL did go down on the East Coast, and we had about a month of outage. And what we did is we replaced that volume to satisfy our customers' needs with a production that we get out of Murphy Plywood. When we sell that, we're basically recovering our sales costs, but not any manufacturing margin. So our volumes were good, but we had to replace it with manufacturer product outside. The other thing, when you look at our margins versus our competitor, just to remember, is that the Abitibi -- or the Resolute joint venture in Quebec, we only get half of that margin because we share with our partner. We also only have half of the investment in that. So I believe our numbers were about $2 million lower than they should have been due to that -- due to the fact of having to satisfy our customers out of the Murphy volume."

And with me today are Curt Stevens, LP's Chief Executive Officer; as well as Mike Kinney and Becky Barckley, our primary Investor Relations contact.
I will begin the discussion with a review of the financial results for the second quarter of 2016 and the first half of 2016. This will be followed by some comments on the performance of the individual segments and selective balance sheet items.
After I finsih my comment, Kurt will discuss the general -- provide his perspective on our operating results our capital projects and give some thoughts on our outlook.
As we've done in the past, we've opened up this call to the public and are doing a webcast. The webcast can be accessed at www.lpcorp.com. Additionally, to help with the discussion, we've provided a presentation with supplemental information that should be reviewed in conjunction with the earnings release. 
I will be referencing these slides in my comments this morning. We filed an 8-K this morning with some supplemental information as well as our Form 10-Q.  I do want to remind all the participants that the forward-looking statements comment on Slide 2 of the presentation. Please also be aware of the discussion of our use of non-GAAP financial information included on Slide 3 of the presentation. The appendix attached to the presentation has some of the necessary reconciliations that's been supplemented by the Form 8-K filing we made this morning. And rather than reading these 2 statements, I incorporate them with this reference.
Our second quarter results continued the momentum which started in the first quarter. In addition to the strong results in our OSB segment reporting the $63 million improvement in adjusted EBITDA and just over $40 million of increased sales, the signing business reported record volume and sale, including a 14% increase in volume from the first quarter of 2016 and 22% improved volumes from the same quarter last year.
Now with that, let me go into the detail.
Moving to Slide 4 of the presentation for discussion of the second quarter and the for six months of 2016 consolidated result. We are reporting net sales of $582 million for the second quarter of 2016, an increase of -- an 18% increase from net sales of $493 million reported in the second quarter of 2015. The second quarter reported net income of $32 million or $0.22 per diluted share compared to a net loss of $20 million or a $0.14 loss per diluted share in the second quarter of 2015.
The adjusted income from continuing operations for the quarter was $40 million or $0.28 per diluted share based upon a normalized tax rate of 35% as compared to a loss of $12 million or a loss of $0.08 per share reported in the second quarter of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $99 million in the quarter compared to $16 million in the second quarter of 2015. In the first six months of 2016, we recorded net income of $42 million or $0.29 per diluted share compared to a net loss for the first six months of 2015 of $54 million or a loss of $0.38 per diluted share. The adjusted income for the six-month period was $50 million or $0.34 per diluted share based upon a normalized tax rate of 35% compared to loss of $31 million or $0.22 loss per diluted share for the first six months of 2015.
Adjusted EBITDAR for continuing operations was $151 million for the first six months compared to $22 million in the first six months of 2015.
And moving on to Slide 5 and a review of our segment results. with OSB. OSB reported net sales for the second quarter of 2016 of $253 million, up 20% from $211 million in the second quarter of 2015. OSB reported operating income of $44 million compared to a loss of $18 million in the second quarter of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $59 million compared to negative adjusted EBITDA of $4 million in the second quarter of 2015. Sales volumes in OSB were down 7% from the second quarter of 2015, primarily due to the conversion of the Swan mill to a Siding milll, and as such those financial results are not included as part of the Siding segment. Pricing for OSB was higher by 30%, which improved operating results by $59 million. For the first 6 months of 2016, OSB reported an operating profit of $59 million on sales of $470 million compared to loss of $47 million and $401 million of sales in the first 6 months of 2015.  
For six months of 2016, we reported adjusted EBITDA of $89 million compared to negative adjusted EBITDA of $17 million in the first 6 months of 2015. Sales volume are lower by 4% and sales prices were higher by 22%. The impact of higher sales price on OSB operations was $86 million for the first 6 months of 2016 compared to the first six months of 2015.
For the quarter and the 6 months of 2016, reductions in raw material cost, higher utilization rates as well as a positive impact of the Canadian currency on our Canadian operation improved the OSB segment's financial result as compared to similar period in 2015.  
Moving on to Slide 6 for the results of the Siding business. This segment includes our SmartSide and CanExel products as well as OSB produced on one line of our Harvard facility. Siding reported net sales for the second quarter of 2016 of $207 million, up 26% from $164 million in the second quarter of 2015. Siding reported operating income of $42 million compared to operating income of $29 million in the second quarter of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $49 million compared to 39 -- $35 million for the same period last year. Sales volumes -- SmartSide volume was up 22% from the prior year and 14% sequentially. Sales prices per SmartSide were down 2% due to changes in product mix with individual prices remaining relatively flat. For CanExel, sales volumes increased 24% due to increased demand, primarily in Europe. Sales prices were lower by 3% due to the impact of the Canadian dollar. Based upon Canadian dollar seeling, prices for CanExel were 2% higher than the same period in 2015.  
We produced approximately 53 million square feet of OSB in the segment during the second quarter of 2016 as compared to no OSB production in the second quarter of 2015.  
The Siding segment reported sales of $389 million for the first 6 months of 2016, an increase of 15% from $337 million recorded in the first six months of 2015. The Siding segment reported operating income of $69 million for the first six months as compared to $62 million in the first six months of 2015 and adjusted EBITDA of $84 million as compared to $73 million of adjusted EBITDA in the same period of 2015.
SmartSide sales volumes were up 11% and sales prices were down 2% for the first six months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015.  
Please turn to Slide 7 of the presentation which shows the result for our Engineered Wood Products segment. The segment includes I-Joist Laminated Strand Lumber, Laminated Veneer Lumber, OSB produced at our facility and such other related products. This segment also includes the sale of I-Joist and LVL products produced by the Abitibi joint venture -- or under a sales arrangement with Murphy Plywood.
The Engineered Wood Products segment recorded sales of $78 million in the second quarter of 2016, up $6 million from the second quarter of 2015. The EWP segment earned operating income of $0.5 million in the second quarter of 2016 compared to a loss of $2 million in the second quarter of 2015. The second quarter 2016 adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations improved to $4 million as compared to $1 million from the second quarter of 2015. Volumes for I-Joist were up 13%, while volumes of LDL and LSL were up 3% compared to the same quarter last year. Pricing was up 6% in LDL and LSL and up 5% in I-Joist.  
For the first six months, sales were $115 million, up from $137 million in the first six months of 2015. The segment's operating loss in the first half of 2016 was $2 million as compared to a loss of $6 million for the first half of 2015. And adjusted EBITDA improved to $5 million from breakeven the first six months of 2015.
Moving on to Slide 8 of the presentation. For the quarter, our South American segment recorded sales of $41 million as compared to $39 million in the second quarter of 2015. Operating income was $7 million as compared to $2 million in the second quarter of 2015 and adjusted EBITDA improved by $5 million from the second quarter of 2015 to $9 million in the second quarter of 2016. Volumes in Chile were up 15% -- volumes in Chile were up 14% and flat in Brazil compared to the same quarter last year. On the USD basis, pricing was flat in Chile and up 4% in Brazil. In local currency, Chile's pricing was up 10% for the same quarter in 2015 and Brazil's pricing increased 20%.
For the first six months our South American segment reported sales of $72 million as compared to $75 million in the first six months of 2015. Operating income was $12 million compared to $4 million in the first six months of 2015 and adjusted EBITDA increased to $16 million from $9 million in the same period of 2015.  
Total selling, general and administrative expenses were $47 million in the second quarter of 2016 compared to $38 million in the same quarter of 2015. For the six months period, our selling general and administrative expenses were $89 million for 2016 compared to $77 million for the first 6 months of 2015. For both the quarter as well as six months period, the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increases in certain management incentive accruals and higher sales and marketing-related expenses.  
Please refer to Slide 9 of the presentation. As of June 30, 2016, we had cash, cash equivalents, investment and restrictive cash for $495 million. Working capital was $700 million. Net cash of a $135 million. And then in addition to the $495 million of cash on our balance sheet, we had $200 million of availability on our credit facility. Capital expenditures from the first 6 months of 2016 were $51 million. We generated operating cash flow of a $104 million for the first 6 months of 2016 and generated net cash flow of $40 million for the first 6 months of 2016.
We are continuing to project capital expenditures for 2016 of $120 million to $130 million, which approximately is $60 million is for both projects and the other $60 million -- $70 million is associated with maintenance projects. Now I'll turn the call over to Curt for his comments."

Good morning, and thanks for joining us on today's call. As usual, I'll start with our safety performance. Through the first half of the year, our total incident rate or TIR was 0.31 and the rolling 12-month TIR was at 0.36. I continue to be extremely proud of all of our employees who recognize the value of being safe, have committed to it and act accordingly.
Today, I'll be providing comments on our results and accomplishments during the last quarter and first half of the year, discuss key demand drivers, provide an update on our capital planning including a potential Siding expansion and give you my views on the outlook for the rest of this year and into next year.  
Sales in Q2 is selling, as Sally just reviewed, were 18% better than Q2 of last year and produced net income of $32 million and EPS of $0.22. This was significantly better than Q2 of last year due to greater demand leading to higher OSB prices, better Siding volumes and lower manufacturing cost across all of our businesses.
For the third consecutive quarter, all business segments recorded positive adjusted EBITDA. It totaled nearly a $100 million for the company in Q2. EBITDA improved by $83 million over Q2 of 2015 and by $52 million compared to last quarter.
In OSB, Random Lengths reported North Central Q2 pricing was 17% higher than the first quarter, LP averaged at 10% increase due to regional differences and lower premiums on flooring. However, when coupled with lower costs, our EBIT margin improved from 13.8% last quarter to 17.4% this quarter.
And Siding, our SmartSide revenues grew 26% versus same quarter last year and adjusted EBITDA was just short of $50 million, a 42% improvement. In EWP, we were EBIT positive for the quarter and EBITDA was almost $4 million compared to $600,000 in Q2 of last year. 
South America overall sales were a bit higher but EBITDA more than double. On year-to-date results, our sales were up 13%, net income was $42 million compared to loss of $54 million last year and adjusted EBITDA was $151 million, an improvement of $129 million. In Sally's review, she did discuss the expected capital expenditures for 2016. I want to give you a little bit more color on this.
One of the projects currently underway, will be to more than double the production capacity of our return OSB product FlameBlock. Today, we have used a contract manufacturer for the coding. We have licensed this technology from this very important vendor and are nearing the completion of a $15 million post-processing facility located at Clark County, Alabama site. This should be operational near the end of this quarter and will provide us with lower cost production, improved logistics and greater geographical diversity for this important growth product.  
At our board meeting last week, we did present 3 capital projects to our board which were approved. The first was a maintenance project to rebuild the press at our Texas bill. This $15 million to $17 million project will take place in the first half of next year. We have done similar projects at Roxborough, and we currently have a similar project in one of our lines at that will begin later this quarter.
You have heard me talk about a third mill in Chile for several years. After an arduous and link the environmental permitting process followed by detailed engineering, our board did agree to go ahead with this $60 million to $65 million project, which should come online late next year or early 2018.  
Like our 2 prior mills in Chile, we will be owned equipment from a few of our shuted OSB mills. This expansion will take place on our existing mill site in Southern Chile.  
The third capital discussion was more a work in process as we continue to plan for the next increment of Siding capacity. Based on our current projections, we will need additional capacity around the end of 2018.  
If we are converting an existing mill, we will need about 9  to 12 months for the conversion. If we're building a new mill, this time frame extends to more than 2 years. There are a lot of factors that need to be considered while making this decision.
The expected growth rate and product mix of our Siding business, availability, cost and species of the wood, competitive logistics, a trained and available workforce, available incentives, the overall business climate and forecasted currency rates.
When considering existing mills, the options with LP are limited due to our existing products and customers that we need to satisfy, the locations of those mills, the woods supplied to that mill and the actual mill configuration. Logically, we're also considering OSB mill owned by others in this exploration is ongoing.  
With the new mill option, we have done quite a bit of work on the potential Siding and concluded that the in Northern Minnesota makes the most sense.
We have been working with the State of Minnesota and economic development group for that region, the Iron Range resources and rehabilitation board or IRRRB on possible site selection and incentives. They have been great partners to us in this effort. To date, the legislature and the IRRRB have combined to offer significant incentives that are greatly appreciated and help to make this alternative much more competitive.  
At our board meeting, we discussed the status and requested funds for long lead time items and continuing engineering, While we complete the evaluation of all of our known alternatives. We've got currently have an estimated capital cost as this will be dependent on a number of factors that have not yet been decided. However, it is most likely that little will be spent in 2016 with spending the meeting next year and accelerating as we go into 2018.
With the improvements in our earnings and  a continued positive outlook for housing, we're increasingly getting questions on the balance sheet, liquidity and our plans for the cash. I want to provide you with my thoughts.  
As Sally mentioned in her review of Q2 results, we ended the second quarter with $495 million in cash, cash equivalents, investments and cash. In South America, we did use some of our cash within Chile to prepay about $7 million on existing debt.
Tied in with the third mill in Chile, we have been working with our local banks to put in place financing within Chile to fund the construction. You'll probably see this early next year.
So what are we going to do with the cash? Our first priority is to invest in our current facilities to lower cost, allow for the manufacture value added products and increase our flexibility to ship the product mix to what is being requested by our customers. The examples include the FlameBlock line under construction in Alabama that I just mentioned. We are installing a small I-Joist line in Chile to give us additional flexibility with in South America and we continuing to investments in our Siding mills to increase our flexibility.
The next priority is to invest in new facilities to meet anticipated demand. Earlier I the addition of a third mill in Chile and the exploration of where new Siding capacity will be installed.
These projects all have returns in excess of our 16% hurdle rate. We do continue to explore acquisitions that will add to or complement our existing businesses. Finally, our board continues to discuss returning cash to shareholders by a dividend or share repurchase. As we continue our string of profitable quarters, adding a dividend will certainly be considered. We do have -- while, we have not yet purchased any shares under this authority.
Let me shift to talk about the housing market. The Q2 news in the housing market was good but it did reaffirm there will likely be in the 8% to 10% annual growth rate for starts over the next few years. While not as strong as been forecast, this actually bodes well for both homebuilders and suppliers to the building industry. Housing starts in the first half of this year were up 7% compared to the same period last year. However, the good news for LP is that single-family starts actually increased 13% during this same periods, more of our products are consumed in a single-family start than a multifamily start as mentioned last quarter.
The consensus for 2016 now stands at $1.206 million, 9% higher than last year and 1.34 for 2017 and 11% increase over this year's forecast. In June, I did attend the Policy Advisory Board meeting of the Harvard Joint Center for housing studies, where we previewed the recently released State of the Nation's Housing 2016. While this report looks broadly at housing, homeownership rates, financing, affordability, rental markets and housing challenges, the key underpinning to their forecast is demographics and household formations.
This group believes that demographics alone will drive the addition of more than $13 million households in the next decade.
Their conclusion, I quote, factoring in the need to replace older units and meet demand for vacation homes and other uses, housing construction should average 1.6 million units a year over the next decade. I like the way they are thinking.
Other positive housing-related data home sales rose 3.5% in June, the fastest rate since February of 2008. Sales of existing single family homes rounded to annual rate of $4.5 million in May, up 4.7% compared to May of 2015.
On the financing side, the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was at 3.42 for the week ended July 15. Retail sales for building materials equipment supply dealers was 7.7% higher in the first half of 2016 versus 2015.
In Canada, second quarter housing stars were seasonally adjusted rate of 198,000, unchained from the first quarter, but up about 3% from Q2 of last year. 
So as I look to the rest of the year and into 2017, to achieve the forecasted 9% growth in housing starts with the first half being at 7%, we will need to see an acceleration in activity in the second half of the year. Based on our conversation with builders and the demand we're seeing for our products, I'm optimistic that this will happen.
I believe concerns about labor and land availability for both builders, uncertainly relative lending standards for buyers and the impact of the upcoming election in our nation, and more specifically, on consumer confidence, have been built into this reduced housing forecast.
The news is better on any of these fronts, we could see an upside in activity.
For 2017, I agree that we will a 10-plus growth in housing starts driven by increase household formations and some wage growth. Specific to LP, we have seen further increases in OSB pricing with Random Lengths reporting current levels at 16% higher than the average North Central price in Q2.
On our Siding business, we are on track to achieve volume growth of 12% of 14% on a year-to-year basis with strong activity in all of our market segments.
As I mentioned last quarter, stronger single-family starts is driving about for EWP. Additionally, the trade actions that could occur in October related to the expired lumber agreement could also be beneficial for EWP later this year and the end of 2017.
South America expect good OSB and Siding demand in Chile throughout the year. In Brazil, we will continue to focus an export opportunities as these are generally priced in USD and we can benefit from the weak Brazilian currency.
With that, let me turn over to Sally for question-and-answer."

And with me today are Curt Stevens, LP's Chief Executive Officer; as well as Mike Kinney and Becky Barckley, our primary Investor Relations contacts.
I'll begin the discussion with a review of the financial results for the second quarter of 2016 and the first half of 2016. This will be followed by some comments on the performance of the individual segments and selected balance sheet items.
After I finish my comments, Curt will discuss the general -- provide his perspective on our operating results, our capital projects and give some thoughts on our outlook.
As we've done in the past, we've opened up this call to the public and are doing a webcast. The webcast can be accessed at www.lpcorp.com. Additionally, to help with the discussion, we have provided a presentation with supplemental information that should be reviewed in conjunction with the earnings release. 
I will be referencing these slides in my comments this morning. We filed an 8-K this morning with some supplemental information as well as our Form 10-Q. I do want to remind all participants that the forward-looking statements comment on Slide 2 of the presentation. Please also be aware of the discussion of our use of non-GAAP financial information included on Slide 3 of the presentation. The appendix attached to the presentation has some of the necessary reconciliations that's been supplemented by the Form 8-K filing we made this morning. Rather than read these 2 statements, I incorporate them with this reference.
Our second quarter results continued the momentum which started in the first quarter. In addition to the strong results in our OSB segment reporting the $63 million improvement in adjusted EBITDA and just over $40 million of increased sales, the signing business reported record SmartSide volume and sales, including a 14% increase in volume from the first quarter of 2016 and 22% improved volumes from the same quarter last year.
Now with that, let me go into the details.
Moving to Slide 4 of the presentation for a discussion of the second quarter and the first 6 months of 2016 consolidated results. We are reporting net sales of $582 million for the second quarter of 2016, an increase of -- an 18% increase from net sales of $493 million reported in the second quarter of 2015. In the second quarter, reported net income of $32 million or $0.22 per diluted share compared to a net loss of $20 million or a $0.14 loss per diluted share in the second quarter of 2015.
The adjusted income from continuing operations for the quarter was $40 million or $0.28 per diluted share based upon a normalized tax rate of 35% as compared to a loss of $12 million or a loss of $0.08 per share reported in the second quarter of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $99 million in the quarter compared to $16 million in the second quarter of 2015. In the first six months of 2016, we recorded net income of $42 million or $0.29 per diluted share compared to a net loss for the first 6 months of 2015 of $54 million or a loss of $0.38 per diluted share. The adjusted income for the 6-month period was $50 million or $0.34 per diluted share based upon a normalized tax rate of 35% compared to a loss of $31 million or a $0.22 loss per diluted share for the first 6 months of 2015.
Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $151 million for the first 6 months compared to $22 million in the first 6 months of 2015.
Now moving on to Slide 5 and a review of our segment results beginning with OSB. OSB reported net sales for the second quarter of 2016 of $253 million, up 20% from $211 million in the second quarter of 2015. OSB reported operating income of $44 million compared to a loss of $18 million in the second quarter of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $59 million compared to negative adjusted EBITDA of $4 million in the second quarter of 2015. Sales volume in OSB were down 7% from the second quarter of 2015, primarily due to the conversion of the Swan mill to a siding mill. And as such, those financial results are now included as part of the siding segment. Pricing for OSB was higher by 30% which improved operating results by $59 million. For the first 6 months of 2016, OSB reported an operating profit of $59 million on sales of $470 million compared to a loss of $47 million and $401 million of sales in the first 6 months of 2015.  
For the first 6 months of 2016, we reported adjusted EBITDA of $89 million compared to negative adjusted EBITDA of $17 million in the first 6 months of 2015. Sales volumes were lower by 4% and sales prices were higher by 22%. The impact of a higher sales price on OSB operations was $86 million for the first 6 months of 2016 compared to the first 6 months of 2015.
Throughout the quarter and first 6 months of 2016, reductions in raw material cost, higher utilization rates as well as a positive impact with the Canadian currency on our Canadian operation improved the OSB segment's financial result as compared to similar periods in 2015.  
Moving on to Slide 6 for the results of the Siding business. This segment includes our SmartSide and CanExel siding products as well as OSB produced on one line of our Hayward, Wisconsin facility. Siding reported net sales for the second quarter of 2016 of $207 million, up 26% from $164 million in the second quarter of 2015. Siding reported operating income of $42 million compared to operating income of $29 million in the second quarter of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $49 million compared to $35 million for the same period last year. Sales volumes -- SmartSide volume was up 22% from the prior year and 14% sequentially. Sales prices for SmartSide were down 2% due to changes in product mix, with individual prices remaining relatively flat. For CanExel, sales volumes increased 24% due to increased demand, primarily in Europe. Sales prices were lower by 3% due to the impact of the Canadian dollar. Based upon Canadian dollar selling prices, prices for CanExel were 2% higher than the same period in 2015.  
We produced approximately 53 million square feet of OSB in the segment during the second quarter of 2016 as compared to no OSB production in the second quarter of 2015.  
The Siding segment reported sales of $389 million for the first 6 months of 2016, an increase of 15% from $337 million reported in the first 6 months of 2015. The Siding segment reported operating income of $69 million for the first 6 months as compared to $62 million in the first 6 months of 2015 and adjusted EBITDA of $84 million as compared to $73 million of adjusted EBITDA in the same period of 2015.
SmartSide sales volumes were up 11% and sales prices were down 2% for the first 6 months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015.  
Please turn to Slide 7 of the presentation which shows the results for our Engineered Wood Products segment. The segment includes I-Joist, Laminated Strand Lumber, Laminated Veneer Lumber, OSB produced at our Houlton, Maine facility plus other related products. This segment also includes the sale of I-Joist and LVL products produced by the Abitibi joint venture or under a sales arrangement with Murphy Plywood.
The Engineered Wood Products segment recorded sales of $78 million in the second quarter of 2016, up $6 million from the second quarter of 2015. The EWP segment earned operating income of $0.5 million in the second quarter of 2016 compared to a loss of $2 million in the second quarter of 2015. For the second quarter 2016, adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations improved to $4 million as compared to $1 million from the second quarter of 2015. Volumes of I-Joist were up 13% while volumes of LVL and LSL were up 3% compared to the same quarter last year. Pricing was up 6% in LVL and LSL and up 5% in I-Joist.  
For the first 6 months, sales were $150 million, up from $137 million in the first 6 months of 2015. The segment's operating loss in the first half of 2016 was $2 million as compared to a loss of $6 million for the first half of 2015. And adjusted EBITDA improved to $5 million from breakeven for the first 6 months of 2015.
Moving on to Slide 8 of the presentation. For the quarter, our South American segment recorded sales of $41 million as compared to $39 million in the second quarter of 2015. Operating income was $7 million as compared to $2 million in the second quarter of 2015 and adjusted EBITDA improved by $5 million from the second quarter of 2015 to $9 million in the second quarter of 2016. Volumes in Chile were up 15% -- volumes in Chile were up 14% and flat in Brazil compared to the same quarter last year. On a USD basis, pricing was flat in Chile and up 4% in Brazil. In local currency, Chile's pricing was up 10% with the same quarter in 2015 and Brazil's pricing increased 20%.
For the first 6 months, our South American segment reported sales of $72 million as compared to $75 million in the first 6 months of 2015. Operating income was $12 million compared to $4 million in the first 6 months of 2015 and adjusted EBITDA increased to $16 million from $9 million in the same period of 2015.  
Total selling, general and administrative expenses were $47 million in the second quarter of 2016 compared to $38 million in the same quarter of 2015. For the 6 months period, our selling general and administrative expenses were $89 million for 2016 compared to $77 million for the first 6 months of 2015. For both the quarter as well as 6 months period, the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increases and certain management incentive accruals and higher sales and marketing-related expenses.  
Please refer to Slide 9 of the presentation. As of June 30, 2016, we had cash, cash equivalents, investments and restrictive cash for $495 million. Working capital was $700 million, net cash of $135 million. And in addition to the $495 million of cash on our balance sheet, we had $200 million of availability on our credit facility. Capital expenditures for the first 6 months of 2016 were $51 million. We generated operating cash flow of $104 million for the first 6 months of 2016 and generated net cash flow of $40 million for the first 6 months of 2016.
We are continuing to project capital expenditures for 2016 of $120 million to $130 million which approximately $60 million is for growth projects and the other $60 million to $70 million is associated with maintenance projects. Now, I'll turn the call over to Curt for his comments."

Good morning, and thanks for joining us on today's call. As usual, I'll start with our safety performance. Through the first half of the year, our total incident rate or TIR was 0.31 and the rolling 12-month TIR was at 0.36. I continue to be extremely proud of all of our employees who recognize the value of being safe, have committed to it and act accordingly.
Today, I'll be providing comments on our results and accomplishments during the last quarter and first half of the year, discuss key demand drivers, provide an update on our capital planning including a potential Siding expansion, and give you my views on the outlook for the rest of this year and into next year.  
Sales in Q2, as Sallie just reviewed, were 18% better than Q2 of last year and produced net income of $32 million and EPS of $0.22. This was significantly better than Q2 of last year due to greater demand leading to higher OSB prices, better Siding volumes and lower manufacturing cost across all of our businesses.
For the third consecutive quarter, all business segments recorded positive adjusted EBITDA that totaled nearly a $100 million for the company in Q2. EBITDA improved by $83 million over Q2 of 2015 and by $52 million compared to last quarter.
In OSB, Random Lengths reported North Central 7/16's Q2 pricing was 17% higher than the first quarter, and LP averaged a 10% increase due to regional differences and lower premiums on flooring. However, when coupled with lower cost, our EBIT margin improved from 13.8% last quarter to 17.4% this quarter.
In Siding, our SmartSide revenues grew 26% versus the same quarter last year and adjusted EBITDA was just short of $50 million, a 42% improvement. In EWP, we were EBIT positive for the quarter and EBITDA was almost $4 million compared to $600,000 in Q2 of last year. 
South America, overall sales were a bit higher but EBITDA more than doubled. On the year-to-date results, our sales were up 13%, net income was $42 million compared to a loss of $54 million last year and adjusted EBITDA was $151 million, an improvement of $129 million. In Sallie's review, she did discuss the expected capital expenditures for 2016. I want to give you a little bit more color on this.
One of the projects currently underway will be to more than double the production capacity of our fire-retardant OSB product, FlameBlock. Today, we have used a contract manufacturer for the coating. We have licensed this technology from this very important vendor and are nearing the completion of a $15 million post-processing facility located at our Clarke County, Alabama site. This should be operational near the end of this quarter and will provide us with lower cost production, improved logistics and greater geographical diversity for this important growth product.  
At our board meeting last week, we did present 3 capital projects to our board which were approved. The first was a maintenance project to rebuild the press at our Jasper, Texas mill. This $15 million to $17 million project will take place in the first half of next year. We have done similar projects at Roxboro, Hanceville and Sagola and we currently have a similar project at one of our lines at Hayward that will begin later this quarter.
You have heard me talk about a third mill in Chile for several years. After an arduous and lengthy environmental permitting process followed by detailed engineering, our board did agree to go ahead with this $60 million to $65 million project which should come online late next year or early 2018.  
Like our 2 prior mills in Chile, we will be re-purposing owned equipment from a few of our shuttered OSB mills. This expansion will take place on our existing Panguipulli mill site in Southern Chile.  
The third capital discussion was more of a work in process, as we continue to plan for the next increment of Siding capacity. Based on our current projections, we will need additional capacity around the end of 2018.  
If we are converting an existing mill, we will need about 9  to 12 months for the conversion. If we're building a new mill, this timeframe extends to more than 2 years. There are a lot of factors that need to be considered when making this decision.
The expected growth rate and product mix of our Siding business, availability, cost and species of the wood, competitive logistics, a trained and available workforce, available incentives, the overall business climate and forecasted currency rates.
When considering existing mills, the options with LP are limited due to our existing products and customers that we need to satisfy, the location of those mills, the wood supply to that mill and the actual mill configuration. Logically, we are also considering OSB mills owned by others and this exploration is ongoing.  
With the new mill option, we have done quite a bit of work on the potential Siding and have preliminarily concluded that the Iron Range in Northern Minnesota makes the most sense.
We have been working with the State of Minnesota and the economic development group for that region, the Iron Range Resources and Rehabilitation Board or IRRRB on possible site selection and incentives. They have been great partners to us in this effort. To date, the legislature and the IRRRB have combined to offer significant incentives that are greatly appreciated and help to make this alternative much more competitive.  
At our board meeting, we discussed this  status and requested funds for long lead time items and continuing engineering, while we are completing the evaluation of all of our known alternatives. We now currently have an estimated capital cost as this will be dependent on a number of factors that have not yet been decided. However, it is most likely that a little will be spent in 2016 with spending beginning next year and accelerating as we go into 2018.
With the improvement in our earnings and a continued positive outlook for housing, we're increasingly getting questions on the balance sheet liquidity and our plans for the cash. I want to provide you with my thoughts.  
As Sallie mentioned in her review of Q2 results, we ended the second quarter with $495 million in cash, cash equivalents, investments and restricted cash. In South America, we did use some of our cash within Chile to prepay about $7 million on existing debt.
Tied in with the third mill in Chile, we have been working with our local banks to put in place financing within Chile to fund the construction. You'll probably see this early next year.
So what are we going to do with the cash? Our first priority is to invest in our current facilities to lower cost, allow for the manufacture of value added products and increase our flexibility to ship the product mix to what is being requested by our customers. The examples include the FlameBlock line under construction in Alabama that I just mentioned. We are installing a small I-Joist line in Chile to give us additional flexibility within South America, and we continuing to investments in our Siding mills to increase our flexibility.
The next priority is to invest in new facilities to meet anticipated demand. Earlier, I discussed the addition of a third mill in Chile and the exploration of where new Siding capacity will be installed.
These projects all have returns in excess of our 16% hurdle rate. We do continue to explore acquisitions that will add to or complement our existing businesses. Finally, our board continues to discuss returning cash to shareholders via dividend or share repurchase. As we continue our string of profitable quarters, adding a dividend will certainly be considered. We do have [indiscernible], so we have not yet purchased any shares under this authority.
Let me shift to talk about the housing market. The Q2 news in the housing market was good but it did reaffirm it will likely be in the 8% to 10% annual growth rate for starts over the next few years. While not as strong as been forecast, this actually bodes well for both homebuilders and suppliers to the building industry. Housing starts in the first half of this year were up 7% compared to the same period last year. However, the good news for LP is that single-family starts actually increased 13% during these same periods. More of our products are consumed in a single-family start than a multifamily start as mentioned last quarter.
The consensus for 2016 now stands at $1.206 million, 9% higher than last year and $1.34 for 2017, an 11% increase over this year's forecast. In June, I did attend the Policy Advisory Board meeting of the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies where we previewed the recently released State of the Nation's Housing 2016. While this report looks broadly at housing, homeownership rates, financing, affordability, rental markets and housing challenges, the key underpinning to their forecast is demographics and household formations.
This group believes that demographics alone will drive the addition of more than 13 million households in the next decade.
Their conclusion, I quote, factoring in the need to replace older units and meet demand for vacation homes and other uses, housing construction should average 1.6 million units a year over the next decade. I like the way they're thinking.
Other positive housing-related data. New home sales rose 3.5% in June, the fastest rate since February of 2008. Sales of existing single-family homes rounded an annual rate of $4.5 million in May, up $4.7 million compared to May of 2015.
On the financing side, the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was at 3.42% for the week ended July 15. Retail sales for building materials, garden equipment and supply dealers was 7.7% higher in the first half of 2016 versus 2015.
In Canada, second quarter housing stars were at a seasonally adjusted rate of 198,000, unchanged from the first quarter but up about 3% from Q2 of last year. 
So as I look to the rest of the year and into 2017, to achieve the forecasted 9% growth in housing starts with the first half being at 7%, we will need to see an acceleration in activity in the second half of the year. Based on our conversations with builders and the demand we're seeing for our products, I'm optimistic that this will happen.
I believe that the concerns about labor and land availability for both builders on certainly relative lending standards for buyers and the impact of the upcoming election in our nation and more specifically, on consumer confidence, have been built into this reduced housing forecast.
The news is better on any of these fronts, we could see an upside in activity.
For 2017, I agree that we'll see a 10-plus growth in housing starts, driven by increased household formations and some wage growth. Specific to LP, we have seen further increases in OSB pricing with Random Lengths reporting current levels at 16% higher than the average 7/16 North Central price in Q2.
On our Siding business, we are on track to achieve volume growth of 12% of 14% on a year-over-year basis, with strong activity in all of our market segments.
As I mentioned last quarter, stronger single-family starts is driving demand for EWP. Additionally, the trade actions that could occur in October related to the expired softwood lumber agreement could also be beneficial for EWP later this year and the end of 2017.
South America, expect good OSB and Siding demand in Chile throughout the year. For Brazil, we will continue to focus on export opportunities as these are generally priced in USD and we can benefit from the weak Brazilian currency.
With that, let me turn over to Sallie for question-and-answer."

The number that they publicly put out there was a $440 million number. That was for a -- that was their estimate for a double expansion. So it was putting in an initial line then adding a second line and I haven't -- I don't exactly know what their number is. But for something like that, it ought to be kind of like 800 million square feet, so it's a big number. As you know, our Siding business has benefited from conversions of existing mills. So they've basically got the OSB mill for nothing and then added the additional equipment. As I said in my comments, we're becoming pretty short of mills that we can do that in our own stable.

And with me today are Curt Stevens, LP's Chief Executive Officer; as well as Mike Kinney and Becky Barckley, our primary Investor Relations contacts.
I'll begin the discussion with a review of the financial results for the second quarter of 2016 and the first half of 2016. This will be followed by some comments on the performance of the individual segments and selected balance sheet items.
After I finish my comments, Curt will discuss the general -- provide his perspective on our operating results, our capital projects and give some thoughts on our outlook.
As we've done in the past, we've opened up this call to the public and are doing a webcast. The webcast can be accessed at www.lpcorp.com. Additionally, to help with the discussion, we have provided a presentation with supplemental information that should be reviewed in conjunction with the earnings release. 
I will be referencing these slides in my comments this morning. We filed an 8-K this morning with some supplemental information as well as our Form 10-Q. I do want to remind all participants that the forward-looking statements comment on Slide 2 of the presentation. Please also be aware of the discussion of our use of non-GAAP financial information included on Slide 3 of the presentation. The appendix attached to the presentation has some of the necessary reconciliations that's been supplemented by the Form 8-K filing we made this morning. Rather than read these 2 statements, I incorporate them with this reference.
Our second quarter results continued the momentum which started in the first quarter. In addition to the strong results in our OSB segment reporting the $63 million improvement in adjusted EBITDA and just over $40 million of increased sales, the signing business reported record SmartSide volume and sales, including a 14% increase in volume from the first quarter of 2016 and 22% improved volumes from the same quarter last year.
Now with that, let me go into the details.
Moving to Slide 4 of the presentation for a discussion of the second quarter and the first 6 months of 2016 consolidated results. We are reporting net sales of $582 million for the second quarter of 2016, an increase of -- an 18% increase from net sales of $493 million reported in the second quarter of 2015. In the second quarter, reported net income of $32 million or $0.22 per diluted share compared to a net loss of $20 million or a $0.14 loss per diluted share in the second quarter of 2015.
The adjusted income from continuing operations for the quarter was $40 million or $0.28 per diluted share based upon a normalized tax rate of 35% as compared to a loss of $12 million or a loss of $0.08 per share reported in the second quarter of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $99 million in the quarter compared to $16 million in the second quarter of 2015. In the first six months of 2016, we recorded net income of $42 million or $0.29 per diluted share compared to a net loss for the first 6 months of 2015 of $54 million or a loss of $0.38 per diluted share. The adjusted income for the 6-month period was $50 million or $0.34 per diluted share based upon a normalized tax rate of 35% compared to a loss of $31 million or a $0.22 loss per diluted share for the first 6 months of 2015.
Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $151 million for the first 6 months compared to $22 million in the first 6 months of 2015.
Now moving on to Slide 5 and a review of our segment results beginning with OSB. OSB reported net sales for the second quarter of 2016 of $253 million, up 20% from $211 million in the second quarter of 2015. OSB reported operating income of $44 million compared to a loss of $18 million in the second quarter of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $59 million compared to negative adjusted EBITDA of $4 million in the second quarter of 2015. Sales volume in OSB were down 7% from the second quarter of 2015, primarily due to the conversion of the Swan mill to a siding mill. And as such, those financial results are now included as part of the siding segment. Pricing for OSB was higher by 30% which improved operating results by $59 million. For the first 6 months of 2016, OSB reported an operating profit of $59 million on sales of $470 million compared to a loss of $47 million and $401 million of sales in the first 6 months of 2015.  
For the first 6 months of 2016, we reported adjusted EBITDA of $89 million compared to negative adjusted EBITDA of $17 million in the first 6 months of 2015. Sales volumes were lower by 4% and sales prices were higher by 22%. The impact of a higher sales price on OSB operations was $86 million for the first 6 months of 2016 compared to the first 6 months of 2015.
Throughout the quarter and first 6 months of 2016, reductions in raw material cost, higher utilization rates as well as a positive impact with the Canadian currency on our Canadian operation improved OSB segment's financial result as compared to similar periods in 2015.  
Moving on to Slide 6 for the results of the Siding business. This segment includes our SmartSide and CanExel siding products as well as OSB produced on one line of our Hayward, Wisconsin facility. Siding reported net sales for the second quarter of 2016 of $207 million, up 26% from $164 million in the second quarter of 2015. Siding reported operating income of $42 million compared to operating income of $29 million in the second quarter of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $49 million compared to $35 million for the same period last year. Sales volumes -- SmartSide volume was up 22% from the prior year and 14% sequentially. Sales prices for SmartSide were down 2% due to changes in product mix, with individual prices remaining relatively flat. For CanExel, sales volumes increased 24% due to increased demand, primarily in Europe. Sales prices were lower by 3% due to the impact of the Canadian dollar. Based upon Canadian dollar selling prices, prices for CanExel were 2% higher than the same period in 2015.  
We produced approximately 53 million square feet of OSB in the segment during the second quarter of 2016 as compared to no OSB production in the second quarter of 2015.  
The Siding segment reported sales of $389 million for the first 6 months of 2016, an increase of 15% from $337 million reported in the first 6 months of 2015. The Siding segment reported operating income of $69 million for the first 6 months as compared to $62 million in the first 6 months of 2015 and adjusted EBITDA of $84 million as compared to $73 million of adjusted EBITDA in the same period of 2015.
SmartSide sales volumes were up 11% and sales prices were down 2% for the first 6 months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015.  
Please turn to Slide 7 of the presentation which shows the results for our Engineered Wood Products segment. The segment includes I-Joist, Laminated Strand Lumber, Laminated Veneer Lumber, OSB produced at our Houlton, Maine facility plus other related products. This segment also includes the sale of I-Joist and LVL products produced by the Abitibi joint venture or under a sales arrangement with Murphy Plywood.
The Engineered Wood Products segment recorded sales of $78 million in the second quarter of 2016, up $6 million from the second quarter of 2015. The EWP segment earned operating income of $0.5 million in the second quarter of 2016 compared to a loss of $2 million for the second quarter of 2015. For the second quarter 2016, adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations improved to $4 million as compared to $1 million from the second quarter of 2015. Volumes of I-Joist were up 13% while volumes of LVL and LSL were up 3% compared to the same quarter last year. Pricing was up 6% in LVL and LSL and up 5% in I-Joist.  
For the first 6 months, sales were $150 million, up from $137 million in the first 6 months of 2015. The segment's operating loss in the first half of 2016 was $2 million as compared to a loss of $6 million for the first half of 2015. And adjusted EBITDA improved to $5 million from breakeven for the first 6 months of 2015.
Moving on to Slide 8 of the presentation. For the quarter, our South American segment recorded sales of $41 million as compared to $39 million in the second quarter of 2015. Operating income was $7 million as compared to $2 million in the second quarter of 2015 and adjusted EBITDA improved by $5 million from the second quarter of 2015 to $9 million in the second quarter of 2016. Volumes in Chile were up 15% -- volumes in Chile were up 14% and flat in Brazil compared to the same quarter last year. On a USD basis, pricing was flat in Chile and up 4% in Brazil. In local currency, Chile's pricing was up 10% with the same quarter in 2015 and Brazil's pricing increased 20%.
For the first 6 months, our South American segment reported sales of $72 million as compared to $75 million in the first 6 months of 2015. Operating income was $12 million compared to $4 million in the first 6 months of 2015 and adjusted EBITDA increased to $16 million from $9 million in the same period of 2015.  
Total selling, general and administrative expenses were $47 million in the second quarter of 2016 compared to $38 million in the same quarter of 2015. For the 6 months period, our selling general and administrative expenses were $89 million for 2016 compared to $77 million for the first 6 months of 2015. For both the quarter as well as 6 months period, the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increases and certain management incentive accruals and higher sales and marketing-related expenses.  
Please refer to Slide 9 of the presentation. As of June 30, 2016, we had cash, cash equivalents, investments and restrictive cash for $495 million. Working capital was $700 million, net cash of $135 million. And in addition to the $495 million of cash on our balance sheet, we had $200 million of availability on our credit facility. Capital expenditures for the first 6 months of 2016 were $51 million. We generated operating cash flow of $104 million for the first 6 months of 2016 and generated net cash flow of $40 million for the first 6 months of 2016.
We are continuing to project capital expenditures for 2016 of $120 million to $130 million which approximately $60 million is for growth projects and the other $60 million to $70 million is associated with maintenance projects. Now, I'll turn the call over to Curt for his comments."

Good morning, and thanks for joining us on today's call. As usual, I'll start with our safety performance. Through the first half of the year, our total incident rate or TIR was 0.31 and the rolling 12-month TIR was at 0.36. I continue to be extremely proud of all of our employees who recognize the value of being safe, have committed to it and act accordingly.
Today, I'll be providing comments on our results and accomplishments during the last quarter and first half of the year, discuss key demand drivers, provide an update on our capital planning including a potential Siding expansion, and give you my views on the outlook for the rest of this year and into next year.  
Sales in Q2, as Sallie just reviewed, were 18% better than Q2 of last year and produced net income of $32 million and EPS of $0.22. This was significantly better than Q2 of last year due to greater demand leading to higher OSB prices, better Siding volumes and lower manufacturing cost across all of our businesses.
For the third consecutive quarter, all business segments recorded positive adjusted EBITDA that totaled nearly a $100 million for the company in Q2. EBITDA improved by $83 million over Q2 of 2015 and by $52 million compared to last quarter.
In OSB, Random Lengths reported North Central 7/16's Q2 pricing was 17% higher than the first quarter, and LP averaged a 10% increase due to regional differences and lower premiums on flooring. However, when coupled with lower cost, our EBIT margin improved from 13.8% last quarter to 17.4% this quarter.
In Siding, our SmartSide revenues grew 26% versus the same quarter last year and adjusted EBITDA was just short of $50 million, a 42% improvement. In EWP, we were EBIT positive for the quarter and EBITDA was almost $4 million compared to $600,000 in Q2 of last year. 
South America, overall sales were a bit higher but EBITDA more than doubled. On the year-to-date results, our sales were up 13%, net income was $42 million compared to a loss of $54 million last year and adjusted EBITDA was $151 million, an improvement of $129 million. In Sallie's review, she did discuss the expected capital expenditures for 2016. I want to give you a little bit more color on this.
One of the projects currently underway will be to more than double the production capacity of our fire-retardant OSB product, FlameBlock. Today, we have used a contract manufacturer for the coating. We have licensed this technology from this very important vendor and are nearing the completion of a $15 million post-processing facility located at our Clarke County, Alabama site. This should be operational near the end of this quarter and will provide us with lower cost production, improved logistics and greater geographical diversity for this important growth product.  
At our board meeting last week, we did present 3 capital projects to our board which were approved. The first was a maintenance project to rebuild the press at our Jasper, Texas mill. This $15 million to $17 million project will take place in the first half of next year. We have done similar projects at Roxboro, Hanceville and Sagola and we currently have a similar project at one of our lines at Hayward that will begin later this quarter.
You have heard me talk about a third mill in Chile for several years. After an arduous and lengthy environmental permitting process followed by detailed engineering, our board did agree to go ahead with this $60 million to $65 million project which should come online late next year or early 2018.  
Like our 2 prior mills in Chile, we will be re-purposing owned equipment from a few of our shuttered OSB mills. This expansion will take place on our existing Panguipulli mill site in Southern Chile.  
The third capital discussion was more of a work in process, as we continue to plan for the next increment of Siding capacity. Based on our current projections, we will need additional capacity around the end of 2018.  
If we are converting an existing mill, we will need about 9  to 12 months for the conversion. If we're building a new mill, this timeframe extends to more than 2 years. There are a lot of factors that need to be considered when making this decision.
The expected growth rate and product mix of our Siding business, availability, cost and species of the wood, competitive logistics, a trained and available workforce, available incentives, the overall business climate and forecasted currency rates.
When considering existing mills, the options with LP are limited due to our existing products and customers that we need to satisfy, the location of those mills, the wood supply to that mill and the actual mill configuration. Logically, we are also considering OSB mills owned by others and this exploration is ongoing.  
With the new mill option, we have done quite a bit of work on the potential Siding and have preliminarily concluded that the Iron Range in Northern Minnesota makes the most sense.
We have been working with the State of Minnesota and the economic development group for that region, the Iron Range Resources and Rehabilitation Board or IRRRB on possible site selection and incentives. They have been great partners to us in this effort. To date, the legislature and the IRRRB have combined to offer significant incentives that are greatly appreciated and help to make this alternative much more competitive.  
At our board meeting, we discussed this  status and requested funds for long lead time items and continuing engineering, while we are completing the evaluation of all of our known alternatives. We now currently have an estimated capital cost as this will be dependent on a number of factors that have not yet been decided. However, it is most likely that a little will be spent in 2016 with spending beginning next year and accelerating as we go into 2018.
With the improvement in our earnings and a continued positive outlook for housing, we're increasingly getting questions on the balance sheet liquidity and our plans for the cash. I want to provide you with my thoughts.  
As Sallie mentioned in her review of Q2 results, we ended the second quarter with $495 million in cash, cash equivalents, investments and restricted cash. In South America, we did use some of our cash within Chile to prepay about $7 million on existing debt.
Tied in with the third mill in Chile, we have been working with our local banks to put in place financing within Chile to fund the construction. You'll probably see this early next year.
So what are we going to do with the cash? Our first priority is to invest in our current facilities to lower cost, allow for the manufacture of value added products and increase our flexibility to ship the product mix to what is being requested by our customers. The examples include the FlameBlock line under construction in Alabama that I just mentioned. We are installing a small I-Joist line in Chile to give us additional flexibility within South America, and we continue to investments in our Siding mills to increase our flexibility.
The next priority is to invest in new facilities to meet anticipated demand. Earlier, I discussed the addition of a third mill in Chile and the exploration of where new Siding capacity will be installed.
These projects all have returns in excess of our 16% hurdle rate. We do continue to explore acquisitions that will add to or complement our existing businesses. Finally, our board continues to discuss returning cash to shareholders via dividend or share repurchase. As we continue our string of profitable quarters, adding a dividend will certainly be considered. We do have [indiscernible], so we have not yet purchased any shares under this authority.
Let me shift to talk about the housing market. The Q2 news in the housing market was good but it did reaffirm it will likely be in the 8% to 10% annual growth rate for starts over the next few years. While not as strong as been forecast, this actually bodes well for both homebuilders and suppliers to the building industry. Housing starts in the first half of this year were up 7% compared to the same period last year. However, the good news for LP is that single-family starts actually increased 13% during these same periods. More of our products are consumed in a single-family start than a multifamily start as mentioned last quarter.
The consensus for 2016 now stands at $1.206 million, 9% higher than last year and $1.34 for 2017, an 11% increase over this year's forecast. In June, I did attend the Policy Advisory Board meeting of the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies where we previewed the recently released State of the Nation's Housing 2016. While this report looks broadly at housing, homeownership rates, financing, affordability, rental markets and housing challenges, the key underpinning to their forecast is demographics and household formations.
This group believes that demographics alone will drive the addition of more than 13 million households in the next decade.
Their conclusion, I quote, factoring in the need to replace older units and meet demand for vacation homes and other uses, housing construction should average 1.6 million units a year over the next decade. I like the way they're thinking.
Other positive housing-related data. New home sales rose 3.5% in June, the fastest rate since February of 2008. Sales of existing single-family homes rounded an annual rate of $4.5 million in May, up $4.7 million compared to May of 2015.
On the financing side, the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was at 3.42% for the week ended July 15. Retail sales for building materials, garden equipment and supply dealers was 7.7% higher in the first half of 2016 versus 2015.
In Canada, second quarter housing stars were at a seasonally adjusted rate of 198,000, unchanged from the first quarter but up about 3% from Q2 of last year. 
So as I look to the rest of the year and into 2017, to achieve the forecasted 9% growth in housing starts with the first half being at 7%, we will need to see an acceleration in activity in the second half of the year. Based on our conversations with builders and the demand we're seeing for our products, I'm optimistic that this will happen.
I believe that the concerns about labor and land availability for both builders on certainly relative lending standards for buyers and the impact of the upcoming election in our nation and more specifically, on consumer confidence, have been built into this reduced housing forecast.
The news is better on any of these fronts, we could see an upside in activity.
For 2017, I agree that we'll see a 10-plus growth in housing starts, driven by increased household formations and some wage growth. Specific to LP, we have seen further increases in OSB pricing with Random Lengths reporting current levels at 16% higher than the average 7/16 North Central price in Q2.
On our Siding business, we are on track to achieve volume growth of 12% of 14% on a year-over-year basis, with strong activity in all of our market segments.
As I mentioned last quarter, stronger single-family starts is driving demand for EWP. Additionally, the trade actions that could occur in October related to the expired softwood lumber agreement could also be beneficial for EWP later this year and the end of 2017.
South America, expect good OSB and Siding demand in Chile throughout the year. For Brazil, we will continue to focus on export opportunities as these are generally priced in USD and we can benefit from the weak Brazilian currency.
With that, let me turn over to Sallie for question-and-answer."

From a timing standpoint, I really do think we need to make this decision, whether we're going to be converting an existing mill or building a new mill.

The number that they publicly put out there was a $440 million number. That was for a -- that was their estimate for a double expansion. So it was putting in an initial line then adding a second line and I haven't -- I don't exactly know what their number is. But for something like that, it ought to be kind of like 800 million square feet, so it's a big number. As you know, our Siding business has benefited from conversions of existing mills. So they've basically got the OSB mill for nothing and then added the additional equipment. As I said in my comments, we're becoming pretty short of mills that we can do that in our own stable.

And with me today are Curt Stevens, LP's Chief Executive Officer; as well as Mike Kinney and Becky Barckley, our primary Investor Relations contacts.
I'll begin the discussion with a review of the financial results for the second quarter of 2016 and the first half of 2016. This will be followed by some comments on the performance of the individual segments and selected balance sheet items.
After I finish my comments, Curt will discuss the general -- provide his perspective on our operating results, our capital projects and give some thoughts on our outlook.
As we've done in the past, we've opened up this call to the public and are doing a webcast. The webcast can be accessed at www.lpcorp.com. Additionally, to help with the discussion, we have provided a presentation with supplemental information that should be reviewed in conjunction with the earnings release. 
I will be referencing these slides in my comments this morning. We filed an 8-K this morning with some supplemental information as well as our Form 10-Q. I do want to remind all participants that the forward-looking statements comment on Slide 2 of the presentation. Please also be aware of the discussion of our use of non-GAAP financial information included on Slide 3 of the presentation. The appendix attached to the presentation has some of the necessary reconciliations that's been supplemented by the Form 8-K filing we made this morning. Rather than read these 2 statements, I incorporate them with this reference.
Our second quarter results continued the momentum which started in the first quarter. In addition to the strong results in our OSB segment reporting the $63 million improvement in adjusted EBITDA and just over $40 million of increased sales, the signing business reported record SmartSide volume and sales, including a 14% increase in volume from the first quarter of 2016 and 22% improved volumes from the same quarter last year.
Now with that, let me go into the details.
Moving to Slide 4 of the presentation for a discussion of the second quarter and the first 6 months of 2016 consolidated results. We are reporting net sales of $582 million for the second quarter of 2016, an increase of -- an 18% increase from net sales of $493 million reported in the second quarter of 2015. In the second quarter, reported net income of $32 million or $0.22 per diluted share compared to a net loss of $20 million or a $0.14 loss per diluted share in the second quarter of 2015.
The adjusted income from continuing operations for the quarter was $40 million or $0.28 per diluted share based upon a normalized tax rate of 35% as compared to a loss of $12 million or a loss of $0.08 per share reported in the second quarter of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $99 million in the quarter compared to $16 million in the second quarter of 2015. In the first six months of 2016, we recorded net income of $42 million or $0.29 per diluted share compared to a net loss for the first 6 months of 2015 of $54 million or a loss of $0.38 per diluted share. The adjusted income for the 6-month period was $50 million or $0.34 per diluted share based upon a normalized tax rate of 35% compared to a loss of $31 million or a $0.22 loss per diluted share for the first 6 months of 2015.
Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $151 million for the first 6 months compared to $22 million in the first 6 months of 2015.
Now moving on to Slide 5 and a review of our segment results beginning with OSB. OSB reported net sales for the second quarter of 2016 of $253 million, up 20% from $211 million in the second quarter of 2015. OSB reported operating income of $44 million compared to a loss of $18 million in the second quarter of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $59 million compared to negative adjusted EBITDA of $4 million in the second quarter of 2015. Sales volume in OSB were down 7% from the second quarter of 2015, primarily due to the conversion of the Swan mill to a siding mill. And as such, those financial results are now included as part of the siding segment. Pricing for OSB was higher by 30% which improved operating results by $59 million. For the first 6 months of 2016, OSB reported an operating profit of $59 million on sales of $470 million compared to a loss of $47 million and $401 million of sales in the first 6 months of 2015.  
For the first 6 months of 2016, we reported adjusted EBITDA of $89 million compared to negative adjusted EBITDA of $17 million in the first 6 months of 2015. Sales volumes were lower by 4% and sales prices were higher by 22%. The impact of a higher sales price on OSB operations was $86 million for the first 6 months of 2016 compared to the first 6 months of 2015.
Throughout the quarter and first 6 months of 2016, reductions in raw material cost, higher utilization rates as well as a positive impact with the Canadian currency on our Canadian operation improved OSB segment's financial result as compared to similar periods in 2015.  
Moving on to Slide 6 for the results of the Siding business. This segment includes our SmartSide and CanExel siding products as well as OSB produced on one line of our Hayward, Wisconsin facility. Siding reported net sales for the second quarter of 2016 of $207 million, up 26% from $164 million in the second quarter of 2015. Siding reported operating income of $42 million compared to operating income of $29 million in the second quarter of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $49 million compared to $35 million for the same period last year. Sales volumes -- SmartSide volume was up 22% from the prior year and 14% sequentially. Sales prices for SmartSide were down 2% due to changes in product mix, with individual prices remaining relatively flat. For CanExel, sales volumes increased 24% due to increased demand, primarily in Europe. Sales prices were lower by 3% due to the impact of the Canadian dollar. Based upon Canadian dollar selling prices, prices for CanExel were 2% higher than the same period in 2015.  
We produced approximately 53 million square feet of OSB in the segment during the second quarter of 2016 as compared to no OSB production in the second quarter of 2015.  
The Siding segment reported sales of $389 million for the first 6 months of 2016, an increase of 15% from $337 million reported in the first 6 months of 2015. The Siding segment reported operating income of $69 million for the first 6 months as compared to $62 million in the first 6 months of 2015 and adjusted EBITDA of $84 million as compared to $73 million of adjusted EBITDA in the same period of 2015.
SmartSide sales volumes were up 11% and sales prices were down 2% for the first 6 months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015.  
Please turn to Slide 7 of the presentation which shows the results for our Engineered Wood Products segment. The segment includes I-Joist, Laminated Strand Lumber, Laminated Veneer Lumber, OSB produced at our Houlton, Maine facility plus other related products. This segment also includes the sale of I-Joist and LVL products produced by the Abitibi joint venture or under a sales arrangement with Murphy Plywood.
The Engineered Wood Products segment recorded sales of $78 million in the second quarter of 2016, up $6 million from the second quarter of 2015. The EWP segment earned operating income of $0.5 million in the second quarter of 2016 compared to a loss of $2 million for the second quarter of 2015. For the second quarter 2016, adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations improved to $4 million as compared to $1 million from the second quarter of 2015. Volumes of I-Joist were up 13% while volumes of LVL and LSL were up 3% compared to the same quarter last year. Pricing was up 6% in LVL and LSL and up 5% in I-Joist.  
For the first 6 months, sales were $150 million, up from $137 million in the first 6 months of 2015. The segment's operating loss in the first half of 2016 was $2 million as compared to a loss of $6 million for the first half of 2015. And adjusted EBITDA improved to $5 million from breakeven for the first 6 months of 2015.
Moving on to Slide 8 of the presentation. For the quarter, our South American segment recorded sales of $41 million as compared to $39 million in the second quarter of 2015. Operating income was $7 million as compared to $2 million in the second quarter of 2015 and adjusted EBITDA improved by $5 million from the second quarter of 2015 to $9 million in the second quarter of 2016. Volumes in Chile were up 15% -- volumes in Chile were up 14% and flat in Brazil compared to the same quarter last year. On a USD basis, pricing was flat in Chile and up 4% in Brazil. In local currency, Chile's pricing was up 10% with the same quarter in 2015 and Brazil's pricing increased 20%.
For the first 6 months, our South American segment reported sales of $72 million as compared to $75 million in the first 6 months of 2015. Operating income was $12 million compared to $4 million in the first 6 months of 2015 and adjusted EBITDA increased to $16 million from $9 million in the same period of 2015.  
Total selling, general and administrative expenses were $47 million in the second quarter of 2016 compared to $38 million in the same quarter of 2015. For the 6 months period, our selling general and administrative expenses were $89 million for 2016 compared to $77 million for the first 6 months of 2015. For both the quarter as well as 6 months period, the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increases and certain management incentive accruals and higher sales and marketing-related expenses.  
Please refer to Slide 9 of the presentation. As of June 30, 2016, we had cash, cash equivalents, investments and restrictive cash for $495 million. Working capital was $700 million, net cash of $135 million. And in addition to the $495 million of cash on our balance sheet, we had $200 million of availability on our credit facility. Capital expenditures for the first 6 months of 2016 were $51 million. We generated operating cash flow of $104 million for the first 6 months of 2016 and generated net cash flow of $40 million for the first 6 months of 2016.
We are continuing to project capital expenditures for 2016 of $120 million to $130 million which approximately $60 million is for growth projects and the other $60 million to $70 million is associated with maintenance projects. Now, I'll turn the call over to Curt for his comments."

Good morning, and thanks for joining us on today's call. As usual, I'll start with our safety performance. Through the first half of the year, our total incident rate or TIR was 0.31 and the rolling 12-month TIR was at 0.36. I continue",1970,"Thank you, Sallie. Good morning, and thanks for joining us on today's call. As usual, I'll start with our safety performance. Through the first half of the year, our total incident rate or TIR was 0.31 and the rolling 12-month TIR was at 0.36. I continue to be extremely proud of all of our employees who recognize the value of being safe, have committed to it and act accordingly.
Today, I'll be providing comments on our results and accomplishments during the last quarter and first half of the year, discuss key demand drivers, provide an update on our capital planning including a potential Siding expansion, and give you my views on the outlook for the rest of this year and into next year.  
Sales in Q2, as Sallie just reviewed, were 18% better than Q2 of last year and produced net income of $32 million and EPS of $0.22. This was significantly better than Q2 of last year due to greater demand leading to higher OSB prices, better Siding volumes and lower manufacturing cost across all of our businesses.
For the third consecutive quarter, all business segments recorded positive adjusted EBITDA that totaled nearly a $100 million for the company in Q2. EBITDA improved by $83 million over Q2 of 2015 and by $52 million compared to last quarter.
In OSB, Random Lengths reported North Central 7/16's Q2 pricing was 17% higher than the first quarter, and LP averaged a 10% increase due to regional differences and lower premiums on flooring. However, when coupled with lower cost, our EBIT margin improved from 13.8% last quarter to 17.4% this quarter.
In Siding, our SmartSide revenues grew 26% versus the same quarter last year and adjusted EBITDA was just short of $50 million, a 42% improvement. In EWP, we were EBIT positive for the quarter and EBITDA was almost $4 million compared to $600,000 in Q2 of last year. 
South America, overall sales were a bit higher but EBITDA more than doubled. On the year-to-date results, our sales were up 13%, net income was $42 million compared to a loss of $54 million last year and adjusted EBITDA was $151 million, an improvement of $129 million. In Sallie's review, she did discuss the expected capital expenditures for 2016. I want to give you a little bit more color on this.
One of the projects currently underway will be to more than double the production capacity of our fire-retardant OSB product, FlameBlock. Today, we have used a contract manufacturer for the coating. We have licensed this technology from this very important vendor and are nearing the completion of a $15 million post-processing facility located at our Clarke County, Alabama site. This should be operational near the end of this quarter and will provide us with lower cost production, improved logistics and greater geographical diversity for this important growth product.  
At our board meeting last week, we did present 3 capital projects to our board which were approved. The first was a maintenance project to rebuild the press at our Jasper, Texas mill. This $15 million to $17 million project will take place in the first half of next year. We have done similar projects at Roxboro, Hanceville and Sagola and we currently have a similar project at one of our lines at Hayward that will begin later this quarter.
You have heard me talk about a third mill in Chile for several years. After an arduous and lengthy environmental permitting process followed by detailed engineering, our board did agree to go ahead with this $60 million to $65 million project which should come online late next year or early 2018.  
Like our 2 prior mills in Chile, we will be re-purposing owned equipment from a few of our shuttered OSB mills. This expansion will take place on our existing Panguipulli mill site in Southern Chile.  
The third capital discussion was more of a work in process, as we continue to plan for the next increment of Siding capacity. Based on our current projections, we will need additional capacity around the end of 2018.  
If we are converting an existing mill, we will need about 9  to 12 months for the conversion. If we're building a new mill, this timeframe extends to more than 2 years. There are a lot of factors that need to be considered when making this decision.
The expected growth rate and product mix of our Siding business, availability, cost and species of the wood, competitive logistics, a trained and available workforce, available incentives, the overall business climate and forecasted currency rates.
When considering existing mills, the options with LP are limited due to our existing products and customers that we need to satisfy, the location of those mills, the wood supply to that mill and the actual mill configuration. Logically, we are also considering OSB mills owned by others and this exploration is ongoing.  
With the new mill option, we have done quite a bit of work on the potential Siding and have preliminarily concluded that the Iron Range in Northern Minnesota makes the most sense.
We have been working with the State of Minnesota and the economic development group for that region, the Iron Range Resources and Rehabilitation Board or IRRRB on possible site selection and incentives. They have been great partners to us in this effort. To date, the legislature and the IRRRB have combined to offer significant incentives that are greatly appreciated and help to make this alternative much more competitive.  
At our board meeting, we discussed this  status and requested funds for long lead time items and continuing engineering, while we are completing the evaluation of all of our known alternatives. We now currently have an estimated capital cost as this will be dependent on a number of factors that have not yet been decided. However, it is most likely that a little will be spent in 2016 with spending beginning next year and accelerating as we go into 2018.
With the improvement in our earnings and a continued positive outlook for housing, we're increasingly getting questions on the balance sheet liquidity and our plans for the cash. I want to provide you with my thoughts.  
As Sallie mentioned in her review of Q2 results, we ended the second quarter with $495 million in cash, cash equivalents, investments and restricted cash. In South America, we did use some of our cash within Chile to prepay about $7 million on existing debt.
Tied in with the third mill in Chile, we have been working with our local banks to put in place financing within Chile to fund the construction. You'll probably see this early next year.
So what are we going to do with the cash? Our first priority is to invest in our current facilities to lower cost, allow for the manufacture of value added products and increase our flexibility to ship the product mix to what is being requested by our customers. The examples include the FlameBlock line under construction in Alabama that I just mentioned. We are installing a small I-Joist line in Chile to give us additional flexibility within South America, and we continue to investments in our Siding mills to increase our flexibility.
The next priority is to invest in new facilities to meet anticipated demand. Earlier, I discussed the addition of a third mill in Chile and the exploration of where new Siding capacity will be installed.
These projects all have returns in excess of our 16% hurdle rate. We do continue to explore acquisitions that will add to or complement our existing businesses.

As we continue our string of profitable quarters, adding a dividend will certainly be considered. We do have [indiscernible], so we have not yet purchased any shares under this authority.
Let me shift to talk about the housing market. The Q2 news in the housing market was good but it did reaffirm it will likely be in the 8% to 10% annual growth rate for starts over the next few years. While not as strong as been forecast, this actually bodes well for both homebuilders and suppliers to the building industry. Housing starts in the first half of this year were up 7% compared to the same period last year. However, the good news for LP is that single-family starts actually increased 13% during these same periods. More of our products are consumed in a single-family start than a multifamily start as mentioned last quarter.
The consensus for 2016 now stands at $1.206 million, 9% higher than last year and $1.34 for 2017, an 11% increase over this year's forecast. In June, I did attend the Policy Advisory Board meeting of the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies where we previewed the recently released State of the Nation's Housing 2016. While this report looks broadly at housing, homeownership rates, financing, affordability, rental markets and housing challenges, the key underpinning to their forecast is demographics and household formations.
This group believes that demographics alone will drive the addition of more than 13 million households in the next decade.
Their conclusion, I quote, factoring in the need to replace older units and meet demand for vacation homes and other uses, housing construction should average 1.6 million units a year over the next decade. I like the way they're thinking.
Other positive housing-related data. New home sales rose 3.5% in June, the fastest rate since February of 2008. Sales of existing single-family homes rounded an annual rate of $4.5 million in May, up $4.7 million compared to May of 2015.
On the financing side, the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was at 3.42% for the week ended July 15. Retail sales for building materials, garden equipment and supply dealers was 7.7% higher in the first half of 2016 versus 2015.
In Canada, second quarter housing stars were at a seasonally adjusted rate of 198,000, unchanged from the first quarter but up about 3% from Q2 of last year. 
So as I look to the rest of the year and into 2017, to achieve the forecasted 9% growth in housing starts with the first half being at 7%, we will need to see an acceleration in activity in the second half of the year. Based on our conversations with builders and the demand we're seeing for our products, I'm optimistic that this will happen.
I believe that the concerns about labor and land availability for both builders on certainly relative lending standards for buyers and the impact of the upcoming election in our nation and more specifically, on consumer confidence, have been built into this reduced housing forecast.
The news is better on any of these fronts, we could see an upside in activity.
For 2017, I agree that we'll see a 10-plus growth in housing starts, driven by increased household formations and some wage growth. Specific to LP, we have seen further increases in OSB pricing with Random Lengths reporting current levels at 16% higher than the average 7/16 North Central price in Q2.
On our Siding business, we are on track to achieve volume growth of 12% of 14% on a year-over-year basis, with strong activity in all of our market segments.
As I mentioned last quarter, stronger single-family starts is driving demand for EWP. Additionally, the trade actions that could occur in October related to the expired softwood lumber agreement could also be beneficial for EWP later this year and the end of 2017.
South America, expect good OSB and Siding demand in Chile throughout the year. For Brazil, we will continue to focus on export opportunities as these are generally priced in USD and we can benefit from the weak Brazilian currency.
With that, let me turn over to Sallie for question-and-answer."

But it does expand the market for OSB which I think is good. The FlameBlock product, we are really targeting at multi-family more than we are at single-family. So that's a kind of an entrée in a plate into the multi-family market. The other industrial applications that we've been pursuing have to do with container lining, cargo trailers, interior garage panels and some of those things and we are making some progress there.

The number that they publicly put out there was a $440 million number. That was for a -- that was their estimate for a double expansion. So it was putting in an initial line then adding a second line and I haven't -- I don't exactly know what their number is. But for something like that, it ought to be kind of like 800 million square feet, so it's a big number. As you know, our Siding business has benefited from conversions of existing mills.

Thank you for joining our conference call today to discuss LP's financial results for the third quarter of 2016. I am Sallie Bailey, LP's Chief Financial Officer. And with me today are Curt Stevens, LP's Chief Executive Officer; Brad Southern, LP's new Chief Operating Officer; as well as Mike Kinney and Becky Barckley, our primary Investor Relations contacts.
I'll begin the discussion with a review of the financial results for the third quarter of 2016. This will be followed by some comments on the performance of the individual segments and selected balance sheet items. After I finish my remarks, Curt will discuss the general market environment in which LP has been operating, update you on his current thoughts on Siding expansion plans and the recently announced organizational change as well as give some thoughts on the outlook.
As we've done in the past, we've opened up this call to the public and we are doing a webcast. That webcast can be accessed at www.lpcorp.com. 
Additionally, to help with the discussion, we've provided in a presentation with supplemental information that should be reviewed in conjunction with the earnings release. I will be referencing these slides in my comments this morning. We filed an 8-K this morning with some supplemental information as well as our 10-Q. 
I want to remind all the participants about the forward-looking statements comment on Slide 2 of the presentation. Please also be aware of the discussion of our use of non-GAAP financial information included on Slide 3 of the presentation. The appendix attached to the presentation has some of the necessary reconciliations that's been supplemented by the Form 8-K filing we made this morning. Rather than reading these 2 statements, I incorporate them with this reference.
We are reporting $111 million of adjusted EBITDA on just under $600 million of sales for the third quarter of 2016. The last time that LP reported adjusted EBITDA of over $100 million was the second quarter of 2013. Now in the last 12 quarters, LP's earnings profile has changed as we've grown our Siding segment. For the third quarter of 2016, Siding's percent of sales increased to 33% and the percent of adjusted EBITDA increased to over 30%. We do expect the percentage of sales and earnings from the Siding segment to continue to increase as a percent of the total as the Siding segment continues to grow. 
Now with that, let me go into the details. Moving to Slide 4 of the presentation for a discussion of the third quarter and first 9 months of 2016 consolidated financial results. We are reporting net sales of $596 million for the third quarter of 2016, a 28% increase from the net sales of $465 million reported in the third quarter of 2015. In the third quarter, we recorded net income of $66 million or $0.45 per diluted share compared to a net loss of $27 million or $0.19 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2015. 
In the third quarter, we reported income tax benefit of $7.5 million. This benefit is primarily due to the recognition of research tax credit for the years 2003 to 2015 and the reversal of certain state and local tax valuation allowances. Excluding the impact of the research tax credit and the reversal of the state and local tax valuation allowances established in the second quarter, the company's annual GAAP tax rate for the third quarter would have been approximately 20%.
The adjusted income from continuing operations for the quarter was $47 million or $0.32 per diluted share based upon a normalized tax rate of 35% as compared to a loss of $16 million or a loss of $0.12 per share reported in the third quarter of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $111 million for the quarter compared to $11 million in the third quarter of 2015.
In the first 9 months of 2016, we recorded net income of $108 million or $0.74 per diluted share on $1.7 billion in sales compared to a net loss for the first 9 months of 2015 of $81 million or a loss per diluted share of $0.57 on $1.4 billion in sales. The adjusted income for the 9-month period was $97 million or $0.67 per diluted share based upon the normalized tax rate of 35% compared to a loss of $47 million or a loss of $0.33 per diluted share for the first 9 months of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $262 million for the 9-month period in 2016 as compared to $33 million in the first 9 months of 2015.
Moving on to Slide 5 and a review of our segment results. Beginning with OSB. OSB reported net sales for the third quarter of 2016 of $282 million, up 41% from $200 million reported in the third quarter of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $83 million compared to $4 million reported in the third quarter of 2015. Sales volumes were up 5%. Sales pricing was higher by 36%, which improved operating results by $75 million. Reduction in raw material costs and higher utilization rates also improved the third quarter 2016 results as compared to the third quarter of 2015. 
For the first 9 months of 2016, OSB reported sales of $752 million compared to $601 million of sales in the first 9 months of 2015. For the first 9 months, OSB reported adjusted EBITDA of $172 million as compared to negative adjusted EBITDA of $13 million in the first 9 months of 2015. Sales volumes were lower by 1%, and sales prices were higher by 27%. The impact of the higher sales price on OSB operations was $161 million in the first 9 months of 2016 compared to the same period in the last year. Reduction of raw material costs, higher utilization rates as well as a positive impact of the Canadian currencies on expenses incurred by our Canadian operations also improved the 9-month 2016 results as compared to the first 9 months of 2015. 
Slide 6 reports the results of the Siding business. This segment includes our SmartSide and CanExel siding products as well as minor amounts of OSB. Siding reported net sales for the third quarter of 2016 of $195 million, up 23% from $158 million in the third quarter of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $42 million compared to $22 million in the third quarter of 2015. SmartSide volumes what up 25% from the prior year. SmartSide -- sales prices in SmartSide were up 1%, primarily due to changes in product mix, with individual prices remaining relatively flat. 
The Siding segment reported sales of $583 million in the first 9 months of 2016, an increase of 18% from $495 million reported in the first 9 months of 2015. Siding segment reported adjusted EBITDA of $125 million as compared to $95 million in the same period of 2015. SmartSide sales volumes were up 15% for the first 9 months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, with sales prices down 1% for SmartSide. 
Please turn to Slide 7 of the presentation, which shows the results of our Engineered Wood Products segment. This segment includes I-Joist, Laminated Strand Lumber, Laminated Veneer Lumber, OSB produced at our Houlton, Maine facility plus other related products. This segment also includes the sale of I-Joist and LVL products produced by the Abitibi joint venture or under a sales arrangement with Murphy Plywood. The Engineered Wood Products segment recorded sales of $81 million in the third quarter of 2016, up from $74 million in the third quarter of 2015. For the third quarter of 2016, adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations improved by $1 million as compared to the third quarter of 2015. Volumes of I-Joist were up 1% while volumes of LVL and LSL were up 9% compared to the same quarter of last year. Pricing increased 2% in LVL, LSL and I-Joist. 
For the first 9 months, sales were $231 million, up from $211 million in 2015. And adjusted EBITDA improved to $9 million from $3 million in the first 9 months of 2015. 
Moving on to Slide 8 of the presentation. For the quarter, our South American segment recorded sales of $32 million as compared to $27 million in the third quarter of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA of $6 million was higher by $2 million as compared to the third quarter of 2015. Volumes in Chile were down 3% and down 9% in Brazil compared to the same quarter of last year. On a U.S. dollar basis, pricing was up 13% in Chile and up 10% in Brazil. In local currency, Chile's pricing was up 10% compared with the same quarter in 2015 and Brazil's pricing was flat. 
For the first 9 months, our South American segment recorded sales of $103 million as compared to $101 million in the first 9 months of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA for the first 9 months of 2016 increased to $22 million from $13 million in the same period in 2015.
Total selling, general and administrative costs were $47 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared to $38 million in the same quarter of 2015. For the 9-month period, our selling, general and administrative costs are $136 million for 2016 compared to $115 million for the first 9 months of 2015. For both the quarter and 9-month period, the increase on these costs was primarily due to increases in certain management incentive and higher costs associated with sales and marketing.
Turning to the balance sheet. We announced 2 transactions in the third quarter which impacted our balance sheet. During the quarter, we refinanced our $350 million senior unsecured notes with an interest rate of 7.5% due 2020 with new senior unsecured notes which carry a 4 7/8% interest rate and will mature in 2024. This transaction will decrease our annual interest expense by approximately $9 million on an annual basis. 
We also announced during the quarter that we have entered into agreement to provide for the acceleration of $410 million of notes receivable from asset sales. At the same time, we gave binding notice the pay off $369 million of related notes payable. This transaction will be completed tomorrow. As a result of the transaction, LP will accelerate the receipt of $41 million of cash. This will also accelerate the income taxes of $121 million associated with the gain on the sale of timber in 2003. We anticipate offsetting much of the accelerated income tax with available carryover benefits. 
Please turn to Slide 9 of the presentation. As of September 30, 2016, we had cash, cash equivalents, investments and restricted cash of $673 million including the cash held for bond redemption or $580 million excluding that cash held for the bond redemption; working capital of $793 million; net cash of $225 million. In addition to the $580 million of cash on our balance sheet, we have $200 million of availability on our credit facility. 
We are projecting the capital expenditures for 2016 will be in the $115 million to $125 million range. For 2017, we are planning on spending approximately $140 million of capital. This estimate includes $40 million for our South American operations but does not include any capital to convert or build a new siding mill. 
We also anticipate beginning to pay cash taxes in the U.S. in 2017. The U.S. represents approximately 70% to 75% of our net income -- of our income before taxes. We don't anticipate paying cash taxes in Canada due to net operating loss carryovers. The benefit amount of our available Canadian net operating losses was $64 million at the end of 2015. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Curt."

Before I begin my remarks, I do want to acknowledge the passing last week of Harry Merlo, LP's first and longest-serving Chief Executive Officer. While Harry was often a controversial leader, there is no doubt that he was instrumental in introducing OSB to the world and promoting the vision of OSB-based siding. 
I will start with our safety performance. Through the first 9 months of this year, our total incident rate or TIR was at 0.39, and this was also the rolling 12-month TIR. We are on track for our second-best safety year ever. One recent highlight, our Panguipulli mill in Chile, last week, achieved 1.5 million hours without a recordable injury, a remarkable achievement. The safety of our employees is LP's core value, and I continue to be extremely proud of all of our employees who support this view and act accordingly. 
Today, I'll be providing comments on our results and accomplishments in the quarter, provide a little more background to the transaction we announced last Friday with Norbord, discuss the promotion of Brad Southern to Chief Operating Officer and give you my views on the outlook for the rest of this year and into 2017. I know Sallie just went through our financial results in detail, but I do want to talk about a few items because it feels so good. 
Total sales in Q3 were 28% higher than Q3 of last year and produced net income of $66 million or EPS of $0.45. For the fourth consecutive quarter, all of our business segments recorded positive EBITDA, and that totaled $111 million for the company in Q3. In Siding, our big growth business, our revenue grew 23% versus the same quarter of last year and adjusted EBITDA was at $42 million. On a year-to-date basis, our sales were up 18%, net income is $108 million and adjusted EBITDA, as Sallie said, was $262 million. 
Let me discuss the mill swap with Norbord. As I did mention last quarter, we continue to explore options to building a greenfield mill in Minnesota as the foundation for our next siding expansion. Last Friday, both LP and Norbord issued press releases that described the mill swap between our 2 companies. Let me explain the rationale from LP's perspective and our preliminary plans going forward. 
LP's Chambord mill has been indefinitely curtailed since 2008, the beginning of the downturn. Norbord's Val-d'Or mill has been curtailed since 2012. While curtailed, both mills had a skeleton crew, who maintained the equipment in the shortest time necessary for a future startup. When assessing the facilities as potential siding mills, we had earlier determined that Chambord did not have ready access to the right wood species, aspen, to make a quality siding product. However, Val-d'Or is an area where there is an abundance of aspen. 
A complicating factor for both companies as we think about restarting these mills is the actions taken by the Québec government in the last 2 years to terminate the wood licenses for both mills due to a lack of cutting activity. A first priority for us is to work with the Québec government to obtain an appropriate wood allocation to run the Val-d'Or facility. To that end, I have had initial conversations with the chiefs of staff in both the premier's and the forestry minister's offices in Québec. 
As I said in the last call, the timing for additional siding capacity is near the end of 2018. For a new mill, the permitting, construction and start-up period is likely to be 24 to 30 months. With an existing mill, we believe that the conversion can take place in less than half that time. Upon closing later this week, we will immediately begin the engineering assessment to determine the cost and timing of such a project. 
In addition to the swap of Chambord for Val-d'Or, we also acquired a former Ainsworth OSB site located in Cook, Minnesota during the last quarter. This will allow us, again, to further expand siding at the appropriate time. I'm very pleased with this result, and this will allow us to continue to work with the very supportive Minnesota elected officials in the IRRRB that -- to redirect the incentives to a size that we believe is better suited from a site development infrastructure perspective than the proposed Hoyt Lakes site. 
Last Thursday, I did speak to Governor Dayton, Senator Bakk, House Speaker Daudt and U.S. Representative Nolan, and they all pledged their support for this future project. We have not yet finalized the accounting implication of this transaction as we are waiting on third-party appraisals of the assets involved. However, we do not believe this will be material. More to come as we make progress with our discussions with the Québec government regarding the wood allocation, reengage with Minnesota officials on the incentives, and begin the engineering assessment at both Val-d'Or and the Cook, Minnesota sites. 
Last Friday, our Board of Directors did elect Brad Southern to a newly created position of Chief Operating Officer. Many of you have met Brad as he's been a regular participant at investor conferences and also was at the Analyst Day we hosted last year in Two Harbors. Brad joined LP in 1999 as the Controller of our Specialty business. Over the next few years, he moved into increasingly complex operating roles. In 2004, Brad became the General Manager of the Siding business. In that role, he was the primary architect of the segment strategy that we've put in place during the housing downturn to focus on repair, remodeling, nonresidential structures and retail, in addition to new home construction. In March of 2015, Brad took over the OSB business and has been instrumental in improving our operating performance and logistics. By the way, along the way, Brad was also the executive sponsor of our successful SAP implementation in 2013. 
In this new role, Brad will maintain direct responsibility for the OSB business and will have the general managers of Siding and EWP report to him, along with our senior VP of sales and marketing and the VP of manufacturing services. Brad will remain the Chairman of the Board of our LP South America operation. 
The elevation of Brad to this new role is part of an ongoing succession planning process that our board has had in place for many years. You may recall that I moved from CFO to COO (sic) [ CEO ] about 5 years ago. I am not retiring anytime soon, and I also will not speculate on when that time might come. As the LP board has done in the past, we are making sure that we have qualified internal successors to assume leadership in all of our key roles when the time comes. I'm very pleased to have Brad in this position as his experience will be invaluable as we continue to take advantage of an improving housing market. 
Let me talk about the housing market. Q3 housing starts were basically flat for both Q2 of this year and to Q3 of last year. However, the mix between multifamily and single family moved in our favor, with single family growing at 8% while multi-family declined slightly. Also, as permits are a leading indicator, we are pleased to see an increase of over 6% to 1.23 million in the September results. With 1 quarter to go, the consensus for 2016 housing starts now stands at 1.174, a relatively slight 6% increase from last year. For next year, the current consensus is 1.272, an 8% increase over this year's forecast. 
There have been some other positive housing-related data released recently. New home sales, August is the last reported period, were up 20.5% compared to August of 2015. Existing inventory of single-family homes fell to 2.04 million, 10% below August of last year. 
On the financing side, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rates were largely unchanged compared to last quarter at 3.47% for the week ended October 14. Retail sales for building materials, garden equipment and supply dealers were about 1.5% higher than Q2. 
In Canada, third quarter starts were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of a little over 200,000, about a 1% increase from the second quarter and down about 5.5% from Q3 of last year. As I mentioned, the current forecast for 2016 shows 6% growth in housing starts, almost all of this from single family. For 2017, we should see demand for housing continue to increase, driven primarily by increased household formations and wage growth. However, because of numerous constraints, labor, adequate lots, regulatory costs and timing, I think that the growth rate in housing will once again be between 5% and 10%. We will likely see a trend towards starter homes as the first-time homebuyer appears to be coming back. 
I recently attended the Policy Advisory Board meeting of the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies. Among other presentations at the meeting, they did provide their forecast for household formations for the next 20 years based on demographics and, immigration, and their forecast of future home ownership rates. For household formation, this group is forecasting 13.6 million net new households in the period 2015 through 2025 and 12.4 million net new households in the next 10-year period. Coupled with household removals due to demolition, catastrophe or conversion plus second home, this is good news for the housing industry. 
On homeownership, they concluded they could go up or down from the current 62%. The low end of the range was 61%, and their high end was 64.5%. Also at the meeting, the Harvard group reaffirmed their forecast that growth in repair, remodeling expenditures should continue at about 4% for the next several years. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Sallie for questions."

One, I'd just remind you on the margins. Because we looked at the competitive margins between us and Boise and Weyerhaeuser who just reported, and our margins for our manufactured products are pretty much right on top of theirs. The difficulty you get is Weyerhaeuser looks like they're reporting it coming out of distribution not as a pure manufacturing play. But the reminder is, the JV, we sell 100% of the product but we only get half of the margin out of that. And then whatever we sell from Murphy Plywood into the West and into export markets, we only get a sales margin on that. So when you look at -- and we don't have the outset base, so we'd have spent the capital but our margins look lower. The good news in Q3 is that what's been a drag on this business for some period of time is when we converted the Houlton mill into Laminated Strand Lumber, and we had the best volumes in Laminated Strand Lumber in the third quarter than we've ever had. And actually, that mill was EBITDA positive for the first time, I think, ever since -- well, since we've converted it. So we have good momentum on the LSL side. That will continue. And then the second thing I would say is we did have the Forest Economic advisory guys in here, and they continue to say that we're going to see a shortage of LVL as the housing starts get towards 1.4 million, which leads us to believe that, that's probably a business that we ought to continue to hold on to, to take advantage of the market when it does come back. That is a market that is heavily tied to single-family new construction. And as that becomes a greater part of the housing starts or actually happening, plus housing starts grow, we think that we will get that business back into the profitable region that we had -- we enjoyed in 2003 and 2004."

And with me today are Curt Stevens, LP's Chief Executive Officer; Brad Southern, LP's new Chief Operating Officer; as well as Mike Kinney and Becky Barckley, our primary Investor Relations contacts.
I'll begin the discussion with a review of the financial results for the third quarter of 2016. This will be followed by some comments on the performance of the individual segments and selected balance sheet items. After I finish my remarks, Curt will discuss the general market environment in which LP has been operating, update you on his current thoughts on Siding expansion plans and the recently announced organizational change as well as give some thoughts on the outlook.
As we've done in the past, we've opened up this call to the public and we are doing a webcast. That webcast can be accessed at www.lpcorp.com. 
Additionally, to help with the discussion, we've provided in a presentation with supplemental information that should be reviewed in conjunction with the earnings release. I will be referencing these slides in my comments this morning. We filed an 8-K this morning with some supplemental information as well as our 10-Q. 
I want to remind all the participants about the forward-looking statements comment on Slide 2 of the presentation. Please also be aware of the discussion of our use of non-GAAP financial information included on Slide 3 of the presentation. The appendix attached to the presentation has some of the necessary reconciliations that's been supplemented by the Form 8-K filing we made this morning. Rather than reading these 2 statements, I incorporate them with this reference.
We are reporting $111 million of adjusted EBITDA on just under $600 million of sales for the third quarter of 2016. The last time that LP reported adjusted EBITDA of over $100 million was the second quarter of 2013. Now in the last 12 quarters, LP's earnings profile has changed as we've grown our Siding segment. For the third quarter of 2016, Siding's percent of sales increased to 33% and the percent of adjusted EBITDA increased to over 30%. We do expect the percentage of sales and earnings from the Siding segment to continue to increase as a percent of the total as the Siding segment continues to grow. 
Now with that, let me go into the details. Moving to Slide 4 of the presentation for a discussion of the third quarter and first 9 months of 2016 consolidated financial results. We are reporting net sales of $596 million for the third quarter of 2016, a 28% increase from the net sales of $465 million reported in the third quarter of 2015. In the third quarter, we recorded net income of $66 million or $0.45 per diluted share compared to a net loss of $27 million or $0.19 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2015. 
In the third quarter, we reported income tax benefit of $7.5 million. This benefit is primarily due to the recognition of research tax credit for the years 2003 to 2015 and the reversal of certain state and local tax valuation allowances. Excluding the impact of the research tax credit and the reversal of the state and local tax valuation allowances established in the second quarter, the company's annual GAAP tax rate for the third quarter would have been approximately 20%.
The adjusted income from continuing operations for the quarter was $47 million or $0.32 per diluted share based upon a normalized tax rate of 35% as compared to a loss of $16 million or a loss of $0.12 per share reported in the third quarter of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $111 million for the quarter compared to $11 million in the third quarter of 2015.
In the first 9 months of 2016, we recorded net income of $108 million or $0.74 per diluted share on $1.7 billion in sales compared to a net loss for the first 9 months of 2015 of $81 million or a loss per diluted share of $0.57 on $1.4 billion in sales. The adjusted income for the 9-month period was $97 million or $0.67 per diluted share based upon the normalized tax rate of 35% compared to a loss of $47 million or a loss of $0.33 per diluted share for the first 9 months of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $262 million for the 9-month period in 2016 as compared to $33 million in the first 9 months of 2015.
Moving on to Slide 5 and a review of our segment results. Beginning with OSB. OSB reported net sales for the third quarter of 2016 of $282 million, up 41% from $200 million reported in the third quarter of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $83 million compared to $4 million reported in the third quarter of 2015. Sales volumes were up 5%. Sales pricing was higher by 36%, which improved operating results by $75 million. Reduction in raw material costs and higher utilization rates also improved the third quarter 2016 results as compared to the third quarter of 2015. 
For the first 9 months of 2016, OSB reported sales of $752 million compared to $601 million of sales in the first 9 months of 2015. For the first 9 months, OSB reported adjusted EBITDA of $172 million as compared to negative adjusted EBITDA of $13 million in the first 9 months of 2015. Sales volumes were lower by 1%, and sales prices were higher by 27%. The impact of the higher sales price on OSB operations was $161 million in the first 9 months of 2016 compared to the same period in the last year. Reduction of raw material costs, higher utilization rates as well as a positive impact of the Canadian currencies on expenses incurred by our Canadian operations also improved the 9-month 2016 results as compared to the first 9 months of 2015. 
Slide 6 reports the results of the Siding business. This segment includes our SmartSide and CanExel siding products as well as minor amounts of OSB. Siding reported net sales for the third quarter of 2016 of $195 million, up 23% from $158 million in the third quarter of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $42 million compared to $22 million in the third quarter of 2015. SmartSide volumes what up 25% from the prior year. SmartSide -- sales prices in SmartSide were up 1%, primarily due to changes in product mix, with individual prices remaining relatively flat. 
The Siding segment reported sales of $583 million in the first 9 months of 2016, an increase of 18% from $495 million reported in the first 9 months of 2015. Siding segment reported adjusted EBITDA of $125 million as compared to $95 million in the same period of 2015. SmartSide sales volumes were up 15% for the first 9 months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, with sales prices down 1% for SmartSide. 
Please turn to Slide 7 of the presentation, which shows the results of our Engineered Wood Products segment. This segment includes I-Joist, Laminated Strand Lumber, Laminated Veneer Lumber, OSB produced at our Houlton, Maine facility plus other related products. This segment also includes the sale of I-Joist and LVL products produced by the Abitibi joint venture or under a sales arrangement with Murphy Plywood. The Engineered Wood Products segment recorded sales of $81 million in the third quarter of 2016, up from $74 million in the third quarter of 2015. For the third quarter of 2016, adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations improved by $1 million as compared to the third quarter of 2015. Volumes of I-Joist were up 1% while volumes of LVL and LSL were up 9% compared to the same quarter of last year. Pricing increased 2% in LVL, LSL and I-Joist. 
For the first 9 months, sales were $231 million, up from $211 million in 2015. And adjusted EBITDA improved to $9 million from $3 million in the first 9 months of 2015. 
Moving on to Slide 8 of the presentation. For the quarter, our South American segment recorded sales of $32 million as compared to $27 million in the third quarter of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA of $6 million was higher by $2 million as compared to the third quarter of 2015. Volumes in Chile were down 3% and down 9% in Brazil compared to the same quarter of last year. On a U.S. dollar basis, pricing was up 13% in Chile and up 10% in Brazil. In local currency, Chile's pricing was up 10% compared with the same quarter in 2015 and Brazil's pricing was flat. 
For the first 9 months, our South American segment recorded sales of $103 million as compared to $101 million in the first 9 months of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA for the first 9 months of 2016 increased to $22 million from $13 million in the same period in 2015.
Total selling, general and administrative costs were $47 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared to $38 million in the same quarter of 2015. For the 9-month period, our selling, general and administrative costs are $136 million for 2016 compared to $115 million for the first 9 months of 2015. For both the quarter and 9-month period, the increase on these costs was primarily due to increases in certain management incentive and higher costs associated with sales and marketing.
Turning to the balance sheet. We announced 2 transactions in the third quarter which impacted our balance sheet. During the quarter, we refinanced our $350 million senior unsecured notes with an interest rate of 7.5% due 2020 with new senior unsecured notes which carry a 4 7/8% interest rate and will mature in 2024. This transaction will decrease our annual interest expense by approximately $9 million on an annual basis. 
We also announced during the quarter that we have entered into agreement to provide for the acceleration of $410 million of notes receivable from asset sales. At the same time, we gave binding notice the pay off $369 million of related notes payable. This transaction will be completed tomorrow. As a result of the transaction, LP will accelerate the receipt of $41 million of cash. This will also accelerate the income taxes of $121 million associated with the gain on the sale of timber in 2003. We anticipate offsetting much of the accelerated income tax with available carryover benefits. 
Please turn to Slide 9 of the presentation. As of September 30, 2016, we had cash, cash equivalents, investments and restricted cash of $673 million including the cash held for bond redemption or $580 million excluding that cash held for the bond redemption; working capital of $793 million; net cash of $225 million. In addition to the $580 million of cash on our balance sheet, we have $200 million of availability on our credit facility. 
We are projecting the capital expenditures for 2016 will be in the $115 million to $125 million range. For 2017, we are planning on spending approximately $140 million of capital. This estimate includes $40 million for our South American operations but does not include any capital to convert or build a new siding mill. 
We also anticipate beginning to pay cash taxes in the U.S. in 2017. The U.S. represents approximately 70% to 75% of our net income -- of our income before taxes. We don't anticipate paying cash taxes in Canada due to net operating loss carryovers. The benefit amount of our available Canadian net operating losses was $64 million at the end of 2015. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Curt."

I will start with our safety performance. Through the first 9 months of this year, our total incident rate or TIR was at 0.39, and this was also the rolling 12-month TIR. We are on track for our second-best safety year ever. One recent highlight, our Panguipulli mill in Chile, last week, achieved 1.5 million hours without a recordable injury, a remarkable achievement. The safety of our employees is LP's core value, and I continue to be extremely proud of all of our employees who support this view and act accordingly. 
Today, I'll be providing comments on our results and accomplishments in the quarter, provide a little more background to the transaction we announced last Friday with Norbord, discuss the promotion of Brad Southern to Chief Operating Officer and give you my views on the outlook for the rest of this year and into 2017. I know Sallie just went through our financial results in detail, but I do want to talk about a few items because it feels so good. 
Total sales in Q3 were 28% higher than Q3 of last year and produced net income of $66 million or EPS of $0.45. For the fourth consecutive quarter, all of our business segments recorded positive EBITDA, and that totaled $111 million for the company in Q3. In Siding, our big growth business, our revenue grew 23% versus the same quarter of last year and adjusted EBITDA was at $42 million. On a year-to-date basis, our sales were up 18%, net income is $108 million and adjusted EBITDA, as Sallie said, was $262 million. 
Let me discuss the mill swap with Norbord. As I did mention last quarter, we continue to explore options to building a greenfield mill in Minnesota as the foundation for our next siding expansion. Last Friday, both LP and Norbord issued press releases that described the mill swap between our 2 companies. Let me explain the rationale from LP's perspective and our preliminary plans going forward. 
LP's Chambord mill has been indefinitely curtailed since 2008, the beginning of the downturn. Norbord's Val-d'Or mill has been curtailed since 2012. While curtailed, both mills had a skeleton crew, who maintained the equipment in the shortest time necessary for a future startup. When assessing the facilities as potential siding mills, we had earlier determined that Chambord did not have ready access to the right wood species, aspen, to make a quality siding product. However, Val-d'Or is an area where there is an abundance of aspen. 
A complicating factor for both companies as we think about restarting these mills is the actions taken by the Québec government in the last 2 years to terminate the wood licenses for both mills due to a lack of cutting activity. A first priority for us is to work with the Québec government to obtain an appropriate wood allocation to run the Val-d'Or facility. To that end, I have had initial conversations with the chiefs of staff in both the premier's and the forestry minister's offices in Québec. 
As I said in the last call, the timing for additional siding capacity is near the end of 2018. For a new mill, the permitting, construction and start-up period is likely to be 24 to 30 months. With an existing mill, we believe that the conversion can take place in less than half that time. Upon closing later this week, we will immediately begin the engineering assessment to determine the cost and timing of such a project. 
In addition to the swap of Chambord for Val-d'Or, we also acquired a former Ainsworth OSB site located in Cook, Minnesota during the last quarter. This will allow us, again, to further expand siding at the appropriate time. I'm very pleased with this result, and this will allow us to continue to work with the very supportive Minnesota elected officials in the IRRRB that -- to redirect the incentives to a size that we believe is better suited from a site development infrastructure perspective than the proposed Hoyt Lakes site. 
Last Thursday, I did speak to Governor Dayton, Senator Bakk, House Speaker Daudt and U.S. Representative Nolan, and they all pledged their support for this future project. We have not yet finalized the accounting implication of this transaction as we are waiting on third-party appraisals of the assets involved. However, we do not believe this will be material. More to come as we make progress with our discussions with the Québec government regarding the wood allocation, reengage with Minnesota officials on the incentives, and begin the engineering assessment at both Val-d'Or and the Cook, Minnesota sites. 
Last Friday, our Board of Directors did elect Brad Southern to a newly created position of Chief Operating Officer. Many of you have met Brad as he's been a regular participant at investor conferences and also was at the Analyst Day we hosted last year in Two Harbors. Brad joined LP in 1999 as the Controller of our Specialty business. Over the next few years, he moved into increasingly complex operating roles. In 2004, Brad became the General Manager of the Siding business. In that role, he was the primary architect of the segment strategy that we've put in place during the housing downturn to focus on repair, remodeling, nonresidential structures and retail, in addition to new home construction. In March of 2015, Brad took over the OSB business and has been instrumental in improving our operating performance and logistics. By the way, along the way, Brad was also the executive sponsor of our successful SAP implementation in 2013. 
In this new role, Brad will maintain direct responsibility for the OSB business and will have the general managers of Siding and EWP report to him, along with our senior VP of sales and marketing and the VP of manufacturing services. Brad will remain the Chairman of the Board of our LP South America operation. 
The elevation of Brad to this new role is part of an ongoing succession planning process that our board has had in place for many years. You may recall that I moved from CFO to COO about 5 years ago. I am not retiring anytime soon, and I also will not speculate on when that time might come. As the LP board has done in the past, we are making sure that we have qualified internal successors to assume leadership in all of our key roles when the time comes. I'm very pleased to have Brad in this position as his experience will be invaluable as we continue to take advantage of an improving housing market. 
Let me talk about the housing market. Q3 housing starts were basically flat for both Q2 of this year and to Q3 of last year. However, the mix between multifamily and single family moved in our favor, with single family growing at 8% while multi-family declined slightly. Also, as permits are a leading indicator, we are pleased to see an increase of over 6% to 1.23 million in the September results. With 1 quarter to go, the consensus for 2016 housing starts now stands at 1.174, a relatively slight 6% increase from last year. For next year, the current consensus is 1.272, an 8% increase over this year's forecast. 
There have been some other positive housing-related data released recently. New home sales, August is the last reported period, were up 20.5% compared to August of 2015. Existing inventory of single-family homes fell to 2.04 million, 10% below August of last year. 
On the financing side, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rates were largely unchanged compared to last quarter at 3.47% for the week ended October 14. Retail sales for building materials, garden equipment and supply dealers were about 1.5% higher than Q2. 
In Canada, third quarter starts were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of a little over 200,000, about a 1% increase from the second quarter and down about 5.5% from Q3 of last year. As I mentioned, the current forecast for 2016 shows 6% growth in housing starts, almost all of this from single family. For 2017, we should see demand for housing continue to increase, driven primarily by increased household formations and wage growth. However, because of numerous constraints, labor, adequate lots, regulatory costs and timing, I think that the growth rate in housing will once again be between 5% and 10%. We will likely see a trend towards starter homes as the first-time homebuyer appears to be coming back. 
I recently attended the Policy Advisory Board meeting of the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies. Among other presentations at the meeting, they did provide their forecast for household formations for the next 20 years based on demographics and, immigration, and their forecast of future home ownership rates. For household formation, this group is forecasting 13.6 million net new households in the period 2015 through 2025 and 12.4 million net new households in the next 10-year period. Coupled with household removals due to demolition, catastrophe or conversion plus second home, this is good news for the housing industry. 
On homeownership, they concluded they could go up or down from the current 62%. The low end of the range was 61%, and their high end was 64.5%. Also at the meeting, the Harvard group reaffirmed their forecast that growth in repair, remodeling expenditures should continue at about 4% for the next several years. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Sallie for questions."

But the number is probably going to be somewhere $275,000 to $300,000 for base OSB, and then you're going to have the same conversion cost to turn it into Siding."

One, I'd just remind you on the margins. Because we looked at the competitive margins between us and Boise and Weyerhaeuser who just reported, and our margins for our manufactured products are pretty much right on top of theirs. The difficulty you get is Weyerhaeuser looks like they're reporting it coming out of distribution not as a pure manufacturing play. But the reminder is, the JV, we sell 100% of the product but we only get half of the margin out of that. And then whatever we sell from Murphy Plywood into the West and into export markets, we only get a sales margin on that. So when you look at -- and we don't have the outset base, so we'd have spent the capital but our margins look lower. The good news in Q3 is that what's been a drag on this business for some period of time is when we converted the Houlton mill into Laminated Strand Lumber, and we had the best volumes in Laminated Strand Lumber in the third quarter than we've ever had. And actually, that mill was EBITDA positive for the first time, I think, ever since -- well, since we've converted it. So we have good momentum on the LSL side. That will continue. And then the second thing I would say is we did have the Forest Economic advisory guys in here, and they continue to say that we're going to see a shortage of LVL as the housing starts get towards 1.4 million, which leads us to believe that, that's probably a business that we ought to continue to hold on to, to take advantage of the market when it does come back. That is a market that is heavily tied to single-family new construction. And as that becomes a greater part of the housing starts or actually happening, plus housing starts grow, we think that we will get that business back into the profitable region that we had -- we enjoyed in 2003 and 2004."

One, I was a little bit surprised by the strength of West Fraser and Canfor's earnings. And I think a lot of that is they shipped one hell of a lot of lumber into the U.S. and benefited from the low Canadian currency and shipped that lumber into the U.S. And if we do have trade duties in the 25% to 30% level that will go in place next year, that will probably limit the amount that comes from Canada. So I think that was an impact that we saw on Q3 because their earnings were very good. As far as the impacts on engineered wood, I still believe, if you add 30% to the cost of Canadian lumber, that we should have some benefit in I-Joist and LVL. But we didn't see anything in the third quarter. We're not anticipating for those duties actually being collected until probably early in the second quarter of next year."

So as long as we have that manufacturing arrangement, again, I don't get too concerned about veneer availability on the West Coast. The one facility we would have a risk from a veneer standpoint is in Wilmington, North Carolina. But we've had long-term supply agreements with a number of plywood producers there.

Thank you for joining our conference call today to discuss LP's financial results for the third quarter of 2016. I am Sallie Bailey, LP's Chief Financial Officer. And with me today are Curt Stevens, LP's Chief Executive Officer; Brad Southern, LP's new Chief Operating Officer; as well as Mike Kinney and Becky Barckley, our primary Investor Relations contacts.
I'll begin the discussion with a review of the financial results for the third quarter of 2016. This will be followed by some comments on the performance of the individual segments and selected balance sheet items. After I finish my remarks, Curt will discuss the general market environment in which LP has been operating, update you on his current thoughts on Siding expansion plans and the recently announced organizational change as well as give some thoughts on the outlook.
As we've done in the past, we've opened up this call to the public and we are doing a webcast. That webcast can be accessed at www.lpcorp.com. 
Additionally, to help with the discussion, we've provided in a presentation with supplemental information that should be reviewed in conjunction with the earnings release. I will be referencing these slides in my comments this morning. We filed an 8-K this morning with some supplemental information as well as our 10-Q. 
I want to remind all the participants about the forward-looking statements comment on Slide 2 of the presentation. Please also be aware of the discussion of our use of non-GAAP financial information included on Slide 3 of the presentation. The appendix attached to the presentation has some of the necessary reconciliations that have been supplemented by the Form 8-K filing we made this morning. Rather than reading these 2 statements, I incorporate them with this reference.
We are reporting $111 million of adjusted EBITDA on just under $600 million of sales for the third quarter of 2016. The last time that LP reported adjusted EBITDA of over $100 million was the second quarter of 2013. Now in the last 12 quarters, LP's earnings profile has changed as we've grown our Siding segment. For the third quarter of 2016, Siding's percent of sales increased to 33% and the percent of adjusted EBITDA increased to over 30%. We do expect the percentage of sales and earnings from the Siding segment to continue to increase as a percent of the total as the Siding segment continues to grow. 
Now with that, let me go into the details. Moving to Slide 4 of the presentation for a discussion of the third quarter and first 9 months of 2016 consolidated financial results. We are reporting net sales of $596 million for the third quarter of 2016, a 28% increase from the net sales of $465 million reported in the third quarter of 2015. In the third quarter, we recorded net income of $66 million or $0.45 per diluted share compared to a net loss of $27 million or $0.19 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2015. 
In the third quarter, we reported income tax benefit of $7.5 million. This benefit is primarily due to the recognition of research tax credits for the years 2003 to 2015 and the reversal of certain state and local tax valuation allowances. Excluding the impact of the research tax credit and the reversal of the state and local tax valuation allowances established in the second quarter, the company's annual GAAP tax rate for the third quarter would have been approximately 20%.
The adjusted income from continuing operations for the quarter was $47 million or $0.32 per diluted share based upon a normalized tax rate of 35% as compared to a loss of $16 million or a loss of $0.12 per share reported in the third quarter of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $111 million in the quarter compared to $11 million in the third quarter of 2015.
In the first 9 months of 2016, we recorded net income of $108 million or $0.74 per diluted share on $1.7 billion in sales compared to a net loss for the first 9 months of 2015 of $81 million or a loss per diluted share of $0.57 on $1.4 billion in sales. The adjusted income for the 9-month period was $97 million or $0.67 per diluted share based upon the normalized tax rate of 35% compared to a loss of $47 million or a loss of $0.33 per diluted share for the first 9 months of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $262 million for the 9-month period in 2016 as compared to $33 million in the first 9 months of 2015.
Moving on to Slide 5 and a review of our segment results. Beginning with OSB. OSB reported net sales for the third quarter of 2016 of $282 million, up 41% from $200 million reported in the third quarter of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $83 million compared to $4 million reported in the third quarter of 2015. Sales volumes were up 5%. Sales pricing was higher by 36%, which improved operating results by $75 million. Reduction in raw material costs and higher utilization rates also improved the third quarter 2016 results as compared to the third quarter of 2015. 
For the first 9 months of 2016, OSB reported sales of $752 million compared to $601 million of sales in the first 9 months of 2015. For the first 9 months, OSB reported adjusted EBITDA of $172 million as compared to negative adjusted EBITDA of $13 million in the first 9 months of 2015. Sales volumes were lower by 1%, and sales prices were higher by 27%. The impact of the higher sales price on OSB operations was $161 million in the first 9 months of 2016 compared to the same period in the last year. Reduction in raw material costs, higher utilization rates as well as a positive impact of the Canadian currencies on expenses incurred by our Canadian operations also improved the 9-month 2016 results as compared to the first 9 months of 2015. 
Slide 6 reports the results of the Siding business. This segment includes our SmartSide and CanExel siding products as well as minor amounts of OSB. Siding reported net sales for the third quarter of 2016 of $195 million, up 23% from $158 million in the third quarter of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $42 million compared to $22 million in the third quarter of 2015. SmartSide volume was up 25% from the prior year. SmartSide -- sales prices in SmartSide were up 1%, primarily due to changes in product mix, with individual prices remaining relatively flat. 
The Siding segment reported sales of $583 million in the first 9 months of 2016, an increase of 18% from $495 million reported in the first 9 months of 2015. Siding segment reported adjusted EBITDA of $125 million as compared to $95 million in the same period of 2015. SmartSide sales volumes were up 15% for the first 9 months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, with sales prices down 1% for SmartSide. 
Please turn to Slide 7 of the presentation, which shows the results of our Engineered Wood Products segment. This segment includes I-Joist, Laminated Strand Lumber, Laminated Veneer Lumber, OSB produced at our Houlton, Maine facility plus other related products. This segment also includes the sale of I-Joist and LVL products produced by the Abitibi joint venture or under a sales arrangement with Murphy Plywood. The Engineered Wood Products segment recorded sales of $81 million in the third quarter of 2016, up from $74 million in the third quarter of 2015. For the third quarter of 2016, adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations improved by $1 million as compared to the third quarter of 2015. Volumes of I-Joist were up 1% while volumes of LVL and LSL were up 9% compared to the same quarter of last year. Pricing increased 2% in LVL, LSL and I-Joist. For the first 9 months, sales were $231 million, up from $211 million in 2015. And adjusted EBITDA improved to $9 million from $3 million in the first 9 months of 2015. 
Moving on to Slide 8 of the presentation. For the quarter, our South American segment recorded sales of $32 million as compared to $27 million in the third quarter of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA of $6 million was higher by $2 million as compared to the third quarter of 2015. Volumes in Chile were down 3% and down 9% in Brazil compared to the same quarter of last year. On a U.S. dollar basis, pricing was up 13% in Chile and up 10% in Brazil. In local currency, Chile's pricing was up 10% compared with the same quarter in 2015 and Brazil's pricing was flat. 
For the first 9 months, our South American segment recorded sales of $103 million as compared to $101 million in the first 9 months of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA for the first 9 months of 2016 increased to $22 million from $13 million in the same period in 2015.
Total selling, general and administrative costs were $47 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared to $38 million in the same quarter of 2015. For the 9-month period, our selling, general and administrative costs are $136 million for 2016 compared to $115 million for the first 9 months of 2015. For both the quarter and 9-month period, the increase on these costs was primarily due to increases in certain management incentive and higher costs associated with sales and marketing.
Turning to the balance sheet. We announced 2 transactions in the third quarter which impacted our balance sheet. During the quarter, we refinanced our $350 million senior unsecured notes with an interest rate of 7.5% due 2020 with new senior unsecured notes which carry a 4 7/8% interest rate and will mature in 2024. This transaction will decrease our annual interest expense by approximately $9 million on an annual basis. 
We also announced during the quarter that we have entered into agreements to provide for the acceleration of $410 million of notes receivable from asset sales. At the same time, we gave binding notice to pay off the $369 million of related notes payable. This transaction will be completed tomorrow. As a result of the transaction, LP will accelerate the receipt of $41 million of cash. This will also accelerate the income taxes of $121 million associated with the gain on the sale of the timber in 2003. We anticipate offsetting much of the accelerated income tax with available carryover benefits. 
Please turn to Slide 9 of the presentation. As of September 30, 2016, we had cash, cash equivalents, investments and restricted cash of $673 million including the cash held for bond redemption or $580 million excluding that cash held for the bond redemption; working capital of $793 million; net cash of $225 million. In addition to the $580 million of cash on our balance sheet, we have $200 million of availability on our credit facility. 
We are projecting that capital expenditures for 2016 will be in the $115 million to $125 million range. For 2017, we are planning on spending approximately $140 million of capital. This estimate includes $40 million for our South American operations but does not include any capital to convert or build a new siding mill. 
We also anticipate beginning to pay cash taxes in the U.S. in 2017. The U.S. represents approximately 70% to 75% of our net income -- of our income before taxes. We don't anticipate paying cash taxes in Canada due to net operating loss carryovers. The benefit amount of our available Canadian net operating losses was $64 million at the end of 2015. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Curt."

Before I begin my remarks, I do want to acknowledge the passing last week of Harry Merlo, LP's first and longest-serving Chief Executive Officer. While Harry was often a controversial leader, there is no doubt that he was instrumental in introducing OSB to the world and promoting the vision of OSB-based siding. 
I will start with our safety performance. Through the first 9 months of this year, our total incident rate or TIR was at 0.39, and this was also the rolling 12-month TIR. We are on track for our second-best safety year ever. One recent highlight, our Panguipulli mill in Chile, last week, achieved 1.5 million hours without a recordable injury, a remarkable achievement. The safety of our employees is LP's core value, and I continue to be extremely proud of all of our employees who support this view and act accordingly. 
Today, I'll be providing comments on our results and accomplishments in the quarter, provide a little more background to the transaction we announced last Friday with Norbord, discuss the promotion of Brad Southern to Chief Operating Officer and give you my views on the outlook for the rest of this year and into 2017. I know Sallie just went through our financial results in detail, but I do want to talk about a few items because it feels so good. 
Total sales in Q3 were 28% higher than Q3 of last year and produced net income of $66 million or EPS of $0.45. For the fourth consecutive quarter, all of our business segments recorded positive EBITDA, and that totaled $111 million for the company in Q3. In Siding, our big growth business, our revenue grew 23% versus the same quarter of last year and adjusted EBITDA was at $42 million. On a year-to-date basis, our sales are up 18%, net income is $108 million and adjusted EBITDA, as Sallie said, was $262 million. 
Let me discuss the mill swap with Norbord. As I did mention last quarter, we continue to explore options to building a greenfield mill in Minnesota as the foundation for our next siding expansion. Last Friday, both LP and Norbord issued press releases that described the mill swap between our 2 companies. Let me explain the rationale from LP's perspective and our preliminary plans going forward. 
LP's Chambord mill has been indefinitely curtailed since 2008, the beginning of the downturn. Norbord's Val-d'Or mill has been curtailed since 2012. While curtailed, both mills had a skeleton crew, who maintained the equipment to shorten the time necessary for a future startup. When assessing the facilities as potential siding mills, we had earlier determined that Chambord did not have ready access to the right wood species, aspen, to make a quality siding product. However, Val-d'Or is an area where there is an abundance of aspen. 
A complicating factor for both companies as we think about restarting these mills is the actions taken by the Québec government in the last 2 years to terminate the wood licenses for both mills due to a lack of cutting activity. A first priority for us is to work with the Québec government to obtain an appropriate wood allocation to run the Val-d'Or facility. To that end, I have had initial conversations with the chiefs of staff in both the Premier's and the Forestry Minister's offices in Québec. 
As I said in the last call, the timing for additional siding capacity is near the end of 2018. For a new mill, the permitting, construction and start-up period is likely to be 24 to 30 months. With an existing mill, we believe that the conversion can take place in less than half that time. Upon closing later this week, we will immediately begin the engineering assessment to determine the cost and timing of such a project. 
In addition to the swap of Chambord for Val-d'Or, we also acquired a former Ainsworth OSB site located in Cook, Minnesota during the last quarter. This will allow us, again, to further expand siding at the appropriate time. I'm very pleased with this result, and this will allow us to continue to work with the very supportive Minnesota elected officials in the IRRRB that -- to redirect the incentives to a site that we believe is better suited from a site development infrastructure perspective than the proposed Hoyt Lakes site. 
Last Thursday, I did speak to Governor Dayton, Senator Bakk, House Speaker Daudt and U.S. Representative Nolan, and they all pledged their support for this future project. We have not yet finalized the accounting implication of this transaction as we are waiting on third-party appraisals of the assets involved. However, we do not believe this will be material. More to come as we make progress with our discussions with the Québec government regarding the wood allocation, reengage with Minnesota officials on the incentives, and begin the engineering assessment at both Val-d'Or and the Cook, Minnesota sites. 
Last Friday, our Board of Directors did elect Brad Southern to a newly created position of Chief Operating Officer. Many of you have met Brad as he's been a regular participant at investor conferences and also was at the Analyst Day we hosted last year in Two Harbors. Brad joined LP in 1999 as the Controller of our Specialty business. Over the next few years, he moved into increasingly complex operating roles. In 2004, Brad became the General Manager of the Siding business. In that role, he was the primary architect of the segment strategy that we've put in place during the housing downturn to focus on repair, remodeling, nonresidential structures and retail, in addition to the new home construction. In March of 2015, Brad took over the OSB business and has been instrumental in improving our operating performance and logistics. By the way, along the way, Brad was also the executive sponsor of our successful SAP implementation in 2013. 
In this new role, Brad will maintain direct responsibility for the OSB business and will have the general managers of Siding and EWP report to him, along with our senior VP of sales and marketing and the VP of manufacturing services. Brad will remain the Chairman of the Board of our LP South America operation. 
The elevation of Brad to this new role is part of an ongoing succession planning process that our board has had in place for many years. You may recall that I moved from CFO to COO about 5 years ago. I am not retiring anytime soon, and I also will not speculate on when that time might come. As the LP board has done in the past, we are making sure that we have qualified internal successors to assume leadership in all of our key roles when the time comes. I'm very pleased to have Brad in this position as his experience will be invaluable as we continue to take advantage of an improving housing market. 
Let me talk about the housing market. Q3 housing starts were basically flat for both Q2 of this year and to Q3 of last year. However, the mix between multifamily and single family moved in our favor, with single family growing at 8% while multi-family declined slightly. Also, as permits are a leading indicator, we were pleased to see an increase of over 6% to 1.23 million in the September results. With 1 quarter to go, the consensus for 2016 housing starts now stands at 1.174, a relatively slight 6% increase from last year. For next year, the current consensus is 1.272, an 8% increase over this year's forecast. 
There have been some other positive housing-related data released recently. New home sales, August is the last reported period, were up 20.5% compared to August of 2015. Existing inventory of single-family homes fell to 2.04 million, 10% below August of last year. 
On the financing side, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rates were largely unchanged compared to last quarter at 3.47% for the week ended October 14. Retail sales for building materials, garden equipment and supply dealers were about 1.5% higher than Q2. 
In Canada, third quarter starts were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of a little over 200,000, about a 1% increase from the second quarter and down about 5.5% from Q3 of last year. As I mentioned, the current forecast for 2016 shows 6% growth in housing starts, almost all of this from single family. For 2017, we should see demand for housing continue to increase, driven primarily by increased household formations and wage growth. However, because of numerous constraints, labor, adequate lots, regulatory costs and timing, I think that the growth rate in housing will once again be between 5% and 10%. We will likely see a trend towards starter homes as the first-time homebuyer appears to be coming back. 
I recently attended the Policy Advisory Board meeting of the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies. Among other presentations at the meeting, they did provide their forecast for household formations for the next 20 years based on demographics and immigration, and their forecast of future home ownership rates. For household formation, this group is forecasting 13.6 million net new households in the period 2015 through 2025 and 12.4 million net new households in the next 10-year period. Coupled with household removals due to demolition, catastrophe or conversion plus second home, this is good news for the housing industry. 
On homeownership, they concluded they could go up or down from the current 62%. The low end of the range was 61%, and their high end was 64.5%. Also at the meeting, the Harvard group reaffirmed their forecast that growth in repair, remodeling expenditures should continue at about 4% for the next several years. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Sallie for questions."

One, I'd just remind you on the margins. Because we looked at the competitive margins between us and Boise and Weyerhaeuser who just reported, and our margins for our manufactured products are pretty much right on top of theirs. The difficulty you get is Weyerhaeuser looks like they're reporting it coming out of distribution not as a pure manufacturing play. But the reminder is, the JV, we sell 100% of the product but we only get half of the margin out of that. And then whatever we sell from Murphy Plywood into the West and into export markets, we only get a sales margin on that. So when you look at it, we don't have the outset base, so we'd have spent the capital but our margins look lower. The good news in Q3 is that what's been a drag on this business for some period of time is when we converted the Houlton mill into Laminated Strand Lumber, and we had the best volumes in Laminated Strand Lumber in the third quarter that we've ever had. And actually, that mill was EBITDA positive for the first time, I think, ever since -- well, since we've converted it. So we have good momentum on the LSL side. That will continue. And then the second thing I would say is we did have the Forest Economic advisory guys in here, and they continue to say that we're going to see a shortage of LVL as the housing starts get towards 1.4 million, which leads us to believe that, that's probably a business that we ought to continue to hold on to, to take advantage of the market when it does come back. That is a market that is heavily tied to single-family new construction. And as that becomes a greater part -- or the housing starts are actually happening, plus housing starts grow, we think that we will get that business back into the profitable region that we had -- we enjoyed in 2003 and 2004."

I think a couple of things I would say is that the market is -- was so tight from a demand capacity that any anomaly that happened in the market would drive pricing up, then it would kind of drift back down, then we'd have another event and it would drive pricing back up. And that's kind of what we saw. I've been actually encouraged that October hasn't come off much because, historically, you would see pricing coming off on the fourth quarter.

So I think that was an impact that we saw on Q3 because their earnings were very good.

It's really -- the intention is to make that as siding facility. But one of the things you heard me say is I don't mind being early with siding capacity because I can run OSB until the siding fills it out. So as an example, when we start up Swan Valley, we're running that as a siding mill, but we converted one of the lines at Hayward back to OSB. And so that's -- every month, there's -- we're making less and less OSB as we make more siding. And that's exactly what we would probably do at both Val-d'Or during the conversion and at a additional mill in Cook."

As far as where we're seeing growth, home centers were relatively flat. With this -- with the import supply wood coming in from Chile and Brazil, we did see some aggressive pricing on T1-11 siding in the boxes, which, I think, probably hurt our panel siding a little bit.

Thank you for joining our conference call today to discuss LP's financial results for the third quarter of 2016. I am Sallie Bailey, LP's Chief Financial Officer. And with me today are Curt Stevens, LP's Chief Executive Officer; Brad Southern, LP's new Chief Operating Officer; as well as Mike Kinney and Becky Barckley, our primary Investor Relations contacts.
I'll begin the discussion with a review of the financial results for the third quarter of 2016. This will be followed by some comments on the performance of the individual segments and selected balance sheet items. After I finish my remarks, Curt will discuss the general market environment in which LP has been operating, update you on his current thoughts on Siding expansion plans and the recently announced organizational change as well as give some thoughts on the outlook.
As we've done in the past, we've opened up this call to the public and we are doing a webcast. That webcast can be accessed at www.lpcorp.com. 
Additionally, to help with the discussion, we've provided in a presentation with supplemental information that should be reviewed in conjunction with the earnings release. I will be referencing these slides in my comments this morning. We filed an 8-K this morning with some supplemental information as well as our 10-Q. 
I want to remind all the participants about the forward-looking statements comment on Slide 2 of the presentation. Please also be aware of the discussion of our use of non-GAAP financial information included on Slide 3 of the presentation. The appendix attached to the presentation has some of the necessary reconciliations that have been supplemented by the Form 8-K filing we made this morning. Rather than reading these 2 statements, I incorporate them with this reference.
We are reporting $111 million of adjusted EBITDA on just under $600 million of sales for the third quarter of 2016. The last time that LP reported adjusted EBITDA of over $100 million was the second quarter of 2013. Now in the last 12 quarters, LP's earnings profile has changed as we've grown our Siding segment. For the third quarter of 2016, Siding's percent of sales increased to 33% and the percent of adjusted EBITDA increased to over 30%. We do expect the percentage of sales and earnings from the Siding segment to continue to increase as a percent of the total as the Siding segment continues to grow. 
Now with that, let me go into the details. Moving to Slide 4 of the presentation for a discussion of the third quarter and first 9 months of 2016 consolidated financial results. We are reporting net sales of $596 million for the third quarter of 2016, a 28% increase from the net sales of $465 million reported in the third quarter of 2015. In the third quarter, we recorded net income of $66 million or $0.45 per diluted share compared to a net loss of $27 million or $0.19 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2015. 
In the third quarter, we reported income tax benefit of $7.5 million. This benefit is primarily due to the recognition of research tax credits for the years 2003 to 2015 and the reversal of certain state and local tax valuation allowances. Excluding the impact of the research tax credit and the reversal of the state and local tax valuation allowances established in the second quarter, the company's annual GAAP tax rate for the third quarter would have been approximately 20%.
The adjusted income from continuing operations for the quarter was $47 million or $0.32 per diluted share based upon a normalized tax rate of 35% as compared to a loss of $16 million or a loss of $0.12 per share reported in the third quarter of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $111 million in the quarter compared to $11 million in the third quarter of 2015.
In the first 9 months of 2016, we recorded net income of $108 million or $0.74 per diluted share on $1.7 billion in sales compared to a net loss for the first 9 months of 2015 of $81 million or a loss per diluted share of $0.57 on $1.4 billion in sales. The adjusted income for the 9-month period was $97 million or $0.67 per diluted share based upon the normalized tax rate of 35% compared to a loss of $47 million or a loss of $0.33 per diluted share for the first 9 months of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $262 million for the 9-month period in 2016 as compared to $33 million in the first 9 months of 2015.
Moving on to Slide 5 and a review of our segment results. Beginning with OSB. OSB reported net sales for the third quarter of 2016 of $282 million, up 41% from $200 million reported in the third quarter of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $83 million compared to $4 million reported in the third quarter of 2015. Sales volumes were up 5%. Sales pricing was higher by 36%, which improved operating results by $75 million. Reduction in raw material costs and higher utilization rates also improved the third quarter 2016 results as compared to the third quarter of 2015. 
For the first 9 months of 2016, OSB reported sales of $752 million compared to $601 million of sales in the first 9 months of 2015. For the first 9 months, OSB reported adjusted EBITDA of $172 million as compared to negative adjusted EBITDA of $13 million in the first 9 months of 2015. Sales volumes were lower by 1%, and sales prices were higher by 27%. The impact of the higher sales price on OSB operations was $161 million in the first 9 months of 2016 compared to the same period in the last year. Reduction in raw material costs, higher utilization rates as well as a positive impact of the Canadian currencies on expenses incurred by our Canadian operations also improved the 9-month 2016 results as compared to the first 9 months of 2015. 
Slide 6 reports the results of the Siding business. This segment includes our SmartSide and CanExel siding products as well as minor amounts of OSB. Siding reported net sales for the third quarter of 2016 of $195 million, up 23% from $158 million in the third quarter of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $42 million compared to $22 million in the third quarter of 2015. SmartSide volume was up 25% from the prior year. SmartSide -- sales prices in SmartSide were up 1%, primarily due to changes in product mix, with individual prices remaining relatively flat. 
The Siding segment reported sales of $583 million in the first 9 months of 2016, an increase of 18% from $495 million reported in the first 9 months of 2015. Siding segment reported adjusted EBITDA of $125 million as compared to $95 million in the same period of 2015. SmartSide sales volumes were up 15% for the first 9 months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, with sales prices down 1% for SmartSide. 
Please turn to Slide 7 of the presentation, which shows the results of our Engineered Wood Products segment. This segment includes I-Joist, Laminated Strand Lumber, Laminated Veneer Lumber, OSB produced at our Houlton, Maine facility plus other related products. This segment also includes the sale of I-Joist and LVL products produced by the Abitibi joint venture or under a sales arrangement with Murphy Plywood. The Engineered Wood Products segment recorded sales of $81 million in the third quarter of 2016, up from $74 million in the third quarter of 2015. For the third quarter of 2016, adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations improved by $1 million as compared to the third quarter of 2015. Volumes of I-Joist were up 1% while volumes of LVL and LSL were up 9% compared to the same quarter of last year. Pricing increased 2% in LVL, LSL and I-Joist. For the first 9 months, sales were $231 million, up from $211 million in 2015. And adjusted EBITDA improved to $9 million from $3 million in the first 9 months of 2015. 
Moving on to Slide 8 of the presentation. For the quarter, our South American segment recorded sales of $32 million as compared to $27 million in the third quarter of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA of $6 million was higher by $2 million as compared to the third quarter of 2015. Volumes in Chile were down 3% and down 9% in Brazil compared to the same quarter of last year. On a U.S. dollar basis, pricing was up 13% in Chile and up 10% in Brazil. In local currency, Chile's pricing was up 10% compared with the same quarter in 2015 and Brazil's pricing was flat. 
For the first 9 months, our South American segment recorded sales of $103 million as compared to $101 million in the first 9 months of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA for the first 9 months of 2016 increased to $22 million from $13 million in the same period in 2015.
Total selling, general and administrative costs were $47 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared to $38 million in the same quarter of 2015. For the 9-month period, our selling, general and administrative costs are $136 million for 2016 compared to $115 million for the first 9 months of 2015. For both the quarter and 9-month period, the increase on these costs was primarily due to increases in certain management incentive and higher costs associated with sales and marketing.
Turning to the balance sheet. We announced 2 transactions in the third quarter which impacted our balance sheet. During the quarter, we refinanced our $350 million senior unsecured notes with an interest rate of 7.5% due 2020 with new senior unsecured notes which carry a 4 7/8% interest rate and will mature in 2024. This transaction will decrease our annual interest expense by approximately $9 million on an annual basis. 
We also announced during the quarter that we have entered into agreements to provide for the acceleration of $410 million of notes receivable from asset sales. At the same time, we gave binding notice to pay off the $369 million of related notes payable. This transaction will be completed tomorrow. As a result of the transaction, LP will accelerate the receipt of $41 million of cash. This will also accelerate the income taxes of $121 million associated with the gain on the sale of the timber in 2003. We anticipate offsetting much of the accelerated income tax with available carryover benefits. 
Please turn to Slide 9 of the presentation. As of September 30, 2016, we had cash, cash equivalents, investments and restricted cash of $673 million including the cash held for bond redemption or $580 million excluding that cash held for the bond redemption; working capital of $793 million; net cash of $225 million. In addition to the $580 million of cash on our balance sheet, we have $200 million of availability on our credit facility. 
We are projecting that capital expenditures for 2016 will be in the $115 million to $125 million range. For 2017, we are planning on spending approximately $140 million of capital. This estimate includes $40 million for our South American operations but does not include any capital to convert or build a new siding mill. 
We also anticipate beginning to pay cash taxes in the U.S. in 2017. The U.S. represents approximately 70% to 75% of our net income -- of our income before taxes. We don't anticipate paying cash taxes in Canada due to net operating loss carryovers. The benefit amount of our available Canadian net operating losses was $64 million at the end of 2015. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Curt."

Before I begin my remarks, I do want to acknowledge the passing last week of Harry Merlo, LP's first and longest-serving Chief Executive Officer. While Harry was often a controversial leader, there is no doubt that he was instrumental in introducing OSB to the world and promoting the vision of OSB-based siding. 
I will start with our safety performance. Through the first 9 months of this year, our total incident rate or TIR was at 0.39, and this was also the rolling 12-month TIR. We are on track for our second-best safety year ever. One recent highlight, our Panguipulli mill in Chile, last week, achieved 1.5 million hours without a recordable injury, a remarkable achievement. The safety of our employees is LP's core value, and I continue to be extremely proud of all of our employees who support this view and act accordingly. 
Today, I'll be providing comments on our results and accomplishments in the quarter, provide a little more background to the transaction we announced last Friday with Norbord, discuss the promotion of Brad Southern to Chief Operating Officer and give you my views on the outlook for the rest of this year and into 2017. I know Sallie just went through our financial results in detail, but I do want to talk about a few items because it feels so good. 
Total sales in Q3 were 28% higher than Q3 of last year and produced net income of $66 million or EPS of $0.45. For the fourth consecutive quarter, all of our business segments recorded positive EBITDA, and that totaled $111 million for the company in Q3. In Siding, our big growth business, our revenue grew 23% versus the same quarter of last year and adjusted EBITDA was at $42 million. On a year-to-date basis, our sales are up 18%, net income is $108 million and adjusted EBITDA, as Sallie said, was $262 million. 
Let me discuss the mill swap with Norbord. As I did mention last quarter, we continue to explore options to building a greenfield mill in Minnesota as the foundation for our next siding expansion. Last Friday, both LP and Norbord issued press releases that described the mill swap between our 2 companies. Let me explain the rationale from LP's perspective and our preliminary plans going forward. 
LP's Chambord mill has been indefinitely curtailed since 2008, the beginning of the downturn. Norbord's Val-d'Or mill has been curtailed since 2012. While curtailed, both mills had a skeleton crew, who maintained the equipment to shorten the time necessary for a future startup. When assessing the facilities as potential siding mills, we had earlier determined that Chambord did not have ready access to the right wood species, aspen, to make a quality siding product. However, Val-d'Or is an area where there is an abundance of aspen. 
A complicating factor for both companies as we think about restarting these mills is the actions taken by the Québec government in the last 2 years to terminate the wood licenses for both mills due to a lack of cutting activity. A first priority for us is to work with the Québec government to obtain an appropriate wood allocation to run the Val-d'Or facility. To that end, I have had initial conversations with the chiefs of staff in both the Premier's and the Forestry Minister's offices in Québec. 
As I said in the last call, the timing for additional siding capacity is near the end of 2018. For a new mill, the permitting, construction and start-up period is likely to be 24 to 30 months. With an existing mill, we believe that the conversion can take place in less than half that time. Upon closing later this week, we will immediately begin the engineering assessment to determine the cost and timing of such a project. 
In addition to the swap of Chambord for Val-d'Or, we also acquired a former Ainsworth OSB site located in Cook, Minnesota during the last quarter. This will allow us, again, to further expand siding at the appropriate time. I'm very pleased with this result, and this will allow us to continue to work with the very supportive Minnesota elected officials in the IRRRB that -- to redirect the incentives to a site that we believe is better suited from a site development infrastructure perspective than the proposed Hoyt Lakes site. 
Last Thursday, I did speak to Governor Dayton, Senator Bakk, House Speaker Daudt and U.S. Representative Nolan, and they all pledged their support for this future project. We have not yet finalized the accounting implication of this transaction as we are waiting on third-party appraisals of the assets involved. However, we do not believe this will be material. More to come as we make progress with our discussions with the Québec government regarding the wood allocation, reengage with Minnesota officials on the incentives, and begin the engineering assessment at both Val-d'Or and the Cook, Minnesota sites. 
Last Friday, our Board of Directors did elect Brad Southern to a newly created position of Chief Operating Officer. Many of you have met Brad as he's been a regular participant at investor conferences and also was at the Analyst Day we hosted last year in Two Harbors. Brad joined LP in 1999 as the Controller of our Specialty business. Over the next few years, he moved into increasingly complex operating roles. In 2004, Brad became the General Manager of the Siding business. In that role, he was the primary architect of the segment strategy that we've put in place during the housing downturn to focus on repair, remodeling, nonresidential structures and retail, in addition to the new home construction. In March of 2015, Brad took over the OSB business and has been instrumental in improving our operating performance and logistics. By the way, along the way, Brad was also the executive sponsor of our successful SAP implementation in 2013. 
In this new role, Brad will maintain direct responsibility for the OSB business and will have the general managers of Siding and EWP report to him, along with our senior VP of sales and marketing and the VP of manufacturing services. Brad will remain the Chairman of the Board of our LP South America operation. 
The elevation of Brad to this new role is part of an ongoing succession planning process that our board has had in place for many years. You may recall that I moved from CFO to COO about 5 years ago. I am not retiring anytime soon, and I also will not speculate on when that time might come. As the LP board has done in the past, we are making sure that we have qualified internal successors to assume leadership in all of our key roles when the time comes. I'm very pleased to have Brad in this position as his experience will be invaluable as we continue to take advantage of an improving housing market. 
Let me talk about the housing market. Q3 housing starts were basically flat for both Q2 of this year and to Q3 of last year. However, the mix between multifamily and single family moved in our favor, with single family growing at 8% while multi-family declined slightly. Also, as permits are a leading indicator, we were pleased to see an increase of over 6% to 1.23 million in the September results. With 1 quarter to go, the consensus for 2016 housing starts now stands at 1.174, a relatively slight 6% increase from last year. For next year, the current consensus is 1.272, an 8% increase over this year's forecast. 
There have been some other positive housing-related data released recently. New home sales, August is the last reported period, were up 20.5% compared to August of 2015. Existing inventory of single-family homes fell to 2.04 million, 10% below August of last year. 
On the financing side, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rates were largely unchanged compared to last quarter at 3.47% for the week ended October 14. Retail sales for building materials, garden equipment and supply dealers were about 1.5% higher than Q2. 
In Canada, third quarter starts were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of a little over 200,000, about a 1% increase from the second quarter and down about 5.5% from Q3 of last year. As I mentioned, the current forecast for 2016 shows 6% growth in housing starts, almost all of this from single family. For 2017, we should see demand for housing continue to increase, driven primarily by increased household formations and wage growth. However, because of numerous constraints, labor, adequate lots, regulatory costs and timing, I think that the growth rate in housing will once again be between 5% and 10%. We will likely see a trend towards starter homes as the first-time homebuyer appears to be coming back. 
I recently attended the Policy Advisory Board meeting of the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies. Among other presentations at the meeting, they did provide their forecast for household formations for the next 20 years based on demographics and immigration, and their forecast of future home ownership rates. For household formation, this group is forecasting 13.6 million net new households in the period 2015 through 2025 and 12.4 million net new households in the next 10-year period. Coupled with household removals due to demolition, catastrophe or conversion plus second home, this is good news for the housing industry. 
On homeownership, they concluded they could go up or down from the current 62%. The low end of the range was 61%, and their high end was 64.5%. Also at the meeting, the Harvard group reaffirmed their forecast that growth in repair, remodeling expenditures should continue at about 4% for the next several years. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Sallie for questions."

But the number is probably going to be somewhere $275,000 to $300,000 for base OSB, and then you're going to have the same conversion cost to turn it into Siding."

One, I'd just remind you on the margins. Because we looked at the competitive margins between us and Boise and Weyerhaeuser who just reported, and our margins for our manufactured products are pretty much right on top of theirs. The difficulty you get is Weyerhaeuser looks like they're reporting it coming out of distribution not as a pure manufacturing play. But the reminder is, the JV, we sell 100% of the product but we only get half of the margin out of that. And then whatever we sell from Murphy Plywood into the West and into export markets, we only get a sales margin on that. So when you look at it, we don't have the outset base, so we'd have spent the capital but our margins look lower. The good news in Q3 is that what's been a drag on this business for some period of time is when we converted the Houlton mill into Laminated Strand Lumber, and we had the best volumes in Laminated Strand Lumber in the third quarter that we've ever had. And actually, that mill was EBITDA positive for the first time, I think, ever since -- well, since we've converted it. So we have good momentum on the LSL side. That will continue. And then the second thing I would say is we did have the Forest Economic advisory guys in here, and they continue to say that we're going to see a shortage of LVL as the housing starts get towards 1.4 million, which leads us to believe that, that's probably a business that we ought to continue to hold on to, to take advantage of the market when it does come back. That is a market that is heavily tied to single-family new construction. And as that becomes a greater part -- or the housing starts are actually happening, plus housing starts grow, we think that we will get that business back into the profitable region that we had -- we enjoyed in 2003 and 2004."

So as long as we have that manufacturing arrangement, again, I don't get too concerned about veneer availability on the West Coast.

So if you think we're going to have 80,000 housing starts, there's going to be demand of roughly 900 million square feet that we're going to need on top of that. And I haven't seen the industry numbers, but I've seen what Weyerhaeuser ran at, which they said ran at 102% of capacity in the third quarter. And I think Norbord was in the high 90s. We were in the low 90s. And now with this swap, we're going -- if you took Chambord out of that number, we'd be even a higher percentage. So I don't think there's a lot of available capacity to satisfy that increased 800 million to 900 million square feet of demand next year. So we will need some additional restarts or new mills. And as you know, the Martco mill is slated to start up some time the second half of next year. I don't think it will have a big impact on 2017, but it will on 2018. And then for us, we don't have anything to start unless we start Val-d'Or up as an OSB mill since Chambord is not in our portfolio any longer. And then our competitors, I did read the Norbord transcript, and I think their first priority is going to be the Huguley mill to satisfy demand in the Southeast, Southwest."
