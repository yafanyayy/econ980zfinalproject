We're making great progress on the operational initiatives that we launched last year.

We're making great progress on the operational initiatives that we launched last year. At a high level, the most important activity has really been simplifying our strategic focus, driving both portfolio optimization and clarity in terms of what's most important to the company, our partners and our customers. 
Our results for Q4 reflect the progress the team has made in absorbing and adjusting to these initiatives cost structure work, work and leadership evolution and changes to our field in general strategy. We'll continue to focus our energy towards our core strategy to secure delivery of apps and data, really setting the company up for even better results of efficiency and growth as we look forward. As you saw from the release today, total revenue was up 6% year-on-year in Q4 with product license up 5%. Adjusted operating margins jump to 32%, adjusted EPS was $1.66 share, up 50%, and we generated $282 million in cash flow from ops. In total, we closed 86 $1-million-plus transactions across products and services. The Americas region booked the majority of these with 60 and EMEA had 23. 
There's a couple of points that are worth noting in that the average value of these large deals increased significantly year-on-year in both the U.S. and EMEA. And at a product level, I think, we saw a really good balance across the portfolio. Roughly 1/3 were made up of virtualization and mobile products, 1/3 from networking, 20% from the full Workspace Suite and the remainder coming from subscription and services. The combination of these large transactions plus strong renewals and other businesses and the ongoing migration to higher value maintenance offerings boosted total deferred revenue by $154 million sequentially. On an annual basis, short-term deferred is up 4%, while multi-year is up 16%. 
From a geo perspective, when you exclude the SaaS businesses, the Americas was really the big driver in the quarter with revenue up 11%. EMEA was flat but results in APAC declined by 13% year-on-year. Since our restructuring last year occurred earlier in the U.S. versus the other geos, the U.S. teams have had much more time to stabilize and adopt to the new structure, really a key contributor in performance in Q4. 
Next, let's take a look at the Q4 results within our 3 primary businesses. Our Workspace Services business grew 4% year-on-year to $352 million, including license growth of 1%, continuing the steady improvement and results we've seen over the past 5 quarters. Really more than any other of our businesses, Workspace Services should benefit the work we're doing to simplify focus and strategy and as we've reviewed before, there's a number of very specific initiatives that we're driving to accelerate growth in this area through innovation, virtualization and the aggregation of our unique assets. We've built the market-leading products that allows the secure delivery of the world's most important applications, including Windows, Web, mobile and customer line of business apps. Plus, we built the integrations in your enterprise file sharing and networking solutions that together creates really a powerful mobility system for our customers, as well as market differentiation. 
In the quarter of the Workspace Suite, which is our comprehensive solution for app and data delivery, contributed nearly 20% of license revenue for this group and this compares to just 9% a year ago. Additionally, we continue to grow our CSP business where partners primarily utilize XenApp to deliver subscription-based offerings to their customers. This quarter's CSP revenue grew over 30% year-on-year and closed the full year at just over $55 million of total recognized revenue. So we're delivering a complete mobility solution, allowing customers of all sizes to bridge between the worlds of Windows and mobility, on-premise or service-based, and we do it really all with the customers-centric experience that only Citrix can provide. 
Next, looking at the Delivery Networking, total revenue increased 13% in the quarter to $220  including license growth of 10%. The strength in this business was driven by NetScaler. Offsetting this was a significant decline by mobile business as we transition away from that product line. But focusing on NetScaler, it's important to remind everybody that the business here is essentially made up of 3 segments: the tax sales, enterprise ADC and strategic service providers. Tax sales, where customers are purchasing networking and Workspace Services together as part of a larger Citrix solution, represented about 20% of the NetScaler mix in Q4. There were over 800 of these transactions and this compares with just 700 a year ago. Enterprise ADC was about 1/3 of the mix growing modestly and of the service provider segment contributed more than 40% of license and similar to what we discussed in Q3, we saw strong demand across the main major service cloud providers. All in, we sold over 2,500 unique customers in the period with 36% being new customers. 
Finally, in our SaaS-based solutions, we delivered revenue of $194 million, up 15% in the quarter. The Communications Cloud remains the largest part of this business contributing over 60% of the mix and growing about 19% year-on-year. In the workflow area, our data platform, ShareFile, was up nearly 30% in subscription-based revenue with the majority of this growth coming across regulated verticals. Our focus on improving retention rates of our active user base has really helped Net New Business increase significantly year-over-year. This has been driven by changes across products, packaging, as well as customer organization. Back in November, we announced the intention to spend our GoTo family of products in the second half of this year. And say that these plans remain well on track and on the coming quarters real provide much more visibility into this business, as well as into the ShareFile business that will remain part of Citrix going forward. 
So turning to operations. We have delivered a rapid increase in margins over the past few quarters, really despite funding incremental investments in our higher growth businesses. As we discussed last year, we built detailed restructuring plans across the company with the intent these would generate permanent expense reductions, allow the company to execute more efficiently with fewer moving parts and prepare for greater scalability in the future. 
In November, we announced headcount actions primarily targeting noncore areas in order to minimize impact on our ability to service customers and drive revenue. Generally speaking, I'd say we broke these notifications down into 2 events: the first one occurred in mid-November and the second one concluded in early January. I would point out that many of these roles have transitioned elements to them so that expense realization will be phased in throughout the year. 
In Q4, we posted 32% adjusted op margin. This is up nearly 600 basis points from last year. This is actually the highest margin of any quarter over the last 10 years. For the full year, we delivered 26% as compared to just 22% in 2014, well ahead of our original guidance the beginning of the year. And currently, I'd say, I think, we're well on our way to achieving the 30%-plus goal that we laid out for fiscal '17. This focus on leverage has also helped increase cash flow from operations, which was $282 million in Q4 and over $1 billion for the full year and this clearly a record for the company. When you translate this, it's about $6.45 a share for all of 2015. 
And finally, remained active with our buyback program last quarter. We repurchased 4.3 million shares and this increases the total for the full year to over 11 million shares. We also announced today that the board has authorized an additional $400 million to fund our ongoing program. So before I wrap up, let me talk about our current outlook and expectations for Q1 '16 and for the full year. Our operational programs are clearly working and say we're very happy with the results so far, and we're confident in our plans for the balance of the year. At the same time, we want to remain mindful of any potential disruptions that can occur really with any restructuring. So with that, we intend to remain conservative across many of our assumptions but we will be increasing our current expectations. For Q1 '16, we expect revenue in a range of $785 million to $790 million, and adjusted EPS between $0.91 and $0.93 a share. For fiscal '16, revenue between $3.31 billion and $3.32 billion, and adjusted EPS of $4.65 to $4.75 per share. And as a reminder, this guidance represents all businesses, including GoTo. So now I'd like to turn it over to Bob to give further color on the quarter. Bob?"

First, I want to provide more context around the solid results that David just shared. Next, I want to give you an update on the progress we've been making to refocus our strategy and execute on the ongoing operating initiatives we outlined in November. And last but certainly not least, I want to share my excitement and introduce you to Citrix's new President and Chief Executive Officer. 
So let's get started. First, needless to say, I'm very pleased with the performance this quarter on both the top line and the bottom line. On the top line, the performance was impressive in and of itself, and even more so when you consider that we were implementing a number of restructuring activities in the sales organization during the fourth quarter. Carlos Sartorius and his team demonstrated is that it's possible to restructure the organization, and keep focus on execution, not only delivering on our expectations, but far exceeding with the beat of more than $25 million with most of that upside coming from product and license revenues. 
After a few consecutive quarters of declining license revenue, we posted solid gains on both Q3 and Q4. As David pointed out, we had good performance once again and our NetScaler's strategic service provider segment. However, it's also important to point out that performance continues to improve in Workspace Services as well where we saw a positive license revenue growth for the first time in a while, which is even more encouraging when you consider the mix shift towards more subscription and term-based licenses. I believe this is a function of improving execution and also, the early benefits of our renewed focus on secure apps and data delivery, which has received excellent feedback from our employees, partners and customers alike. This focus allows us to put all of our energy and resources into what is most important to us and to our customers, which I believe, is a key contributor to our top-line performance this quarter. 
A few weeks ago, I had the opportunity to participate in Citrix Summit, which is our annual kickoff with our sales team and our partners. You could feel the energy in the room as a collective team had just participated in an excellent end of the year. Both our sales team and partners had very positive feedback about the event, and they were particularly appreciative of the focus of the company, our simplified go-to-market strategy and our reenergized partner program. 
On the partner front, they were excited decided not only about the clarity we provided on the portfolio, but also about the innovation we are driving our core products. At the event, we showcased new capabilities for Microsoft technologies, browser-based apps and software-defined win. These innovations lineup for some of the major buying cycles going on in the tech sector that played Citrix trends. Citrix can significantly accelerate and simplify the migration to Windows 10. We'll be ready with similar capabilities to preserve our 2016 when it launches later this year, and our new optimization pack delivers deep integration within the Skype architecture, allowing us to deliver virtualized Skype functionality to Windows, Mac and Lenox desktops, making as a preferred partner for Skype for Business and giving us the lead competitive position. There are also host of other IT buying trends at Citrix is in great position to capitalize on. For example, the massive adoption of Chromebooks, an explosion in the use of browser-based apps is creating new opportunities for us to simplify and secure the delivery of apps for our customers. At Summit, we announced our browser app service that eliminates the headaches of browser version compatibility and mitigate security risks involved with browser-based apps. 
In addition to these market trends, we're also benefiting from our focus on industry verticals, especially in financial services and health care. By focusing on these verticals, we add features to our core products that meet to the needs of specific industry use cases, which gives us a significant competitive advantage. Along with our focus in execution, this is enabled us to be the competition and in several cases, resulted in competitive takeouts versus VMWare, which is reflected in our accidents results this quarter. The competitive wins are definitely turning in our favor, that is true with customers evidence by a number of competitive takeouts, it's true with -- and partners as well. That's on the recruiting front. 
I'm equally pleased with the progress on cost and margin improvement. When we last met, I shared how the recommendations from our strategic and operating reviews were not only focus the business on our core competencies and segments where we have or can built a defensive leadership position but also the streamlined organization to improve execution and reduced to the ongoing cost structure of the business. As you can see in the results this quarter, we are making great strides with adjusted operating margins up nearly 600 basis points year-on-year. A number of our initiatives are already implemented, and we are on track with more than 30 individual projects realizing faster savings, which is reflected in the quarter's results, as well as in the increased EPS guidance for 2016. 
Back in November, we set goals for 2016, which I characterized as conservative. The team did an outstanding job this quarter of performing, while implementing the restructuring. Yet, I believe it's prudent to remain conservative and realize a few more quarters of consistent performance before we raise expectations further. Considering current performance and the recent trends in the business, I would say our 2016 guidance remains very conservative, if not more so today. 
Before introducing Kirill, let me just say a few words of things to the team for the tremendous support they've given me over the past 6 months since I first joined at this exact chair and more recently, as Interim CEO. We have a terrific team here at Citrix. It's a very smart team, they're dedicated and the culture is ingrained with a deep desire to win and a competitive spirit that I'm very accustomed to. They have given me all the support I could ask for and they have shown what they can do when focused on the core mission and freed from distractions. They rapidly embraced the changes in the business and have shown that less can be more, not only more profit, but more revenue as well. And they've shown that they can drive results in the business, while simultaneously implementing difficult restructuring actions. The mission is not complete. Far from it, but I'm encouraged by the progress to date. The wins are clearly shifting in our favor, the team is energized and confident, they are competing more aggressively and winning in the market. The building momentum build the business as evidence not just by my words but by their performance. I'm very proud to been part of the cement think full for the support I received as Interim CEO. I look forward to continuing on as Exec Chair as we build upon our great start. Going forward, my focus first and foremost is on providing Kirill and the team any support they need. And beyond that, I plan to continue to stay involved in the restructuring and operating actions we outlined in November, the spin out of our GoTo business and in capital structure items. 
So finally, let me say how pleased I am to have Kirill join as our new Chief Executive Officer. I and the rest of the search committee conducted a very thorough search. We consider the number of candidates focus on those with the background that includes both leadership experience, as well as technology and products expertise. Most importantly, we look for leaders of shared our company's core values and the relentless focus on customer and partner's success. Kirill has a proven track record of growing businesses and driving operational performance. When you coupled that with his deep product background and the fact that he knows our space, our competitors and our biggest partners, there could not be a better fit between a candidate and an opportunity. So I'm really excited to have Kirill joined and lead this company to our next phase of growth. So with that, let me officially welcome Kirill to Citrix and turn the call over to him so he can introduce himself and say hello. Kirill?"

In fact, many of whom I also served in my prior roles. 
Today is only my third day with the companies I wanted to share just a couple of thoughts on why I'm so excited about joining Citrix. With my discussions with many CIOs over the years, it is clear that secure delivery of apps and data is one of the most important priorities in driving digital transformations in their company and helping people in their organizations work better. And this is precisely what Citrix does. Personally, joining Citrix feels a bit like a homecoming for me. Throughout my career, I've been passing about helping people at work to be more productive. I've been fortunate to have an opportunity to build and lead innovative organizations with multi-product portfolios. And I had an opportunity to grow businesses at scale through partner-centric go-to-market model. So it seems like a perfect seat. I'm delighted Bob is staying on as our Executive Chairman, continuing the projects initiated last fall and helping me onboard and immersed in the business. I look forward to working with Bob and the leadership team to execute on Citrix's operating plan and drive greater value for our customers, partners and shareholders. I want to thank you for joining us today, and I look forward to engaging with many of you in the coming weeks and months. And now, I'd like to open up for questions."

Let me just repeat a few things that I said earlier. And really, what's going on the Workspace Services is the culmination of a lot of these activities we've talked about over the last several quarters, not only to reinstate the focus on that app, but all of the other technologies that are around that to create those types of solutions. In terms of the actual drivers, 2 big things I'd call out. First is the holistic Workspace Suite. Everyone knows that's our solution for enterprise mobility, talk about apps and mobility and data in 1 broader, more strategic conversation with customers. That is up to about 20% of the mix right now. That was less than 10% a year ago, growing at close to 200% year-on-year. 
Second piece is actually around our service provider business, is the CSPs. That is all subscription-based, monthly ratable, approaching a $60 million business and growing north of 30%. That's really the big one. We're also the driving lots of innovation forward. So things that Bob called out, whether it's the focus on helping customers win 10 migrations, virtualizing Skype for business, browser servers, new management capabilities, lots of things in that area, really just demonstrated in exhilarating the market leadership we've had for all these years. That's the message we're carrying for the at the partners, that's the message our sales teams are driving and is allowing for the continuous improvement in overall execution. I'd say back to the comment about the geos, yes, in Q4, the Americas was really the big driver. I made a comment in my prepared remarks about that's the place where we initiated our restructuring last year. So they got a lot more time to work through all of the changes, get settled into them new structure in a good report as a setter was, so we are as we roll into '16 you'll see a similar type of performance flow-through in the other geos."

I think, those that's probably the easiest way to describe the changes between '15 and '16. The other is around the simplification and focus message that we talked about over the past couple of quarters. Certainly, our partners want to hear that as well. Here's what we're focused on, here's what's most important then, here's how they make money for their businesses, and then just drive in the relentless focus against that.

I talked about the 3 main pieces in my prepared remarks and I think, that's the way you should expect us to discuss networking going forward. The attached motion is the first piece and that is where customers are purchasing really Workspace Services solution and and networking product in conjunction to create more of a system. Not only does it provide more value for Citrix on a bookings double, but it creates a lot of differentiation to our value for our customers, that's one. The stuff that I called out is that we had 800 of those types of transactions in the quarter versus 700 a year ago. If you invert the metric, that's about a 12% attach rate to virtualization orders, and that's up from 9% a year ago. So that's one of the key focus areas. 
The second is around what we would describe as core ADC. And this is enterprise ADC that's largely a focus area for coverage, and so one of the investments that we're making right now is to increase coverage in multiple geos that should allow us to be able to service many more of those engagements. And then the third is around strategic service providers, which as everyone knows, we have tremendous engagement with a handful of large customers but their purchasing patterns tend to be a bit volatile. So overall we expect to be able to grow in-line or faster than the market in '16, but be a little bit cautious about the timing of the SSPs piece and where are those yet."

In terms of long-term product roadmaps I mean, it's probably not an appropriate time to do it on a call like this. Shorter term, yes, we've talked to partners about just a pretty rapid ramp in innovation across late 2015, '16 in the Workspace Services areas. For those of you that have followed the company for a while, remember that we went through a major platform transition for a couple of years around XenApps and Desktop, et cetera. With that guidance we been able to really ramp the new innovation, new features, things like that, just focusing on what customers need, how to be more successful, how to bridge between on-prem, hybrid and full cloud deployments et cetera. So that's the thematically it's what we're doing in that area. You see a lot of new improvements coming out in terms of just ways we integrate from a management layer, from end-user experience, performance across lousy networks, the types of things that really matter to customers. We've laid all that out, and we'll be talking a lot more about that at synergy in the May timeframe. Networking, very similar. We've taken our software-based strategy and really extended that across the platforms over the last couple of years. For example, I didn't talk about this in the prepared remarks, but our virtual appliances, the VPX family, is actually the fastest growing elements of networking. That grew well over 20% for the full year and in the quarter as customers are utilizing a virtual appliance more in the think about in the context of from a data fabric versus a physical box in the data center. And so lots of things like that are going to the theater drive forward there aggressively. And then, of course, close illusions, which are a little bit further out in the future. So core messages, come to synergy, we'd love to have everybody see the latest and Grace will talk much more about future roadmaps they are. In terms of the market environment, I think, a number of companies have talked about macro and currency, and that's all true. Outside of the U.S., markets are a little bit more volatile than they are domestically. I think, everybody's just operating under the same base assumptions, and we saw some of that as well. We didn't really feel worth calling out because frankly, that's the way it's been the past 2, 3 quarters anyway. Fairly challenging in parts of APAC. Certainly, challenging in places in South America and others where you've just had lots of currency volatility. And frankly, the same -- it holds true for me especially those markets that are more focused on energy. we're executing through that. We're really focus on the things that we can control, and that's what we're talking about now. Happy with what's going on in the Americas, we've got a great new leadership in the EMEA space, and we're excited about the things that we can accomplish in '16. So stay with us.

Yes, a service provider is our really important segment of the business. For those of you that have followed NetScaler for a long time, remember that it was nearly 100% of total revenue if you roll the clock back 7 or 8 years. We've diversified broadly across the idea of the way I describe it is attached, but settings solutions and then core enterprise ADC. It remains one of our most important, but like you said, it's a little volatile. I mean what's happened over the years is that it's more from being a big spike in Q3 as dotcoms were focused on what was frankly the holiday shopping season, building out capacity for that. Too much more distributed now where people are delivering services to mobile devices, services to just SaaS and those type of things. So the businesses much more broad than it used to be. I'd say we have pretty good visibility into the full year. It's just that the timing of purchases tend to be concentrated based on when customers need it. And so one of the hesitations we have about giving quarter-to-quarter guidance at that level is that it does move around. If you remember back in 2014, we had a tremendous first half of the year with the SSP segment, and then a little bit weaker in the back half of the year. Going on to '15, we said it was going to be the opposite. So that came true and first half was lighter with the SSPs and that the second half was very strong. When we look at it in hindsight, the full year, pretty much as expected. And so that is the only pause that I have when talking about guidance for that segment is that it's predicated on their build cycles. Full year, I think we've got good relationships, really happy with our share and we're going to work very closely with them on all of their needs."

We're making great progress on the operational initiatives that we launched last year. At a high level, the most important activity has really been simplifying our strategic focus, driving both",1455,"Thank you, Eduardo, and welcome to everyone joining us today. We're making great progress on the operational initiatives that we launched last year. At a high level, the most important activity has really been simplifying our strategic focus, driving both portfolio optimization and clarity in terms of what's most important to the company, our partners and our customers. 
Our results for Q4 reflect the progress the team has made in absorbing and adjusting to these initiatives, cost structure work, org and leadership evolution and changes to our field in general strategy. We continue to focus our energy towards our core strategy to secure delivery of apps and data, really setting the company up for even better results, efficiency and growth as we look forward. 
As you saw from the release today, total revenue was up 6% year-on-year in Q4, with product license up 5%. Adjusted operating margins jump to 32%; adjusted EPS was $1.66 share, up 50%; and we generated $282 million in cash flow from ops. 
In total, we closed 86 $1-million-plus transactions across products and services. The Americas region booked the majority of these with 60 and EMEA had 23. 
There's a couple of points that are worth noting in that the average value of these large deals increased significantly year-on-year in both the U.S. and EMEA. And at a product level, I think, we saw a really good balance across the portfolio. Roughly 1/3 were made up of virtualization and mobile products, 1/3 from networking, 20% from the full Workspace Suite and the remainder coming from subscription and services. 
The combination of these large transactions plus strong renewals and other businesses and the ongoing migration to higher value maintenance offerings boosted total deferred revenue by $154 million sequentially. On an annual basis, short-term deferred is up 4%, while multi-year is up 16%. 
From a geo perspective, when you exclude the SaaS businesses, the Americas was really the big driver in the quarter, with revenue up 11%. EMEA was flat, but results in APAC declined by 13% year-on-year. Since our restructuring last year occurred earlier in the U.S. versus the other geos, the U.S. teams have had much more time to stabilize and adopt to the new structure, really a key contributor to this performance in Q4. 
Next, let's take a look at the Q4 results within our 3 primary businesses. Our Workspace Services business grew 4% year-on-year to $352 million, including license growth of 1%, continuing the steady improvement and results we've seen over the past 5 quarters. Really more than any other of our businesses, Workspace Services should benefit the work we're doing to simplify focus and strategy. And as we've reviewed before, there's a number of very specific initiatives that we're driving to accelerate growth in this area through innovation, verticalization and the aggregation of our unique assets. We've built the market-leading products that allows secure delivery of the world's most important applications, including Windows, Web, mobile and customer line of business apps. Plus, we built the integrations into our enterprise file sharing and networking solutions that together creates, really, a powerful mobility system for our customers as well as market differentiation. 
In the quarter, the Workspace Suite, which is our comprehensive solution for app and data delivery, contributed nearly 20% of license revenue for this group, and this compares to just 9% a year ago. Additionally, we continue to grow our CSP business, where partners primarily utilize XenApp to deliver subscription-based offerings to their customers. This quarter's CSP revenue grew over 30% year-on-year and closed the full year at just over $55 million in total recognized revenue. 
So we're delivering a complete mobility solution, allowing customers of all sizes to bridge between the worlds of Windows and mobility, on-premise or service-based. And we do it, really, all with the customers-centric experience that only Citrix can provide. 
Next, looking at the Delivery Networking, total revenue increased 13% in the quarter to $220, including license growth of 10%. The strength in this business was driven by NetScaler. Offsetting this was a significant decline in ByteMobile, as we transition away from that product line. But focusing on NetScaler, it's important to remind everybody that the business here is essentially made up of 3 segments: attach sales, enterprise ADC and strategic service providers. Attach sales, where customers are purchasing networking and Workspace Services together as part of a larger Citrix solution, represented about 20% of the NetScaler mix in Q4. There were over 800 of these transactions, and this compares with just 700 a year ago. Enterprise ADC was about 1/3 of the mix growing modestly. And the Service Provider segment contributed more than 40% of license. And similar to what we discussed in Q3, we saw strong demand across the main major service cloud providers. All in, we sold over 2,500 unique customers in the period, with 36% being new customers. 
Finally, in our SaaS-based solutions, we delivered revenue of $194 million, up 15% in the quarter. The Communications Cloud remains the largest part of this business, contributing over 60% of the mix and growing about 19% year-on-year. In the workflow area, our data platform, ShareFile, was up nearly 30% in subscription-based revenue, with the majority of this growth coming across regulated verticals. 
Our focus on improving retention rates of the active user base has really helped Net New Business increase significantly year-over-year. This has been driven by changes across product, packaging as well as customer care organization. Back in November, we announced the intention to spend our GoTo family of products in the second half of this year. And I'd say that these plans remain well on track, and on the coming quarters, we'll provide much more visibility into this business as well as into the ShareFile business that will remain part of Citrix going forward. 
So turning to operations. We have delivered a rapid increase in margins over the past few quarters, really despite funding incremental investments in our higher-growth businesses. As we discussed last year, we built detailed restructuring plans across the company with the intent that these would generate permanent expense reductions, allow the company to execute more efficiently with fewer moving parts and prepare for greater scalability in the future. 
In November, we announced headcount actions primarily targeting noncore [indiscernible] areas in order to minimize the impact on our ability to service customers and drive revenue. Generally speaking, I'd say we broke these notifications down into 2 events: the first one occurred in mid-November and the second one concluded in early January. I would point out that many of these roles have transition elements to them, so the expense realization will be phased in throughout the year. 
In Q4, we posted 32% adjusted op margin. This is up nearly 600 basis points from last year. This is actually the highest margin of any quarter over the last 10 years. For the full year, we delivered 26% as compared to just 22% in 2014, well ahead of our original guidance at the beginning of the year. And currently, I'd say, I think, we're well on our way to achieving the 30%-plus goal that we laid out for fiscal '17. 
This focus on leverage has also helped increase cash flow from operations, which was $282 million in Q4 and over $1 billion for the full year. And this is clearly a record for the company. When you translate this, it's about $6.45 a share for all of 2015. 
And finally, we remained active with our buyback program last quarter. We repurchased 4.3 million shares, and this increases the total for the full year to over 11 million shares. We also announced today that the board has authorized an additional $400 million to fund our ongoing program. 
So before I wrap up, let me talk about our current outlook and expectations for Q1 '16 and for the full year. Our operational programs are clearly working. I'd say we're very happy with the results so far, and we're confident in our plans for the balance of the year. At the same time, we want to remain mindful of any potential disruptions that can occur, really, with any restructuring. So with that, we intend to remain conservative across many of our assumptions, but we will be increasing our current expectations. 
For Q1 '16, we expect revenue in a range of $785 million to $790 million, and adjusted EPS between $0.91 and $0.93 a share. For fiscal '16, revenue between $3.31 billion and $3.32 billion, and adjusted EPS of $4.65 to $4.75 per share. And as a reminder, this guidance represents all businesses, including GoTo. 
So now I'd like to turn it over to Bob to give further color on the quarter. Bob?"

First, I want to provide more context around the solid results David just shared. Next, I want to give you an update on the progress we've been making to refocus our strategy and execute on the ongoing operating initiatives we outlined in November. And last, but certainly not least, I want to share my excitement and introduce you to Citrix's new President and Chief Executive Officer. 
So let's get started. First, needless to say, I'm very pleased with the performance this quarter on both the top line and the bottom line. On the top line, the performance was impressive in and of itself, and even more so when you consider that we were implementing a number of restructuring activities in the sales organization during the fourth quarter. Carlos Sartorius and his team demonstrated that it's possible to restructure the organization and keep focus on execution, not only delivering on our expectations, but far exceeding with a beat of more than $25 million, with most of that upside coming from product and license revenues. 
After a few consecutive quarters of declining license revenues, we posted solid gains in both Q3 and Q4. As David pointed out, we had good performance once again in our NetScaler's strategic service provider segment. However, it's also important to point out that performance continues to improve in Workspace Services as well, where we saw a positive license revenue growth for the first time in a while, which is even more encouraging when you consider the mix shift towards more subscription and term-based licenses. 
I believe this is a function of improving execution and also, the early benefits of our renewed focus on secure apps and data delivery, which has received excellent feedback from our employees, partners and customers alike. This focus allows us to put all of our energy and resources into what is most important to us and to our customers, which, I believe, is a key contributor to our top-line performance this quarter. 
A few weeks ago, I had the opportunity to participate in Citrix Summit, which is our annual kickoff with our sales team and our partners. You could feel the energy in the room as a collective team had just participated in an excellent end of the year. Both our sales team and partners had very positive feedback about the event, and they were particularly appreciative of the focus of the company, our simplified go-to-market strategy and our reenergized partner program. 
On the partner front, they were excited, not only about the clarity we provided on the portfolio, but also about the innovation we are driving in our core products. At the event, we showcased new capabilities for Microsoft technologies, browser-based apps and software-defined win. These innovations lineup with some of the major buying cycles going on in the tech sector that played the Citrix strengths. 
Citrix can significantly accelerate and simplify the migration to Windows 10. We'll be ready with similar capabilities, Citrix Server 2016, when it launches later this year. And our new optimization pack delivers deep integration within the Skype architecture, allowing us to deliver virtualized Skype functionality to Windows, Mac and Linux desktops, making us a preferred partner for Skype for Business and giving us the lead competitive position. 
There are also a host of other IT buying trends that Citrix is in great position to capitalize on. For example, the massive adoption of Chromebooks, an explosion in the use of browser-based apps is creating new opportunities for us to simplify and secure the delivery of apps for our customers. At Summit, we announced our browser app service that eliminates the headaches of browser version compatibility and mitigates the security risks involved with browser-based apps. 
In addition to these market trends, we're also benefiting from our focus on industry verticals, especially in financial services and health care. By focusing on these verticals, we add features to our core products that meet the needs of specific industry use cases, which gives us a significant competitive advantage. Along with our focus in execution, this has enabled us to beat the competition and in several cases, resulted in competitive takeouts versus VMWare, which is reflected in our excellent results this quarter. 
The competitive wins are definitely turning in our favor. That is true with customers, evidenced by a number of competitive takeouts, it's true with -- and partners as well. That's on the recruiting front. 
I'm equally pleased with the progress on costs and margin improvement. When we last met, I shared how the recommendations from our strategic and operating reviews would not only focus the business on our core competencies and segments where we have or can build a defensive leadership position, but also to streamline the organization to improve execution and reduce the ongoing cost structure of the business. 
As you can see in the results this quarter, we're making great strides, with adjusted operating margins up nearly 600 basis points year-on-year. A number of our initiatives are already implemented, and we are on track with more than 30 individual projects realizing faster savings, which is reflected in the quarter's results as well as in the increased EPS guidance for 2016. 
Back in November, we set goals for 2016, which I characterized as conservative. The team did an outstanding job this quarter of performing while implementing the restructuring. Yet, I believe it's prudent to remain conservative and realize a few more quarters of consistent performance before we raise expectations further. Considering current performance and the recent trends in the business, I would say our 2016 guidance remains very conservative, if not more so today. 
Before introducing Kirill, let me just say a few words of thanks to the team for the tremendous support they've given me over the past 6 months since I first joined as Exec Chair and more recently, as Interim CEO. We have a terrific team here at Citrix. It's a very smart team. They're dedicated. And the culture is ingrained with a deep desire to win and a competitive spirit that I'm very accustomed to. They have given me all the support I could ask for, and they have shown what they can do when focused on a core mission and freed from distractions. They rapidly embraced the changes in the business and have shown that less can be more, not only more profit, but more revenue as well. And they have shown that they can drive results in the business while simultaneously implementing difficult restructuring actions. 
The mission is not complete, far from it. But I'm encouraged by the progress to date. The wins are clearly shifting in our favor. The team is energized and confident. They are competing more aggressively and winning in the market. The building momentum build in the business as evidenced not just by my words but by their performance. I'm very proud to have been part of this team and thankful for the support I received as Interim CEO. 
I look forward to continuing on as Exec Chair as we build upon our great start. Going forward, my focus, first and foremost, is on providing Kirill and the team any support they need. And beyond that, I plan to continue to stay involved in the restructuring and operating actions we outlined in November, the spin out of our GoTo business and in capital structure items. 
So finally, let me say how pleased I am to have Kirill join as our new Chief Executive Officer. I and the rest of the search committee conducted a very thorough search. We considered a number of candidates, focused on those with the background that includes both leadership experience as well as technology and product expertise. Most importantly, we look for leaders who shared our company's core values and a relentless focus on customer and partner success. 
Kirill has a proven track record of growing businesses and driving operational performance. When you coupled that with his deep product background and the fact that he knows our space, our competitors and our biggest partners, there could not be a better fit between a candidate and an opportunity. So I'm really excited to have Kirill join and lead this company to our next phase of growth. 
So with that, let me officially welcome Kirill to Citrix and turn the call over to him, so he can introduce himself and say hello. Kirill?"

I've obviously known Citrix over the years as a peer and a partner in the industry. And I always viewed Citrix as a great company, with highly respected brand, differentiated products, strong team, large and loyal partner channel and amazing customers around the world. In fact, many of whom I also served in my prior roles. 
Today is only my third day with the company, so I wanted to share just a couple of thoughts on why I'm so excited about joining Citrix. With my discussions with many CIOs over the years, it is clear that secure delivery of apps and data is one of the most important priorities in driving digital transformations in their company and helping people in their organizations to work better. And this is precisely what Citrix does. 
Personally, joining Citrix feels a bit like a homecoming for me. Throughout my career, I've been passionate about helping people at work to be more productive. I've been fortunate to have an opportunity to build and lead innovative organizations with multi-product portfolios. And I had an opportunity to grow businesses at scale through partner-centric go-to-market model. So it seems like a perfect fit. 
I'm delighted Bob is staying on as our Executive Chairman, continuing with the projects initiated last fall and helping me onboard and immerse in the business. I look forward to working with Bob and the leadership team to execute on Citrix's operating plan and drive greater value for our customers, partners and shareholders. 
I want to thank you for joining us today, and I look forward to engaging with many of you in the coming weeks and months.  
And now I would like to open up for questions."

It's David. Let me just repeat a few things that I said earlier. And really, what's going on the Workspace Services is the culmination of a lot of these activities we've talked about over the last several quarters, not only to reinstate the focus on XenApp, but all of the other technologies that are around that to create those types of solutions. In terms of the actual drivers, 2 big things I'd call out. First is the holistic Workspace Suite. Everyone knows that's our solution for enterprise mobility, talking about apps and mobility and data in 1 broader, more strategic conversation with customers. That is up to about 20% of the mix right now. That was less than 10% a year ago, growing at close to 200% year-on-year. Second piece is actually around our service provider business, or the CSPs. That is all subscription-based, monthly ratable, approaching a $60 million business and growing north of 30%. That's really the big one. We're also driving lots of innovation forward. So things that Bob called out, whether it's the focus on helping customers with Win 10 migrations, virtualizing Skype for Business, browser servers, new management capabilities, lots of things in that area, really just demonstrating and accelerating the market leadership we've had for all these years. That's the message we're carrying forward with the partners. That's the message that our sales teams should drive in. And it's allowing for the continuous improvement in overall execution. I'd say back to the comment about the geos, yes, in Q4, the Americas was really the big driver. I made a comment in my prepared remarks about -- that's the place where we initiated the restructuring last year. So they've had a lot more time to work through all of the changes, get settled into the new structure, engage with partners, etc. So we're certainly optimistic that as we roll into '16, you'll see a similar type of performance flow-through in the other geos."

And the 3 that I would call out would be ByteMobile, Podio and Cloud. And so those 3 together represent about $85 million of revenue last year.

The other is around the simplification and focus message that we've talked about over the past couple of quarters. Certainly, our partners want to hear that as well. Here's what we're focused on. Here's what's most important to them. Here's how they make money for their businesses. And then just drive in a relentless focus against that.

Not only does it provide more value for Citrix on a bookings level, but it creates a lot of differentiation and added value for customers. That's one. The stat that I called out is that we had 800 of those types of transactions in the quarter versus 700 a year ago. If you invert the metric, that's about a 12% attach rate to virtualization orders, and that's up from 9% a year ago. So that's one of the key focus areas. The second is around what we would describe as core ADC. And this is enterprise ADC, and that's largely a focus area for coverage. And so one of the investments that we're making right now is to increase coverage in multiple geos that should allow us to be able to service many more of those engagements. And then the third is around strategic service providers, which, as everyone knows, we have tremendous engagement with a handful of large customers, but their purchasing patterns tend to be a bit volatile. So overall we expect to be able to grow in-line or faster than the market in '16, but be a little bit cautious about the timing of the SSPs and where those hit."

I'd say the company had a very good quarter relative to the competition this quarter. Looking at a long list of competitive wins, some of those were head-to-head wins for new business and frankly, there are a number of pretty significant competitive takeouts this quarter versus VMware. So I'd say, as I mentioned in my comments, the competitive wins are definitely moving in our favor. That was building as the quarter went on. I would say that's true from a customer point of view given the wins. I would say that's true from a partner point of view. I think the partners have definitely noticed some very good changes in their relationship with Citrix here from just the way we're partnering better in the field. They like the focus and the renewed energy around the core of our business and I would say, on the recruiting front as well. So even with employees, I think, we've definitely seen a shift in activity there as well. So we're feeling, I would say, we're feeling rather bullish right now and very optimistic going into 2016."

But when you take a step back, and if you recall what we talked about in November, a lot of our focus efforts were around actually increasing the investment on our core solutions. And we're doing that by trimming away things, were contributing to revenue, were redundant, et cetera, et cetera. And so if I -- you look at very specific to core products like XenApp, for example, I mean, there's not a single engineer that has been removed from that organization. In fact, we'll be increasing investment there in networking and data, et cetera. And so don't focus too much on the absolute. I think it would be more important to focus on the individual initiatives that we're driving.

I mean, one of the things that we had covered was just the impact of some of these discontinued businesses as the primary reason why revenue is dipping into '16, and once we normalize that, we'll have a much better -- much clearer picture of the go-forward business. So once that normalize, year-over-year comps look good. The accelerated investments that we're making into things that will facilitate and drive long-term growth, I think, are still in place as we layer in increased capacity in areas, go-to-market areas like networking, et cetera.

In terms of long-term product road maps, I mean, it's probably not an appropriate time to do it on a call like this. Shorter-term, yes, we've talked to partners about just a pretty rapid ramp in innovation across late 2015, '16 in the Workspace Services areas. For those of you that have followed the company for a while, remember that we went through a major platform transition for a couple of years around XenApps and Desktop, et cetera. With that behind us, we've been able to really ramp the new innovation, new features, things like that, just focusing on what customers need, how to be more successful, how to bridge between on-prem, hybrid and full cloud deployments, et cetera. So that's thematically is what we're doing in that area. You'll see a lot of new improvements coming out in terms of just ways we integrate from a management layer, from end-user experience, performance across lossy networks, the types of things that really matter to customers. We've laid all that out, and we'll be talking a lot more about that at Synergy in the May time frame. Networking, very similar. We've taken our software-based strategy and really extended that across the platforms over the last couple of years. For example, I didn't talk about this in the prepared remarks, but our virtual appliances, the VPX family, is actually the fastest-growing element of all of networking. That grew well over 20% for the full year and in the quarter as customers are utilizing a virtual appliance more in the -- think of it in the context of a data fabric versus a physical box in the data center. And so lots of things like that we're going to continue to drive forward very aggressively, and then, of course, cloud solutions, which are a little bit further out in the future. So core message is come to Synergy, we'd love to have everybody see the latest and greatest. We'll talk much more about future road maps there. In terms of the market environment, I think a number of companies have talked about macro and currency, and that's all true. It's -- outside of the U.S., markets are a little bit more volatile than they are domestically. I think everybody's just operating under the same basic assumptions, and we saw some of that as well. We didn't really feel worth calling that out because, frankly, that's the way it's been over the past 2, 3 quarters anyway. Fairly challenging in parts of APAC. Certainly, challenging in places in South America and others where you've just had lots of currency volatility. And frankly, the same -- it holds true for me, especially those markets that are more focused on energy. So we're executing through that. We're really focused on the things that we can control, and that's what we're talking about now. Happy with what's going on in the Americas, we've got a great new leadership in the EMEA space, and we're excited about the things that we can accomplish in '16. So stay with us.

Yes, the service providers are a really important segment of the business. For those of you that have followed NetScaler for a long time, remember that it was nearly 100% of total revenue, if you roll the clock back 7, 8 years. We've diversified broadly across the idea of the way I describe it as attached but selling solutions and then core enterprise ADC. It remains one of our most important, but like you said, it's a little bit volatile. And I mean, what's happened over the years is that it's more from being a big spike in Q3 as dot-coms were focused on what was frankly the holiday shopping season, building out capacity for that. Too much more distributed now, where people are delivering services to mobile devices, services to just SaaS and those types of things. So the business is much more broad than it used to be. I'd say we have pretty good visibility into the full year. It's just that the timing of purchases tend to be concentrated based on when customers need it. And so one of the hesitations we have about giving quarter-to-quarter guidance at that level is that it does move around. If you remember back in 2014, we had a tremendous first half of the year with the SSP segment and then a little bit weaker in the back half of the year. Going into '15, we said it was going to be the opposite. So that came true and the first half was lighter with the SSPs, and then the second half was very strong. When we look at it in hindsight, the full year, pretty much as expected. And so that is the only pause that I have when talking about guidance for that segment, is that it's predicated on their build cycles. Full year, I think we've got great relationships, I'm really happy with our share, and we're going to work very closely with them on all of their needs."

That's what every CIO wants to see in their organization, and that's with Citrix drive, and I think the product portfolios supports it in a very significant way. And I'm really excited about that particular part of the business, Workspace Services, and how it can continue to play that role. Obviously, cloud is another hugely significant trend, and the NetScaler business that have -- how NetScaler essentially is becoming such a huge enabler of the cloud worldwide, essentially serving such a huge portion of cloud transactions for the major service providers is just astounding. And I fully expect this only to continue and accelerate as the world continues to shift to the cloud, which is now unstoppable as people build out more data centers, serving server and clouds and more clouds around the world. And then, of course, data and sharing data and enabling sort of analytics empowered by big data and the role that ShareFile technology placed in that particular trend as it relates to highly regulated industries. That's another very important powerful trend that I see only accelerating in the future. And so with those 3 things combined from the technology point of view, as I went for my due diligence on the Citrix technical portfolio, that would get me really excited about the opportunity, and I think, that's what propels this company into the future and to the next phase of greatness."

We're making great progress on the operational initiatives that we launched last year.

We're making great progress on the operational initiatives that we launched last year. At a high level, the most important activity has really been simplifying our strategic focus, driving both portfolio optimization and clarity in terms of what's most important to the company, our partners and our customers. 
Our results for Q4 reflect the progress the team has made in absorbing and adjusting to these initiatives, cost structure work, org and leadership evolution and changes to our field in general strategy. We continue to focus our energy towards our core strategy: the secured delivery of apps and data, really setting the company up for even better results, efficiency and growth as we look forward. 
As you saw from the release today, total revenue was up 6% year-on-year in Q4, with product license up 5%. Adjusted operating margins jump to 32%; adjusted EPS was $1.66 share, up 50%; and we generated $282 million in cash flow from ops. 
In total, we closed 86 $1-million-plus transactions across products and services. The Americas region booked the majority of these with 60 and EMEA had 23. 
There's a couple of points that are worth noting in that the average value of these large deals increased significantly year-on-year in both the U.S. and EMEA. And at a product level, I think, we saw a really good balance across the portfolio. Roughly 1/3 were made up of virtualization and mobile products, 1/3 from networking, 20% from the full Workspace Suite and the remainder coming from subscription and services. 
The combination of these large transactions plus strong renewals in other businesses and the ongoing migration to higher value maintenance offerings boosted total deferred revenue by $154 million sequentially. On an annual basis, short-term deferred is up 4%, while multi-year is up 16%. 
From a geo perspective, when you exclude the SaaS businesses, the Americas was really the big driver in the quarter, with revenue up 11%. EMEA was flat, but results in APAC declined by 13% year-on-year. Since our restructuring last year occurred earlier in the U.S. versus the other geos, the U.S. teams have had much more time to stabilize and adapt to the new structure, really a key contributor to this performance in Q4. 
Next, let's take a look at the Q4 results within our 3 primary businesses. Our Workspace Services business grew 4% year-on-year to $352 million, including license growth of 1%, continuing the steady improvement and results we've seen over the past 5 quarters. Really more than any other of our businesses, Workspace Services should benefit the work we're doing to simplify focus and strategy. And as we've reviewed before, there's a number of very specific initiatives that we're driving to accelerate growth in this area through innovation, verticalization and the aggregation of our unique assets. We've built the market-leading products that allow secured delivery of the world's most important applications, including Windows, Web, mobile and customer line of business apps. Plus, we built the integrations into our enterprise file sharing and networking solutions that together creates, really, a powerful mobility system for our customers as well as market differentiation. 
In the quarter, the Workspace Suite, which is our comprehensive solution for app and data delivery, contributed nearly 20% of license revenue for this group, and this compares to just 9% a year ago. Additionally, we continue to grow our CSP business, where partners primarily utilize XenApp to deliver subscription-based offerings to their customers. This quarter's CSP revenue grew over 30% year-on-year and closed the full year at just over $55 million in total recognized revenue. 
So we're delivering a complete mobility solution, allowing customers of all sizes to bridge between the worlds of Windows and mobility, on-premise or service-based. And we do it, really, all with the customers-centric experience that only Citrix can provide. 
Next, looking at the Delivery Networking, total revenue increased 13% in the quarter to $220, including license growth of 10%. The strength in this business was driven by NetScaler. Offsetting this was a significant decline in ByteMobile, as we transition away from that product line. But focusing on NetScaler, it's important to remind everybody that the business here is essentially made up of 3 segments: attach sales, enterprise ADC and strategic service providers. Attach sales, where customers are purchasing networking and Workspace Services together as part of a larger Citrix solution, represented about 20% of the NetScaler mix in Q4. There were over 800 of these transactions, and this compares with just 700 a year ago. Enterprise ADC was about 1/3 of the mix growing modestly. And the Service Provider segment contributed more than 40% of license. And similar to what we discussed in Q3, we saw strong demand across the main major service cloud providers. All in, we sold to over 2,500 unique customers in the period, with 36% being new customers. 
Finally, in our SaaS-based solutions, we delivered revenue of $194 million, up 15% in the quarter. The Communications Cloud remains the largest part of this business, contributing over 60% of the mix and growing about 19% year-on-year. In the workflow area, our data platform, ShareFile, was up nearly 30% in subscription-based revenue, with the majority of this growth coming across regulated verticals. 
Our focus on improving retention rates of the active user base has really helped Net New Business increase significantly year-over-year. This has been driven by changes across product, packaging as well as customer care organization. Back in November, we announced the intention to spend our GoTo family of products in the second half of this year. And I'd say that these plans remain well on track, and on the coming quarters, we'll provide much more visibility into this business as well as into the ShareFile business that will remain part of Citrix going forward. 
So turning to operations. We have delivered a rapid increase in margins over the past few quarters, really despite funding incremental investments in our higher-growth businesses. As we discussed last year, we built detailed restructuring plans across the company with the intent that these would generate permanent expense reductions, allow the company to execute more efficiently with fewer moving parts and prepare for greater scalability in the future. 
In November, we announced headcount actions primarily targeting non-quota carrying areas in order to minimize the impact on our ability to service customers and drive revenue. Generally speaking, I'd say we broke these notifications down into 2 events: the first one occurred in mid-November and the second one concluded in early January. I would point out that many of these roles have transition elements to them, so the expense realization will be phased in throughout the year. 
In Q4, we posted 32% adjusted op margin. This is up nearly 600 basis points from last year. This is actually the highest margin of any quarter over the last 10 years. For the full year, we delivered 26% as compared to just 22% in 2014, well ahead of our original guidance at the beginning of the year. And currently, I'd say, I think, we're well on our way to achieving the 30%-plus goal that we laid out for fiscal '17. 
This focus on leverage has also helped increase cash flow from operations, which was $282 million in Q4 and over $1 billion for the full year. And this is clearly a record for the company. When you translate this, it's about $6.45 a share for all of 2015. 
And finally, we remained active with our buyback program last quarter. We repurchased 4.3 million shares, and this increases the total for the full year to over 11 million shares. We also announced today that the board has authorized an additional $400 million to fund our ongoing program. 
So before I wrap up, let me talk about our current outlook and expectations for Q1 '16 and for the full year. Our operational programs are clearly working. I'd say we're very happy with the results so far, and we're confident in our plans for the balance of the year. At the same time, we want to remain mindful of any potential disruptions that can occur, really, with any restructuring. So with that, we intend to remain conservative across many of our assumptions, but we will be increasing our current expectations. 
For Q1 '16, we expect revenue in a range of $785 million to $790 million, and adjusted EPS between $0.91 and $0.93 a share. For fiscal '16, revenue of between $3.31 billion and $3.32 billion, and adjusted EPS of $4.65 to $4.75 per share. And as a reminder, this guidance represents all businesses, including GoTo. 
So now I'd like to turn it over to Bob to give further color on the quarter. Bob?"

First, I want to provide more context around the solid results David just shared. Next, I want to give you an update on the progress we've been making to refocus our strategy and execute on the ongoing operating initiatives we outlined in November. And last, but certainly not least, I want to share my excitement and introduce you to Citrix's new President and Chief Executive Officer. 
So let's get started. First, needless to say, I'm very pleased with the performance this quarter on both the top line and the bottom line. On the top line, the performance was impressive in and of itself, and even more so when you consider that we were implementing a number of restructuring activities in the sales organization during the fourth quarter. Carlos Sartorius and his team demonstrated that it's possible to restructure the organization and keep focus on execution, not only delivering on our expectations, but far exceeding with a beat of more than $25 million, with most of that upside coming from product and license revenues. 
After a few consecutive quarters of declining license revenues, we posted solid gains in both Q3 and Q4. As David pointed out, we had good performance once again in our NetScaler strategic service provider segment. However, it's also important to point out that performance continues to improve in Workspace Services as well, where we saw a positive license revenue growth for the first time in a while, which is even more encouraging when you consider the mix shift towards more subscription and term-based licenses. 
I believe this is a function of improving execution and also, the early benefits of our renewed focus on secure apps and data delivery, which has received excellent feedback from our employees, partners and customers alike. This focus allows us to put all of our energy and resources into what is most important to us and to our customers, which, I believe, is a key contributor to our top-line performance this quarter. 
A few weeks ago, I had the opportunity to participate in Citrix Summit, which is our annual kickoff with our sales team and our partners. You could feel the energy in the room as a collective team had just participated in an excellent end of the year. Both our sales team and partners had very positive feedback about the event, and they were particularly appreciative of the focus of the company, our simplified go-to-market strategy and our reenergized partner program. 
On the partner front, they were excited, not only about the clarity we provided on the portfolio, but also about the innovation we are driving in our core products. At the event, we showcased new capabilities for Microsoft technologies, browser-based apps and software-defined WAN. These innovations lineup with some of the major buying cycles going on in the tech sector that played to Citrix strengths. 
Citrix can significantly accelerate and simplify the migration to Windows 10. We'll be ready with similar capabilities, such as Server 2016, when it launches later this year. And our new optimization pack delivers deep integration within the Skype architecture, allowing us to deliver virtualized Skype functionality to Windows, Mac and Linux desktops, making us a preferred partner for Skype for Business and giving us the lead competitive position. 
There are also a host of other IT buying trends that Citrix is in great position to capitalize on. For example, the massive adoption of Chromebooks, an explosion in the use of browser-based apps is creating new opportunities for us to simplify and secure the delivery of apps for our customers. At Summit, we announced our browser app service that eliminates the headaches of browser version compatibility and mitigates the security risks involved with browser-based apps. 
In addition to these market trends, we're also benefiting from our focus on industry verticals, especially in financial services and health care. By focusing on these verticals, we add features to our core products that meet the needs of specific industry use cases, which gives us a significant competitive advantage. Along with our focus in execution, this has enabled us to beat the competition and in several cases, resulted in competitive takeouts versus VMWare, which is reflected in our excellent results this quarter. 
The competitive wins are definitely turning in our favor. That is true with customers, evidenced by a number of competitive takeouts, it's true with -- in partners as well. That's on the recruiting front. 
I'm equally pleased with the progress on costs and margin improvement. When we last met, I shared how the recommendations from our strategic and operating reviews would not only focus the business on our core competencies and segments where we have or can build a defensive leadership position, but also to streamline the organization to improve execution and reduce the ongoing cost structure of the business. 
As you can see in the results this quarter, we're making great strides, with adjusted operating margins up nearly 600 basis points year-on-year. A number of our initiatives are already implemented, and we are on track with more than 30 individual projects realizing faster savings, which is reflected in the quarter's results as well as in the increased EPS guidance for 2016. 
Back in November, we set goals for 2016, which I characterized as conservative. The team did an outstanding job this quarter of performing while implementing the restructuring. Yet, I believe it's prudent to remain conservative and realize a few more quarters of consistent performance before we raise expectations further. Considering current performance and the recent trends in the business, I would say our 2016 guidance remains very conservative, if not more so today. 
Before introducing Kirill, let me just say a few words of thanks to the team for the tremendous support they've given me over the past 6 months since I first joined as Exec Chair and more recently, as Interim CEO. We have a terrific team here at Citrix. It's a very smart team. They're dedicated. And the culture is ingrained with a deep desire to win and a competitive spirit that I'm very accustomed to. They have given me all the support I could ask for, and they have shown what they can do when focused on a core mission and freed from distractions. They rapidly embraced the changes in the business and have shown that less can be more, not only more profit, but more revenue as well. And they have shown that they can drive results in the business while simultaneously implementing difficult restructuring actions. 
The mission is not complete, far from it. But I'm encouraged by the progress to date. The winds are clearly shifting in our favor. The team is energized and confident. They are competing more aggressively and winning in the market. They're building momentum build in the business as evidenced not just by my words but by their performance. I'm very proud to have been part of this team and thankful for the support I received as Interim CEO. 
I look forward to continuing on as Exec Chair as we build upon our great start. Going forward, my focus, first and foremost, is on providing Kirill and the team any support they need. And beyond that, I plan to continue to stay involved in the restructuring and operating actions we outlined in November, the spinout of our GoTo business and in capital structure items. 
So finally, let me say how pleased I am to have Kirill join as our new Chief Executive Officer. I and the rest of the search committee conducted a very thorough search. We considered a number of candidates, focused on those with the background that includes both leadership experience as well as technology and product expertise. Most importantly, we look for leaders who shared our company's core values and a relentless focus on customer and partner success. 
Kirill has a proven track record of growing businesses and driving operational performance. When you couple that with his deep product background and the fact that he knows our space, our competitors and our biggest partners, there could not be a better fit between a candidate and an opportunity. So I'm really excited to have Kirill join and lead this company to our next phase of growth. 
So with that, let me officially welcome Kirill to Citrix and turn the call over to him, so he can introduce himself and say hello. Kirill?"

I've obviously known Citrix over the years as a peer and a partner in the industry. And I always viewed Citrix as a great company, with highly respected brand, differentiated products, strong team, large and loyal partner channel and amazing customers around the world. In fact, many of whom I also served in my prior roles. 
Today is only my third day with the company, so I wanted to share just a couple of thoughts on why I'm so excited about joining Citrix. With my discussions with many CIOs over the years, it is clear that secured delivery of apps and data is one of the most important priorities in driving digital transformations in their company and helping people in their organizations to work better. And this is precisely what Citrix does. 
Personally, joining Citrix feels a bit like a homecoming for me. Throughout my career, I've been passionate about helping people at work to be more productive. I've been fortunate to have an opportunity to build and lead innovative organizations with multi-product portfolios. And I had an opportunity to grow businesses at scale through partner-centric go-to-market model. So it seems like a perfect fit. 
I'm delighted Bob is staying on as our Executive Chairman, continuing with the projects initiated last fall and helping me onboard and immerse in the business. I look forward to working with Bob and the leadership team to execute on Citrix's operating plan and drive greater value for our customers, partners and shareholders. 
I want to thank you for joining us today, and I look forward to engaging with many of you in the coming weeks and months. 
And now I would like to open up for questions."

It's David. Let me just repeat a few things that I said earlier. And really, what's going on the Workspace Services is the culmination of a lot of these activities we've talked about over the last several quarters, not only to reinstate the focus on XenApp, but all of the other technologies that are around that to create those types of solutions. In terms of the actual drivers, 2 big things I'd call out. First is the holistic Workspace Suite. Everyone knows that's our solution for enterprise mobility, talking about apps and mobility, and data is one broader, more strategic conversation with customers. That is up to about 20% of the mix right now. That was less than 10% a year ago, growing at close to 200% year-on-year. Second piece is actually around our service provider business, or the CSPs. That is all subscription-based, monthly ratable, approaching a $60 million business and growing north of 30%. That's really the big one. We're also driving lots of innovation forward. So things that Bob called out, whether it's the focus on helping customers with Win 10 migrations, virtualizing Skype for Business, browser servers, new management capabilities, lots of things in that area, really just demonstrating and accelerating the market leadership we've had for all these years. That's the message we're carrying forward with the partners. That's the message that our sales teams are driving. And it's allowing for the continuous improvement in overall execution. I'd say back to the comment about the geos, yes, in Q4, the Americas was really the big driver. I made a comment in my prepared remarks about -- that's the place where we initiated the restructuring last year. So they've had a lot more time to work through all of the changes, get settled into the new structure, engage with partners, etc. So we're certainly optimistic that as we roll into '16, you'll see a similar type of performance flow-through in the other geos."

The other is around the simplification and focus message that we've talked about over the past couple of quarters. Certainly, our partners want to hear that as well. Here's what we're focused on. Here's what's most important to them. Here's how they make money for their businesses. And then just driving a relentless focus against that. And so that's why we're seeing better and better results.

Not only does it provide more value for Citrix on a bookings level, but it creates a lot of differentiation and added value for customers. That's one. The stat that I called out is that we had 800 of those types of transactions in the quarter versus 700 a year ago. If you invert the metric, that's about a 12% attach rate to virtualization orders, and that's up from 9% a year ago. So that's one of the key focus areas. The second is around what we would describe as core ADC. And this is just enterprise ADC, and that's largely a focus area for coverage. And so one of the investments that we're making right now is to increase coverage in multiple geos that should allow us to be able to service many more of those engagements. And then the third is around strategic service providers, which, as everyone knows, we have tremendous engagement with a handful of large customers, but their purchasing patterns tend to be a bit volatile. So overall we expect to be able to grow in line or faster than the market in '16, but be a little bit cautious about the timing of the SSPs and where those hit."

And this year, our guidance will put you probably at 56%, 57% of revenue. And that's good from an op margin point of view, that's driving the direction that we're trying to get to. But when you take a step back, and if you recall what we talked about in November, a lot of our focus efforts were around actually increasing the investment on our core solutions. And we're doing that by trimming away things that weren't contributing to revenue, were redundant, et cetera, et cetera. And so if I -- you look at very specific to core products like XenApp, for example, I mean, there's not a single engineer that has been removed from that organization. In fact, we'll be increasing investment there in networking and data, et cetera. And so don't focus too much on the absolute. I think it would be more important to focus on the individual initiatives that we're driving. Long-term, 14%, 15%, 16% of revenue is relatively typical for large software companies, some economies of scale, but I feel pretty comfortable about the capacity we have overall in the system."

Honestly, Heather, we're just getting into '16 right now, so that's the primary focus. But when we were in November, we laid out a growth rate of 4%, 5% on the top line for '17 and north of 30% operating margin for the full year. And I feel very good about those at this point in time. I mean, one of the things that we had covered was just the impact of some of these discontinued businesses as the primary reason why revenue is dipping into '16, and once we normalize that, we'll have a much better -- much clearer picture of the go-forward business. So once that normalize, year-over-year comps look good; the accelerated investments that we're making into things that will facilitate and drive long-term growth, I think, are still in place as we layer in increased capacity in areas, go-to-market areas like networking, et cetera. I think that all portends good things for '17. So no change, I feel good about the progress so far, and clearly, we're executing well. It shows up in Q4.

In terms of long-term product roadmaps, I mean, it's probably not an appropriate time to do it on a call like this. Shorter-term, yes, we've talked to partners about just a pretty rapid ramp in innovation across late 2015, '16 in the Workspace Services areas. For those of you that have followed the company for a while, remember that we went through a major platform transition for a couple of years around XenApps and Desktop, et cetera. With that behind us, we've been able to really ramp the new innovation, new features, things like that, just focusing on what customers need, how to be more successful, how to bridge between on-prem, hybrid and full cloud deployments, et cetera. So that, thematically, is what we're doing in that area. You'll see a lot of new improvements coming out in terms of just ways we integrate from a management layer, from end-user experience, performance across lofty networks, the types of things that really matter to customers. We've laid all that out, and we'll be talking a lot more about that at Synergy in the May time frame. Networking, very similar. We've taken our software-based strategy and really extended that across the platforms over the last couple of years. For example, I didn't talk about this in the prepared remarks, but our virtual appliances, the VPX family, is actually the fastest-growing element of all of networking. That grew well over 20% for the full year and in the quarter as customers are utilizing a virtual appliance more in the -- think of it in the context of a data fabric versus a physical box in the data center. And so lots of things like that we're going to continue to drive forward very aggressively, and then, of course, cloud solutions, which are a little bit further out in the future. So core message is come to Synergy, we'd love to have everybody see the latest and greatest. We'll talk much more about future roadmaps there. In terms of the market environment, I think a number of companies have talked about macro and currency, and that's all true. It's -- outside of the U.S., markets are a little bit more volatile than they are domestically. I think everybody's just operating under the same basic assumptions, and we saw some of that as well. We didn't really feel worth calling that out because, frankly, that's the way it's been over the past 2, 3 quarters anyway. Fairly challenging in parts of APAC. Certainly, challenging in places in South America and others where you've just had lots of currency volatility. And frankly, the same -- it holds true for me, especially those markets that are more focused on energy. So we're executing through that. We're really focused on the things that we can control, and that's what we're talking about now. Happy with what's going on in the Americas, we've got a great new leadership in the EMEA space, and we're excited about the things that we can accomplish in '16. So stay with us. We'll give you an update each and every quarter."

It's just fairly common for SaaS-based businesses. So when I talk about margin guidance, however, that is the Holdco for everything. We'll go back and update guidance as appropriate once the spin is complete sometime in the second half of the year. So from a Holdco point of view, we went from 22.5% in '14 to a little over 25% in '15, and our guidance for '16 is north of 28%. I think when you run the numbers for our current financial guidance, you'll land somewhere around 28.5%, and so we're quite comfortable with that.

Yes, the service providers are a really important segment of the business. For those of you that have followed NetScaler for a long time, remember that it was nearly 100% of total revenue, if you roll the clock back 7, 8 years. We've diversified broadly across the idea of the way I describe it as attached but selling solutions and then core enterprise ADC. It remains one of our most important, but like you said, it's a little bit volatile. And I mean, what's happened over the years is that it's morphed from being a big spike in Q3 as dot-coms were focused on what was frankly the holiday shopping season, building out capacity for that, to much more distributed now, where people are delivering services to mobile devices, services to just SaaS and those types of things. So the business is much more broad than it used to be. I'd say we have pretty good visibility into the full year. It's just that the timing of purchases tend to be concentrated based on when customers need it. And so one of the hesitations we have about giving quarter-to-quarter guidance at that level is that it does move around. If you remember back in 2014, we had a tremendous first half of the year with the SSP segment and then a little bit weaker in the back half of the year. Going into '15, we said it was going to be the opposite. So that came true and the first half was lighter with the SSPs, and then the second half was very strong. When we look at it in hindsight, the full year, pretty much as expected. And so that is the only pause that I have when talking about guidance for that segment, is that it's predicated on their build cycles. Full year, I think we've got great relationships, I'm really happy with our share, and we're going to work very closely with them on all of their needs."

Obviously, cloud is another hugely significant trend, and the NetScaler business that have -- how NetScaler essentially is becoming such a huge enabler of the cloud worldwide, essentially serving such a huge portion of cloud transactions for the major service providers is just astounding. And I fully expect this only to continue and accelerate as the world continues to shift to the cloud, which is now unstoppable as people build out more data centers, serving server and clouds and more clouds around the world.

Before we begin, I want to state that we have posted product specification and historical revenue trends related to our product groupings to our Investor Relations website.
I'd like to remind you that today's conversation will contain forward-looking statements made under the safe harbor provision of the U.S. securities law. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Obviously, these risks could cause actual results to differ from those anticipated.

Copies are available from the SEC or on the company's Investor Relations website.
Furthermore, we will discuss various non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC's Reg G. A reconciliation of the differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures discussed on today's call can be found at the end of today's press release and on the Investor Relations page of our website.

As you can see, we continue to show great progress with the operational initiatives we introduced last year. We're focusing our energy towards our core strategy: The secure delivery of apps and data, really setting the company up for even better results, efficiency and growth as we look forward. 
As you can see from the release, total revenue was up 9% year-on-year in Q1, with perpetual product license up 10% and SaaS up 17%. Adjusted operating margin jumped to 29%. Adjusted EPS was $1.18 per share, up 80% from Q1 a year ago, and we generated a record $340 million in cash flow from operations.
In total, we closed 51 $1 million-plus transactions across products and services, an increase of 30%. The Americas region booked the majority with 42 of these, while EMEA had 5 and APJ had 4. 
A couple of points worth noting was that the average value of these large deals increased significantly from last year. And at the product level, there's good balance across the portfolio with roughly half coming from Workspace Services solutions and half from Delivery Networking. 
From a geo perspective when you exclude SaaS, the Americas was really the big driver in the quarter with revenue up 13%. EMEA finished up 1%, while results in APJ declined by 8% year-on-year. Since our restructuring last year occurred earlier in the U.S. versus the other geos, the America's teams have really had the most time to stabilize and adapt to these new structure, a key contributor to this performance.
Next, let's take a look at the Q1 results within our 3 primary groups. Our Workspace Services business grew 3% to about $400 million, including flat license revenue. Really more than any other, Workspace Services should benefit from the work we're doing to simplify our focus and strategy. And as we've reviewed before, there's a number of really specific initiatives we're driving to accelerate growth in this area through faster innovation, a more verticalized focus and aggregation of our unique assets. Within this business, there's a few dynamics I'd like to point out. First, growth in the Workspace Suite, which is our comprehensive solution for secure app and data delivery, was up more than 100%, contributing 8% of license revenues as compared to just 3% a year ago. 
Second, we continue to grow our CSP subscriptions, where partners primarily utilize app to deliver cloud-based offerings to their customers. Overall, CSP revenue grew over 30% in the quarter. 
Third, customer interest was more focused on application delivery versus VDI in Q1, lifting XenApp's standalone license sales by more than 10% from Q1 a year ago. 
And finally, we saw really good results in the Americas geo for overall Workspace service license. In total, it grew 7% and reflected the success of the restructuring within this business. This compares to flat year-on-year license growth in EMEA and a decline of 24% in the APAC region. 
Next, let's look at the Delivery Networking business, where total revenue increased 20% in the quarter to $195 million. This includes license revenue growth of 25%. 
Focusing on NetScaler. I'll remind everybody that the business is essentially made up of 3 segments: Cloud service providers; Citrix solutions sales and Enterprise ADC. Demand from the cloud providers continues to be really strong, contributing more than 60% of sales in the period due to growth in public cloud and cloud services, plus the addition of more than 100 new customers in this segment as we expand the opportunity base. Solution attached sales represented over 10% of the mix in Q1, with the number of app and mobile opportunities that included networking as part of the overall Citrix solution, up about 30% from a year ago. Core Enterprise ADC was about 25% of the mix in Q1, and we're beginning to see early traction from the new NetScaler ASD WAN products, which we're addressing the nascent market that's expected to grow significantly over the next few years. All in, we sold over 2,100 networking customers in the period with about 1/3 of them being new.
Finally, within our SaaS services, revenue in the quarter approached $200 million, growing in the mid-teens. About 85% of the SaaS revenue is being generated by the GoTo solutions that will be spitting off later this year. The spin project overall remains on track for the second half, and we expect to provide more detail on the performance of this unit within the Q2 time frame.
The majority of the other SaaS revenue is coming from ShareFile, our secure data platform. In Q1, this business grew 40% and is being driven by integrations with our enterprise solutions and enterprise sales motion.
Turning to operations. We've obviously shown rapid increase in margins over the past few quarters despite funding incremental investments in our growth businesses and certain go-to-market areas. As we've repeatedly discussed, our restructuring plans across the company are intended to generate permanent expense reductions and allow the company to execute more efficiently, while at the same time, driving greater scalability into the future. 
In Q1, we posted 29% adjusted operating margin, up over 900 basis points from last year and highest Q1 in over a decade. We're obviously well in our way to achieving the 30%-plus goal for fiscal '17. 
The focus on leverage has also helped to increase cash flow from operations, which was a record $340 million in Q1 and $1.1 billion for the trailing 12 months. This translates into approximately $2.18 per share in the quarter and over $6.83 per share for the past 4 quarters. 
And finally, we remained active in our share repurchase program, buying back about 850,000 shares last quarter. 
Before I wrap up, let me talk about the current outlook and expectations for Q2 and for the full year. Our operational programs are clearly working. We're happy with the results so far and confident in our plans for the year. At the same time, we want to remain mindful of the potential disruptions that can occur with any restructuring, the GoTo spin project and the significant revenue upside that we delivered in Q1. With that, we intend to remain conservative with all of our assumptions for Q2, while at the same time, still increasing current expectations.
So for Q2 '16, we expect revenue in a range of $810 million to $820 million and adjusted EPS of between $1.12 and $1.15 per share. For the full year '16, we're increasing our expectations to include revenue between $3.34 billion and $3.36 billion and adjusted EPS of $4.90 to $5 per share. I want to remind everybody that this guidance represents all the businesses, including those that are part of the plan GoTo spin. 
So now I'd like to turn it over to Kirill to provide further color on the quarter and our focus going forward. Kirill?"

Obviously, I'm very pleased with our performance this quarter on both the top line and the bottom line. It's clear that our efforts to refocus the company is starting to work. As we simplified our portfolio",1015,"Thank you, David. Hello, and welcome, everybody. Obviously, I'm very pleased with our performance this quarter on both the top line and the bottom line. It's clear that our efforts to refocus the company is starting to work. As we simplified our portfolio and sharpened our message, it made it easier for our sellers and channel partners to execute and deliver. This is really the case where refocus and restructuring is producing not only bottom line results, but also driving the revenue growth. In particular, I'm really excited about double-digit growth in license revenue. 
All in all, this was another quarter of great execution by a worldwide sales team. It also gives us confidence that the new promotional leadership, together with the revitalized channel programs sets us up on a path for continued healthy execution. 
With a large number of significant customer adds, we'll continue to demonstrate growth in our targeted industry verticals, especially in public sector, financial services and health care, where customers are transitioning from other virtualization networking and mobility providers to Citrix.
Specifically, as John Hopkins has chosen Citrix XenDesktop for VDI deployment, expanding our long-standing application virtualization partnership. The decision to replace the competitive offering was driven by the need to unify their clients' virtualization solutions and improved performance. On the network delivery site, Health was from another vendor to Citrix NetScaler because of the seamless integration with the rest of our portfolio, richness of the experience and reduced TCO. In enterprise mobility, we were selected multiple times over competition due to our unique capabilities, such as micro VPN application security and our integrated cross-device platform. Customers choosing XenMobile included the country's leading commercial real estate development firm and a major energy provider. These were all great wins, and they're just few of many examples where Citrix was chosen over the competition. 
Our engineering teams performed very well in Q1 and product delivery was strong, specifically, we announced and delivered capabilities to accelerate and simplify the deployment of Microsoft Skype for Business in the enterprise. We see very strong interest amongst largest customers deploying Skype for Business to roll it out on Citrix virtualization infrastructure. 
Overall, we see our Workspace Services business trending very positively. In addition to introducing new releases for the entire Xen family of products this quarter, we also launched our new secure browser service, which extend secure email access to web and SaaS applications. 
Q1 was also a big quarter for networking innovations, and we see growing interest in our advanced WAN activities that we announced in the quarter. We're also hitting new performance milestones for the industry, releasing virtualized NetScaler VPX with delivery speeds topping 100 gigabytes per second. 
In Q1, we also released NetScaler CPS, basically NetScaler in a doctor container, giving teams a production-grade tool they can use to speed development of new apps. We also expect NetScaler CPX to help accelerate IoT strategies. 
Finally, we have expanded the enterprise plant security and usability of our ShareFile portfolio, allowing customers to secure the share data and files from any source or location on-premise, in the cloud or across other file-sharing services. 
Overall, I feel great about product deliverables in Q1, and I feel they set us really well for the future and I'm super excited about product road map. 
I'd also like to give you a bit of a context on how we're evolving the Citrix strategy. Organizations a little experiencing dramatic changes in the way businesses operate and the way people work, moving more workloads to mobile devices into the cloud and across an array of networks. A growing number of new connected things or endpoints are creating huge volumes of data that need to be accessed, secured, transported and managed. And as I approach this mythical 90 days milestone as CEO of Citrix, there are 2 recurring themes that I'm hearing in my dialogues with customers, partners and key industry analysts. First, CIOs IT networking professionals feel overwhelmed by the heterogeneous environments they're being asked to manage today. They're even more concerned about all the new cloud apps, mobile devices and other connected things they're being asked to control. Cybersecurity is the top concern for all of them. And therefore, their ability to securely deliver apps and data to their people is top of mind. 
The second thing I learned from several surveys and direct dialogue with customers and the industry is that the Citrix brand is very well trusted and that our customers really like working with us. They love our products and the way that they deliver. However, in many cases, they don't yet see our end-to-end strategy, the breadth of our portfolio and how the whole is more than the sum of the parts. And this is precisely where I feel Citrix has a huge opportunity. It all starts with our vision: We aim to power will read people, organizations and things are securely connected and accessible to make the extraordinary possible. And our strategy is to build the world's best integrated technology services for secured delivery of apps and data anytime, anywhere on any device from any cloud. When able better by giving them secure, reliable and performance enterprise storefront to get access to all the apps and data they need to excel at their jobs. Security is the core underlying feature and the most important outcome of deploying Citrix technology with our network delivery through NetScaler, Workspace Services through the Xen family and secure file and think sharing through ShareFile, all integrated and working together to deliver on the singular mission. 
We will provide more details in our strategy in the upcoming Analyst Day at Synergy event next month. Today's results clearly demonstrate that the market is beginning to validate our vision and our strategy. When we examine the primary reasons why we're winning in the market, it's because of our reliable product performance and scalability, the openness and flexibility of our solutions, low PCL and our ability to provide it all as integrated solution working together. 
Thank you, and now I look forward to your questions."

Overall, talking about the industry and the demand environment, I'd say that the big stories in the quarter were the Americas performance. Really did a great job, drove a lot of the revenue, drove a lot of revenue upside as well. So those teams have been working through the restructuring from really the beginning of '15. So they're just humming along. We're a little bit further behind when it comes to the other 2 regions in terms of the work that we've been operating in. From a product standpoint, yes, NetScaler had a terrific quarter again, similar to the last -- really last 9 months have been very strong. It's combination of strength across some of the big trends around cloud build-out, cloud services, et cetera. We're also continuing to expand the customer opportunity size. I called out more than 20% growth in customers within that segment. Interestingly enough, we're also seeing a pretty rapid growth of NetScaler being consumed as a cloud service. And so while still only a kind of mid-single digits of the mix, that business is growing well over 100% as well. Shifting gears and talking about Workspace Services, couple of things to point out. Clearly, we're making good progress over the last several quarters. Some of the staff that we referenced in the prepared remarks, this week being the complete solution for our talking with customers about app and data delivery, that was up about 100%. The overall CSP business, which reminds you full subscription, was up about 30%. And one data point that I didn't put in the prepared remarks, but is also interesting is that when I look at units, units are actually growing year-on-year in the mid-single-digit range. And that's just a function of the mix of license type. So overall, for the Workspace Services business, about 18% of license this quarter was coming via subscription. That compares to 14% a year go. So we've got a couple of different dynamics in play, but the overall message is that we're up into the right across all of our major product areas. We're seeing terrific execution out of the Americas. We were happy and above kind of our internal expectation in multiple product areas, and we still see further upside because there's more work to do."

On the networking side, we all see the tremendous buildout of the data centers that continues. And NetScaler offering unique capabilities in a software-defined fashion truly participates in that build out. And that's what we see in the growth in the cloud provider segment. At the same time, the growth in e-commerce and the fact that even those companies that historically weren't participating in delivery of online goods and services now right in there, and they need to increase their networking throughput and capacity. That plays significant control. And of course, many of you NetScaler as essentially secure to product part of their cybersecurity strategy. And that's not a trend that plays to that. On the app virtualization and on the sort of overall Workspaces Services, XenApp is we're seeing significant interest in XenApp, and we see a significant interest in large customers wanting to virtualize application. And we see actually good growth in that particular product. From the trends point of view, I would say the introduction of Windows 10 in the enterprise is starting to be a driver that we're seeing. And many large customers that I had a chance to have dialogue within the last few weeks certainly looking at XenApp and XenDesktop as they sort of very significant important infrastructure for them to roll out Windows 10 in their enterprise. And we obviously expected that to grow and accelerate and continue. And new product introductions that happen in Q1 will only help with that also through the Skype for Business and secure web browser."

Do you feel like this is a sustainable growth rate into 2016? Should we be thinking that this is a double-digit grower in going forward?"

But as you pointed out, the last 9 months have been particularly strong. And so we're clearly taking share. Share is not broken out in terms of individual segments, but we took several points of share last year, and I think we've got the capabilities to do that going forward. If you look across our product portfolio, we've got a unique technology approach where we are a software company. And that gives us capability to deliver these types of technologies in a form factor of an appliance and highly virtualized appliance in a software package or via cloud consumption. And I think that gives us the ability to do some really unique things with customers that are going to play very, very well with all the meta-trends that are going on around us."

And the feedback that we're getting from the channel from customers and even from our own sellers, has been resoundingly positive. I would say our sweet message resonates incredibly well because this is precisely what customers want to implement. Our latest releases are very strong XenApp and XenDesktop 7.8 has richness functionality and lots of features that our competitors simply missing. At the same time, they're clearly providing this integrated environment. XenMobile our latest release in that area is very competitive, and we saw some very interesting takeouts with application management on mobile application management being the core strength area of ours. And that's again, the case where XenMobile working together with NetScaler, working together with ShareFile, provides this unique to get a scenario, and those are simply unmatched by competitors. So I think this is the case where we have something unique in our hands. Of course, there's always more things we need to do.

Before we begin, I want to state that we have posted product specification and historical revenue trends related to our product groupings to our Investor Relations website.
I'd like to remind you that today's conversation will contain forward-looking statements made under the safe harbor provision of the U.S. securities law. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Obviously, these risks could cause actual results to differ from those anticipated.

Copies are available from the SEC or on the company's Investor Relations website.
Furthermore, we will discuss various non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC's Reg G. A reconciliation of the differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures discussed on today's call can be found at the end of today's press release and on the Investor Relations page of our website.

As you can see, we continue to show great progress with the operational initiatives we introduced last year. We're focusing our energy towards our core strategy: The secure delivery of apps and data, really setting the company up for even better results, efficiency and growth as we look forward. 
As you can see from the release, total revenue was up 9% year-on-year in Q1, with perpetual product license up 10% and SaaS up 17%. Adjusted operating margin jumped to 29%. Adjusted EPS was $1.18 per share, up 80% from Q1 a year ago, and we generated a record $340 million in cash flow from operations.
In total, we closed 51 $1 million-plus transactions across products and services, an increase of 30%. The Americas region booked the majority with 42 of these, while EMEA had 5 and APJ had 4. 
A couple of points worth noting was that the average value of these large deals increased significantly from last year. And at the product level, there's good balance across the portfolio with roughly half coming from Workspace Services solutions and half from Delivery Networking. 
From a geo perspective when you exclude SaaS, the Americas was really the big driver in the quarter, with revenue up 13%. EMEA finished up 1%, while results in APJ declined by 8% year-on-year. Since our restructuring last year occurred earlier in the U.S. versus the other geos, the Americas teams have really had the most time to stabilize and adapt to this new structure, a key contributor to this performance.
Next, let's take a look at the Q1 results within our 3 primary groups. Our Workspace Services business grew 3% to about $400 million, including flat license revenue. Really more than any other, Workspace Services should benefit from the work we're doing to simplify our focus and strategy. And as we've reviewed before, there's a number of really specific initiatives we're driving to accelerate growth in this area through faster innovation, a more verticalized focus and aggregation of our unique assets. Within this business, there's a few dynamics I'd like to point out. First, growth in the Workspace Suite, which is our comprehensive solution for secure app and data delivery, was up more than 100%, contributing 8% of license revenue as compared to just 3% a year ago. 
Second, we continue to grow our CSP subscriptions, where partners primarily utilize XenApp to deliver cloud-based offerings to their customers. Overall, CSP revenue grew over 30% in the quarter. 
Third, customer interest was more focused on application delivery versus VDI in Q1, lifting XenApp's standalone license sales by more than 10% from Q1 a year ago. 
And finally, we saw really good results in the Americas geo for overall Workspace service license. In total, it grew 7% and reflected the success of the restructuring within this business. This compares to flat year-on-year license growth in EMEA and a decline of 24% in the APAC region. 
Next, let's look at the Delivery Networking business, where total revenue increased 20% in the quarter to $195 million. This includes license revenue growth of 25%. 
Focusing on NetScaler. I'll remind everybody that the business is essentially made up of 3 segments: Cloud service providers, Citrix Solution sales and Enterprise ADC. Demand from the cloud providers continues to be really strong, contributing more than 60% of sales in the period due to growth in public cloud and cloud services, plus the addition of more than 100 new customers in this segment as we expand the opportunity base. Solution attached sales represented over 10% of the mix in Q1, with the number of app and mobile opportunities that included networking as part of the overall Citrix Solution up about 30% from a year ago. Core Enterprise ADC was about 25% of the mix in Q1, and we're beginning to see early traction from the new NetScaler SD-WAN products, which were addressing the nascent market that's expected to grow significantly over the next few years. All in, we sold over 2,100 networking customers in the period with about 1/3 of them being new.
Finally, within our SaaS services, revenue in the quarter approached $200 million, growing in the mid-teens. About 85% of the SaaS revenue is being generated by the GoTo solutions that we'll be spitting off later this year. The spin project overall remains on track for the second half, and we expect to provide more detail on the performance of this unit within the Q2 time frame.
The majority of the other SaaS revenue is coming from ShareFile, our secure data platform. In Q1, this business grew 40% and is being driven by integrations with our enterprise solutions and enterprise sales motion.
Turning to operations. We've obviously shown rapid increase in margins over the past few quarters despite funding incremental investments in our growth businesses and certain go-to-market areas. As we've repeatedly discussed, our restructuring plans across the company are intended to generate permanent expense reductions and allow the company to execute more efficiently, while at the same time, driving greater scalability into the future. 
In Q1, we posted 29% adjusted operating margin, up over 900 basis points from last year and the highest Q1 in over a decade. We're obviously well in our way to achieving the 30%-plus goal for fiscal '17. 
The focus on leverage has also helped to increase cash flow from operations, which was a record $340 million in Q1 and $1.1 billion for the trailing 12 months. This translates into approximately $2.18 per share in the quarter and over $6.83 per share for the past 4 quarters. 
And finally, we remained active on our share repurchase program, buying back about 850,000 shares last quarter. 
Before I wrap up, let me talk about the current outlook and expectations for Q2 and for the full year. Our operational programs are clearly working. We're happy with the results so far and confident in our plans for the year. At the same time, we want to remain mindful of the potential disruptions that can occur with any restructuring, the GoTo spin project and the significant revenue upside that we delivered in Q1. With that, we intend to remain conservative with all of our assumptions for Q2, while at the same time, still increasing current expectations.
So for Q2 '16, we expect revenue in a range of $810 million to $820 million and adjusted EPS of between $1.12 and $1.15 per share. For the full year '16, we're increasing our expectations to include revenue between $3.34 billion and $3.36 billion, and adjusted EPS of $4.90 to $5 per share. I want to remind everybody that this guidance represents all the businesses, including those that are part of the planned GoTo spin. 
So now, I'd like to turn it over to Kirill to provide further color on the quarter and our focus areas going forward. Kirill?"

Obviously, I'm very pleased with our performance this quarter on both the top line and the bottom line. It's clear that our efforts to refocus the company is starting to work. As we simplified our portfolio",1030,"Thank you, David. Hello, and welcome, everybody. Obviously, I'm very pleased with our performance this quarter on both the top line and the bottom line. It's clear that our efforts to refocus the company is starting to work. As we simplified our portfolio and sharpened our message, it made it easier for our sellers and channel partners to execute and deliver. This is really the case where refocus and restructuring is producing not only bottom line results, but also driving the revenue growth. In particular, I'm really excited about double-digit growth in license revenue. 
All in all, this was another quarter of great execution by a worldwide sales team. It also gives us confidence that the new promotional leadership, together with the revitalized channel programs, sets us up on a path for continued healthy execution. 
With a large number of significant customer adds, we'll continue to demonstrate growth in our targeted industry verticals, especially in public sector, financial services and health care, where customers are transitioning from other virtualization, networking and mobility providers to Citrix.
Specifically, Johns Hopkins has chosen Citrix XenDesktop for VDI deployment, expanding our long-standing application and virtualization partnership. The decision to replace the competitive offering was driven by the need to unify their clients' virtualization solutions and improve performance. On the network delivery side, Salem Health [ph] moved from another vendor to Citrix NetScaler because of the seamless integration with the rest of our portfolio, richness of the experience and reduced TCO. In enterprise mobility, we were selected multiple times over competition due to our unique capabilities, such as MicroVPN for application security and our integrated cross-device platform. Customers choosing XenMobile included the country's leading commercial real estate development firm and a major energy provider. These were all great wins, and they're just few of many examples where Citrix was chosen over the competition. 
Our engineering teams performed very well in Q1 and product delivery was strong, specifically, we announced and delivered capabilities to accelerate and simplify the deployment of Microsoft Skype for Business in the enterprise. We see very strong interest amongst largest customers deploying Skype for Business to roll it out on Citrix virtualization infrastructure. 
Overall, we see our Workspace Services business trending very positively. In addition to introducing new releases for the entire Xen family of products this quarter, we also launched our new Secure Browser service, which extend secure remote access to web and SaaS applications. 
Q1 was also a big quarter for networking innovations. And we see growing interest in our advanced SD-WAN capabilities that we announced in the quarter, we're also hitting new performance milestones for the industry, releasing virtualized NetScaler VPX with delivery speeds topping 100 gigabytes per second. 
In Q1, we also released NetScaler CPX , basically a NetScaler in a darker container, giving [indiscernible] teams a production-grade tool they can use to speed development of new apps. We also expect NetScaler CPX to help accelerate IoT strategies. 
Finally, we have further expanded the enterprise plat security and usability of our ShareFile portfolio, allowing customers to securely share data and files from any source or location on-premise, in the cloud or across other file-sharing services. 
Overall, I feel great about product deliverables in Q1, and I feel they set us really well for the future and I'm super excited about product road map. 
I would also like to give you a bit of a context on how we're evolving the Citrix strategy. Organizations a little [ph] experiencing dramatic changes in the way businesses operate and the way people work, moving more workloads to mobile devices into the cloud and across an array of networks. A growing number of new connected things or endpoints are creating huge volumes of data that need to be accessed, secured, transported and managed. And as I approach this mythical 90 days milestone as CEO of Citrix, there are 2 recurring themes that I'm hearing in my dialogues with customers, partners and key industry analysts. First, CIOs, IT and networking professionals feel overwhelmed by the heterogeneous environments they're being asked to manage today. They're even more concerned about all the new cloud apps, mobile devices and other connected things they're being asked to control. Cybersecurity is the top concern for all of them, and therefore, their ability to securely deliver apps and data to their people is top of mind. 
The second thing I learned from several surveys and direct dialogue with customers and the industry is that the Citrix brand is very well trusted and that our customers really like working with us. They love our products and the way that they deliver. However, in many cases, they don't yet see our end-to-end strategy, the breadth of our portfolio and how the whole is more than the sum of the parts. And this is precisely where I feel Citrix has a huge opportunity. It all starts with our vision. We aim to power a world where people, organizations and things are securely connected and accessible to make the extraordinary possible. And our strategy is to build the world's best integrated technology services for secured delivery of apps and data anytime, anywhere on any device from any cloud. We enable people to work and live better by giving them secure, reliable and performance enterprise storefront to get access to all the apps and data they need to excel at their jobs. Security is the core underlying feature and the most important outcome of deploying Citrix technology with our network delivery through NetScaler, Workspace Services, through the Xen family and secure file and thinksharing through ShareFile, all integrated and working together to deliver on the singular mission. 
We will provide more details on our strategy in the upcoming Analyst Day at Synergy event next month. But even today's results clearly demonstrate that the market is beginning to validate our vision and our strategy. When we examine the primary reasons why we're winning in the market, it's because of our reliable product performance and scalability, the openness and flexibility of our solutions, low TCL and our ability to provide it all as integrated solution working together. 
Thank you. And now, we look forward to your questions."

Overall, talking about the industry and the demand environment, I'd say that the big stories in the quarter were the Americas' performance. Really did a great job, drove a lot of the revenue, drove a lot of revenue upside as well. So those teams have been working through the restructuring from really the beginning of '15. So they're just humming along. We're a little bit further behind when it comes to the other 2 regions in terms of the work that we've been operating against. From a product standpoint, yes. NetScaler had a terrific quarter again, similar to the last -- really, the last 9 months have been very strong. It's a combination of strength across the big trends around cloud build-out, cloud services, et cetera. We're also continuing to expand the customer opportunity size. I called out more than 20% growth in customers within that segment. Interestingly enough, we're also seeing a pretty rapid growth of NetScaler being consumed as a cloud service. And so while still only a kind of mid-single digits of the mix, that business is growing well over 100% as well. Shifting gears and talking about Workspace Services, couple of things to point out. Clearly, we've been making good progress over the last several quarters. Some of the staffs that we referenced in the prepared remarks, the suite being the complete solution for talking with customers about app and data delivery, that was up about 100%. The overall CSP business, which, remind you, is full subscription, was up about 30%. And one data point that I didn't put in the prepared remarks but is also interesting is that when I look at units, units are actually growing year-on-year in the mid-single-digit range. And that's just a function of the mix of license type. So overall, for the Workspace Services business, about 18% of license this quarter was coming in via subscription. That compares to 14% a year go. So we've got a couple of different dynamics in play, but the overall message is that we're up into the right across all of our major product areas. We're seeing terrific execution out of the Americas. We were happy and above kind of our internal expectation in multiple product areas, and we still see further upside because there's more work to do."

On the networking side, we all see the tremendous buildout of the data centers that continues, and NetScaler offering unique capabilities in a software-defined fashion truly participates in that buildout and that's what we see in the growth in the cloud provider segment. At the same time, the growth in e-commerce and the fact that even those companies that historically weren't participating in that delivery of online goods and services are now right in there and they need to increase their networking throughput and capacity. That plays significant control. And of course, many have used NetScaler as essentially security product or part of their cybersecurity strategy, and that's not a trend that plays to that. On the app virtualization and on the sort of overall Workspace's services, XenApp is -- we're seeing significant interest in XenApp, and we see a significant interest in large customers wanting to virtualize applications. And we see actually good growth in that particular product. From the trends point of view, I would say the introduction of Windows 10 in the enterprise is starting to be a driver that we're seeing. And many large customers that I had a chance to have dialogue within the last -- in the last few weeks certainly looking at XenApp and XenDesktop as the sort of very significant important infrastructure for them to roll out Windows 10 in the enterprise. And we obviously expected that to grow and accelerate and continue. And the new product introductions that happen in Q1 will only help with that also through the Skype for Business and secure web browser."

And as I mentioned a little earlier, we've been expanding that base. So trying to keep the size of the opportunity expanding at the same time. So we added a couple of hundred customers to that segment, and it's really a combination of all 3 of those that are driving the growth. Over the past few quarters, Q4, for example, have represented about 45% of the mix. It was 60% in Q1.

As we shared, we have seen some good strong winds and I'm quite excited about those. And we see customers who really want to work with us, customers who love our unified story, customers who love our capability. There was one particular one that I would mention that I had a chance to sit down, Friday, actually, in Paris. It's a large financial institution. They've just selected XenDesktop over VMware, VDI for 2 main reasons. One was overall cost of ownership and implementation; and two was capabilities and set of scenarios that only Citrix could support. And in particular, they discovered their proof of concept that only Citrix solution can support all broad range of peripherals that they wanted to run for virtualized desktop and that drove them to us. And that's just one example of many that we've seen, but at the same time, it's a competitive environment. We see our competitors discounting their solutions heavily. And in many cases, it's a combat. But we're here to win."

Share is not broken out in terms of individual segments, but we took several points of share last year. I think we've got the capabilities to do that going forward. If you look across our product portfolio, we've got a unique technology approach where we are a software company. And that gives us capability to deliver these types of technologies in the form factor of an appliance, a highly virtualized appliance in a software package or via cloud consumption.

And the feedback that we're getting from the channel from customers and even from our own sellers has been resoundingly positive. I would say our sweet message resonates incredibly well because this is precisely what customers want to implement. Our latest releases are very strong, XenApp, XenDesktop 7.8 has richness of functionality and lots of features that our competitors simply missing. At the same time, they're clearly providing this integrated environment. XenMobile 10.3, our latest release in that area, is very competitive, and we saw some very interesting takeouts with application management, on mobile application management being the core strength area of ours. And that's, again, the case where XenMobile working together with NetScaler working together with ShareFile, provides this unique better together scenario, and those are simply unmatched by competitors. So I think this is the case where we have something unique in our hands. Of course, there's always more things we need to do. Of course, we'll continue to evolve our solution and we will continue to invest in continuous research and development to add those new unique scenarios and embrace the needs of sort of new modern infrastructures and health enterprise move with the trends of sort of digital transformation.

The reason why we've gone through so much hard work on the restructuring is that it frees up the capital to be able to do that and deliver the upside the margins on an ongoing basis. So that's the goal."

As you can see, we continue to show great progress with the operational initiatives we introduced last year. We're focusing our energy towards our core strategy: The secure delivery of apps and data, really setting the company up for even better results, efficiency and growth as we look forward. 
As you can see from the release, total revenue was up 9% year-on-year in Q1, with perpetual product license up 10% and SaaS up 17%. Adjusted operating margin jumped to 29%. Adjusted EPS was $1.18 per share, up 80% from Q1 a year ago, and we generated a record $340 million in cash flow from operations.
In total, we closed 51 $1 million-plus transactions across products and services, an increase of 30%. The Americas region booked the majority with 42 of these, while EMEA had 5 and APJ had 4. 
A couple of points worth noting was that the average value of these large deals increased significantly from last year. And at the product level, there's good balance across the portfolio with roughly half coming from Workspace Services solutions and half from Delivery Networking. 
From a geo perspective when you exclude SaaS, the Americas was really the big driver in the quarter, with revenue up 13%. EMEA finished up 1%, while results in APJ declined by 8% year-on-year. Since our restructuring last year occurred earlier in the U.S. versus the other geos, the Americas teams have really had the most time to stabilize and adapt to this new structure, a key contributor to this performance.
Next, let's take a look at the Q1 results within our 3 primary groups. Our Workspace Services business grew 3% to about $400 million, including flat license revenue. Really more than any other, Workspace Services should benefit from the work we're doing to simplify our focus and strategy. And as we've reviewed before, there's a number of really specific initiatives we're driving to accelerate growth in this area through faster innovation, a more verticalized focus and aggregation of our unique assets. Within this business, there's a few dynamics I'd like to point out. First, growth in the Workspace Suite, which is our comprehensive solution for secure app and data delivery, was up more than 100%, contributing 8% of license revenue as compared to just 3% a year ago. 
Second, we continue to grow our CSP subscriptions, where partners primarily utilize XenApp to deliver cloud-based offerings to their customers. Overall, CSP revenue grew over 30% in the quarter. 
Third, customer interest was more focused on application delivery versus VDI in Q1, lifting XenApp's standalone license sales by more than 10% from Q1 a year ago. 
And finally, we saw really good results in the Americas geo for overall Workspace service license. In total, it grew 7% and reflected the success of the restructuring within this business. This compares to flat year-on-year license growth in EMEA and a decline of 24% in the APAC region. 
Next, let's look at the Delivery Networking business, where total revenue increased 20% in the quarter to $195 million. This includes license revenue growth of 25%. 
Focusing on NetScaler. I'll remind everybody that the business is essentially made up of 3 segments: Cloud service providers, Citrix Solution sales and Enterprise ADC. Demand from the cloud providers continues to be really strong, contributing more than 60% of sales in the period due to growth in public cloud and cloud services, plus the addition of more than 100 new customers in this segment as we expand the opportunity base. Solution attached sales represented over 10% of the mix in Q1, with the number of app and mobile opportunities that included networking as part of the overall Citrix Solution up about 30% from a year ago. Core Enterprise ADC was about 25% of the mix in Q1, and we're beginning to see early traction from the new NetScaler SD-WAN products, which were addressing the nascent market that's expected to grow significantly over the next few years. All in, we sold over 2,100 networking customers in the period with about 1/3 of them being new.
Finally, within our SaaS services, revenue in the quarter approached $200 million, growing in the mid-teens. About 85% of the SaaS revenue is being generated by the GoTo solutions that we'll be spitting off later this year. The spin project overall remains on track for the second half, and we expect to provide more detail on the performance of this unit within the Q2 time frame.
The majority of the other SaaS revenue is coming from ShareFile, our secure data platform. In Q1, this business grew 40% and is being driven by integrations with our enterprise solutions and enterprise sales motion.
Turning to operations. We've obviously shown rapid increase in margins over the past few quarters despite funding incremental investments in our growth businesses and certain go-to-market areas. As we've repeatedly discussed, our restructuring plans across the company are intended to generate permanent expense reductions and allow the company to execute more efficiently, while at the same time, driving greater scalability into the future. 
In Q1, we posted 29% adjusted operating margin, up over 900 basis points from last year and the highest Q1 in over a decade. We're obviously well in our way to achieving the 30%-plus goal for fiscal '17. 
The focus on leverage has also helped to increase cash flow from operations, which was a record $340 million in Q1 and $1.1 billion for the trailing 12 months. This translates into approximately $2.18 per share in the quarter and over $6.83 per share for the past 4 quarters. 
And finally, we remained active on our share repurchase program, buying back about 850,000 shares last quarter. 
Before I wrap up, let me talk about the current outlook and expectations for Q2 and for the full year. Our operational programs are clearly working. We're happy with the results so far and confident in our plans for the year. At the same time, we want to remain mindful of the potential disruptions that can occur with any restructuring, the GoTo spin project and the significant revenue upside that we delivered in Q1. With that, we intend to remain conservative with all of our assumptions for Q2, while at the same time, still increasing current expectations.
So for Q2 '16, we expect revenue in a range of $810 million to $820 million and adjusted EPS of between $1.12 and $1.15 per share. For the full year '16, we're increasing our expectations to include revenue between $3.34 billion and $3.36 billion, and adjusted EPS of $4.90 to $5 per share. I want to remind everybody that this guidance represents all the businesses, including those that are part of the planned GoTo spin. 
So now, I'd like to turn it over to Kirill to provide further color on the quarter and our focus areas going forward. Kirill?"

Obviously, I'm very pleased with our performance this quarter on both the top line and the bottom line. It's clear that our efforts to refocus the company is starting to work. As we simplified our portfolio",1030,"Thank you, David. Hello, and welcome, everybody. Obviously, I'm very pleased with our performance this quarter on both the top line and the bottom line. It's clear that our efforts to refocus the company is starting to work. As we simplified our portfolio and sharpened our message, it made it easier for our sellers and channel partners to execute and deliver. This is really the case where refocus and restructuring is producing not only bottom line results, but also driving the revenue growth. In particular, I'm really excited about double-digit growth in license revenue. 
All in all, this was another quarter of great execution by our worldwide sales team. It also gives us confidence that the new promotional leadership, together with the revitalized channel programs, sets us up on a path for continued healthy execution. 
With a large number of significant customer adds, we'll continue to demonstrate growth in our targeted industry verticals, especially in public sector, financial services and health care, where customers are transitioning from other virtualization, networking and mobility providers to Citrix.
Specifically, Johns Hopkins has chosen Citrix XenDesktop for VDI deployment, expanding our long-standing application and virtualization partnership. The decision to replace the competitive offering was driven by the need to unify their clients' virtualization solutions and improve performance. On the network delivery side, Salem Health moved from another vendor to Citrix NetScaler because of the seamless integration with the rest of our portfolio, richness of the experience and reduced TCO. In enterprise mobility, we were selected multiple times over competition due to our unique capabilities, such as MicroVPN for application security and our integrated cross-device platform. Customers choosing XenMobile included the country's leading commercial real estate development firm and a major energy provider. These were all great wins, and they're just few of many examples where Citrix was chosen over the competition. 
Our engineering teams performed very well in Q1 and product delivery was strong, specifically, we announced and delivered capabilities to accelerate and simplify the deployment of Microsoft Skype for Business in the enterprise. We see very strong interest amongst the largest customers deploying Skype for Business to roll it out on Citrix virtualization infrastructure. 
Overall, we see our Workspace Services business trending very positively. In addition to introducing new releases for the entire Xen family of products this quarter, we also launched our new Secure Browser service, which extend secure remote access to web and SaaS applications. 
Q1 was also a big quarter for networking innovations. And we see growing interest in our advanced SD-WAN capabilities that we announced in the quarter, we're also hitting new performance milestones for the industry, releasing virtualized NetScaler VPX with delivery speeds topping 100 gigabytes per second. 
In Q1, we also released NetScaler CPX, basically a NetScaler in a darker container, giving dev ops teams a production-grade tool they can use to speed development of new apps. We also expect NetScaler CPX to help accelerate IoT strategies. 
Finally, we have further expanded the enterprise plat security and usability of our ShareFile portfolio, allowing customers to securely share data and files from any source or location on-premise, in the cloud or across other file-sharing services. 
Overall, I feel great about product deliverables in Q1, and I feel they set us really well for the future and I'm super excited about product road map. 
I would also like to give you a bit of a context on how we're evolving the Citrix strategy. Organizations of all sizes experiencing dramatic changes in the way businesses operate and the way people work, moving more workloads to mobile devices into the cloud and across an array of networks. A growing number of new connected things or endpoints are creating huge volumes of data that need to be accessed, secured, transported and managed. And as I approach this mythical 90 days milestone as CEO of Citrix, there are 2 recurring themes that I'm hearing in my dialogues with customers, partners and key industry analysts. First, CIOs, IT and networking professionals feel overwhelmed by the heterogeneous environments they're being asked to manage today. They're even more concerned about all the new cloud apps, mobile devices and other connected things they're being asked to control. Cybersecurity is the top concern for all of them, and therefore, their ability to securely deliver apps and data to their people is top of mind. 
The second thing I learned from several surveys and direct dialogue with customers and the industry is that the Citrix brand is very well trusted and that our customers really love working with us. They love our products and the bandwidth [ph] they deliver. However, in many cases, they don't yet see our end-to-end strategy, the breadth of our portfolio and how the whole is more than the sum of the parts. And this is precisely where I feel Citrix has a huge opportunity. It all starts with our vision. We aim to power a world where people, organizations and things are securely connected and accessible to make the extraordinary possible. And our strategy is to build the world's best integrated technology services for secured delivery of apps and data anytime, anywhere on any device from any cloud. We enable people to work and live better by giving them secure, reliable and performance enterprise storefront to get access to all the apps and data they need to excel at their jobs. 
Security is the core underlying feature and the most important outcome of deploying Citrix technology with our network delivery through NetScaler, Workspace Services, through the Xen family and secure file and thinksharing through ShareFile, all integrated and working together to deliver on the singular mission. 
We will provide more details on our strategy in the upcoming Analyst Day at Synergy event next month. But even today's results clearly demonstrate that the market is beginning to validate our vision and our strategy. When we examine the primary reasons why we're winning in the market, it's because of our reliable product performance and scalability, the openness and flexibility of our solutions, low TCO and our ability to provide it all as integrated solution working together.

Overall, talking about the industry and the demand environment, I'd say that the big stories in the quarter were the Americas' performance. Really did a great job, drove a lot of the revenue, drove a lot of revenue upside as well. So those teams have been working through the restructuring from really the beginning of '15. So they're just humming along. We're a little bit further behind when it comes to the other 2 regions in terms of the work that we've been operating against. From a product standpoint, yes. NetScaler had a terrific quarter again, similar to the last -- really, the last 9 months have been very strong. It's a combination of strength across the big trends around cloud build-out, cloud services, et cetera. We're also continuing to expand the customer opportunity size. I called out more than 20% growth in customers within that segment. Interestingly enough, we're also seeing a pretty rapid growth of NetScaler being consumed as a cloud service. And so while still only a kind of mid-single digits of the mix, that business is growing well over 100% as well. Shifting gears and talking about Workspace Services, couple of things to point out. Clearly, we've been making good progress over the last several quarters. Some of the stats that we referenced in the prepared remarks, the suite being the complete solution for talking with customers about app and data delivery, that was up about 100%. The overall CSP business, which, remind you, is full subscription, was up about 30%. And one data point that I didn't put in the prepared remarks but is also interesting is that when I look at units, units are actually growing year-on-year in the mid-single-digit range. And that's just a function of the mix of license type. So overall, for the Workspace Services business, about 18% of license this quarter was coming in via subscription. That compares to 14% a year ago. So we've got a couple of different dynamics in play, but the overall message is that we're up into the right across all of our major product areas. We're seeing terrific execution out of the Americas. We were happy and above kind of our internal expectation in multiple product areas, and we still see further upside because there's more work to do."

On the networking side, we all see the tremendous buildout of the data centers that continues, and NetScaler offering unique capabilities in a software-defined fashion truly participates in that buildout and that's what we see in the growth in the cloud provider segment. At the same time, the growth in e-commerce and the fact that even those companies that historically weren't participating in the delivery of online goods and services are now right in there and they need to increase their networking throughput and capacity. That plays significant control. And of course, many have used NetScaler as essentially security product or part of their cybersecurity strategy, and that's not a trend that plays to that. On the app virtualization and on the sort of overall Workspace's services, XenApp is -- we're seeing significant interest in XenApp, and we see a significant interest in large customers wanting to virtualize applications. And we see actually good growth in that particular product. From the trends point of view, I would say the introduction of Windows 10 in the enterprise is starting to be a driver that we're seeing. And many large customers that I had a chance to have dialogue with in the last -- in the last few weeks certainly looking at XenApp and XenDesktop as the sort of very significant important infrastructure for them to roll out Windows 10 in the enterprise. And we obviously expected that to grow and accelerate and continue. And the new product introductions that happen in Q1 will only help with that also through the Skype for Business and secure web browser."

And as I mentioned a little earlier, we've been expanding that base. So trying to keep the size of the opportunity expanding at the same time. So we added a couple of hundred customers to that segment, and it's really a combination of all 3 of those that are driving the growth.

On the other angle, there is Windows 10 phenomenon in the enterprise that essentially drives sort of reinvigoration of desire to put traditional apps -- legacy apps, for lack of a better word, into the modern desktops or deliver modern desktops through XenDesktop to the legacy hardware. Both trends would be playing here in the future without a doubt."

There was one particular one that I would mention that I had a chance to sit down, Friday, actually, in Paris. It's a large financial institution. They've just selected XenDesktop over VMware, VDI for 2 main reasons. One was overall cost of ownership and implementation; and two was capabilities and sort of scenarios that only Citrix could support. And in particular, they discovered their proof of concept that only Citrix solution can support all broad range of peripherals that they wanted to run for virtualized desktop and that drove them to us. And that's just one example of many that we've seen, but at the same time, it's a competitive environment. We see our competitors discounting their solutions heavily.

And the feedback that we're getting from the channel from customers and even from our own sellers has been resoundingly positive. I would say our suite message resonates incredibly well because this is precisely what customers want to implement. Our latest releases are very strong, XenApp, XenDesktop 7.8 has richness of functionality and lots of features that our competitors' simply missing. At the same time, they're clearly providing this integrated environment. XenMobile 10.3, our latest release in that area, is very competitive, and we saw some very interesting takeouts with application management, on mobile application management being the core strength area of ours. And that's, again, the case where XenMobile working together with NetScaler working together with ShareFile, provides this unique better together scenario, and those are simply unmatched by competitors. So I think this is the case where we have something unique in our hands. Of course, there's always more things we need to do.

We continue to show great results from the operational initiatives we introduced last year. We are focusing all of our energy on our core strategy of securely delivering of apps and data, allowing for this consistent execution and really setting the company up for profitable growth as we look forward.
As you can see from the release, total revenue was up 6% year-on-year in Q2, with product license up 7% and SaaS up 14%. Adjusted operating margin was 28%. Adjusted EPS was $1.20 per share, up 20% from Q2 a year ago, and we also generated $228 million in cash flow from operations. 
In total, we closed 61 $1 million plus transactions across products and services, an increase of 33% year-on-year, with particular strength coming from financial services, health care and cloud verticals. There's also a good balance across the portfolio. More than half of these transactions coming from Workspace Services solutions, the increasing number from Delivery Networking and even our largest-ever single contract around Enterprise file, sync and share. 
From a geo perspective, excluding the GoTo business, revenue from the Americas was up 11% while EMEA and APJ both declined modestly. The Americas Geo continue to be the really growth engine for a number quarters now. This region is where a restructuring activities began over the last year, and therefore had the benefit of stability and continuity, a key contributor to this performance and a model for changes that were making elsewhere in the world.
So next, let's look at our Q2 results within our primary groups. Our Workspace Services business, including app virtualization and Mobility grew about 2% to $412 million, including a 1% year-on-year increase in license revenue. The results show that this business is benefiting from the strategy and increased focus applied last year. And as we've discussed before, there's a number of specific initiatives that we're driving to accelerate growth in this area through faster innovation, more verticalized solutions and aggregation of our unique assets. Within this area, there's a few dynamics that are worth noting. First, total revenue from the Workspace suite, which is our comprehensive solution for secure app and data delivery, was up more than 70%, contributed about 12% of license revenue.
Second, we continue to grow our CSP subscriptions, where partners primarily utilize XenApp to deliver cloud-based offerings to their customers. Overall, CSP revenue grew 37% to an ARR of about $75 million. And finally, we saw a great results coming out of the Americas Geo for overall Workspace Services where license revenue grew 23% in the quarter and 16% for the first half, really, led by demand from the suite.
Next, looking at our Delivery Networking. Total revenue increased 11% in the quarter to $195 million, with license growth of 16%. When you focus just on NetScaler, I'll remind everybody that the business is essentially made up of 3 segments: cloud infrastructure and service providers, Citrix solution sales and Enterprise ADC. Demand from the cloud customers continues to be really strong, consistent with what we've seen over the past year. This segment contributed about half of NetScaler product bookings. 
Solution attached sales represented 15% of the mix in Q2, with a number of app and mobile opportunities that included networking as part of an overall Citrix solution, consistent with what we saw a year ago. 
Enterprise ADC was about 1/3 of the mix in Q2, and we're seeing increased traction from the new NetScaler SD-WAN products, which is addressing the nascent market but one that's expected to grow, really, significantly over the next few years. All in, we sold over 1,900 networking customers in the period with over 1/3 of them being net new. 
And finally, our SaaS delivered revenue was up 14%, contributing over $200 million in the quarter. The contribution from the GoTo solutions was $169 million, growing 10.5% from a year ago. As we announced earlier today, we're merging this business with LogMeIn over the next few quarters. But until this transaction is completed, we'll continue to operate as consolidated entity for reporting and guidance purposes. More detail on the performance of the GoTo businesses, and individual segments will be included in the LogMeIn S-4 filing which is expected later this quarter.
Looking back on the other core Citrix cloud-based services, it contributed $33 million in total revenue, growing at 30%. The bulk of this is coming from ShareFile, our secure data platform, and other new services addressing mobile networking and desktop needs for our customers.
So clearly, we're beginning to see a shift in the way that products are being consumed by our customers, evolving slowly towards a consumption-based model. When we include revenue coming from the CSP program, our cloud-based services, excluding GoTo, and any term licenses, the aggregate ARR was over $200 million in Q2, growing [ph] more than 30%. We'll begin to break this out each quarter to provide more visibility into this dynamic.
Shifting gears and turning to operations. We've shown a rapid increase in margin over the last few quarters despite funding incremental investments in our growth businesses and certain go-to-market areas. Our restructuring plans across the company are intended to generate permanent expense reductions, allowing the company to execute more efficiently, while also driving scalability into the future.
In Q2, we posted 28% adjusted op margin, which was up 300 basis points from a year ago. We're clearly operating well ahead of our stated goal of reaching 30% in the fiscal year '17. 
The focus on leverage has also really helped increase cash flow from operations, which was up 13% in the quarter to $228 million and up 31% on a trailing 12-month basis. This translates into approximately $1.46 per share in the quarter and over $7 on share over the last 4 quarters.
Before I wrap up, let me talk about our current outlook and expectations for the remainder of the year. Our operational programs and strategy is clearly working, and we're happy with the results and confident in our plans for the balance of the year. At the same time, we're going to remain conservative given the restructuring, the GoTo merger and the significant revenue upside that we deliver in the first half of this year. That said, we're going to increase our assumptions for Q3 and for the full year.
For Q3 '16, we now expect revenue in the range of $820 million to $830 million and adjusted EPS of between $1.18 and $1.20 per share. For the full year 2016, we're increasing our expectations to include revenue between $3.37 billion and $3.39 billion, and adjusted EPS of $5 and $5.10 per share. This rate represents 3% to 4% growth on the top line in more than 15% growth in adjusted EPS. A reminder that this guidance represents all businesses, including those that are part of the planned GoTo merger. So now I'd like to turn it over to Kirill to give you further color on the quarter and the focus on areas going forward. Kirill?"

Our product teams have delivered on all commitments, enabling us to make a number of powerful announcement that the Synergy events in late May. Specifically, we announced and delivered XenApp XenDesktop 7.9, new NetScaler with an option to deliver in a docket container and also brand new management and analytics system in NetScaler and also ShareFile's new information rights management, amongst many or other advanced capabilities. 
We've also announced our renewed in stronger than ever partnership with Microsoft. And most importantly, we shared our strategy to become the leader in Workspace as a service and accelerate our move to the cloud. All these announcements and product delivery received resoundingly positive feedback from all constituencies. Our innovation and partnerships are clearly fueling the continued strength in our execution and position us as #1 or 2 in all market segments where we play. 
Adding some comments to the Q2 results that David just shared. I'm very pleased to see that our Workspace Services business or Xen family is delivering growth, reversing past trends and clearly regaining market share. This quarter, our rate of growth in net new customers for XenApp/XenDesktop reached strong double-digit growth year-over-year. 
XenMobile contributed stronger to the overall suite. Last month, Citrix was yet again positioned as a leader in Gartner's Magic Quadrant for Enterprise Mobility Management suite. 
On our transformation to the cloud. The growth in ShareFile reached 30% year-over-year in new sales, and our Citrix service provided business continues to grow at a rapid pace, 37 percentage points year-over-year, primarily delivering XenApp and XenDesktop as a cloud service. That also now adding XenMobile and NetScaler as cloud service as well. We clearly see that cloud is a strong growth catalyst for Citrix, really positive sign as we continue to focus on the evolving Citrix cloud strategy. Overall, this was a terrific quarter for our worldwide sales team, particularly our Americas team executed extremely well into the quarter. 
We just completed a comprehensive review of our operations in EMEA, and we see strong opportunities in the region, of course balancing it with the other geopolitical headwinds. We've seen some strong winds and Asia Pacific and Japan, and we have high growth aspirations for that regions also. This was an incredible quarter adding new customers to the Citrix family, but also solidifying our existing customer relationships. We also saw significant growth in large deals, as David mentioned, and we saw strengths in our targeted industry verticals, particularly financial services and health care with nearly 1/3 of our largest wins represented by health care organizations. 
A significant number of customers are moving from other virtualization and networking vendors to Citrix. In fact, we have nearly 800 combined competitive wins or replacements against our top competitors in Q2. Amongst more noticeable competitive wins in Q2, catering health network, a long-time competitors customer with more than 12,000 employees and 2,100 physicians chose XenDesktop for VDI deployment. Another win from a major short-term housing provider in the United States selected Citrix cloud delivered XenApp and XenDesktop to support business-critical applications in more than 180 locations. This win serves a nice example of XenApp and XenDesktop returning to growth and regaining market share. 
Our renewed and strength in Microsoft partnership started to bear fruit already in this past quarter. We'll work with Microsoft on an engagement with a cellular carrier owned by LG Corporation. It was the largest-ever deal closed in carrier [ph] for Citrix with 29,000 licenses being deployed to help enhance security and productivity. On strengthening our existing customer relationships, one of the world's largest investment banks, a long-standing XenApp and XenDesktop took customer moved to allow Citrix to its worldwide operations, encompassing more than 200,000 employees. The bank's decision to choose Citrix was heavily influenced by our unique ability to execute virtualized type of business, and this was only 1 of many such examples. Microsoft recently issued a technical guidance, making an ambiguous statement that Citrix is the clear choice for deploying Skype for Business in virtualized environments. We anticipate that our partnership and alignment with Microsoft will provide us continued additional lift in end user computing. 
On the network delivery side, CMA Insurance, one of the largest commercial insurance companies in the United States replaced and established competitive networking vendor with Citrix NetScaler, making it the cornerstone for their network in infrastructure. CNHL NetScaler will provide quality and user experience to their employees and the mission-critical applications. Essentially, it is an ADC scenario in the Enterprise.
And finally, ShareFile continues to provide itself as an industry leader quickly gaining share in the market. We're seeing our efforts to extend ShareFile to the Enterprise segment paid big dividends with the highest number of large deals ever. Among those large scale wins with ShareFile was one of the largest accounting firm standardized on ShareFile to enable secure collaboration and workflows between their consultants and the clients. With accounting being a target vertical for ShareFile, this win now gives ShareFile 2 of the top of 4 accounting firms as customers. 
Our unique differentiators clearly help ShareFile to continue stand out against generic cloud storage providers. In fact, last week, Citrix was positioned as a leader in Gartner's Magic Quadrant for Enterprise file sync and share for the third consecutive year. Needless to say, we see very bright future for ShareFile. This week marks my sixth month as Citrix CEO in a more enthusiastic than ever. Our results demonstrates that we're on the right path, building new Citrix. I feel highly confident that we have the right strategy and the plan to execute upon it. I'm incredibly excited about the future of Citrix. Today's announcement with LogMeIn will allow us to continue focus our resources and investments and accelerate our execution and results. Thank you, and we look forward to your questions."

You've seen a couple of years back. And unfortunately, the pressure there is abating. Hence, the performance has really come back on that front. I'd say that as we've talked about a couple of times, we're uplifting the ARR by delivering new offerings and really migrating customers towards higher value subscriptions. And so as of last quarter, we had about 25% of the installed base migrated. We're going to be make a larger portion, the second half of the year when we're accelerating that, so I think that's one of the things it's going to continue to drive license update and maintenance going forward. I've say that second thing is a little bit of a timing issue with our largest installed base customer for an order that came in right after the close of the quarter, which influenced that to a kind of a mid-single-digit millions range.

We've seen some really examples where collaboration is already occurring. LGU Plus in Korea was one such example and there are many more. And I would expect to see a lot more. This is clearly the case where this is win-win for both companies. Citrix is truly helping Microsoft deploy Skype for Business and virtualized setting in the large enterprises, and that's how we want to deploy Skype for Business. This is also the case where Citrix has ready to go technology to help deploy Windows scan in the Enterprise. And obviously, Microsoft is very focused on that deployment. And all of that, as even before, we realized some additional product integrations that are coming later in the next 12 months and Enterprise mobility suite and NetScaler with Azure and more on Azure integration.

So we're really happy with execution across the board. When you kind of step back a little bit and think about for the core Citrix, excluding the part of this merging, LogMeIN. That part of the business is operating between 1.5 and 2 percentage points higher on an adjusted op margin than the consolidated whole. So we're clearly well above the 30% range already from a core Citrix point of view. As it comes to providing more granularity into the individual pieces, the S-4 will be filed by LogMeIN later this quarter. And so at that point in time, you'll have better position to look at the individual performance of the GoTo business stand-alone, the forecast moving forward, et cetera.

As I mentioned, we've received another strong accolade from Gartner being named as a leader in their Magic Quadrant and the product was done very well. We have some unique differentiators that continue to play out for us. In particular, we differentiate by delivering earnings set of capabilities in mobile application management as opposed to just generic low-cost mobile device management. And these are the capabilities that are being valued and bring-your-own-device scenarios. These are capabilities that actually being valued by Microsoft. They are core to our alignment with Microsoft between XenMobile in Enterprise mobility suite, and we see continued strength and growth in that market. Yet again, we differentiate by focusing on mobile application management by delivering unique capabilities like MicroVPN and really focusing on a suite with XenMobile, which ShareFile and with NetScaler playing significant role in that particular rollout. And we also continue to strengthen our portfolio and our solutions with some additional capabilities like the new forms application that was introduced as part of XenMobile in June. It's being very well received by our customers yet again, focusing on applications versus device itself. So we're quite excited about what we have with XenMobile. We predominantly see it as a part of the overall suite of the overall offering. We see more and more customers choosing XenMobile to be delivered to the cloud service, and we expect to see more of that, and we are quite excited and bullish about that particular product."

Microsoft just issued technical guidance on potentially stating that Citrix is clear choice to deploy Skype for Business this way. We have solution to deploy Windows 10 and the Enterprise and the virtualized in VDI fashion, and that is incredibly well received and that is a huge priority for Microsoft. We certainly expect both of those existing initiatives to start bearing more fruit. Of course, it depends on overall Skype for Business adoption in the Enterprise. It all depends on Windows 10 adoption to Enterprise, and we continue to work with Microsoft to advance it.

Overall, I wouldn't say there's anything explicit in our guidance. However, implicitly, we are certainly talking about a model shift that we've seen gradually. For us, we're in the fortunate position where a lot of it is incremental to what we've already done. The CSP, for example, which is ratable coming out on the Workspace Services business is addressing SMBs and other areas that other core products wouldn't have. That business is running about a $75 million ARR right now. When I look back at core Citrix cloud delivered services, ShareFile is clearly the biggest, but we've also rolled out new services around XenMobile. We delivered networking actually as a service. We have desktop and VDI and some of those other things that we are rolling out as new services. When you aggregate those together, that business is running at about a 30% clip, and it's generating an ARR of roughly $130 million per year. So when you put those 2 together, and we are seeing on over $200 million annualized recurring revenue growing north of 30% right now. That's probably the best way to really frame out the shift that we've seen over the past couple of years versus a type of revenue model that you would've had historically. It will be a shift to continue. We're going to talk about this metric each and every quarter to get people more visibility into how that's moving. And when the time comes, not in fiscal year '16, when the time comes, we're going to be more aggressive and our shift in the installed base or something that could have a material impact, we make sure we talk about that well in advance and communicate that explicitly as part of guidance."

And so the other thing that I would mention is with the engineering work that Citrix have been doing over the last few years, we're now uniquely positioned to deliver XenApp and XenDesktop essentially application virtualization and desktop virtualization on the same platform. And we're seeing quite a strong number of customers really wanting to do both of the same platform. And some of those who are using XenApp in the past now want to deploy DDI and having the same platform and the same infrastructure really enable them to do it with ease using the same tools, using the same life cycle manager -- management, that's the trend. And perhaps, the final thing that I would mention that sort of the Americas apart from the rest of the geos, here in Americas, the team embrace vertical focus ahead of everyone else. And if you think about health care win, most of us happen here in Americas. And if you think about financial sector and focus there, most of those wins actually happens in Americas as well.

We continue to show great results from the operational initiatives we introduced last year. We are focusing all of our energy on our core strategy of securely delivering apps and data, allowing for this consistent execution and really setting the company up for profitable growth as we look forward.
And as you can see from the release, total revenue was up 6% year-on-year in Q2, with product license up 7% and SaaS up 14%. Adjusted operating margin was 28%. Adjusted EPS was $1.20 per share, up 20% from Q2 a year ago, and we also generated $228 million in cash flow from operations. 
In total, we closed 61 $1 million-plus transactions across products and services, an increase of 33% year-on-year, with particular strength coming from financial services, health care and cloud verticals. There's also a good balance across the portfolio. More than half of these transactions coming from Workspace Services solutions, the increasing number from Delivery Networking and even our largest-ever single contract around Enterprise file, sync and share. 
From a geo perspective, excluding the GoTo business, revenue from the Americas was up 11% while EMEA and APJ both declined modestly. The Americas geo has continued to really be the growth engine for a number quarters now. This region is where our restructuring activities began over the last year, and therefore has had the benefit of stability and continuity, a key contributor to this performance and a model for changes that we're making elsewhere in the world.
So next, let's look at our Q2 results within our primary groups. Our Workspace Services business, including app virtualization and mobility grew about 2% to $412 million, including a 1% year-on-year increase in license revenue. The results show that this business is benefiting from the strategy and increased focus applied last year. And as we've discussed before, there's a number of specific initiatives that we're driving to accelerate growth in this area through faster innovation, more verticalized solutions and aggregation of our unique assets. Within this area, there's a few dynamics that are worth noting. First, total revenue from the Workspace suite, which is our comprehensive solution for secure app and data delivery, was up more than 70%, contributed about 12% of license revenue.
Second, we continue to grow our CSP subscriptions, where partners primarily utilize XenApp to deliver cloud-based offerings to their customers. Overall, CSP revenue grew 37% to an ARR of about $75 million. And finally, we saw great results coming out of the Americas geo for overall Workspace Services, where license revenue grew 23% in the quarter and 16% for the first half, really led by demand from the suite.
Next looking at our Delivery Networking. Total revenue increased 11% in the quarter to $195 million, with license growth of 16%. When you focus just on NetScaler, I'll remind everybody that the business is essentially made up of 3 segments: cloud infrastructure and service providers, Citrix solution sales and Enterprise ADC. Demand from the cloud customers continues to be really strong, consistent with what we've seen over the past year. This segment contributed about half of NetScaler product bookings. 
Solution attached sales represented 15% of the mix in Q2, with a number of app and mobile opportunities that included networking as part of an overall Citrix solution, consistent with what we saw a year ago. 
Enterprise ADC was about 1/3 of the mix in Q2, and we're seeing an increased traction from the new NetScaler SD-WAN products, which is addressing a nascent market but one that's expected to grow really significantly over the next few years. All in, we sold over 1,900 networking customers in the period with over 1/3 of them being net new. 
And finally, our SaaS-delivered revenue was up 14%, contributing over $200 million in the quarter. The contribution from the GoTo solutions was $169 million, growing 10.5% from a year ago. As we announced earlier today, we're merging this business with LogMeIn over the next few quarters. But until that transaction is completed, we'll continue to operate as a consolidated entity for reporting and guidance purposes. More detail on the performance of the GoTo business' individual segments will be included in the LogMeIn S-4 filing, which is expected later this quarter.
Looking back on the other core Citrix cloud-based services, it contributed $33 million in total revenue, growing at 30%. The bulk of this is coming from ShareFile, our secure data platform, and other new services addressing mobile networking and desktop needs for our customers.
So clearly, we're beginning to see a shift in the way that products are being consumed by our customers, evolving slowly towards a more consumption-based model. When we include revenue coming from the CSP program, our cloud-based services, excluding GoTo, and any term licenses, the aggregate ARR was over $200 million in Q2, growing at more than 30%. We'll begin to break this out each quarter to provide more visibility into this dynamic.
Shifting gears and turning to operations. We've shown a rapid increase in margin over the last few quarters despite funding incremental investments in our growth businesses and certain go-to-market areas. Our restructuring plans across the company are intended to generate permanent expense reductions, allowing the company to execute more efficiently, while also driving scalability into the future.
In Q2, we posted 28% adjusted op margin, which was up 370 basis points from a year ago. We're clearly operating well ahead of our stated goal of reaching 30% in the fiscal year '17. 
The focus on leverage has also really helped increase cash flow from operations, which was up 13% in the quarter to $228 million and up 31% on a trailing 12-month basis. This translates into approximately $1.46 per share in the quarter and over $7 a share over the last 4 quarters.
Before I wrap up, let me talk about our current outlook and expectations for the remainder of the year. Our operational programs and strategy is clearly working, and we're happy with the results and confident in our plans for the balance of the year. At the same time, we're going to remain conservative given the restructuring, the GoTo merger and the significant revenue upside that we delivered in the first half of this year. That said, we're going to increase our assumptions for Q3 and for the full year.
For Q3 '16, we now expect revenue in the range of $820 million to $830 million and adjusted EPS of between $1.18 and $1.20 per share. For the full year 2016, we're increasing our expectations to include revenue between $3.37 billion and $3.39 billion, and adjusted EPS of $5 and $5.10 per share. This range represents 3% to 4% growth on the top line and more than 15% growth in adjusted EPS. We remind you that this guidance represents all businesses, including those that are part of the planned GoTo merger. 
So now I'd like to turn it over to Kirill to give you further color on the quarter and the focus on areas looking forward. Kirill?"

I'm very encouraged by our performance this quarter. It's a clear signal that our focused execution on the strategy to deliver the world's best integrated technology services for secure delivery of apps and data is resonating well with our customers, partners and the market. 
Our product teams have delivered on all commitments, enabling us to make a number of powerful announcement at the Synergy event in late May. Specifically, we announced and delivered XenApp XenDesktop 7.9, new NetScaler with an option to deliver in a docket container and also brand new management and analytics system in NetScaler, and also ShareFile's new information rights management, amongst many other advanced capabilities. 
We've also announced our renewed and stronger-than-ever partnership with Microsoft. And most importantly, we shared our strategy to become the leader in Workspace-as-a-Service and accelerate our move to the cloud. All these announcements and product delivery received resoundingly positive feedback from all constituencies. Our innovation and partnerships are clearly fueling the continued strength in our execution and position us as #1 or 2 in all market segments where we play. 
Adding some comments to the Q2 results that David just shared. I'm very pleased to see that our Workspace Services business, or Xen family, is delivering growth, reversing past trends and clearly regaining market share. This quarter, our rate of growth in net new customers for XenApp/XenDesktop reached strong double-digit growth year-over-year. 
XenMobile contributed strongly to the overall suite. Last month, Citrix was yet again positioned as a leader in Gartner's Magic Quadrant for Enterprise Mobility Management Suites. 
On our transformation to the cloud. The growth in ShareFile reached 30% year-over-year in new sales, and our Citrix service provided business continues to grow at a rapid pace, 37 percentage points year-over-year, primarily delivering XenApp and XenDesktop as a cloud service but also now adding XenMobile and NetScaler as cloud service as well. We clearly see that the cloud is a strong growth catalyst for Citrix, really positive sign as we continue to focus on the evolving Citrix cloud strategy. Overall, this was a terrific quarter for our worldwide sales team, particularly our Americas team executed extremely well in the quarter. 
We just completed a comprehensive review of our operations in EMEA, and we see strong opportunities in the region, of course, balancing it with other geopolitical headwinds. We've seen some strong winds in Asia Pacific and Japan, and we have high growth aspirations for that region also. This was an incredible quarter adding new customers to the Citrix family, but also solidifying our existing customer relationships. We also saw significant growth in large deals, as David mentioned, and we saw strengths in our targeted industry verticals, particularly financial services and health care with nearly 1/3 of our largest wins represented by health care organizations. 
A significant number of customers are moving from other virtualization and networking vendors to Citrix. In fact, we have nearly 800 combined competitive wins or replacements against our top competitors in Q2. Amongst more noticeable competitive wins in Q2, Kindred health network, a long-time competitor's customer with more than 12,000 employees and 2,100 physicians, chose XenDesktop for VDI deployment. In another win, a major short-term housing provider in the United States selected Citrix cloud delivered XenApp and XenDesktop to support business-critical applications in more than 180 locations. This win serves a nice example of XenApp and XenDesktop returning to growth and regaining market share. 
Our renewed strength in Microsoft partnership started to bear fruit already in this past quarter. We'll work with Microsoft on an engagement with a cellular carrier owned by LG Corporation. It was the largest-ever deal closed in Korea for Citrix with 29,000 licenses being deployed to help enhance security and productivity. 
On strengthening our existing customer relationships, one of the world's largest investment banks, a long-standing XenApp and XenDesktop took customer moved to allow Citrix to its worldwide operations, encompassing more than 200,000 employees. The bank's decision to choose Citrix was heavily influenced by our unique ability to execute virtualized Skype for Business, and this was only 1 of many such examples. Microsoft recently issued a technical guidance, making an ambiguous statement that Citrix is the clear choice for deploying Skype for Business in virtualized environments. We anticipate that our partnership and alignment with Microsoft will provide us continued additional lift in end user computing. 
On the network delivery side, CMA Insurance, one of the largest commercial insurance companies in the United States replaced and established competitive networking vendor with Citrix NetScaler, making it the cornerstone for their networking infrastructure. CMA chose NetScaler to provide with quality end user experience to their employees and the mission-critical applications. Essentially, it is an ADC scenario in the Enterprise.
And finally, ShareFile continues to provide itself as an industry leader, quickly gaining share in the market. We're seeing our efforts to extend ShareFile to the Enterprise segment paid big dividends with the highest number of large deals ever. Among those large-scale wins with ShareFile, we saw one of the largest accounting firms standardized on ShareFile to enable secure collaboration and workflows between their consultants and the clients. With accounting being a target vertical for ShareFile, this win now gives ShareFile 2 of the top of 4 accounting firms as customers. 
Our unique differentiators clearly help ShareFile to continue stand out against generic cloud storage providers. In fact, last week, Citrix was positioned as a leader in Gartner's Magic Quadrant for Enterprise file, sync and share for the third consecutive year. Needless to say, we see very bright future for ShareFile. 
This week marks my sixth month as Citrix CEO, and I'm more enthusiastic than ever. Our results demonstrate that we're on the right path, building new Citrix. I feel highly confident that we have the right strategy and the plan to execute upon it. I'm incredibly excited about the future of Citrix. Today's announcement with LogMeIn will allow us to continue to focus our resources and investments and accelerate our execution and results. Thank you, and we look forward to your questions."

One is the decrease is a direct result of just declining Workspace Services license you've seen a couple of years back. And unfortunately, the pressure there is abating. Hence, the performance has really come back on that front. I'd say that as we've talked about a couple of times, we're uplifting the ARR by delivering new offerings and really migrating customers towards higher-value subscriptions. And so as of last quarter, we had about 25% of the installed base migrated. We're going to be make a larger portion in the second half of the year, really accelerating that. So I think that's one of the things that's going to continue to drive license update and maintenance going forward. I'd say the second thing is a little bit of a timing issue with our largest installed base customer for an order that came in right after the close of the quarter, which influenced that to a kind of a mid-single-digit millions range. Overall, when I look at license update and maintenance line, comfortable with about 3% growth for the year and expect that to grow sequentially into Q3."

And every step of the way, there is a lot of energy and a lot of discussion between Microsoft and Citrix field organizations. We've seen some real examples where collaboration is already occurring. LG U+ in Korea was one such example and there are many more, and I would expect to see a lot more. This is clearly the case where this is win-win for both companies. Citrix is truly helping Microsoft deploy Skype for Business in virtualized setting in the large enterprises, and that's how they want to deploy Skype for Business. This is also the case where Citrix has ready-to-go technology to help deploy Windows 10 in the Enterprise, and obviously Microsoft is very focused on that deployment. And all of that is even before we realized some additional product integrations that are coming later in the next 12 months, Enterprise Mobility Suite and NetScaler with Azure and more on Azure integration. So all in all, this is really what we're seeing as the beginning of this partnership becoming to work for both companies."

So we're really happy with execution across the board. When you kind of step back a little bit and think about the core Citrix, excluding the part of this merging, LogMeIn, that part of the business is operating between 1.5 and 2 percentage points higher on an adjusted op margin than the consolidated whole. So we're clearly well above the 30% range already from a core Citrix point of view. As it comes to providing more granularity into the individual pieces, the S-4 will be filed by LogMeIn later this quarter. And so at that point in time, you'll have better position to look at the individual performance of the GoTo business stand-alone, the forecast moving forward, et cetera. And I'd say, after Q3, we'll be talking about guidance going forward for 2017 as a stand-alone entity. So I'd say that's one way to think about it."

In particular, we differentiate by delivering unique set of capabilities in mobile application management as opposed to just generic low-cost mobile device management. And these are the capabilities that are being valued in bring-your-own-device scenarios. These are capabilities that are actually being valued by Microsoft. They were core to our alignment with Microsoft between XenMobile and Enterprise Mobility suite. And we see continued strength and growth in that market. Yet again, we differentiate by focusing on mobile application management by delivering unique capabilities like MicroVPN and really focusing on a suite with XenMobile, with ShareFile and with NetScaler playing significant role in that particular rollout. And we also continue to strengthen our portfolio and our solution with some additional capabilities like the new Forms application that was introduced as part of XenMobile in June. It's being very well received by our customers yet again, focusing on applications versus device itself. So we're quite excited about what we have with XenMobile. We predominantly see it as a part of the overall suite, of the overall offering. We see more and more customers choosing XenMobile to be delivered to the cloud service, and we expect to see more of that. And we are quite excited and bullish about that particular product."

The signs, the early signs are incredibly positive, and we're certainly looking forward to increase velocity and better execution, and frankly, better  momentum as we work close together. There are some specific product initiatives and specific joint workings in the field that will certainly be producing more results. We're ready to go with Skype for Business virtualized, and that's how many large enterprises wanted to deploy Skype for Business on Citrix. Microsoft just issued technical guidance on -- essentially stating that Citrix is a clear choice to deploy Skype for Business this way. We have solution to deploy Windows 10 in the Enterprise in a virtualized and VDI fashion, and that is incredibly well received and that is a huge priority for Microsoft. And we certainly expect both of those existing initiatives to start bearing more fruit. Of course, it depends on overall Skype for Business adoption in the Enterprise. It all depends on Windows 10 adoption to Enterprise, and we continue to work with Microsoft to advance it. And of course, later in this year, we're really looking forward to introducing additional capabilities into this partnership and into this channel, especially with XenMobile and overall XenMobile suite now playing a role into the Enterprise mobility suite and also NetScaler being aligned with Azure."

Overall, I wouldn't say there's anything explicit in our guidance. However, implicitly, we are certainly talking about a model shift that we've seen gradually. For us, we're in the fortunate position where a lot of it is incremental to what we've already done. The CSP, for example, which is ratable coming out on the Workspace Services business, is addressing SMBs and other areas that our core products wouldn't have. That business is running about a $75 million ARR right now. When I look back at core Citrix cloud delivered services, ShareFile is clearly the biggest, but we've also rolled out new services around XenMobile. We deliver networking actually as a service. We have desktop and VDI and some of these other things that we are rolling out as new services. When you aggregate those together, that business is running at about a 30% clip, and it's generating an ARR of roughly $130 million per year. So when you put those 2 together, and we are sitting on over $200 million of annualized recurring revenue growing north of 30% right now. That's probably the best way to really frame out the shift that we've seen over the past couple of years versus a type of revenue model that you would've had historically. It will be a shift that continues. We're going to talk about this metric each and every quarter to give people more visibility into how that's moving. And when the time comes, not in fiscal year '16, when the time comes, we're going to be more aggressive in our shift in installed base or something that could have a material impact, we make sure we talk about that well in advance and communicate that explicitly as part of guidance."

We just want to be clear with everyone that it is more volatile and it does go up and down. We've just been really fortunate to see 4 quarters in a row of great performance."

Whether it's going to continue at the same pace, I tend to believe that it will it, but it's impossible to pin it down, and therefore, we're being conservative on that part of the business. But then, there are additional parts of NetScaler that we're really excited about. The fact that NetScaler is essentially the only pure software-defined ADC enables us to do truly unique things in that market, as evidenced by some wins last quarter. And of course, emerging SD-WAN part of NetScaler [indiscernible] very strongly. And we expect that to start providing some real material growth in '17 as that market evolves and matures.

We're all about secure delivery of apps and data, and this is the top of mind of every organization, large and small.

And I would say that is the #1 most significant secular trends that drives the need for Citrix solution. And of course, Windows 10, Skype for Business that we already discussed are additional very important capabilities that people need to embrace and that people need to deploy Skype for Business at scale with Citrix. You can do it securely and you can do it reducing your overall support cost. And sort of the other thing that I would mention is with the engineering work that Citrix have been doing over the last few years, we're now uniquely positioned to deliver XenApp and XenDesktop, essentially application virtualization and desktop virtualization, on the same platform. And we're seeing quite a strong number of customers really wanting to do both on the same platform. And some of those who were using XenApp in the past now want to deploy DDI, and having the same platform and the same infrastructure really enable them to do it with ease using the same tools, using the same life cycle manager -- management, that's the trend. And perhaps, the final thing that I would mention that sort of sets the Americas apart from the rest of the geos, here in Americas, the team embraced vertical focus ahead of everyone else. And if you think about health care wins, most of them happened here in Americas. And if you think about financial sector and focus there, most of those wins actually happen in Americas as well.

We continue to show great results from the operational initiatives we introduced last year. We are focusing all of our energy on our core strategy of securely delivering apps and data, allowing for this consistent execution and really setting the company up for profitable growth as we look forward.
And as you can see from the release, total revenue was up 6% year-on-year in Q2, with product license up 7% and SaaS up 14%. Adjusted operating margin was 28%. Adjusted EPS was $1.20 per share, up 20% from Q2 a year ago, and we also generated $228 million in cash flow from operations. 
In total, we closed 61 $1 million-plus transactions across products and services, an increase of 33% year-on-year, with particular strength coming from financial services, health care and cloud verticals. There's also a good balance across the portfolio. More than half of these transactions coming from Workspace Services solutions, the increasing number from Delivery Networking and even our largest-ever single contract around Enterprise file, sync and share. 
From a geo perspective, excluding the GoTo business, revenue from the Americas was up 11% while EMEA and APJ both declined modestly. The Americas geo has continued to really be the growth engine for a number quarters now. This region is where our restructuring activities began over the last year, and therefore has had the benefit of stability and continuity, a key contributor to this performance and a model for changes that we're making elsewhere in the world.
So next, let's look at our Q2 results within our primary groups. Our Workspace Services business, including app virtualization and mobility grew about 2% to $412 million, including a 1% year-on-year increase in license revenue. The results show that this business is benefiting from the strategy and increased focus applied last year. And as we've discussed before, there's a number of specific initiatives that we're driving to accelerate growth in this area through faster innovation, more verticalized solutions and aggregation of our unique assets. Within this area, there's a few dynamics that are worth noting. First, total revenue from the Workspace suite, which is our comprehensive solution for secure app and data delivery, was up more than 70%, contributed about 12% of license revenue.
Second, we continue to grow our CSP subscriptions, where partners primarily utilize XenApp to deliver cloud-based offerings to their customers. Overall, CSP revenue grew 37% to an ARR of about $75 million. And finally, we saw great results coming out of the Americas geo for overall Workspace Services, where license revenue grew 23% in the quarter and 16% for the first half, really led by demand from the suite.
Next looking at our Delivery Networking. Total revenue increased 11% in the quarter to $195 million, with license growth of 16%. When you focus just on NetScaler, I'll remind everybody that the business is essentially made up of 3 segments: cloud infrastructure and service providers, Citrix solution sales and Enterprise ADC. Demand from the cloud customers continues to be really strong, consistent with what we've seen over the past year. This segment contributed about half of NetScaler product bookings. 
Solution attached sales represented 15% of the mix in Q2, with the number of app and mobile opportunities that included networking as part of an overall Citrix solution consistent with what we saw a year ago. 
Enterprise ADC was about 1/3 of the mix in Q2, and we're seeing an increased traction from the new NetScaler SD-WAN products, which is addressing a nascent market but one that's expected to grow really significantly over the next few years. All in, we sold over 1,900 networking customers in the period with over 1/3 of them being net new. 
And finally, our SaaS-delivered revenue was up 14%, contributing over $200 million in the quarter. The contribution from the GoTo solutions was $169 million, growing 10.5% from a year ago. As we announced earlier today, we're merging this business with LogMeIn over the next few quarters, but until that transaction is completed, we'll continue to operate as a consolidated entity for reporting and guidance purposes. More detail on the performance of the GoTo business' individual segments will be included in the LogMeIn S-4 filing, which is expected later this quarter.
Looking back on the other core Citrix cloud-based services, it contributed $33 million in total revenue, growing at 30%. The bulk of this is coming from ShareFile, our secure data platform, and other new services addressing mobile, networking and desktop needs for our customers.
So clearly, we're beginning to see a shift in the way that products are being consumed by our customers, evolving slowly towards a more consumption-based model. When we include revenue coming from the CSP program, our cloud-based services, excluding GoTo, and any term licenses, the aggregate ARR was over $200 million in Q2, growing at more than 30%. We'll begin to break this out each quarter to provide more visibility into this dynamic.
Shifting gears and turning to operations. We've shown a rapid increase in margin over the last few quarters despite funding incremental investments in our growth businesses and certain go-to-market areas. Our restructuring plans across the company are intended to generate permanent expense reductions, allowing the company to execute more efficiently, while also driving scalability into the future.
In Q2, we posted 28% adjusted op margin, which was up 370 basis points from a year ago. We're clearly operating well ahead of our stated goal of reaching 30% in fiscal year '17. 
The focus on leverage has also really helped increase cash flow from operations, which was up 13% in the quarter to $228 million and up 31% on a trailing 12-month basis. This translates into approximately $1.46 per share in the quarter and over $7 a share over the last 4 quarters.
Before I wrap up, let me talk about our current outlook and expectations for the remainder of the year. Our operational programs and strategy is clearly working, and we're happy with the results and confident in our plans for the balance of the year. At the same time, we're going to remain conservative given the restructuring, the GoTo merger and the significant revenue upside that we delivered in the first half of this year. That said, we're going to increase our assumptions for Q3 and for the full year.
For Q3 '16, we now expect revenue in the range of $820 million to $830 million and adjusted EPS of between $1.18 and $1.20 per share. For the full year 2016, we're increasing our expectations to include revenue between $3.37 billion and $3.39 billion, and adjusted EPS of $5 and $5.10 per share. This range represents 3% to 4% growth on the top line and more than 15% growth in adjusted EPS. We remind you that this guidance represents all businesses, including those that are part of the planned GoTo merger. 
So now I'd like to turn it over to Kirill to give you further color on the quarter and to focus on the areas looking forward. Kirill?"

I'm very encouraged by our performance this quarter. It's a clear signal that our focused execution on the strategy to deliver the world's best integrated technology services for secure delivery of apps and data is resonating well with our customers, partners and the market. 
Our product teams have delivered on all commitments, enabling us to make a number of powerful announcements at the Synergy event in late May. Specifically, we announced and delivered XenApp XenDesktop 7.9, new NetScaler with an option to deliver it in a docket container and also a brand new management and analytics system in NetScaler, and also ShareFile's new information rights management, amongst many other advanced capabilities. 
We've also announced our renewed and stronger-than-ever partnership with Microsoft. And most importantly, we shared our strategy to become the leader in Workspace-as-a-Service and accelerate our move to the cloud. All these announcements and product delivery received resoundingly positive feedback from all constituencies. Our innovation and partnerships are clearly fueling the continued strength in our execution and position us as #1 or 2 in all market segments where we play. 
Adding some comments to the Q2 results that David just shared. I'm very pleased to see that our Workspace Services business, or Xen family, is delivering growth, reversing past trends and clearly regaining market share. This quarter, our rate of growth in net new customers for XenApp/XenDesktop reached strong double-digit growth year-over-year. 
XenMobile contributed strongly to the overall suite. Last month, Citrix was yet again positioned as a leader in Gartner's Magic Quadrant for Enterprise Mobility Management Suites. 
On our transformation to the cloud. The growth in ShareFile reached 30% year-over-year in new sales, and our Citrix service provider business continues to grow at a rapid pace, 37 percentage points year-over-year, primarily delivering XenApp and XenDesktop as a cloud service but also now adding XenMobile and NetScaler as cloud service as well. We clearly see that the cloud is a strong growth catalyst for Citrix, a really positive sign as we continue to focus on the evolving Citrix cloud strategy. Overall, this was a terrific quarter for our worldwide sales team, particularly our Americas team executed extremely well in the quarter. 
We just completed a comprehensive review of our operations in EMEA, and we see strong opportunities in the region, of course, balancing it with other geopolitical headwinds. We've seen some strong winds in Asia Pacific and Japan, and we have high growth aspirations for that region also. This was an incredible quarter adding new customers to the Citrix family, but also solidifying our existing customer relationships. We also saw significant growth in large deals, as David mentioned, and we saw strength in our targeted industry verticals, particularly financial services and health care with nearly 1/3 of our largest wins represented by health care organizations. 
A significant number of customers are moving from other virtualization and networking vendors to Citrix. In fact, we have nearly 800 combined competitive wins or replacements against our top competitors in Q2. Amongst more noticeable competitive wins in Q2, Kindred health network, a long-time competitor's customer with more than 12,000 employees and 2,100 physicians, chose XenDesktop for VDI deployment. In another win, a major short-term housing provider in the United States selected Citrix cloud delivered XenApp and XenDesktop to support business-critical applications in more than 180 locations. This win serves as a nice example of XenApp and XenDesktop returning to growth and regaining market share. 
Our renewed strengthened Microsoft partnership started to bear fruit already in this past quarter. We'll work with Microsoft on an engagement with a cellular carrier owned by LG Corporation. It was the largest-ever deal closed in Korea for Citrix with 29,000 licenses being deployed to help enhance security and productivity. 
On strengthening our existing customer relationships, one of the world's largest investment banks, a long-standing XenApp and XenDesktop took customer moved to allow Citrix to its worldwide operations, encompassing more than 200,000 employees. The bank's decision to choose Citrix was heavily influenced by our unique ability to execute virtualized Skype for Business, and this was only 1 of many such examples. Microsoft recently issued a technical guidance, making an unambiguous statement that Citrix is the clear choice for deploying Skype for Business in virtualized environments. We anticipate that our partnership and alignment with Microsoft will provide us continued additional lift in end user computing. 
On the network delivery side, CMA Insurance, one of the largest commercial insurance companies in the United States replaced an established competitive networking vendor with Citrix NetScaler, making it the cornerstone for their networking infrastructure. CMA chose NetScaler to provide with [ph] quality end user experience to their employees and the mission-critical applications. Essentially, it is an ADC scenario in the Enterprise.
And finally, ShareFile continues to provide [ph] itself as an industry leader, quickly gaining share in the market. We're seeing our efforts to extend ShareFile to the Enterprise segment pay big dividends with the highest number of large deals ever. Among those large-scale wins with ShareFile, we saw one of the largest accounting firms standardized on ShareFile to enable secure collaboration and workflows between their consultants and clients. With accounting being a target vertical for ShareFile, this win now gives ShareFile 2 of the top of 4 accounting firms as customers. 
Our unique differentiators clearly help ShareFile to continue to stand out against generic cloud storage providers. In fact, last week, Citrix was positioned as a leader in Gartner's Magic Quadrant for Enterprise file, sync and share for the third consecutive year. Needless to say, we see a very bright future for ShareFile. 
This week marks my sixth month as Citrix CEO, and I'm more enthusiastic than ever. Our results demonstrate that we're on the right path, building new Citrix. I feel highly confident that we have the right strategy and the plan to execute upon it. I'm incredibly excited about the future of Citrix. Today's announcement with LogMeIn will allow us to continue to focus our resources and investments and accelerate our execution and results. Thank you, and we look forward to your questions."

One is that the decrease is a direct result of just declining Workspace Services license you've seen a couple of years back. And fortunately, the pressure there is abating as the performance has really come back on that front. I'd say that as we've talked about a couple of times, we're uplifting the ARR by delivering new offerings and really migrating customers towards higher-value subscriptions. And so as of last quarter, we had about 25% of the installed base migrated. We're going to be making a larger portion in the second half of the year, really accelerating that. So I think that's one of the things that's going to continue to drive license update and maintenance going forward. I'd say the second thing is there's a little bit of a timing issue with our largest installed-base customer for an order that came in right after the close of the quarter, which influenced that to a kind of a mid-single-digit millions range. Overall, when I look at license update and maintenance line, comfortable with about 3% growth for the year and expect that to grow sequentially into Q3."

And every step of the way, there is a lot of energy and a lot of discussion between Microsoft and Citrix field organizations. We've seen some real examples where collaboration is already occurring. LG U+ in Korea was one such example and there are many more, and I would expect to see a lot more. This is clearly the case where this is win-win for both companies. Citrix is truly helping Microsoft deploy Skype for Business in a virtualized setting in the largest enterprises, and that's how they want to deploy Skype for Business. This is also the case where Citrix has ready-to-go technology to help deploy Windows 10 in the Enterprise, and obviously Microsoft is very focused on that deployment. And all of that is even before we realized some additional product integrations that are coming later in the next 12 months in Enterprise Mobility Suite and NetScaler with Azure and more on Azure integration.

So we're really happy with execution across the board. When you kind of step back a little bit and think about the core Citrix, excluding the part that is merging with LogMeIn, that part of the business is operating between 1.5 and 2 percentage points higher on an adjusted op margin than the consolidated whole. So we're clearly well above the 30% range already from a core Citrix point of view. As it comes to providing more granularity into the individual pieces, the S-4 will be filed by LogMeIn later this quarter. And so at that point in time, you'll have a better position to look at the individual performance of the GoTo business stand-alone, the forecast moving forward, et cetera.

And we also continue to strengthen our portfolio and our solution with some additional capabilities like the new Forms application that was introduced as part of XenMobile in June. It's being very well received by our customers yet again, focusing on applications versus device itself. So we're quite excited about what we have with XenMobile. We predominantly see it as a part of the overall suite, of the overall offering. We see more and more customers choosing XenMobile to be delivered as a cloud service, and we expect to see more of that. And we are quite excited and bullish about that particular product."

And in this past quarter already, even though we announced this partnership with Microsoft actually midway in the quarter, even in that quarter, we saw some very exciting wins as a result of better alignment. We see more of that alignment coming in the future. I would say right now, we're at the beginning of working out the mechanics and specifics of how this partnership is going play out in the field. The signs, the early signs are incredibly positive, and we're certainly looking forward to increased velocity and better execution and, frankly, better momentum as we work close together. There are some specific product initiatives and specific joint workings in the field that will certainly be producing more results. We're ready to go with Skype for Business virtualized, and that's how many large enterprises wanted to deploy Skype for Business on Citrix. Microsoft just issued technical guidance on -- essentially stating that Citrix is a clear choice to deploy Skype for Business this way. We have a solution to deploy Windows 10 in the Enterprise in a virtualized and VDI fashion, and that is incredibly well received and that is a huge priority for Microsoft. And we certainly expect both of those existing initiatives to start bearing more fruit. Of course, it depends on overall Skype for Business adoption in the Enterprise. It all depends on Windows 10 adoption in the Enterprise, and we continue to work with Microsoft to advance it. And of course, later in this year, we're really looking forward to introducing additional capabilities into this partnership and into this channel, especially with XenMobile and overall XenMobile suite now playing a role into the Enterprise mobility suite and also NetScaler being aligned with Azure."

Overall, I wouldn't say there's anything explicit in our guidance. However, implicitly, we are certainly talking about a model shift that we've seen gradually. For us, we're in the fortunate position where a lot of it is incremental to what we've already done. The CSP, for example, which is ratable coming out on the Workspace Services business, is addressing SMBs and other areas that our core products wouldn't have. That business is running about a $75 million ARR right now. When I look back at core Citrix cloud delivered services, ShareFile is clearly the biggest, but we've also rolled out new services around XenMobile. We deliver networking actually as a service. We have desktop and VDI and some of these other things that we are rolling out as new services. When you aggregate those together, that business is running at about a 30% clip, and it's generating an ARR of roughly $130 million per year. So when you put those 2 together, and we are sitting on over $200 million of annualized recurring revenue growing north of 30% right now. That's probably the best way to really frame out the shift that we've seen over the past couple of years versus a type of revenue model that you would've had historically. It will be a shift that continues. We're going to talk about this metric each and every quarter to give people more visibility into how that's moving. And when the time comes, not in fiscal year '16, when the time comes, we're going to be more aggressive in our shift of installed base or something that could have a material impact, we'll make sure we talk about that well in advance and communicate that explicitly as part of guidance."

It is hard to predict, but it has certainly been continuing for the last 4 quarters. Whether it's going to continue at the same pace, I tend to believe that it will it, but it's impossible to pin it down, and therefore, we're being conservative on that part of the business. But then, there are additional parts of NetScaler that we're really excited about. The fact that NetScaler is essentially the only pure software-defined ADC enables us to do truly unique things in that market, as evidenced by some wins last quarter. And of course, emerging SD-WAN part of NetScaler, we believe in very strongly. And we expect that to start providing some real material growth in '17 as that market evolves and matures. And we certainly plan on talking about it when we provide overall guidance for 2017 in late October."

We're all about secure delivery of apps and data, and this is the top of mind of every organization, large and small. Security and cybersecurity playing such a strong -- it's just such a strong priority for everybody. And I would say that is the #1 most significant secular trend that drives the need for Citrix solutions. And of course, Windows 10, Skype for Business that we already discussed are additional very important capabilities that people need to embrace and that people need to deploy Skype for Business at scale with Citrix. You can do it securely and you can do it reducing your overall support costs. And sort of the other thing that I would mention is with the engineering work that Citrix have been doing over the last few years, we're now uniquely positioned to deliver XenApp and XenDesktop, essentially, application virtualization and desktop virtualization on the same platform. And we're seeing quite a strong number of customers really wanting to do both on the same platform. And some of those who were using XenApp in the past now want to deploy DDI, and having the same platform and the same infrastructure really enables them to do it with ease using the same tools, using the same life cycle manager -- management, that's the trend. And perhaps, the final thing that I would mention that sort of sets the Americas apart from the rest of the geos, here in Americas, the team embraced vertical focus ahead of everyone else. And if you think about health care wins, lots of them happened here in Americas. And if you think about financial sector and focus there, lots of those -- most of those wins actually happened in Americas as well.

We continue to show great results from the operational initiatives we introduced last year. We are focusing all of our energy on our core strategy of securely delivering apps and data, allowing for this consistent execution and really setting the company up for profitable growth as we look forward.
And as you can see from the release, total revenue was up 6% year-on-year in Q2, with product license up 7% and SaaS up 14%. Adjusted operating margin was 28%. Adjusted EPS was $1.20 per share, up 20% from Q2 a year ago, and we also generated $228 million in cash flow from operations. 
In total, we closed 61 $1 million-plus transactions across products and services, an increase of 33% year-on-year, with particular strength coming from financial services, health care and cloud verticals. There's also a good balance across the portfolio. More than half of these transactions coming from Workspace Services solutions, the increasing number from Delivery Networking and even our largest-ever single contract around Enterprise file, sync and share. 
From a geo perspective, excluding the GoTo business, revenue from the Americas was up 11% while EMEA and APJ both declined modestly. The Americas geo has continued to really be the growth engine for a number quarters now. This region is where our restructuring activities began over the last year, and therefore has had the benefit of stability and continuity, a key contributor to this performance and a model for changes that we're making elsewhere in the world.
So next, let's look at our Q2 results within our primary groups. Our Workspace Services business, including app virtualization and mobility grew about 2% to $412 million, including a 1% year-on-year increase in license revenue. The results show that this business is benefiting from the strategy and increased focus applied last year. And as we've discussed before, there's a number of specific initiatives that we're driving to accelerate growth in this area through faster innovation, more verticalized solutions and aggregation of our unique assets. Within this area, there's a few dynamics that are worth noting. First, total revenue from the Workspace suite, which is our comprehensive solution for secure app and data delivery, was up more than 70%, contributed about 12% of license revenue.
Second, we continue to grow our CSP subscriptions, where partners primarily utilize XenApp to deliver cloud-based offerings to their customers. Overall, CSP revenue grew 37% to an ARR of about $75 million. And finally, we saw great results coming out of the Americas geo for overall Workspace Services, where license revenue grew 23% in the quarter and 16% for the first half, really led by demand from the suite.
Next looking at our Delivery Networking. Total revenue increased 11% in the quarter to $195 million, with license growth of 16%. When you focus just on NetScaler, I'll remind everybody that the business is essentially made up of 3 segments: cloud infrastructure and service providers, Citrix solution sales and Enterprise ADC. Demand from the cloud customers continues to be really strong, consistent with what we've seen over the past year. This segment contributed about half of NetScaler product bookings. 
Solution attached sales represented 15% of the mix in Q2, with the number of app and mobile opportunities that included networking as part of an overall Citrix solution consistent with what we saw a year ago. 
Enterprise ADC was about 1/3 of the mix in Q2, and we're seeing an increased traction from the new NetScaler SD-WAN products, which is addressing a nascent market but one that's expected to grow really significantly over the next few years. All in, we sold over 1,900 networking customers in the period with over 1/3 of them being net new. 
And finally, our SaaS-delivered revenue was up 14%, contributing over $200 million in the quarter. The contribution from the GoTo solutions was $169 million, growing 10.5% from a year ago. As we announced earlier today, we're merging this business with LogMeIn over the next few quarters, but until that transaction is completed, we'll continue to operate as a consolidated entity for reporting and guidance purposes. More detail on the performance of the GoTo business' individual segments will be included in the LogMeIn S-4 filing, which is expected later this quarter.
Looking back on the other core Citrix cloud-based services, it contributed $33 million in total revenue, growing at 30%. The bulk of this is coming from ShareFile, our secure data platform, and other new services addressing mobile, networking and desktop needs for our customers.
So clearly, we're beginning to see a shift in the way that products are being consumed by our customers, evolving slowly towards a more consumption-based model. When we include revenue coming from the CSP program, our cloud-based services, excluding GoTo, and any term licenses, the aggregate ARR was over $200 million in Q2, growing at more than 30%. We'll begin to break this out each quarter to provide more visibility into this dynamic.
Shifting gears and turning to operations. We've shown a rapid increase in margin over the last few quarters despite funding incremental investments in our growth businesses and certain go-to-market areas. Our restructuring plans across the company are intended to generate permanent expense reductions, allowing the company to execute more efficiently, while also driving scalability into the future.
In Q2, we posted 28% adjusted op margin, which was up 370 basis points from a year ago. We're clearly operating well ahead of our stated goal of reaching 30% in fiscal year '17. 
The focus on leverage has also really helped increase cash flow from operations, which was up 13% in the quarter to $228 million and up 31% on a trailing 12-month basis. This translates into approximately $1.46 per share in the quarter and over $7 a share over the last 4 quarters.
Before I wrap up, let me talk about our current outlook and expectations for the remainder of the year. Our operational programs and strategy is clearly working, and we're happy with the results and confident in our plans for the balance of the year. At the same time, we're going to remain conservative given the restructuring, the GoTo merger and the significant revenue upside that we delivered in the first half of this year. That said, we're going to increase our assumptions for Q3 and for the full year.
For Q3 '16, we now expect revenue in the range of $820 million to $830 million and adjusted EPS of between $1.18 and $1.20 per share. For the full year 2016, we're increasing our expectations to include revenue between $3.37 billion and $3.39 billion, and adjusted EPS of $5 and $5.10 per share. This range represents 3% to 4% growth on the top line and more than 15% growth in adjusted EPS. We remind you that this guidance represents all businesses, including those that are part of the planned GoTo merger. 
So now I'd like to turn it over to Kirill to give you further color on the quarter and to focus on the areas looking forward. Kirill?"

I'm very encouraged by our performance this quarter. It's a clear signal that our focused execution on the strategy to deliver the world's best integrated technology services for secure delivery of apps and data is resonating well with our customers, partners and the market. 
Our product teams have delivered on all commitments, enabling us to make a number of powerful announcements at the Synergy event in late May. Specifically, we announced and delivered XenApp XenDesktop 7.9, new NetScaler with an option to deliver it in a docket container and also a brand new management and analytics system in NetScaler, and also ShareFile's new information rights management, amongst many other advanced capabilities. 
We've also announced our renewed and stronger-than-ever partnership with Microsoft. And most importantly, we shared our strategy to become the leader in Workspace-as-a-Service and accelerate our move to the cloud. All these announcements and product delivery received resoundingly positive feedback from all constituencies. Our innovation and partnerships are clearly fueling the continued strength in our execution and position us as #1 or 2 in all market segments where we play. 
Adding some comments to the Q2 results that David just shared. I'm very pleased to see that our Workspace Services business, or Xen family, is delivering growth, reversing past trends and clearly regaining market share. This quarter, our rate of growth in net new customers for XenApp/XenDesktop reached strong double-digit growth year-over-year. 
XenMobile contributed strongly to the overall suite. Last month, Citrix was yet again positioned as a leader in Gartner's Magic Quadrant for Enterprise Mobility Management Suites. 
On our transformation to the cloud. The growth in ShareFile reached 30% year-over-year in new sales, and our Citrix service provider business continues to grow at a rapid pace, 37 percentage points year-over-year, primarily delivering XenApp and XenDesktop as a cloud service but also now adding XenMobile and NetScaler as cloud service as well. We clearly see that the cloud is a strong growth catalyst for Citrix, a really positive sign as we continue to focus on the evolving Citrix cloud strategy. Overall, this was a terrific quarter for our worldwide sales team, particularly our Americas team executed extremely well in the quarter. 
We just completed a comprehensive review of our operations in EMEA, and we see strong opportunities in the region, of course, balancing it with other geopolitical headwinds. We've seen some strong winds in Asia Pacific and Japan, and we have high growth aspirations for that region also. This was an incredible quarter adding new customers to the Citrix family, but also solidifying our existing customer relationships. We also saw significant growth in large deals, as David mentioned, and we saw strength in our targeted industry verticals, particularly financial services and health care with nearly 1/3 of our largest wins represented by health care organizations. 
A significant number of customers are moving from other virtualization and networking vendors to Citrix. In fact, we have nearly 800 combined competitive wins or replacements against our top competitors in Q2. Amongst more noticeable competitive wins in Q2, Kindred health network, a long-time competitor's customer with more than 12,000 employees and 2,100 physicians, chose XenDesktop for VDI deployment. In another win, a major short-term housing provider in the United States selected Citrix cloud delivered XenApp and XenDesktop to support business-critical applications in more than 180 locations. This win serves as a nice example of XenApp and XenDesktop returning to growth and regaining market share. 
Our renewed strengthened Microsoft partnership started to bear fruit already in this past quarter. We'll work with Microsoft on an engagement with a cellular carrier owned by LG Corporation. It was the largest-ever deal closed in Korea for Citrix with 29,000 licenses being deployed to help enhance security and productivity. 
On strengthening our existing customer relationships, one of the world's largest investment banks, a long-standing XenApp and XenDesktop took customer moved to allow Citrix to its worldwide operations, encompassing more than 200,000 employees. The bank's decision to choose Citrix was heavily influenced by our unique ability to execute virtualized Skype for Business, and this was only 1 of many such examples. Microsoft recently issued a technical guidance, making an unambiguous statement that Citrix is the clear choice for deploying Skype for Business in virtualized environments. We anticipate that our partnership and alignment with Microsoft will provide us continued additional lift in end user computing. 
On the network delivery side, CMA Insurance, one of the largest commercial insurance companies in the United States replaced an established competitive networking vendor with Citrix NetScaler, making it the cornerstone for their networking infrastructure. CMA chose NetScaler to provide with [ph] quality end user experience to their employees and the mission-critical applications. Essentially, it is an ADC scenario in the Enterprise.
And finally, ShareFile continues to provide [ph] itself as an industry leader, quickly gaining share in the market. We're seeing our efforts to extend ShareFile to the Enterprise segment pay big dividends with the highest number of large deals ever. Among those large-scale wins with ShareFile, we saw one of the largest accounting firms standardized on ShareFile to enable secure collaboration and workflows between their consultants and clients. With accounting being a target vertical for ShareFile, this win now gives ShareFile 2 of the top of 4 accounting firms as customers. 
Our unique differentiators clearly help ShareFile to continue to stand out against generic cloud storage providers. In fact, last week, Citrix was positioned as a leader in Gartner's Magic Quadrant for Enterprise file, sync and share for the third consecutive year. Needless to say, we see a very bright future for ShareFile. 
This week marks my sixth month as Citrix CEO, and I'm more enthusiastic than ever. Our results demonstrate that we're on the right path, building new Citrix. I feel highly confident that we have the right strategy and the plan to execute upon it. I'm incredibly excited about the future of Citrix. Today's announcement with LogMeIn will allow us to continue to focus our resources and investments and accelerate our execution and results. Thank you, and we look forward to your questions."

One is that the decrease is a direct result of just declining Workspace Services license you've seen a couple of years back. And fortunately, the pressure there is abating as the performance has really come back on that front. I'd say that as we've talked about a couple of times, we're uplifting the ARR by delivering new offerings and really migrating customers towards higher-value subscriptions. And so as of last quarter, we had about 25% of the installed base migrated. We're going to be making a larger portion in the second half of the year, really accelerating that. So I think that's one of the things that's going to continue to drive license update and maintenance going forward. I'd say the second thing is there's a little bit of a timing issue with our largest installed-base customer for an order that came in right after the close of the quarter, which influenced that to a kind of a mid-single-digit millions range. Overall, when I look at license update and maintenance line, comfortable with about 3% growth for the year and expect that to grow sequentially into Q3."

And every step of the way, there is a lot of energy and a lot of discussion between Microsoft and Citrix field organizations. We've seen some real examples where collaboration is already occurring. LG U+ in Korea was one such example and there are many more, and I would expect to see a lot more. This is clearly the case where this is win-win for both companies. Citrix is truly helping Microsoft deploy Skype for Business in a virtualized setting in the largest enterprises, and that's how they want to deploy Skype for Business. This is also the case where Citrix has ready-to-go technology to help deploy Windows 10 in the Enterprise, and obviously Microsoft is very focused on that deployment. And all of that is even before we realized some additional product integrations that are coming later in the next 12 months in Enterprise Mobility Suite and NetScaler with Azure and more on Azure integration. So all in all, this is really what we're seeing as the beginning of this partnership becoming to work for both companies."

It's one of the things that always allows us to be conservative when we look forward because it is such a large concentration, but we love our position there.

So in -- 6 months ago, when we laid out targets for the combined company, we're talking about 30% op margin by the end of 2017, I mean, we're clearly operating well ahead of that, probably nearly a full year in front of that when you look at our guidance. So we're really happy with execution across the board. When you kind of step back a little bit and think about the core Citrix, excluding the part that is merging with LogMeIn, that part of the business is operating between 1.5 and 2 percentage points higher on an adjusted op margin than the consolidated whole. So we're clearly well above the 30% range already from a core Citrix point of view. As it comes to providing more granularity into the individual pieces, the S-4 will be filed by LogMeIn later this quarter. And so at that point in time, you'll have a better position to look at the individual performance of the GoTo business stand-alone, the forecast moving forward, et cetera. And I'd say, after Q3, we'll be talking about guidance going forward for 2017 as a stand-alone entity. So I'd say that's one way to think about it."

And in this past quarter already, even though we announced this partnership with Microsoft actually midway in the quarter, even in that quarter, we saw some very exciting wins as a result of better alignment. We see more of that alignment coming in the future. I would say right now, we're at the beginning of working out the mechanics and specifics of how this partnership is going play out in the field. The signs, the early signs are incredibly positive, and we're certainly looking forward to increased velocity and better execution and, frankly, better momentum as we work close together. There are some specific product initiatives and specific joint workings in the field that will certainly be producing more results. We're ready to go with Skype for Business virtualized, and that's how many large enterprises wanted to deploy Skype for Business on Citrix. Microsoft just issued technical guidance on -- essentially stating that Citrix is a clear choice to deploy Skype for Business this way. We have a solution to deploy Windows 10 in the Enterprise in a virtualized and VDI fashion, and that is incredibly well received and that is a huge priority for Microsoft. And we certainly expect both of those existing initiatives to start bearing more fruit. Of course, it depends on overall Skype for Business adoption in the Enterprise. It all depends on Windows 10 adoption in the Enterprise, and we continue to work with Microsoft to advance it. And of course, later in this year, we're really looking forward to introducing additional capabilities into this partnership and into this channel, especially with XenMobile and overall XenMobile suite now playing a role into the Enterprise mobility suite and also NetScaler being aligned with Azure."

Overall, I wouldn't say there's anything explicit in our guidance. However, implicitly, we are certainly talking about a model shift that we've seen gradually. For us, we're in the fortunate position where a lot of it is incremental to what we've already done. The CSP, for example, which is ratable coming out on the Workspace Services business, is addressing SMBs and other areas that our core products wouldn't have. That business is running about a $75 million ARR right now. When I look back at core Citrix cloud delivered services, ShareFile is clearly the biggest, but we've also rolled out new services around XenMobile. We deliver networking actually as a service. We have desktop and VDI and some of these other things that we are rolling out as new services. When you aggregate those together, that business is running at about a 30% clip, and it's generating an ARR of roughly $130 million per year. So when you put those 2 together, and we are sitting on over $200 million of annualized recurring revenue growing north of 30% right now. That's probably the best way to really frame out the shift that we've seen over the past couple of years versus a type of revenue model that you would've had historically. It will be a shift that continues. We're going to talk about this metric each and every quarter to give people more visibility into how that's moving. And when the time comes, not in fiscal year '16, when the time comes, we're going to be more aggressive in our shift of installed base or something that could have a material impact, we'll make sure we talk about that well in advance and communicate that explicitly as part of guidance."

But then, there are additional parts of NetScaler that we're really excited about. The fact that NetScaler is essentially the only pure software-defined ADC enables us to do truly unique things in that market, as evidenced by some wins last quarter. And of course, emerging SD-WAN part of NetScaler, we believe in very strongly. And we expect that to start providing some real material growth in '17 as that market evolves and matures. And we certainly plan on talking about it when we provide overall guidance for 2017 in late October."

We're all about secure delivery of apps and data, and this is the top of mind of every organization, large and small. Security and cybersecurity playing such a strong -- it's just such a strong priority for everybody. And I would say that is the #1 most significant secular trend that drives the need for Citrix solutions. And of course, Windows 10, Skype for Business that we already discussed are additional very important capabilities that people need to embrace and that people need to deploy Skype for Business at scale with Citrix. You can do it securely and you can do it reducing your overall support costs. And sort of the other thing that I would mention is with the engineering work that Citrix have been doing over the last few years, we're now uniquely positioned to deliver XenApp and XenDesktop, essentially, application virtualization and desktop virtualization on the same platform. And we're seeing quite a strong number of customers really wanting to do both on the same platform. And some of those who were using XenApp in the past now want to deploy DDI, and having the same platform and the same infrastructure really enables them to do it with ease using the same tools, using the same life cycle manager -- management, that's the trend. And perhaps, the final thing that I would mention that sort of sets the Americas apart from the rest of the geos, here in Americas, the team embraced vertical focus ahead of everyone else. And if you think about health care wins, lots of them happened here in Americas. And if you think about financial sector and focus there, lots of those -- most of those wins actually happened in Americas as well. And yet again, we expect that playbook to now to be replicated across the world, and that gives us confidence in the future."

We continue to show great results from the operational initiatives we introduced last year. We are focusing all of our energy on our core strategy of securely delivering apps and data, allowing for this consistent execution and really setting the company up for profitable growth as we look forward.
And as you can see from the release, total revenue was up 6% year-on-year in Q2, with product license up 7% and SaaS up 14%. Adjusted operating margin was 28%. Adjusted EPS was $1.20 per share, up 20% from Q2 a year ago, and we also generated $228 million in cash flow from operations. 
In total, we closed 61 $1 million-plus transactions across products and services, an increase of 33% year-on-year, with particular strength coming from financial services, health care and cloud verticals. There's also a good balance across the portfolio. More than half of these transactions coming from Workspace Services solutions, the increasing number from Delivery Networking and even our largest-ever single contract around Enterprise file, sync and share. 
From a geo perspective, excluding the GoTo business, revenue from the Americas was up 11% while EMEA and APJ both declined modestly. The Americas geo has continued to really be the growth engine for a number quarters now. This region is where our restructuring activities began over the last year, and therefore has had the benefit of stability and continuity, a key contributor to this performance and a model for changes that we're making elsewhere in the world.
So next, let's look at our Q2 results within our primary groups. Our Workspace Services business, including app virtualization and mobility grew about 2% to $412 million, including a 1% year-on-year increase in license revenue. The results show that this business is benefiting from the strategy and increased focus applied last year. And as we've discussed before, there's a number of specific initiatives that we're driving to accelerate growth in this area through faster innovation, more verticalized solutions and aggregation of our unique assets. Within this area, there's a few dynamics that are worth noting. First, total revenue from the Workspace suite, which is our comprehensive solution for secure app and data delivery, was up more than 70%, contributed about 12% of license revenue.
Second, we continue to grow our CSP subscriptions, where partners primarily utilize XenApp to deliver cloud-based offerings to their customers. Overall, CSP revenue grew 37% to an ARR of about $75 million. And finally, we saw great results coming out of the Americas geo for overall Workspace Services, where license revenue grew 23% in the quarter and 16% for the first half, really led by demand from the suite.
Next looking at our Delivery Networking. Total revenue increased 11% in the quarter to $195 million, with license growth of 16%. When you focus just on NetScaler, I'll remind everybody that the business is essentially made up of 3 segments: cloud infrastructure and service providers, Citrix solution sales and Enterprise ADC. Demand from the cloud customers continues to be really strong, consistent with what we've seen over the past year. This segment contributed about half of NetScaler product bookings. 
Solution attached sales represented 15% of the mix in Q2, with the number of app and mobile opportunities that included networking as part of an overall Citrix solution consistent with what we saw a year ago. 
Enterprise ADC was about 1/3 of the mix in Q2, and we're seeing an increased traction from the new NetScaler SD-WAN products, which is addressing a nascent market but one that's expected to grow really significantly over the next few years. All in, we sold over 1,900 networking customers in the period with over 1/3 of them being net new. 
And finally, our SaaS-delivered revenue was up 14%, contributing over $200 million in the quarter. The contribution from the GoTo solutions was $169 million, growing 10.5% from a year ago. As we announced earlier today, we're merging this business with LogMeIn over the next few quarters, but until that transaction is completed, we'll continue to operate as a consolidated entity for reporting and guidance purposes. More detail on the performance of the GoTo business' individual segments will be included in the LogMeIn S-4 filing, which is expected later this quarter.
Looking back on the other core Citrix cloud-based services, it contributed $33 million in total revenue, growing at 30%. The bulk of this is coming from ShareFile, our secure data platform, and other new services addressing mobile, networking and desktop needs for our customers.
So clearly, we're beginning to see a shift in the way that products are being consumed by our customers, evolving slowly towards a more consumption-based model. When we include revenue coming from the CSP program, our cloud-based services, excluding GoTo, and any term licenses, the aggregate ARR was over $200 million in Q2, growing at more than 30%. We'll begin to break this out each quarter to provide more visibility into this dynamic.
Shifting gears and turning to operations. We've shown a rapid increase in margin over the last few quarters despite funding incremental investments in our growth businesses and certain go-to-market areas. Our restructuring plans across the company are intended to generate permanent expense reductions, allowing the company to execute more efficiently, while also driving scalability into the future.
In Q2, we posted 28% adjusted op margin, which was up 370 basis points from a year ago. We're clearly operating well ahead of our stated goal of reaching 30% in fiscal year '17. 
The focus on leverage has also really helped increase cash flow from operations, which was up 13% in the quarter to $228 million and up 31% on a trailing 12-month basis. This translates into approximately $1.46 per share in the quarter and over $7 a share over the last 4 quarters.
Before I wrap up, let me talk about our current outlook and expectations for the remainder of the year. Our operational programs and strategy is clearly working, and we're happy with the results and confident in our plans for the balance of the year. At the same time, we're going to remain conservative given the restructuring, the GoTo merger and the significant revenue upside that we delivered in the first half of this year. That said, we're going to increase our assumptions for Q3 and for the full year.
For Q3 '16, we now expect revenue in the range of $820 million to $830 million and adjusted EPS of between $1.18 and $1.20 per share. For the full year 2016, we're increasing our expectations to include revenue between $3.37 billion and $3.39 billion, and adjusted EPS of $5 and $5.10 per share. This range represents 3% to 4% growth on the top line and more than 15% growth in adjusted EPS. We remind you that this guidance represents all businesses, including those that are part of the planned GoTo merger. 
So now I'd like to turn it over to Kirill to give you further color on the quarter and to focus on the areas looking forward. Kirill?"

I'm very encouraged by our performance this quarter. It's a clear signal that our focused execution on the strategy to deliver the world's best integrated technology services for secure delivery of apps and data is resonating well with our customers, partners and the market. 
Our product teams have delivered on all commitments, enabling us to make a number of powerful announcements at the Synergy event in late May. Specifically, we announced and delivered XenApp XenDesktop 7.9, new NetScaler with an option to deliver it in a docket container and also a brand new management and analytics system in NetScaler, and also ShareFile's new information rights management, amongst many other advanced capabilities. 
We've also announced our renewed and stronger-than-ever partnership with Microsoft. And most importantly, we shared our strategy to become the leader in Workspace-as-a-Service and accelerate our move to the cloud. All these announcements and product delivery received resoundingly positive feedback from all constituencies. Our innovation and partnerships are clearly fueling the continued strength in our execution and position us as #1 or 2 in all market segments where we play. 
Adding some comments to the Q2 results that David just shared. I'm very pleased to see that our Workspace Services business, or Xen family, is delivering growth, reversing past trends and clearly regaining market share. This quarter, our rate of growth in net new customers for XenApp/XenDesktop reached strong double-digit growth year-over-year. 
XenMobile contributed strongly to the overall suite. Last month, Citrix was yet again positioned as a leader in Gartner's Magic Quadrant for Enterprise Mobility Management Suites. 
On our transformation to the cloud. The growth in ShareFile reached 30% year-over-year in new sales, and our Citrix service provided business continues to grow at a rapid pace, 37 percentage points year-over-year, primarily delivering XenApp and XenDesktop as a cloud service but also now adding XenMobile and NetScaler as cloud service as well. We clearly see that the cloud is a strong growth catalyst for Citrix, a really positive sign as we continue to focus on the evolving Citrix cloud strategy. Overall, this was a terrific quarter for our worldwide sales team, particularly our Americas team executed extremely well in the quarter. 
We just completed a comprehensive review of our operations in EMEA, and we see strong opportunities in the region, of course, balancing it with other geopolitical headwinds. We've seen some strong winds in Asia Pacific and Japan, and we have high growth aspirations for that region also. This was an incredible quarter adding new customers to the Citrix family, but also solidifying our existing customer relationships. We also saw significant growth in large deals, as David mentioned, and we saw strength in our targeted industry verticals, particularly financial services and health care with nearly 1/3 of our largest wins represented by health care organizations. 
A significant number of customers are moving from other virtualization and networking vendors to Citrix. In fact, we have nearly 800 combined competitive wins or replacements against our top competitors in Q2. Amongst more noticeable competitive wins in Q2, Kindred health network, a long-time competitor's customer with more than 12,000 employees and 2,100 physicians, chose XenDesktop for VDI deployment. In another win, a major short-term housing provider in the United States selected Citrix cloud delivered XenApp and XenDesktop to support business-critical applications in more than 180 locations. This win serves as a nice example of XenApp and XenDesktop returning to growth and regaining market share. 
Our renewed strengthened Microsoft partnership started to bear fruit already in this past quarter. We'll work with Microsoft on an engagement with a cellular carrier owned by LG Corporation. It was the largest-ever deal closed in Korea for Citrix with 29,000 licenses being deployed to help enhance security and productivity. 
On strengthening our existing customer relationships, one of the world's largest investment banks, a long-standing XenApp and XenDesktop took customer moved to allow Citrix to its worldwide operations, encompassing more than 200,000 employees. The bank's decision to choose Citrix was heavily influenced by our unique ability to execute virtualized Skype for Business, and this was only 1 of many such examples. Microsoft recently issued a technical guidance, making an unambiguous statement that Citrix is the clear choice for deploying Skype for Business in virtualized environments. We anticipate that our partnership and alignment with Microsoft will provide us continued additional lift in end user computing. 
On the network delivery side, CMA Insurance, one of the largest commercial insurance companies in the United States replaced an established competitive networking vendor with Citrix NetScaler, making it the cornerstone for their networking infrastructure. CMA chose NetScaler to provide with [ph] quality end user experience to their employees and the mission-critical applications. Essentially, it is an ADC scenario in the Enterprise.
And finally, ShareFile continues to provide [ph] itself as an industry leader, quickly gaining share in the market. We're seeing our efforts to extend ShareFile to the Enterprise segment pay big dividends with the highest number of large deals ever. Among those large-scale wins with ShareFile, we saw one of the largest accounting firms standardized on ShareFile to enable secure collaboration and workflows between their consultants and clients. With accounting being a target vertical for ShareFile, this win now gives ShareFile 2 of the top of 4 accounting firms as customers. 
Our unique differentiators clearly help ShareFile to continue to stand out against generic cloud storage providers. In fact, last week, Citrix was positioned as a leader in Gartner's Magic Quadrant for Enterprise file, sync and share for the third consecutive year. Needless to say, we see a very bright future for ShareFile. 
This week marks my sixth month as Citrix CEO, and I'm more enthusiastic than ever. Our results demonstrate that we're on the right path, building new Citrix. I feel highly confident that we have the right strategy and the plan to execute upon it. I'm incredibly excited about the future of Citrix. Today's announcement with LogMeIn will allow us to continue to focus our resources and investments and accelerate our execution and results. Thank you, and we look forward to your questions."

One is that the decrease is a direct result of just declining Workspace Services license you've seen a couple of years back. And fortunately, the pressure there is abating as the performance has really come back on that front. I'd say that as we've talked about a couple of times, we're uplifting the ARR by delivering new offerings and really migrating customers towards higher-value subscriptions. And so as of last quarter, we had about 25% of the installed base migrated. We're going to be making a larger portion in the second half of the year, really accelerating that. So I think that's one of the things that's going to continue to drive license update and maintenance going forward. I'd say the second thing is there's a little bit of a timing issue with our largest installed-base customer for an order that came in right after the close of the quarter, which influenced that to a kind of a mid-single-digit millions range. Overall, when I look at license update and maintenance line, comfortable with about 3% growth for the year and expect that to grow sequentially into Q3."

And every step of the way, there is a lot of energy and a lot of discussion between Microsoft and Citrix field organizations. We've seen some real examples where collaboration is already occurring. LG U+ in Korea was one such example and there are many more, and I would expect to see a lot more. This is clearly the case where this is win-win for both companies. Citrix is truly helping Microsoft deploy Skype for Business in a virtualized setting in the largest enterprises, and that's how they want to deploy Skype for Business. This is also the case where Citrix has ready-to-go technology to help deploy Windows 10 in the Enterprise, and obviously Microsoft is very focused on that deployment. And all of that is even before we realized some additional product integrations that are coming later in the next 12 months in Enterprise Mobility Suite and NetScaler with Azure and more on Azure integration.

It's one of the things that always allows us to be conservative when we look forward because it is such a large concentration, but we love our position there.

So we're really happy with execution across the board. When you kind of step back a little bit and think about the core Citrix, excluding the part that is merging with LogMeIn, that part of the business is operating between 1.5 and 2 percentage points higher on an adjusted op margin than the consolidated whole. So we're clearly well above the 30% range already from a core Citrix point of view. As it comes to providing more granularity into the individual pieces, the S-4 will be filed by LogMeIn later this quarter. And so at that point in time, you'll have a better position to look at the individual performance of the GoTo business stand-alone, the forecast moving forward, et cetera. And I'd say, after Q3, we'll be talking about guidance going forward for 2017 as a stand-alone entity. So I'd say that's one way to think about it."

And in this past quarter already, even though we announced this partnership with Microsoft actually midway in the quarter, even in that quarter, we saw some very exciting wins as a result of better alignment. We see more of that alignment coming in the future. I would say right now, we're at the beginning of working out the mechanics and specifics of how this partnership is going play out in the field. The signs, the early signs are incredibly positive, and we're certainly looking forward to increased velocity and better execution and, frankly, better momentum as we work close together. There are some specific product initiatives and specific joint workings in the field that will certainly be producing more results. We're ready to go with Skype for Business virtualized, and that's how many large enterprises wanted to deploy Skype for Business on Citrix. Microsoft just issued technical guidance on -- essentially stating that Citrix is a clear choice to deploy Skype for Business this way. We have a solution to deploy Windows 10 in the Enterprise in a virtualized and VDI fashion, and that is incredibly well received and that is a huge priority for Microsoft. And we certainly expect both of those existing initiatives to start bearing more fruit. Of course, it depends on overall Skype for Business adoption in the Enterprise. It all depends on Windows 10 adoption in the Enterprise, and we continue to work with Microsoft to advance it. And of course, later in this year, we're really looking forward to introducing additional capabilities into this partnership and into this channel, especially with XenMobile and overall XenMobile suite now playing a role into the Enterprise mobility suite and also NetScaler being aligned with Azure."

Overall, I wouldn't say there's anything explicit in our guidance. However, implicitly, we are certainly talking about a model shift that we've seen gradually. For us, we're in the fortunate position where a lot of it is incremental to what we've already done. The CSP, for example, which is ratable coming out on the Workspace Services business, is addressing SMBs and other areas that our core products wouldn't have. That business is running about a $75 million ARR right now. When I look back at core Citrix cloud delivered services, ShareFile is clearly the biggest, but we've also rolled out new services around XenMobile. We deliver networking actually as a service. We have desktop and VDI and some of these other things that we are rolling out as new services. When you aggregate those together, that business is running at about a 30% clip, and it's generating an ARR of roughly $130 million per year. So when you put those 2 together, and we are sitting on over $200 million of annualized recurring revenue growing north of 30% right now. That's probably the best way to really frame out the shift that we've seen over the past couple of years versus a type of revenue model that you would've had historically. It will be a shift that continues. We're going to talk about this metric each and every quarter to give people more visibility into how that's moving. And when the time comes, not in fiscal year '16, when the time comes, we're going to be more aggressive in our shift of installed base or something that could have a material impact, we'll make sure we talk about that well in advance and communicate that explicitly as part of guidance."

We're all about secure delivery of apps and data, and this is the top of mind of every organization, large and small. Security and cybersecurity playing such a strong -- it's just such a strong priority for everybody. And I would say that is the #1 most significant secular trend that drives the need for Citrix solutions. And of course, Windows 10, Skype for Business that we already discussed are additional very important capabilities that people need to embrace and that people need to deploy Skype for Business at scale with Citrix. You can do it securely and you can do it reducing your overall support costs. And sort of the other thing that I would mention is with the engineering work that Citrix have been doing over the last few years, we're now uniquely positioned to deliver XenApp and XenDesktop, essentially, application virtualization and desktop virtualization on the same platform. And we're seeing quite a strong number of customers really wanting to do both on the same platform. And some of those who were using XenApp in the past now want to deploy DDI, and having the same platform and the same infrastructure really enables them to do it with ease using the same tools, using the same life cycle manager -- management, that's the trend. And perhaps, the final thing that I would mention that sort of sets the Americas apart from the rest of the geos, here in Americas, the team embraced vertical focus ahead of everyone else. And if you think about health care wins, lots of them happened here in Americas. And if you think about financial sector and focus there, lots of those -- most of those wins actually happened in Americas as well. And yet again, we expect that playbook to now to be replicated across the world, and that gives us confidence in the future."

We continue to show great results from the operational initiatives we introduced last year. We are focusing all of our energy on our core strategy of securely delivering apps and data, allowing for this consistent execution and really setting the company up for profitable growth as we look forward.
And as you can see from the release, total revenue was up 6% year-on-year in Q2, with product license up 7% and SaaS up 14%. Adjusted operating margin was 28%. Adjusted EPS was $1.20 per share, up 20% from Q2 a year ago, and we also generated $228 million in cash flow from operations. 
In total, we closed 61 $1 million-plus transactions across products and services, an increase of 33% year-on-year, with particular strength coming from financial services, health care and cloud verticals. There's also a good balance across the portfolio. More than half of these transactions coming from Workspace Services solutions, the increasing number from Delivery Networking and even our largest-ever single contract around Enterprise file, sync and share. 
From a geo perspective, excluding the GoTo business, revenue from the Americas was up 11% while EMEA and APJ both declined modestly. The Americas geo has continued to really be the growth engine for a number quarters now. This region is where our restructuring activities began over the last year, and therefore has had the benefit of stability and continuity, a key contributor to this performance and a model for changes that we're making elsewhere in the world.
So next, let's look at our Q2 results within our primary groups. Our Workspace Services business, including app virtualization and mobility grew about 2% to $412 million, including a 1% year-on-year increase in license revenue. The results show that this business is benefiting from the strategy and increased focus applied last year. And as we've discussed before, there's a number of specific initiatives that we're driving to accelerate growth in this area through faster innovation, more verticalized solutions and aggregation of our unique assets. Within this area, there's a few dynamics that are worth noting. First, total revenue from the Workspace suite, which is our comprehensive solution for secure app and data delivery, was up more than 70%, contributed about 12% of license revenue.
Second, we continue to grow our CSP subscriptions, where partners primarily utilize XenApp to deliver cloud-based offerings to their customers. Overall, CSP revenue grew 37% to an ARR of about $75 million. And finally, we saw great results coming out of the Americas geo for overall Workspace Services, where license revenue grew 23% in the quarter and 16% for the first half, really led by demand from the suite.
Next looking at our Delivery Networking. Total revenue increased 11% in the quarter to $195 million, with license growth of 16%. When you focus just on NetScaler, I'll remind everybody that the business is essentially made up of 3 segments: cloud infrastructure and service providers, Citrix solution sales and Enterprise ADC. Demand from the cloud customers continues to be really strong, consistent with what we've seen over the past year. This segment contributed about half of NetScaler product bookings. 
Solution attached sales represented 15% of the mix in Q2, with the number of app and mobile opportunities that included networking as part of an overall Citrix solution consistent with what we saw a year ago. 
Enterprise ADC was about 1/3 of the mix in Q2, and we're seeing an increased traction from the new NetScaler SD-WAN products, which is addressing a nascent market but one that's expected to grow really significantly over the next few years. All in, we sold over 1,900 networking customers in the period with over 1/3 of them being net new. 
And finally, our SaaS-delivered revenue was up 14%, contributing over $200 million in the quarter. The contribution from the GoTo solutions was $169 million, growing 10.5% from a year ago. As we announced earlier today, we're merging this business with LogMeIn over the next few quarters, but until that transaction is completed, we'll continue to operate as a consolidated entity for reporting and guidance purposes. More detail on the performance of the GoTo business' individual segments will be included in the LogMeIn S-4 filing, which is expected later this quarter.
Looking back on the other core Citrix cloud-based services, it contributed $33 million in total revenue, growing at 30%. The bulk of this is coming from ShareFile, our secure data platform, and other new services addressing mobile, networking and desktop needs for our customers.
So clearly, we're beginning to see a shift in the way that products are being consumed by our customers, evolving slowly towards a more consumption-based model. When we include revenue coming from the CSP program, our cloud-based services, excluding GoTo, and any term licenses, the aggregate ARR was over $200 million in Q2, growing at more than 30%. We'll begin to break this out each quarter to provide more visibility into this dynamic.
Shifting gears and turning to operations. We've shown a rapid increase in margin over the last few quarters despite funding incremental investments in our growth businesses and certain go-to-market areas. Our restructuring plans across the company are intended to generate permanent expense reductions, allowing the company to execute more efficiently, while also driving scalability into the future.
In Q2, we posted 28% adjusted op margin, which was up 370 basis points from a year ago. We're clearly operating well ahead of our stated goal of reaching 30% in fiscal year '17. 
The focus on leverage has also really helped increase cash flow from operations, which was up 13% in the quarter to $228 million and up 31% on a trailing 12-month basis. This translates into approximately $1.46 per share in the quarter and over $7 a share over the last 4 quarters.
Before I wrap up, let me talk about our current outlook and expectations for the remainder of the year. Our operational programs and strategy is clearly working, and we're happy with the results and confident in our plans for the balance of the year. At the same time, we're going to remain conservative given the restructuring, the GoTo merger and the significant revenue upside that we delivered in the first half of this year. That said, we're going to increase our assumptions for Q3 and for the full year.
For Q3 '16, we now expect revenue in the range of $820 million to $830 million and adjusted EPS of between $1.18 and $1.20 per share. For the full year 2016, we're increasing our expectations to include revenue between $3.37 billion and $3.39 billion, and adjusted EPS of $5 and $5.10 per share. This range represents 3% to 4% growth on the top line and more than 15% growth in adjusted EPS. We remind you that this guidance represents all businesses, including those that are part of the planned GoTo merger. 
So now I'd like to turn it over to Kirill to give you further color on the quarter and to focus on the areas looking forward. Kirill?"

I'm very encouraged by our performance this quarter. It's a clear signal that our focused execution on the strategy to deliver the world's best integrated technology services for secure delivery of apps and data is resonating well with our customers, partners and the market. 
Our product teams have delivered on all commitments, enabling us to make a number of powerful announcements at the Synergy event in late May. Specifically, we announced and delivered XenApp XenDesktop 7.9, new NetScaler with an option to deliver it in a docket container and also a brand new management and analytics system in NetScaler, and also ShareFile's new information rights management, amongst many other advanced capabilities. 
We've also announced our renewed and stronger-than-ever partnership with Microsoft. And most importantly, we shared our strategy to become the leader in Workspace-as-a-Service and accelerate our move to the cloud. All these announcements and product delivery received resoundingly positive feedback from all constituencies. Our innovation and partnerships are clearly fueling the continued strength in our execution and position us as #1 or 2 in all market segments where we play. 
Adding some comments to the Q2 results that David just shared. I'm very pleased to see that our Workspace Services business, or Xen family, is delivering growth, reversing past trends and clearly regaining market share. This quarter, our rate of growth in net new customers for XenApp/XenDesktop reached strong double-digit growth year-over-year. 
XenMobile contributed strongly to the overall suite. Last month, Citrix was yet again positioned as a leader in Gartner's Magic Quadrant for Enterprise Mobility Management Suites. 
On our transformation to the cloud. The growth in ShareFile reached 30% year-over-year in new sales, and our Citrix service provided business continues to grow at a rapid pace, 37 percentage points year-over-year, primarily delivering XenApp and XenDesktop as a cloud service but also now adding XenMobile and NetScaler as cloud service as well. We clearly see that the cloud is a strong growth catalyst for Citrix, a really positive sign as we continue to focus on the evolving Citrix cloud strategy. Overall, this was a terrific quarter for our worldwide sales team, particularly our Americas team executed extremely well in the quarter. 
We just completed a comprehensive review of our operations in EMEA, and we see strong opportunities in the region, of course, balancing it with other geopolitical headwinds. We've seen some strong winds in Asia Pacific and Japan, and we have high growth aspirations for that region also. This was an incredible quarter adding new customers to the Citrix family, but also solidifying our existing customer relationships. We also saw significant growth in large deals, as David mentioned, and we saw strength in our targeted industry verticals, particularly financial services and health care with nearly 1/3 of our largest wins represented by health care organizations. 
A significant number of customers are moving from other virtualization and networking vendors to Citrix. In fact, we have nearly 800 combined competitive wins or replacements against our top competitors in Q2. Amongst more noticeable competitive wins in Q2, Kindred health network, a long-time competitor's customer with more than 12,000 employees and 2,100 physicians, chose XenDesktop for VDI deployment. In another win, a major short-term housing provider in the United States selected Citrix cloud delivered XenApp and XenDesktop to support business-critical applications in more than 180 locations. This win serves as a nice example of XenApp and XenDesktop returning to growth and regaining market share. 
Our renewed strengthened Microsoft partnership started to bear fruit already in this past quarter. We'll work with Microsoft on an engagement with a cellular carrier owned by LG Corporation. It was the largest-ever deal closed in Korea for Citrix with 29,000 licenses being deployed to help enhance security and productivity. 
On strengthening our existing customer relationships, one of the world's largest investment banks, a long-standing XenApp and XenDesktop took customer moved to allow Citrix to its worldwide operations, encompassing more than 200,000 employees. The bank's decision to choose Citrix was heavily influenced by our unique ability to execute virtualized Skype for Business, and this was only 1 of many such examples. Microsoft recently issued a technical guidance, making an unambiguous statement that Citrix is the clear choice for deploying Skype for Business in virtualized environments. We anticipate that our partnership and alignment with Microsoft will provide us continued additional lift in end user computing. 
On the network delivery side, CMA Insurance, one of the largest commercial insurance companies in the United States replaced an established competitive networking vendor with Citrix NetScaler, making it the cornerstone for their networking infrastructure. CMA chose NetScaler to provide with [ph] quality end user experience to their employees and the mission-critical applications. Essentially, it is an ADC scenario in the Enterprise.
And finally, ShareFile continues to provide [ph] itself as an industry leader, quickly gaining share in the market. We're seeing our efforts to extend ShareFile to the Enterprise segment pay big dividends with the highest number of large deals ever. Among those large-scale wins with ShareFile, we saw one of the largest accounting firms standardized on ShareFile to enable secure collaboration and workflows between their consultants and clients. With accounting being a target vertical for ShareFile, this win now gives ShareFile 2 of the top of 4 accounting firms as customers. 
Our unique differentiators clearly help ShareFile to continue to stand out against generic cloud storage providers. In fact, last week, Citrix was positioned as a leader in Gartner's Magic Quadrant for Enterprise file, sync and share for the third consecutive year. Needless to say, we see a very bright future for ShareFile. 
This week marks my sixth month as Citrix CEO, and I'm more enthusiastic than ever. Our results demonstrate that we're on the right path, building new Citrix. I feel highly confident that we have the right strategy and the plan to execute upon it. I'm incredibly excited about the future of Citrix. Today's announcement with LogMeIn will allow us to continue to focus our resources and investments and accelerate our execution and results. Thank you, and we look forward to your questions."

One is that the decrease is a direct result of just declining Workspace Services license you've seen a couple of years back. And fortunately, the pressure there is abating as the performance has really come back on that front. I'd say that as we've talked about a couple of times, we're uplifting the ARR by delivering new offerings and really migrating customers towards higher-value subscriptions. And so as of last quarter, we had about 25% of the installed base migrated. We're going to be making a larger portion in the second half of the year, really accelerating that. So I think that's one of the things that's going to continue to drive license update and maintenance going forward. I'd say the second thing is there's a little bit of a timing issue with our largest installed-base customer for an order that came in right after the close of the quarter, which influenced that to a kind of a mid-single-digit millions range. Overall, when I look at license update and maintenance line, comfortable with about 3% growth for the year and expect that to grow sequentially into Q3."

There's a tremendous collaboration that we're starting to see in the field worldwide. I just returned from touring EMEA. And every step of the way, there is a lot of energy and a lot of discussion between Microsoft and Citrix field organizations. We've seen some real examples where collaboration is already occurring. LG U+ in Korea was one such example and there are many more, and I would expect to see a lot more. This is clearly the case where this is win-win for both companies. Citrix is truly helping Microsoft deploy Skype for Business in a virtualized setting in the largest enterprises, and that's how they want to deploy Skype for Business. This is also the case where Citrix has ready-to-go technology to help deploy Windows 10 in the Enterprise, and obviously Microsoft is very focused on that deployment. And all of that is even before we realized some additional product integrations that are coming later in the next 12 months in Enterprise Mobility Suite and NetScaler with Azure and more on Azure integration. So all in all, this is really what we're seeing as the beginning of this partnership becoming to work for both companies."

So we've had great continuity over the course of the last year. It's one of the things that always allows us to be conservative when we look forward because it is such a large concentration, but we love our position there.

So we're really happy with execution across the board. When you kind of step back a little bit and think about the core Citrix, excluding the part that is merging with LogMeIn, that part of the business is operating between 1.5 and 2 percentage points higher on an adjusted op margin than the consolidated whole. So we're clearly well above the 30% range already from a core Citrix point of view. As it comes to providing more granularity into the individual pieces, the S-4 will be filed by LogMeIn later this quarter. And so at that point in time, you'll have a better position to look at the individual performance of the GoTo business stand-alone, the forecast moving forward, et cetera. And I'd say, after Q3, we'll be talking about guidance going forward for 2017 as a stand-alone entity. So I'd say that's one way to think about it."

We first sort of saw it at Synergy, when for the first time ever, we have this good contingent of IT decision-makers, really senior CIO level people coming to join us to talk about Citrix. And that raised the profile and raised visibility, certainly enabled us to deliver more of that complete value, and that's certainly how we look at the future. It's not point product.

And in this past quarter already, even though we announced this partnership with Microsoft actually midway in the quarter, even in that quarter, we saw some very exciting wins as a result of better alignment. We see more of that alignment coming in the future. I would say right now, we're at the beginning of working out the mechanics and specifics of how this partnership is going play out in the field. The signs, the early signs are incredibly positive, and we're certainly looking forward to increased velocity and better execution and, frankly, better momentum as we work close together. There are some specific product initiatives and specific joint workings in the field that will certainly be producing more results. We're ready to go with Skype for Business virtualized, and that's how many large enterprises wanted to deploy Skype for Business on Citrix. Microsoft just issued technical guidance on -- essentially stating that Citrix is a clear choice to deploy Skype for Business this way. We have a solution to deploy Windows 10 in the Enterprise in a virtualized and VDI fashion, and that is incredibly well received and that is a huge priority for Microsoft. And we certainly expect both of those existing initiatives to start bearing more fruit. Of course, it depends on overall Skype for Business adoption in the Enterprise. It all depends on Windows 10 adoption in the Enterprise, and we continue to work with Microsoft to advance it. And of course, later in this year, we're really looking forward to introducing additional capabilities into this partnership and into this channel, especially with XenMobile and overall XenMobile suite now playing a role into the Enterprise mobility suite and also NetScaler being aligned with Azure."

Overall, I wouldn't say there's anything explicit in our guidance. However, implicitly, we are certainly talking about a model shift that we've seen gradually. For us, we're in the fortunate position where a lot of it is incremental to what we've already done. The CSP, for example, which is ratable coming out on the Workspace Services business, is addressing SMBs and other areas that our core products wouldn't have. That business is running about a $75 million ARR right now. When I look back at core Citrix cloud delivered services, ShareFile is clearly the biggest, but we've also rolled out new services around XenMobile. We deliver networking actually as a service. We have desktop and VDI and some of these other things that we are rolling out as new services. When you aggregate those together, that business is running at about a 30% clip, and it's generating an ARR of roughly $130 million per year. So when you put those 2 together, and we are sitting on over $200 million of annualized recurring revenue growing north of 30% right now. That's probably the best way to really frame out the shift that we've seen over the past couple of years versus a type of revenue model that you would've had historically. It will be a shift that continues. We're going to talk about this metric each and every quarter to give people more visibility into how that's moving. And when the time comes, not in fiscal year '16, when the time comes, we're going to be more aggressive in our shift of installed base or something that could have a material impact, we'll make sure we talk about that well in advance and communicate that explicitly as part of guidance."

We're all about secure delivery of apps and data, and this is the top of mind of every organization, large and small. Security and cybersecurity playing such a strong -- it's just such a strong priority for everybody. And I would say that is the #1 most significant secular trend that drives the need for Citrix solutions. And of course, Windows 10, Skype for Business that we already discussed are additional very important capabilities that people need to embrace and that people need to deploy Skype for Business at scale with Citrix. You can do it securely and you can do it reducing your overall support costs. And sort of the other thing that I would mention is with the engineering work that Citrix have been doing over the last few years, we're now uniquely positioned to deliver XenApp and XenDesktop, essentially, application virtualization and desktop virtualization on the same platform. And we're seeing quite a strong number of customers really wanting to do both on the same platform. And some of those who were using XenApp in the past now want to deploy DDI, and having the same platform and the same infrastructure really enables them to do it with ease using the same tools, using the same life cycle manager -- management, that's the trend. And perhaps, the final thing that I would mention that sort of sets the Americas apart from the rest of the geos, here in Americas, the team embraced vertical focus ahead of everyone else. And if you think about health care wins, lots of them happened here in Americas. And if you think about financial sector and focus there, lots of those -- most of those wins actually happened in Americas as well.

We continue to show great results and overall execution from the operational initiatives that have been driving profitability, to the strength in product portfolio that's driving top line growth.",1385,"Thanks, Eduardo, and welcome to everyone joining us today. We continue to show great results and overall execution from the operational initiatives that have been driving profitability, to the strength in product portfolio that's driving top line growth. We're focusing all of our energy on the core strategy of securely delivering apps and data, really setting the company up for sustainable profitable growth as we look forward. 
As you can see from the release, total revenue was up 3% year-on-year in Q3. Adjusted operating margin expanded to over 30%. Adjusted EPS was $1.32 per share, up 27% year-on-year, and we generated nearly $290 million in cash flow from ops. In total, we closed 49 $1 million-plus transactions, with particular strength in cloud, health care, technology and government verticals. There was also good balance across the portfolio, with more than half of these deals coming from Workspace Services, with the balance coming from networking. 
From a geographic perspective, when you exclude the GoTo businesses, revenue from the Americas was up 8%. APJ was flat, and the EMEA market declined about 4%. This performance is pretty consistent with the first half of the year. The Americas geo continues to drive significant growth across all product categories, while the other regions are seeing improving execution in many of our primary markets. 
Related to this, in Q3, we announced a leadership change in the APJ region and pending change in the U.K. And these things will help accelerate field restructuring into 2017. 
Next, I want to talk about Q3 results within our 3 primary businesses. Within Workspace Service business, which includes virtualization mobility, grew 5% total to $414 million, including a 5% year-on-year increase in product license revenue. This growth rate has been really moving up over the last 6 quarters and is a direct result of the focused strategy we adopted last year. As we've discussed a few times, there's a number of very specific initiatives that we're driving to accelerate growth in this area through much faster innovation, more verticalized solutions, integration of our unique assets across the portfolio and the reinvigoration of our channel partnerships. 
Just a couple of other dynamics that are worth noting. That includes the license revenue in the Americas geo, with across all of Workspace Services has accelerated last quarter. In Q3, this was up 18% year-on-year, and this is after already posting 16% license growth through the first half of the year. Much of this has been coming from mid-, large enterprise customers, often in verticals where security and compliance are major concerns. 
Additionally, we continue to grow our cloud service provider subscriptions, where partners are primarily utilizing XenApp to deliver cloud-based offerings to their customers. Overall, the Citrix Service Provider revenue grew about 30% to now have an ARR of over $75 million. 
Next, looking at Delivery Networking. Total revenue increased 1% in the quarter to $191 million. The largest part of this overall business, NetScaler ADC, posted license revenue growth of 5% against the strong Q3 a year ago. But impacting the results in the rest of the BU were the comps from the ByteMobile and cloud platform products that are part of the restructuring at the start of this year. 
Staying on NetScaler for a minute. I'll remind everybody that the business is essentially made up of 3 segments: cloud infrastructure and e-commerce; Citrix solution sales; and enterprise ADC. So within the quarter, demand from cloud and e-commerce continued to be really strong, consistent with what we've seen over the last 5 quarters. This segment, which is made up of roughly 200 different customers in the quarter, contributed about 40% of NetScaler product sales. The solution-attached segment represented 15% of the mix, with a number of app and mobile opportunities that included networking as part of an overall Citrix solution was up modestly from a year ago. And then enterprise ADC was the remaining 45% of the mix. All in, we sold over 1,600 networking customers during the period, with 1/3 of those being net new to Citrix. 
And finally, our SaaS-delivered revenue was up 9% to $207 million in the quarter. The contribution from the GoTo business was $173 million. And as far as the merger between GoTo and LogMeIn, we received U.S. antitrust approval in September and continue to expect this to close in the Q1 2017 time frame. 
When you look at just the cloud-based services that are part of core Citrix, we delivered $35 million in total revenue, growing 28% in the quarter. The bulk of this is coming from ShareFile, our secure data platform, with the other new offerings addressing workspaces and service needs for our customers. So clearly, we continue to see a shift in the way products are being consumed by customers, evolving slowly towards a more ratable model. So when you include revenue that is being generated from the Citrix Service Provider program, plus our own cloud-based services and the annual term license, the aggregate ARR is now over $225 million, growing very rapidly. 
So turning to operations. We've driven a lot of efficiencies in the company over the past 6 quarters and continue to do so in Q3. The actions across the business were designed to generate permanent expense reductions while reallocating investments to those areas that will drive profitable growth in the future. In Q3, adjusted operating margin was over 30%. This is up more than 400 basis points from last year. We're clearly operating well ahead of our stated goal of reaching 30% full year margins in 2017. 
The focus on leverage has also helped increase our cash flow profile for the company. Q3 cash flow from operations was a record $288 million. And over the trailing 12 months, we've generated a total of $1.14 billion in cash from ops, and this is up 21%. 
As you start to model fiscal 2017, I want to point out that historically, about 80% to 90% of cash flow from operations can be attributed to core Citrix business, with the remainder coming from GoTo. Exiting Q3, we had nearly $2.5 billion in cash and investments on the balance sheet, which is up sharply from last quarter. Over the last several years, our stated target has been to utilize half of free cash flow for capital return, a level which, frankly, we've regularly exceeded. As you know, this program has been on hold due to the pending separation of the GoTo business. So once that's completed, we intend to restart our programmatic capital return, and we'll talk definitively about those plans once the transaction is closed. 
Before I wrap up, let me talk about our current outlook and expectations for the remainder of the year. Our growth strategy and operational programs are clearly working. We're happy with the results, and we're confident in our plans for the balance of the year and looking into 2017. At the same time, we're going to continue our conservative outlook, given the pending GoTo merger with LogMeIn and the significant revenue upside we posted in Q4 of last year. That said, we're increasing our assumptions for Q4 and the full year. So for 2016, we now expect consolidated revenue between $3.4 billion and $3.41 billion and adjusted EPS of $5.18 to $5.20 this year. This represents revenue for core Citrix to be in the range of $2.71 billion to $2.72 billion or roughly 3.5 -- or excuse me, 2.5% to 3% growth, when you exclude the GoTo business. 
With respect to 2017, we're just finishing up our planning cycle, which is very normal for this point in Q4. At this stage, we still expect the GoTo merger to be completed in Q1 '17, so we're completely focused on the ongoing business at core Citrix. We're feeling good about the continued improvement in results, in the new product cycles and the early returns from Citrix cloud. We're also making the GoTo market capacity investments that should drive additional growth next year, particularly in the second half of 2017. Therefore, we're currently modeling 2017 full year revenue growth of 3% to 4% for core Citrix and adjusted operating margins of 32% to 33%. 
So now I'd like to turn it over to Kirill to give further color on the quarter and our focus areas looking forward. Kirill?"

I'm obviously very pleased with our results, clearly demonstrating how our renewed focus is resonating in the marketplace. We're seeing growth in all of our core areas of business, most importantly in our Workspace Services business, showing growth for the second consecutive quarter. 
Our efforts in accelerating product innovation and improving operational processes are working. And the progress on cultural transformation that defines us in the company will continue to power us forward. We're seeing improved stability in our workforce and incredibly strong employee engagement as evidenced by very strong results and participation in our recent global employee survey. 
Specific to our field organization, through these improvements, we now have approximately 100 more quota-carrying reps since our restructuring about a year ago. Our America sales team continues to fire on all cylinders with consistently strong execution quarter after quarter. And with the leadership changes we have implemented in APJ and more change upcoming in EMEA, we see great opportunity to replicate what's working so strongly in the Americas. 
Our vision is clear. Our strategy is crisp, and our execution has improved dramatically. We now have had 5 straight quarters of continuous operating improvement. 
A few additional comments on our solution areas. There's a big story this quarter, of course, Workspace Services or our Xen family. It's exciting to see this core part of our business delivering 5% year-over-year increase in license revenue. I'm encouraged by sales energy and tremendous product innovation in this area. After 2 quarters of solid growth, this is clearly not a fluke or just a blip on the radar. This is an exciting change deliberately driven by the strongest, highly differentiated products and much-improved competitive edge. 
Additionally, in September, we delivered XenApps and Desktop 7.11, a major release featuring day 1 support for Windows Server 2016, management innovations and user experience enhancements. We also acquired NorthScale, greatly complementary technology that adds extra capabilities in the user environment management and adds very smart workspace performance optimization techniques, unmatched in the industry. 
We saw more than 650 competitive wins in virtual client computing this quarter, and our win rate has been consistently improving. Specifically, one of the nation's largest grocery retail and supply chain services companies chose XenDesktop for VDI delivery to support their retail corporations, thanks to our partnership with Microsoft. 
And another major win against the top competitor in the space, one of the world's largest insurance providers chose to leverage XenDesktop to enable the efficient upgrade to Windows 10 on more than 20,000 desktops, also driven by our unique support for Skype for Business. 
We continue to see more customers choosing our entire portfolio due to stronger-than-ever product integration. For example, in a dual competitive win, a top clinical teaching hospital in the Netherlands is rethinking their Workspace Services end-to-end, chose Citrix Workspace Suite against both the virtualization competitor and the networking competitor, so they can implement a full coherent solution for hospital workplace innovation. 
Moving on to network delivery business. As David mentioned, we saw good growth in the core ADC area, with a 5% year-over-year increase from the already strong Q3 in 2015. On the product innovation front, we released a major update to NetScaler SD-WAN. We continue to be very encouraged by growth in that area. This update featured more advanced routing, simple deployment and unrivaled security capabilities. We also released NetScaler support for the fifth standard, a testament to our commitment to security in the U.S. federal government. And we released NetScaler CPX, a free developer version of NetScaler in a container, that allows for rapid deployment methodologies such as DevOps. It's clear indicator of our teams focus on new technologies and increased innovation. 
We some other 500 competitive wins in the network delivery space globally, including a major African mobile communications company, a major international electronics company and a global technology company. All of which are using NetScaler to ensure high network availability, resilience and security in their services. 
Onto data delivery. As with previous quarters, ShareFile continued to prove itself as a growing force in the Enterprise file, sync and share market, growing 25% year-over-year. We continue to drive rapid product innovation and expand ShareFile functionality in target industries, adding more workflows and cloud connectors. We're starting to see increased traction of ShareFile outside of the United States, where it's still the strongest, and in the larger Enterprise segment. Specifically, Daimler AG, one of the largest and well-known producers of premium cars and manufacturers of commercial vehicles, chose Citrix ShareFile to improve large file exchange across the organization, and it will help them reduce storage and support business departments when dealing with big amounts of data. 
On to the industry trends. Cybersecurity, bring-your-own-device phenomenon, cloud adoption and Microsoft refresh cycle all served as catalysts to our business in Q3. We saw strong demand for our solutions to support organizations' initiatives to secure their data, applications and networks. This is particularly evident in highly regulated industries, including financial services and health care, which had more than a dozen large deals this quarter, as David mentioned. 
We also had several defense ministries and government agencies around the world choosing Citrix to address security concerns. The cybersecurity being the #1 concern for enterprises of all sizes and governments around the world. It is becoming increasingly evident that Citrix solutions are indeed one of the strongest defenses against potential endpoint device and perimeter attacks. 
Moving on to our progress in the cloud. This was a tremendous quarter in our cloud transformation. While it's still in early progress, the momentum is building, with wins coming from businesses of all sizes. Highlighting just a few examples. , a well-known provider of worldwide leading-edge technology for international construction professionals, has partnered with us to drive their cloud transformation and enable to bring-your-own-device policy for employees through Citrix Cloud. Columbia University and another major Ivy League school both chose Citrix Cloud to assist in their transition and reduce infrastructure costs and IT support needs. Citrix Cloud overall is really starting to shine. 
Couple of remarks on our partnerships. This quarter, we saw a major step forward in our stronger-than-ever relationship with Microsoft. As you may recall, earlier this year, we had announced an elevated and more strategic partnership with Microsoft and now, I'm happy to report that it's starting to bear fruit. We're seeing good alignment of our teams in the field, bringing those joint wins I previously mentioned. 
Also in August, Microsoft announced that they were transitioning out of [indiscernible] app, and Citrix XenApp was designated as the destination for [indiscernible] customers. We're creating clear migration path for as remote app customers that want to use all of the app capabilities. This announcement served as a continued vote of confidence that Citrix is clearly the right partner for future success to deliver more workloads on Azure and more adoption of Windows 10 and Office 365. 
As to our broader partner channel, the momentum is continuing to grow. And while we have nearly 50 $1 million-plus deals in Q3, the ShareFile sales coming from the mid-market is increasing, clear signal that our strategy to expand in mid-market is working and that our partner channel is more vibrant than ever. 
Just last week, we hosted our top partners in the Americas who gave us tremendous feedback on our mutual progress. 
And last but certainly, not least, last month, we held our Annual Industry Analyst event, where we have the opportunity to share our vision, strategy and core messaging. Their feedback was remarkable. I previously shared the confidence I heard from our customers and partners and now, hearing such positive reinforcement in our direction and focus from industry analysts was truly encouraging. Our strategy and overall positioning was very well received, proving to me that we're on the right path. 
As I mentioned with highly differentiated products, we have stepped up our competitive edge, and it is paying off. We're taking share in all our core areas of business. Overall, I feel very enthusiastic about the business and look forward to closing out the year strong and starting 2017 with Citrix being better and stronger than ever. 
Thank you, and we look forward to your questions."

This is the second quarter, and 5% growth in license is truly remarkable. As I mentioned, this is driven by tremendous strengths in our product, which is simply never have such a strong technology, and the team has done remarkable job innovating on this. 7 [ph] of 9 [ph] release coming out at about Synergy conference in May was very strong, and it's driving tremendous adoption. And we just made it even stronger with 7.11 release and with a small tuck-in acquisition of More Scale. I think it's also fair to say that virtual clank computing, in many cases, is viewed as part of one of the core parts in cybersecurity efforts that everybody is driving. And we're seeing it from regulated industries. We're seeing it from the governments. We certainly see that trend driving the business forward. And I expect that only to continue and only to accelerate. And last but not least, we're in the midst of very significant refresh cycle in Microsoft environments, driven by Windows 10 adoption and recent introduction of Windows servers 2016. And I think also coupled with Office 365 and broad adoption and unique support that we have for Skype for Business, that will continue to be very significant growth catalyst. So very encouraged by what we saw in Q3 and certainly feel very enthusiastic and bullish about future prospects in this core part of our business."

Even the last presidential debate, we heard about cybersecurity. I think it's for the first time in history, and I think it's certainly served as a call to action to many. And it's just continuous escalation that we see from attackers being a few years ago to an organized crime, to now governments and cyber terrorists. This is certainly a major threat that everybody's feeling and everybody's experiencing. And people are truly starting to see virtual client computing, our core business, as one of the major defenses. And many people realize that essentially virtualizing their device may be one of the only ways they can truly secure the data and secure the device. So certainly, secular trend is helping. From the product perspective, we definitely continue to amp it up across the portfolio. With NetScaler capabilities that were released in June, with updates to the entire NetScaler portfolio and NetScaler gateway, serving as essentially conditional access with multi-factors indication that many customers are starting to deploy, with information rights management being introduced into ShareFile and with continuous improvement in our core business and apps and desktop certainly, from the product point of view, we continue to drive improvements. I would say last but not least, it sort of overall awareness that we've been driving in the marketplace. And I think as I shared with you when I first joined 9 months ago, even when I was doing my due diligence on Citrix a year ago, what I discovered was that there's a whole lot more to Citrix than the world knows about. And in the last 6 months, most importantly, starting with the Synergy in May, we have delivered the driven awareness to make sure that the world actually understands what we stand for and what we have to offer. And the world actually understands that improving cybersecurity defenses is the most significant outcome that our customer get from deploying Citrix solutions. So all combined, that's what we're seeing, and that's why we're amplifying this and that's why it's going to be on a go-forward basis."

And I was seeing adoption and I was seeing broad adoption in the enterprise and also that's what our friends at Microsoft is sharing with us. And is in the past, major Microsoft refresh cycles, Citrix gets the benefit. as I mentioned, some major clients are deploying Windows 10 through VDI mechanisms, and that's tremendously helpful. We're now in the sort of final phases to implement Windows 10 VDI on Azure, which is coming just next short few months, and that will serve as additional catalyst. But certainly, our partnership with Microsoft and overall rate of adoption of Windows 10 is strong and it's accelerating and really excited about it. On Windows Server 2016, this is the best server release ever that Microsoft had, and we're seeing good momentum. We expect strong adoption.

But just to talk about that a little bit more, everything that Kirill mentioned earlier in terms of the momentum around the Xen family business, that's just pure execution. And the other thing that we've talked about is that there is an ongoing subscription component of that, the Citrix Service Provider business that I mentioned, which is largely Xen family. That's up to about $75 million ARR, growing at 30%. So we're addressing both more and more incremental efficiencies at the higher end of the market and also programs like CSP, which are just that new, largely targeting SMB in some mid-market. So it's coming from a number of different factors. When if we feel like that momentum can continue. In terms of networking, there's really 3 big segments in that business as everyone knows. It's primarily around the secular trend towards cloud and e-commerce and SaaS providers. We're doing extremely well in that business, and we'll continue to expand the base. The attached motion, where today represents about 15% of the mix, that's been a function of what's been going on the last 5 years around Workspace Services. So as that business reaccelerates, we'll just have many more opportunities to go on attached. And then third, around the part that we just termed core Enterprise ADC. That's probably our single biggest capacity ad from a go-to-market standpoint in '17. We've been ramping back up the last quarter, and we'll finish that up in Q4 time frame. But by the end of next year, we'll probably have a 20% increase in networking capacity across the board. So while it's largely a second half story, it's an area that we believe that we can continue this trend of taking share each and every year. We just need to be involved in more places where our customers are. And so that's just a little contextual flavor around the business. But in terms of overall guidance, just to reiterate, this year, the core business is doing about 2.5%, 3% growth. Our prelim guidance for next year is to actually accelerate that to 3% to 4%, and we think we can do that at a higher-margin structure."

And of course, Windows 10, I think it's -- would be fair to say when you look at the worldwide deployment of Windows desktops, approximately, if you kind of trying to different analyst reports, approximately 10% of those deployments run virtualized. And obviously, those currently get to move to the new version of Windows, they typically go with the more recent and more advanced SKU of server of Citrix solutions. And at the same time, they usually expand their usage. And that's certainly something that we are starting to see, and we expect to see more of that as we go into 2017, which gives us increased confidence."

But sort of to give you our preliminary view where we see investment priorities. In GoTo market, it is not only increasing direct selling capacity that we have been driving through most of 2016, and we will continue in 2017, but it's also reinvigorating, in many cases, our partner channel and putting more energy in working with our partners. It served us well, and we'll now see early signals that it's working to add more breadth back into business and to expand in mid-market, and we expect to do more of that. On the sort of product portfolio, if there's one most significant major transformation that is happening at Citrix right now, it is cloud transformation. We started it earlier this year. We've declared that we're all in the cloud, and we're absolutely going to continue. And it is starting to serve us very well from awareness perspective, from the engagement perspective with our existing customers all want to run their entire infrastructures in the cloud at some point in the future. And for them to know that Citrix is going to be there with them serves as tremendous reassurance, and we're going to continue to give them more proof points of how strong we're going to be going there and how we're going to become a leader in this emerging discipline of Workspaces as a Service. And perhaps, sort of couple of traditional major trends that we're embracing and that you're going to start seeing us sort of be central to is Workspaces IoT. This is, overall Internet of Things, taking place at people's workplace. It's really a scenario where you can imagine everything around you in your office now has a certain amount of compute capacity and connected to the Internet. And what magical things can you do there? And Citrix, being essentially workspace transformation company for the last 27 years has amazing DNA to essentially take advantage of this secular technological trend and give people ability to help their people work better and work differently. And we're already engaged with some of our partners and systems integrated community, in particular, we're starting to see those scenarios, and we're very engaged with some of our large customers who are now sort of turning into early adopters of those workplace IoT approach. So really exciting things happening in the industry and with the Citrix being truly back on our sort of innovation edge, we're very excited about being participant in that."

In terms of hyperscale, they would fall within that segment that we talked about is cloud infrastructure and e-commerce. It's 40% of the mix last quarter. And then those what I would call hyperscale, it's only a handful, and that would represent part of that market. The trend continues. And I mean, the megatrend about just capacity buildout is -- has been great. So that business, whereas it used to be 1 or 2 quarters per year has been strong for 4, 5 quarters in a row now. That's one of the things that you see us lapsing really, really tough comps in Q3 and Q4 of last year. Expect that to continue. We always have pretty good visibility on a full year basis. The quarter-to-quarter is somewhat subject to just the needs and capacity buildout of the hyperscale. As we go into next year, as I mentioned a minute ago, I mean, part of the strategy is expanding that category so that you're touching what I'd call Tier 2 clouds as well as broader e-commerce providers and others as well as the capacity investment and attach motion for the other segments. So that's what's going on in overall networking. As far as VPX, I mean, remind everybody that the most important element of NetScaler is the fact that it's a software product. It's deployed across a number of form factors, everything from fully virtualized data center appliances, all the way down to virtual appliances and even in the form factor of a container. And we get a lot of leverage by being able to utilize one code base across all those different use case scenarios. So VPX, on a license count, was probably the fastest growing in Q3, and that's just a function of broad distribution. You can use that in the cloud. You can use that in your own data center. You can do use this as part of networking fabric, if you will. And it's just having that base for us is what one of the things that we leverage from differentiation point of view."

The feedback was very positive, and you may have seen some of them written about it. I think the second is, we've continuously driven innovation in this area across NetScaler, Xen family and ShareFile, addressing increasing needs of cybersecurity defenses in our existing customers and future customers. And of course, we continue to look to improve it and to do even more in the area of cybersecurity for our customers, both organically and inorganically as well."

We continue to show great results and overall execution from the operational initiatives that have been driving profitability, to the strength in product portfolio that's driving top line growth.",1385,"Thanks, Eduardo, and welcome to everyone joining us today. We continue to show great results and overall execution from the operational initiatives that have been driving profitability, to the strength in product portfolio that's driving top line growth. We're focusing all of our energy on the core strategy of securely delivering apps and data, really setting the company up for sustainable profitable growth as we look forward. 
As you can see from the release, total revenue was up 3% year-on-year in Q3. Adjusted operating margin expanded to over 30%. Adjusted EPS was $1.32 per share, up 27% year-on-year, and we generated nearly $290 million in cash flow from ops. In total, we closed 49 $1 million-plus transactions, with particular strength in cloud, health care, technology and government verticals. There was also good balance across the portfolio, with more than half of these deals coming from Workspace Services, with the balance coming from networking. 
From a geographic perspective, when you exclude the GoTo businesses, revenue from the Americas was up 8%. APJ was flat, and the EMEA market declined about 4%. This performance is pretty consistent with the first half of the year. The Americas geo continues to drive significant growth across all product categories, while the other regions are seeing improving execution in many of our primary markets. 
Related to this, in Q3, we announced a leadership change in the APJ region and pending change in the U.K. And these things will help accelerate field restructuring into 2017. 
Next, I want to talk about Q3 results within our 3 primary businesses. Within Workspace Service business, which includes virtualization mobility, grew 5% total to $414 million, including a 5% year-on-year increase in product license revenue. This growth rate has been really moving up over the last 6 quarters and is a direct result of the focused strategy we adopted last year. As we've discussed a few times, there's a number of very specific initiatives that we're driving to accelerate growth in this area through much faster innovation, more verticalized solutions, integration of our unique assets across the portfolio and the reinvigoration of our channel partnerships. 
Just a couple of other dynamics that are worth noting. That includes the license revenue in the Americas geo, with across all of Workspace Services has accelerated last quarter. In Q3, this was up 18% year-on-year, and this is after already posting 16% license growth through the first half of the year. Much of this has been coming from mid-, large enterprise customers, often in verticals where security and compliance are major concerns. 
Additionally, we continue to grow our cloud service provider subscriptions, where partners are primarily utilizing XenApp to deliver cloud-based offerings to their customers. Overall, the Citrix Service Provider revenue grew about 30% to now have an ARR of over $75 million. 
Next, looking at Delivery Networking. Total revenue increased 1% in the quarter to $191 million. The largest part of this overall business, NetScaler ADC, posted license revenue growth of 5% against the strong Q3 a year ago. But impacting the results in the rest of the BU were the comps from the ByteMobile and cloud platform products that are part of the restructuring at the start of this year. 
Staying on NetScaler for a minute. I'll remind everybody that the business is essentially made up of 3 segments: cloud infrastructure and e-commerce; Citrix solution sales; and enterprise ADC. So within the quarter, demand from cloud and e-commerce continued to be really strong, consistent with what we've seen over the last 5 quarters. This segment, which is made up of roughly 200 different customers in the quarter, contributed about 40% of NetScaler product sales. The solution-attached segment represented 15% of the mix, with a number of app and mobile opportunities that included networking as part of an overall Citrix solution was up modestly from a year ago. And then enterprise ADC was the remaining 45% of the mix. All in, we sold over 1,600 networking customers during the period, with 1/3 of those being net new to Citrix. 
And finally, our SaaS-delivered revenue was up 9% to $207 million in the quarter. The contribution from the GoTo business was $173 million. And as far as the merger between GoTo and LogMeIn, we received U.S. antitrust approval in September and continue to expect this to close in the Q1 2017 time frame. 
When you look at just the cloud-based services that are part of core Citrix, we delivered $35 million in total revenue, growing 28% in the quarter. The bulk of this is coming from ShareFile, our secure data platform, with the other new offerings addressing workspaces and service needs for our customers. So clearly, we continue to see a shift in the way products are being consumed by customers, evolving slowly towards a more ratable model. So when you include revenue that is being generated from the Citrix Service Provider program, plus our own cloud-based services and the annual term license, the aggregate ARR is now over $225 million, growing very rapidly. 
So turning to operations. We've driven a lot of efficiencies in the company over the past 6 quarters and continue to do so in Q3. The actions across the business were designed to generate permanent expense reductions while reallocating investments to those areas that will drive profitable growth in the future. In Q3, adjusted operating margin was over 30%. This is up more than 400 basis points from last year. We're clearly operating well ahead of our stated goal of reaching 30% full year margins in 2017. 
The focus on leverage has also helped increase our cash flow profile for the company. Q3 cash flow from operations was a record $288 million. And over the trailing 12 months, we've generated a total of $1.14 billion in cash from ops, and this is up 21%. 
As you start to model fiscal 2017, I want to point out that historically, about 80% to 90% of cash flow from operations can be attributed to core Citrix business, with the remainder coming from GoTo. Exiting Q3, we had nearly $2.5 billion in cash and investments on the balance sheet, which is up sharply from last quarter. Over the last several years, our stated target has been to utilize half of free cash flow for capital return, a level which, frankly, we've regularly exceeded. As you know, this program has been on hold due to the pending separation of the GoTo business. So once that's completed, we intend to restart our programmatic capital return, and we'll talk definitively about those plans once the transaction is closed. 
Before I wrap up, let me talk about our current outlook and expectations for the remainder of the year. Our growth strategy and operational programs are clearly working. We're happy with the results, and we're confident in our plans for the balance of the year and looking into 2017. At the same time, we're going to continue our conservative outlook, given the pending GoTo merger with LogMeIn and the significant revenue upside we posted in Q4 of last year. That said, we're increasing our assumptions for Q4 and the full year. So for 2016, we now expect consolidated revenue between $3.4 billion and $3.41 billion and adjusted EPS of $5.18 to $5.20 this year. This represents revenue for core Citrix to be in the range of $2.71 billion to $2.72 billion or roughly 3.5 -- or excuse me, 2.5% to 3% growth, when you exclude the GoTo business. 
With respect to 2017, we're just finishing up our planning cycle, which is very normal for this point in Q4. At this stage, we still expect the GoTo merger to be completed in Q1 '17, so we're completely focused on the ongoing business at core Citrix. We're feeling good about the continued improvement in results, in the new product cycles and the early returns from Citrix cloud. We're also making the GoTo market capacity investments that should drive additional growth next year, particularly in the second half of 2017. Therefore, we're currently modeling 2017 full year revenue growth of 3% to 4% for core Citrix and adjusted operating margins of 32% to 33%. 
So now I'd like to turn it over to Kirill to give further color on the quarter and our focus areas looking forward. Kirill?"

I'm obviously very pleased with our results, clearly demonstrating how our renewed focus is resonating in the marketplace. We're seeing growth in all of our core areas of business, most importantly in our Workspace Services business, showing growth for the second consecutive quarter. 
Our efforts in accelerating product innovation and improving operational processes are working. And the progress on cultural transformation that defines us in the company will continue to power us forward. We're seeing improved stability in our workforce and incredibly strong employee engagement as evidenced by very strong results and participation in our recent global employee survey. 
Specific to our field organization, through these improvements, we now have approximately 100 more quota-carrying reps since our restructuring about a year ago. Our America sales team continues to fire on all cylinders with consistently strong execution quarter after quarter. And with the leadership changes we have implemented in APJ and more change upcoming in EMEA, we see great opportunity to replicate what's working so strongly in the Americas. 
Our vision is clear. Our strategy is crisp, and our execution has improved dramatically. We now have had 5 straight quarters of continuous operating improvement. 
A few additional comments on our solution areas. There's a big story this quarter, of course, Workspace Services or our Xen family. It's exciting to see this core part of our business delivering 5% year-over-year increase in license revenue. I'm encouraged by sales energy and tremendous product innovation in this area. After 2 quarters of solid growth, this is clearly not a fluke or just a blip on the radar. This is an exciting change deliberately driven by the strongest, highly differentiated products and much-improved competitive edge. 
Additionally, in September, we delivered XenApps and Desktop 7.11, a major release featuring day 1 support for Windows Server 2016, management innovations and user experience enhancements. We also acquired NorthScale, greatly complementary technology that adds extra capabilities in the user environment management and adds very smart workspace performance optimization techniques, unmatched in the industry. 
We saw more than 650 competitive wins in virtual client computing this quarter, and our win rate has been consistently improving. Specifically, one of the nation's largest grocery retail and supply chain services companies chose XenDesktop for VDI delivery to support their retail corporations, thanks to our partnership with Microsoft. 
And another major win against the top competitor in the space, one of the world's largest insurance providers chose to leverage XenDesktop to enable the efficient upgrade to Windows 10 on more than 20,000 desktops, also driven by our unique support for Skype for Business. 
We continue to see more customers choosing our entire portfolio due to stronger-than-ever product integration. For example, in a dual competitive win, a top clinical teaching hospital in the Netherlands is rethinking their Workspace Services end-to-end, chose Citrix Workspace Suite against both the virtualization competitor and the networking competitor, so they can implement a full coherent solution for hospital workplace innovation. 
Moving on to network delivery business. As David mentioned, we saw good growth in the core ADC area, with a 5% year-over-year increase from the already strong Q3 in 2015. On the product innovation front, we released a major update to NetScaler SD-WAN. We continue to be very encouraged by growth in that area. This update featured more advanced routing, simple deployment and unrivaled security capabilities. We also released NetScaler support for the fifth standard, a testament to our commitment to security in the U.S. federal government. And we released NetScaler CPX, a free developer version of NetScaler in a container, that allows for rapid deployment methodologies such as DevOps. It's a clear indicator of our team's focus on new technologies and increased innovation. 
We saw more than 500 competitive wins in the network delivery space globally, including a major African mobile communications company, a major international electronics company and a global technology company. All of which are using NetScaler to ensure high network availability, resilience and security in their services. 
On to data delivery. As with previous quarters, ShareFile continued to prove itself as a growing force in the Enterprise file, sync and share market, growing 25% year-over-year. We continue to drive rapid product innovation and expand ShareFile functionality in target industries, adding more workflows and cloud connectors. We're starting to see increased traction of ShareFile outside of the United States, where it's still the strongest, and in the larger Enterprise segment. Specifically, Daimler AG, one of the largest and well-known producers of premium cars and manufacturers of commercial vehicles, chose Citrix ShareFile to improve large file exchange across their organization, and it will help them reduce storage costs and support business departments when dealing with big amounts of data. 
On to the industry trends. Cybersecurity, bring-your-own-device phenomenon, cloud adoption and Microsoft refresh cycle all served as catalysts to our business in Q3. We saw a strong demand for our solutions to support organizations' initiatives to secure their data, applications and networks. This is particularly evident in highly regulated industries, including financial services and health care, which had more than a dozen large deals this quarter, as David mentioned. 
We also had several defense ministries and government agencies around the world choosing Citrix to address security concerns, the cybersecurity being the #1 concern for enterprises of all sizes and governments around the world. It is becoming increasingly evident that Citrix solutions are indeed one of the strongest defenses against potential endpoint device and perimeter attacks. 
Moving on to our progress in the cloud. This was a tremendous quarter in our cloud transformation. While it's still in early progress, the momentum is building, with wins coming from businesses of all sizes. Highlighting just a few examples. Hilti, a well-known provider of worldwide leading-edge technology for international construction professionals, has partnered with us to drive their cloud transformation and enable a bring-your-own-device policy for employees through Citrix cloud. Columbia University and another major Ivy League school both chose Citrix cloud to assist in their transition and reduce infrastructure costs and IT support needs. Citrix cloud overall is really starting to shine. 
A couple of remarks on our partnerships. This quarter, we saw a major step forward in our stronger-than-ever relationship with Microsoft. As you may recall, earlier this year, we had announced an elevated and more strategic partnership with Microsoft and now I'm happy to report that it's starting to bear fruit. We're seeing good alignment of our teams in the field, bringing those joint wins I previously mentioned. 
Also in August, Microsoft announced that they were transitioning out of Azure RemoteApp, and Citrix XenApp was designated as the destination for Azure RemoteApp customers. We're creating a clear migration path for Azure RemoteApp customers that want to use all of XenApp's capabilities. This announcement served as a continued vote of confidence that Citrix is clearly the right partner for future success to deliver more workloads on Azure and more adoption of Windows 10 and Office 365. 
As to our broader partner channel, the momentum is continuing to grow. And while we have nearly 50 $1 million-plus deals in Q3, the ShareFile sales coming from the mid-market is increasing, a clear signal that our strategy to expand in the mid-market is working and that our partner channel is more vibrant than ever. 
Just last week, we hosted our top partners in the Americas who gave us tremendous feedback on our mutual progress. 
And last but certainly not least, last month, we held our Annual Industry Analyst event, where we had the opportunity to share our vision, strategy and core messaging. The feedback was remarkable. I previously shared the confidence I heard from our customers and partners, and now hearing such positive reinforcement in our direction and focus from industry analysts was truly encouraging. Our strategy and overall positioning was very well-received, proving to me that we're on the right path. 
As I mentioned, with highly differentiated products, we have stepped up our competitive edge, and it is paying off. We're taking share in all our core areas of business. Overall, I feel very enthusiastic about the business and look forward to closing out the year strong and starting 2017 with Citrix being better and stronger than ever. 
Thank you, and we look forward to your questions."

This is the second quarter, and 5% growth in license is truly remarkable. As I mentioned, it is driven by tremendous strength in our product. We've just simply never had such a strong technology, and the team has done a remarkable job innovating on this. 7.9 release coming out, and about the Synergy conference in May, it was very strong and it's driving tremendous adoption. And we just made it even stronger with 7.11 release and with a small tuck-in acquisition of NorthScale. I think it's also fair to say that virtual client computing, in many cases, is viewed as sort of one of the core parts in cybersecurity efforts that everybody is driving. And we're seeing it from regulated industries. We're seeing it from the governments. We certainly see that trend driving the business forward. And I expect that only to continue and only to accelerate. And last but not least, we're in the midst of a very significant refresh cycle in Microsoft environments, driven by Windows 10 adoption and the recent introduction of Windows Server 2016. And I think also coupled with Office 365 and the broad adoption and unique support that we have for Skype for Business, that will continue to be a very significant growth catalyst.

Even the last presidential debate, we heard about cybersecurity. I think it's for the first time in history, and I think it's certainly served as a call to action to many. And it's just a continuous escalation that we see, from attackers being hobbyists a few years ago, to organized crime, to now real governments and cyber terrorists. This is certainly a major threat that everybody's feeling and everybody's experiencing. And people are truly starting to see virtual client computing, our core business, as one of the major defenses. And many people realize that essentially virtualizing their device may be one of the only ways they can truly secure the data and secure the device. So certainly, secular trend is helping. From the product perspective, we definitely continue to amp it up across the portfolio. With NetScaler capabilities that were released in June, with updates to the entire NetScaler portfolio and NetScaler gateway serving as essentially conditional access, with multi-factor authentication that many customers are starting to deploy, with information rights management being introduced into ShareFile and with continuous improvement in our core business, XenApps and Desktop, certainly, from the product point of view, we have continued to drive improvement. But I would say, last but not least, it's the sort of overall awareness that we've been driving in the marketplace. And I think as I shared with you when I first joined 9 months ago, even when I was doing my due diligence on Citrix a year ago, what I discovered was that there's a whole lot more to Citrix than the world knows about. And in the last 6 months, most importantly starting with Synergy in May, we have delivered the driven awareness to make sure that the world actually understands what we stand for and what we have to offer. And the world actually understands that improving cybersecurity defenses is the most significant outcome that our customer gets from deploying Citrix solutions. So all combined, that's what we're seeing and that's why we're amplifying this, and that's why it's going to be so important on a go-forward basis."

But certainly, our partnership with Microsoft and overall rate of adoption of Windows 10 is strong and it's accelerating, and we're really excited about it. On Windows Server 2016, this is the best server release ever that Microsoft had. And we're seeing good momentum. We expect strong adoption. I think if you read analyst reports about Windows Server adoption, sort of, obviously, in addition to all the rapid move to the cloud and to Azure, today, the majority of Windows Servers run Windows Server 2008, so their major refresh cycle is coming. And we believe that Windows Server 2016 will be right there and we'll be right there with it since we have supported it from day 1 when it was released."

We're in the final phases of addressing a couple of open positions in Northern Europe in particular. And we look forward to reporting on sort of upcoming leadership changes in that area and particularly strong results. I would say that just like in many other companies we all profiled, there are obvious microeconomic factors that, I believe, impacted our performance in that region. I did have an opportunity to spend time in the EMEA region past summer and had a chance to get introduced to the team and see where we're making strong progress. The service reassurance, that's in Central and Eastern Europe, and in Germany, we have a strong leadership team and we have great execution. And we know precisely what needs to do. We have the model that's working very well in the Americas. We're going to replicate it in EMEA. And I think it's -- it represents good upside in my view."

We've got an ongoing focus on efficiencies and just getting better at everything we do. And that will translate into 2 ways. One is the margin you see; and then two is our ability to reinvest a lot of the savings, if you will, back into things that will drive growth. I'd say that the team is much more focused on driving growth into the future that margins because we're building that muscle just kind of in the ongoing operations of the company. As you mentioned, we're up a better part of 800 basis points over 2 years. There's still a number of specific projects in flight, those that have a longer tail, whether it's real-estate-related or procurement or those types of things that will continue to generate permanent savings. And as you saw on our prelim guidance for '17, we do think that there's a lot more opportunity to run the business at even more efficient levels than we are today. We're going to keep driving those. But I also think that you'll hear us talk much more about growth going forward because we're building a business around profitable growth, and that's the focus of the execution."

But just to talk about that a little bit more, everything that Kirill mentioned earlier in terms of the momentum around the Xen family business, that's just pure execution. And the other thing that we've talked about is that there is an ongoing subscription component of that, the Citrix Service Provider business that I mentioned, which is largely Xen family. That's up to about $75 million ARR, growing at 30%. So we're addressing both more and more incremental efficiencies at the higher end of the market and also programs like CSP, which are just net new, largely targeting SMB in some mid-market. So it's coming from a number of different factors, and we feel like that momentum can continue. In terms of networking, there's really 3 big segments of that business as everyone knows. It's primarily around the secular trend towards cloud and e-commerce and SaaS providers. We're doing extremely well in that business, and we'll continue to expand the base. The attached motion, where today represents about 15% of the mix, that's been a function of what's been going on in the last 5 years around Workspace Services. So as that business reaccelerates, we'll just have many more opportunities to go on attach. And then third, around the part that we just termed core enterprise ADC, that's probably our single biggest capacity add from a go-to-market standpoint in '17. We've been ramping that up really last quarter, and we'll finish that up in Q4 time frame. But by the end of next year, we'll probably have a 20% increase in networking capacity across the board. So while it's largely a second half story, it's an area that we believe that we can continue this trend of taking share each and every year. We just need to be involved in more places where our customers are. And so that's just a little contextual flavor around the business. But in terms of overall guidance, just to reiterate, this year, the core business is doing about 2.5%, 3% growth. Our prelim guidance for next year is to actually accelerate that to 3% to 4%, and we think we can do that at a higher-margin structure."

But sort of to give you our preliminary view where we see investment priorities. In GoTo market, it is not only increasing direct selling capacity that we have been driving through most of 2016 and we will continue in 2017, but it's also reinvigorating, in many cases, our partner channel and putting more energy in working with our partners. It served us well, and we now see early signals that it's working to add more breadth back into business and to expand in the mid-market, and we expect to do more of that. On the sort of product portfolio, if there's one most significant major transformation that is happening at Citrix right now, it is cloud transformation. We started it earlier this year. We've declared that we're all in on the cloud, and we're absolutely going to continue. And it is starting to serve us very well from an awareness perspective, from the engagement perspective with even our existing customers, who all want to run their entire infrastructures in the cloud at some point in the future. And for them to know that Citrix is going to be there with them serves as tremendous reassurance, and we're going to continue to give them more proof points of how strong we're going to be growing there and how we're going to become a leader in this emerging discipline of Workspace-as-a-Service. And perhaps, sort of on a couple of additional major trends that we're embracing and that you're going to start seeing us sort of be central to is Workspaces IoT. This is overall Internet of Things taking place at people's workplace. It's really a scenario where you can imagine everything around you in your office now has a certain amount of compute capacity and connected to the Internet and what magical things can you do there. Now in Citrix, being essentially a workspace transformation company for the last 27 years, has amazing DNA to essentially take advantage of this secular technological trend and give people the ability to help their people work better and work differently. And we're already engaged with some of our partners, in the systems integrated community in particular, who are starting to see those scenarios, and we're very engaged with some of our larger customers, who are now sort of turning into early adopters of those workplace IoT approaches. So really exciting things happening in the industry, and with Citrix being truly back on our sort of innovation edge, we're very excited about being a participant in that."

In terms of hyperscale, they would fall within that segment that we talk about as cloud infrastructure and e-commerce. It's 40% of the mix last quarter. And then those what I would call hyperscale, it's only a handful and that would represent part of that market. The trend continues, and I mean, the megatrend around just capacity buildout is -- has been great. So that business, whereas it used to be 1 or 2 quarters per year, has been strong for 4 or 5 quarters in a row now. And that's one of the things that you see us lapsing really, really tough comps in Q3 and Q4 of last year. Expect that to continue. We always have pretty good visibility on a full year basis. The quarter-to-quarter is somewhat subject to just the needs and capacity buildout of the hyperscale. As we go into next year, as I mentioned a minute ago, I mean, part of the strategy is expanding that category so that you're touching, what I'd call, Tier 2 clouds as well as broader e-commerce providers and others as well as the capacity investments and attach motion for the other segments. So that's what's going on in overall -- on networking. As far as VPX, I mean, remind everybody that the most important element of NetScaler is the fact that it's a software product. It's deployed across a number of form factors, everything from fully virtualized data center appliances, all the way down through virtual appliances and even in the form factor of a container. And we get a lot of leverage by being able to utilize one code base across all those different use case scenarios. So VPX on a license count was probably the fastest growing in Q3, and that's just a function of broad distribution. You can use that in the cloud. You can use that in your own data center. You can use it as part of a networking fabric, if you will. And it's just having that base for us is what -- one of the things that we leverage from a differentiation point of view."

We continue to show great results and overall execution from the operational initiatives that have been driving profitability, to the strength in product portfolio that's driving top line growth.",1385,"Thanks, Eduardo, and welcome to everyone joining us today. We continue to show great results and overall execution from the operational initiatives that have been driving profitability, to the strength in product portfolio that's driving top line growth. We're focusing all of our energy on the core strategy of securely delivering apps and data, really setting the company up for sustainable profitable growth as we look forward. 
As you can see from the release, total revenue was up 3% year-on-year in Q3. Adjusted operating margin expanded to over 30%. Adjusted EPS was $1.32 per share, up 27% year-on-year, and we generated nearly $290 million in cash flow from ops. In total, we closed 49 $1 million-plus transactions, with particular strength in cloud, health care, technology and government verticals. There was also good balance across the portfolio, with more than half of these deals coming from Workspace Services, with the balance coming from networking. 
From a geographic perspective, when you exclude the GoTo businesses, revenue from the Americas was up 8%. APJ was flat, and the EMEA market declined about 4%. This performance is pretty consistent with the first half of the year. The Americas geo continues to drive significant growth across all product categories, while the other regions are seeing improving execution in many of our primary markets. 
Related to this, in Q3, we announced a leadership change in the APJ region and pending change in the U.K. And these things will help accelerate field restructuring into 2017. 
Next, I want to talk about Q3 results within our 3 primary businesses. Within Workspace Service business, which includes virtualization mobility, grew 5% total to $414 million, including a 5% year-on-year increase in product license revenue. This growth rate has been really moving up over the last 6 quarters and is a direct result of the focused strategy we adopted last year. As we've discussed a few times, there's a number of very specific initiatives that we're driving to accelerate growth in this area through much faster innovation, more verticalized solutions, integration of our unique assets across the portfolio and the reinvigoration of our channel partnerships. 
Just a couple of other dynamics that are worth noting. That includes the license revenue in the Americas geo, with across all of Workspace Services has accelerated last quarter. In Q3, this was up 18% year-on-year, and this is after already posting 16% license growth through the first half of the year. Much of this has been coming from mid-, large enterprise customers, often in verticals where security and compliance are major concerns. 
Additionally, we continue to grow our cloud service provider subscriptions, where partners are primarily utilizing XenApp to deliver cloud-based offerings to their customers. Overall, the Citrix Service Provider revenue grew about 30% to now have an ARR of over $75 million. 
Next, looking at Delivery Networking. Total revenue increased 1% in the quarter to $191 million. The largest part of this overall business, NetScaler ADC, posted license revenue growth of 5% against the strong Q3 a year ago. But impacting the results in the rest of the BU were the comps from the ByteMobile and cloud platform products that are part of the restructuring at the start of this year. 
Staying on NetScaler for a minute. I'll remind everybody that the business is essentially made up of 3 segments: cloud infrastructure and e-commerce; Citrix solution sales; and enterprise ADC. So within the quarter, demand from cloud and e-commerce continued to be really strong, consistent with what we've seen over the last 5 quarters. This segment, which is made up of roughly 200 different customers in the quarter, contributed about 40% of NetScaler product sales. The solution-attached segment represented 15% of the mix, with a number of app and mobile opportunities that included networking as part of an overall Citrix solution was up modestly from a year ago. And then enterprise ADC was the remaining 45% of the mix. All in, we sold over 1,600 networking customers during the period, with 1/3 of those being net new to Citrix. 
And finally, our SaaS-delivered revenue was up 9% to $207 million in the quarter. The contribution from the GoTo business was $173 million. And as far as the merger between GoTo and LogMeIn, we received U.S. antitrust approval in September and continue to expect this to close in the Q1 2017 time frame. 
When you look at just the cloud-based services that are part of core Citrix, we delivered $35 million in total revenue, growing 28% in the quarter. The bulk of this is coming from ShareFile, our secure data platform, with the other new offerings addressing workspaces and service needs for our customers. So clearly, we continue to see a shift in the way products are being consumed by customers, evolving slowly towards a more ratable model. So when you include revenue that is being generated from the Citrix Service Provider program, plus our own cloud-based services and the annual term license, the aggregate ARR is now over $225 million, growing very rapidly. 
So turning to operations. We've driven a lot of efficiencies in the company over the past 6 quarters and continue to do so in Q3. The actions across the business were designed to generate permanent expense reductions while reallocating investments to those areas that will drive profitable growth in the future. In Q3, adjusted operating margin was over 30%. This is up more than 400 basis points from last year. We're clearly operating well ahead of our stated goal of reaching 30% full year margins in 2017. 
The focus on leverage has also helped increase our cash flow profile for the company. Q3 cash flow from operations was a record $288 million. And over the trailing 12 months, we've generated a total of $1.14 billion in cash from ops, and this is up 21%. 
As you start to model fiscal 2017, I want to point out that historically, about 80% to 90% of cash flow from operations can be attributed to core Citrix business, with the remainder coming from GoTo. Exiting Q3, we had nearly $2.5 billion in cash and investments on the balance sheet, which is up sharply from last quarter. Over the last several years, our stated target has been to utilize half of free cash flow for capital return, a level which, frankly, we've regularly exceeded. As you know, this program has been on hold due to the pending separation of the GoTo business. So once that's completed, we intend to restart our programmatic capital return, and we'll talk definitively about those plans once the transaction is closed. 
Before I wrap up, let me talk about our current outlook and expectations for the remainder of the year. Our growth strategy and operational programs are clearly working. We're happy with the results, and we're confident in our plans for the balance of the year and looking into 2017. At the same time, we're going to continue our conservative outlook, given the pending GoTo merger with LogMeIn and the significant revenue upside we posted in Q4 of last year. That said, we're increasing our assumptions for Q4 and the full year. So for 2016, we now expect consolidated revenue between $3.4 billion and $3.41 billion and adjusted EPS of $5.18 to $5.20 this year. This represents revenue for core Citrix to be in the range of $2.71 billion to $2.72 billion or roughly 3.5 -- or excuse me, 2.5% to 3% growth, when you exclude the GoTo business. 
With respect to 2017, we're just finishing up our planning cycle, which is very normal for this point in Q4. At this stage, we still expect the GoTo merger to be completed in Q1 '17, so we're completely focused on the ongoing business at core Citrix. We're feeling good about the continued improvement in results, in the new product cycles and the early returns from Citrix cloud. We're also making the GoTo market capacity investments that should drive additional growth next year, particularly in the second half of 2017. Therefore, we're currently modeling 2017 full year revenue growth of 3% to 4% for core Citrix and adjusted operating margins of 32% to 33%. 
So now I'd like to turn it over to Kirill to give further color on the quarter and our focus areas looking forward. Kirill?"

I'm obviously very pleased with our results, clearly demonstrating how our renewed focus is resonating in the marketplace. We're seeing growth in all of our core areas of business, most importantly in our Workspace Services business, showing growth for the second consecutive quarter. 
Our efforts in accelerating product innovation and improving operational processes are working. And the progress on cultural transformation that defines us in the company will continue to power us forward. We're seeing improved stability in our workforce and incredibly strong employee engagement as evidenced by very strong results and participation in our recent global employee survey. 
Specific to our field organization, through these improvements, we now have approximately 100 more quota-carrying reps since our restructuring about a year ago. Our America sales team continues to fire on all cylinders with consistently strong execution quarter after quarter. And with the leadership changes we have implemented in APJ and more change upcoming in EMEA, we see great opportunity to replicate what's working so strongly in the Americas. 
Our vision is clear. Our strategy is crisp, and our execution has improved dramatically. We now have had 5 straight quarters of continuous operating improvement. 
A few additional comments on our solution areas. There's a big story this quarter, of course, Workspace Services or our Xen family. It's exciting to see this core part of our business delivering 5% year-over-year increase in license revenue. I'm encouraged by sales energy and tremendous product innovation in this area. After 2 quarters of solid growth, this is clearly not a fluke or just a blip on the radar. This is an exciting change deliberately driven by the strongest, highly differentiated products and much-improved competitive edge. 
Additionally, in September, we delivered XenApps and Desktop 7.11, a major release featuring day 1 support for Windows Server 2016, management innovations and user experience enhancements. We also acquired NorthScale, greatly complementary technology that adds extra capabilities in the user environment management and adds very smart workspace performance optimization techniques, unmatched in the industry. 
We saw more than 650 competitive wins in virtual client computing this quarter, and our win rate has been consistently improving. Specifically, one of the nation's largest grocery retail and supply chain services companies chose XenDesktop for VDI delivery to support their retail corporations, thanks to our partnership with Microsoft. 
And another major win against the top competitor in the space, one of the world's largest insurance providers chose to leverage XenDesktop to enable the efficient upgrade to Windows 10 on more than 20,000 desktops, also driven by our unique support for Skype for Business. 
We continue to see more customers choosing our entire portfolio due to stronger-than-ever product integration. For example, in a dual competitive win, a top clinical teaching hospital in the Netherlands is rethinking their Workspace Services end-to-end, chose Citrix Workspace Suite against both the virtualization competitor and the networking competitor, so they can implement a full coherent solution for hospital workplace innovation. 
Moving on to network delivery business. As David mentioned, we saw good growth in the core ADC area, with a 5% year-over-year increase from the already strong Q3 in 2015. On the product innovation front, we released a major update to NetScaler SD-WAN. We continue to be very encouraged by growth in that area. This update featured more advanced routing, simple deployment and unrivaled security capabilities. We also released NetScaler support for the fifth standard, a testament to our commitment to security in the U.S. federal government. And we released NetScaler CPX, a free developer version of NetScaler in a container, that allows for rapid deployment methodologies such as DevOps. It's a clear indicator of our team's focus on new technologies and increased innovation. 
We saw more than 500 competitive wins in the network delivery space globally, including a major African mobile communications company, a major international electronics company and a global technology company. All of which are using NetScaler to ensure high network availability, resilience and security in their services. 
On to data delivery. As with previous quarters, ShareFile continued to prove itself as a growing force in the Enterprise file, sync and share market, growing 25% year-over-year. We continue to drive rapid product innovation and expand ShareFile functionality in target industries, adding more workflows and cloud connectors. We're starting to see increased traction of ShareFile outside of the United States, where it's still the strongest, and in the larger Enterprise segment. Specifically, Daimler AG, one of the largest and well-known producers of premium cars and manufacturers of commercial vehicles, chose Citrix ShareFile to improve large file exchange across their organization, and it will help them reduce storage costs and support business departments when dealing with big amounts of data. 
On to the industry trends. Cybersecurity, bring-your-own-device phenomenon, cloud adoption and Microsoft refresh cycle all served as catalysts to our business in Q3. We saw a strong demand for our solutions to support organizations' initiatives to secure their data, applications and networks. This is particularly evident in highly regulated industries, including financial services and health care, which had more than a dozen large deals this quarter, as David mentioned. 
We also had several defense ministries and government agencies around the world choosing Citrix to address security concerns, the cybersecurity being the #1 concern for enterprises of all sizes and governments around the world. It is becoming increasingly evident that Citrix solutions are indeed one of the strongest defenses against potential endpoint device and perimeter attacks. 
Moving on to our progress in the cloud. This was a tremendous quarter in our cloud transformation. While it's still in early progress, the momentum is building, with wins coming from businesses of all sizes. Highlighting just a few examples. Hilti, a well-known provider of worldwide leading-edge technology for international construction professionals, has partnered with us to drive their cloud transformation and enable a bring-your-own-device policy for employees through Citrix cloud. Columbia University and another major Ivy League school both chose Citrix cloud to assist in their transition and reduce infrastructure costs and IT support needs. Citrix cloud overall is really starting to shine. 
A couple of remarks on our partnerships. This quarter, we saw a major step forward in our stronger-than-ever relationship with Microsoft. As you may recall, earlier this year, we had announced an elevated and more strategic partnership with Microsoft and now I'm happy to report that it's starting to bear fruit. We're seeing good alignment of our teams in the field, bringing those joint wins I previously mentioned. 
Also in August, Microsoft announced that they would transitioning out of Azure RemoteApp, and Citrix XenApp was designated as the destination for Azure RemoteApp customers. We're creating a clear migration path for Azure RemoteApp customers that want to use all of XenApp's capabilities. This announcement served as a continued vote of confidence that Citrix is clearly the right partner for future success to deliver more workloads on Azure and more adoption of Windows 10 and Office 365. 
As to our broader partner channel, the momentum is continuing to grow. And while we have nearly 50 $1 million-plus deals in Q3, the ShareFile sales coming from the mid-market is increasing, a clear signal that our strategy to expand in the mid-market is working and that our partner channel is more vibrant than ever. 
Just last week, we hosted our top partners in the Americas who gave us tremendous feedback on our mutual progress. 
And last but certainly not least, last month, we held our Annual Industry Analyst event, where we had the opportunity to share our vision, strategy and core messaging. The feedback was remarkable. I previously shared the confidence I heard from our customers and partners, and now hearing such positive reinforcement in our direction and focus from industry analysts was truly encouraging. Our strategy and overall positioning was very well-received, proving to me that we're on the right path. 
As I mentioned, with highly differentiated products, we have stepped up our competitive edge, and it is paying off. We're taking share in all our core areas of business. Overall, I feel very enthusiastic about the business and look forward to closing out the year strong and starting 2017 with Citrix being better and stronger than ever. 
Thank you, and we look forward to your questions."

This is the second quarter, and 5% growth in license is truly remarkable. As I mentioned, it is driven by tremendous strength in our product. We've just simply never had such a strong technology, and the team has done a remarkable job innovating on this. 7.9 release coming out, at about the Synergy conference in May, it was very strong and it's driving tremendous adoption. And we just made it even stronger with 7.11 release and with a small tuck-in acquisition of NorthScale. I think it's also fair to say that virtual client computing, in many cases, is viewed as sort of one of the core parts in cybersecurity efforts that everybody is driving. And we're seeing it from regulated industries. We're seeing it from the governments. We certainly see that trend driving the business forward. And I expect that only to continue and only to accelerate. And last but not least, we're in the midst of a very significant refresh cycle in Microsoft environments, driven by Windows 10 adoption and the recent introduction of Windows Server 2016. And I think also coupled with Office 365 and the broad adoption and unique support that we have for Skype for Business, that will continue to be a very significant growth catalyst. So very encouraged by what we saw in Q3 and certainly feel very enthusiastic and bullish about future prospects in this core part of our business."

Even in the last presidential debate, we heard about cybersecurity. I think it's for the first time in history, and I think it's certainly served as a call to action to many. And it's just a continuous escalation that we see, from attackers being hobbyists a few years ago, to organized crime, to now rouge governments and cyber terrorists. This is certainly a major threat that everybody's feeling and everybody's experiencing. And people are truly starting to see virtual client computing, our core business, as one of the major defenses. And many people realize that essentially virtualizing their device may be one of the only ways they can truly secure the data and secure the device. So certainly, secular trend is helping. From the product perspective, we definitely continue to amp it up across the portfolio. With NetScaler capabilities that were released in June, with updates to the entire NetScaler portfolio and NetScaler gateway serving as essentially conditional access, with multi-factor authentication that many customers are starting to deploy, with information rights management being introduced into ShareFile and with continuous improvement in our core business, XenApps and Desktop, certainly, from the product point of view, we have continued to drive improvement. But I would say, last but not least, it's the sort of overall awareness that we've been driving in the marketplace. And I think as I shared with you when I first joined 9 months ago, even when I was doing my due diligence on Citrix a year ago, what I discovered was that there's a whole lot more to Citrix than the world knows about. And in the last 6 months, most importantly starting with Synergy in May, we have delivered the driven awareness to make sure that the world actually understands what we stand for and what we have to offer. And the world actually understands that improving cybersecurity defenses is the most significant outcome that our customer gets from deploying Citrix solutions. So all combined, that's what we're seeing and that's why we're amplifying this, and that's why it's going to be so important on a go-forward basis."

But now we're seeing adoption, and now we're seeing broad adoption in the enterprise and also that's what our friends at Microsoft is sharing with us. And as in the past, in major Microsoft refresh cycles, Citrix gets the benefit. As I mentioned, some major, major clients are deploying Windows 10 through VDI mechanisms, and that's tremendously helpful. We're now in the sort of final phases to implement Windows 10 VDI on Azure, which is coming in just the next short few months, and that will serve as additional catalyst. But certainly, our partnership with Microsoft and overall rate of adoption of Windows 10 is strong and it's accelerating, and we're really excited about it. On Windows Server 2016, this is the best server release ever that Microsoft had. And we're seeing good momentum. We expect strong adoption. I think if you read analyst reports about Windows Server adoption, sort of, obviously, in addition to all the rapid move to the cloud and to Azure, today, the majority of Windows Servers run Windows Server 2008, so their major refresh cycle is coming. And we believe that Windows Server 2016 will be right there and we'll be right there with it since we have supported it from day 1 when it was released."

But just to talk about that a little bit more, everything that Kirill mentioned earlier in terms of the momentum around the Xen family business, that's just pure execution. And the other thing that we've talked about is that there is an ongoing subscription component of that, the Citrix Service Provider business that I mentioned, which is largely Xen family. That's up to about $75 million ARR, growing at 30%. So we're addressing both more and more incremental efficiencies at the higher end of the market and also programs like CSP, which are just net new, largely targeting SMB and some mid-market. So it's coming from a number of different factors, and we feel like that momentum can continue. In terms of networking, there's really 3 big segments of that business as everyone knows. It's primarily around the secular trend towards cloud and e-commerce and SaaS providers. We're doing extremely well in that business, and we'll continue to expand the base. The attached motion, where today represents about 15% of the mix, that's been a function of what's been going on in the last 5 years around Workspace Services. So as that business reaccelerates, we'll just have many more opportunities to go on attach. And then third, around the part that we just termed core enterprise ADC, that's probably our single biggest capacity add from a go-to-market standpoint in '17. We've been ramping that up really last quarter, and we'll finish that up in Q4 time frame. But by the end of next year, we'll probably have a 20% increase in networking capacity across the board. So while it's largely a second half story, it's an area that we believe that we can continue this trend of taking share each and every year. We just need to be involved in more places where our customers are. And so that's just a little contextual flavor around the business. But in terms of overall guidance, just to reiterate, this year, the core business is doing about 2.5%, 3% growth. Our prelim guidance for next year is to actually accelerate that to 3% to 4%, and we think we can do that at a higher-margin structure."

VDI is one segment that will be largely influenced by the refresh cycle of Windows 10. And we certainly see significant momentum and excitement building up there, and we feel that we're going to be strong beneficiaries of the trend. And we do have strong partnerships with hyper-converged appliance providers, and particularly, Nutanix, last quarter, announced increased partnership with XenServer. They're putting the XenServer in their appliances now, and they're working with us on the entire VDI stack on their appliance. It is primarily designed to serve mid-market, which is obviously going to play to our strategy of continued expansion in mid-market customers. And I view that as another net positive capital going forward."

And of course, Windows 10, I think it would be fair to say, when you look at the worldwide deployment of Windows desktops, approximately, if you're kind of trying to triangulate different analyst reports, approximately 10% of those deployments run virtualized. And obviously, as those currently get to move to the new version of Windows, they typically go with the more recent and more advanced SKU of server, of Citrix solutions.

But sort of to give you our preliminary view where we see investment priorities. In GoTo market, it is not only increasing direct selling capacity that we have been driving through most of 2016 and we will continue in 2017, but it's also reinvigorating, in many cases, our partner channel and putting more energy in working with our partners. It served us well, and we now see early signals that it's working to add more breadth back into business and to expand in the mid-market, and we expect to do more of that. On the sort of product portfolio, if there's one most significant major transformation that is happening at Citrix right now, it is cloud transformation. We started it earlier this year. We've declared that we're all in on the cloud, and we're absolutely going to continue. And it is starting to serve us very well from an awareness perspective, from the engagement perspective with even our existing customers, who all want to run their entire infrastructures in the cloud at some point in the future. And for them to know that Citrix is going to be there with them serves as tremendous reassurance, and we're going to continue to give them more proof points of how strong we're going to be growing there and how we're going to become a leader in this emerging discipline of Workspace-as-a-Service. And perhaps, sort of on a couple of additional major trends that we're embracing and that you're going to start seeing us sort of be central to is Workspaces IoT. This is overall Internet of Things taking place at people's workplace. It's really a scenario where you can imagine everything around you in your office now has a certain amount of compute capacity and connected to the Internet and what magical things can you do there. Now Citrix, being essentially a workspace transformation company for the last 27 years, has amazing DNA to essentially take advantage of this secular technological trend and give people the ability to help their people work better and work differently. And we're already engaged with some of our partners, in the systems integrated community in particular, who are starting to see those scenarios, and we're very engaged with some of our larger customers, who are now sort of turning into early adopters of those workplace IoT approaches. So really exciting things happening in the industry, and with Citrix being truly back on our sort of innovation edge, we're very excited about being a participant in that."

In terms of hyperscale, they would fall within that segment that we talk about as cloud infrastructure and e-commerce. It's 40% of the mix last quarter. And then those what I would call hyperscale, it's only a handful and that would represent part of that market. The trend continues, and I mean, the meta-trend around just capacity buildout is -- has been great. So that business, whereas it used to be 1 or 2 quarters per year, has been strong for 4 or 5 quarters in a row now. And that's one of the things that you see us lapsing really, really tough comps in Q3 and Q4 of last year. Expect that to continue. We always have pretty good visibility on a full year basis. The quarter-to-quarter is somewhat subject to just the needs and capacity buildout of the hyperscale. As we go into next year, as I mentioned a minute ago, I mean, part of the strategy is expanding that category so that you're touching, what I'd call, Tier 2 clouds as well as broader e-commerce providers and others as well as the capacity investments and attach motion for the other segments. So that's what's going on in overall -- on networking. As far as VPX, I mean, remind everybody that the most important element of NetScaler is the fact that it's a software product. It's deployed across a number of form factors, everything from fully virtualized data center appliances, all the way down through virtual appliances and even in the form factor of a container. And we get a lot of leverage by being able to utilize one code base across all those different use case scenarios. So VPX on a license count was probably the fastest growing in Q3, and that's just a function of broad distribution. You can use that in the cloud. You can use that in your own data center. You can use it as part of a networking fabric, if you will. And it's just having that base for us is what -- one of the things that we leverage from a differentiation point of view."

Before we begin, I want to state that we have posted product specification and historical revenue trends related to our product groupings to our Investor Relations website.
I'd like to remind you that today's conversation will contain forward-looking statements made under the safe harbor provision of the U.S. securities law. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Obviously, these risks could cause actual results to differ from those anticipated.

We continue to show great results and overall execution from the operational initiatives that have been driving profitability, to the strength in product portfolio that's driving top line growth.",1385,"Thanks, Eduardo, and welcome to everyone joining us today. We continue to show great results and overall execution from the operational initiatives that have been driving profitability, to the strength in product portfolio that's driving top line growth. We're focusing all of our energy on the core strategy of securely delivering apps and data, really setting the company up for sustainable profitable growth as we look forward. 
As you can see from the release, total revenue was up 3% year-on-year in Q3. Adjusted operating margin expanded to over 30%. Adjusted EPS was $1.32 per share, up 27% year-on-year, and we generated nearly $290 million in cash flow from ops. In total, we closed 49 $1 million-plus transactions, with particular strength in cloud, health care, technology and government verticals. There was also good balance across the portfolio, with more than half of these deals coming from Workspace Services, with the balance coming from networking. 
From a geographic perspective, when you exclude the GoTo businesses, revenue from the Americas was up 8%. APJ was flat, and the EMEA market declined about 4%. This performance is pretty consistent with the first half of the year. The Americas geo continues to drive significant growth across all product categories, while the other regions are seeing improving execution in many of our primary markets. 
Related to this, in Q3, we announced a leadership change in the APJ region and pending change in the U.K. And these things will help accelerate field restructuring into 2017. 
Next, I want to talk about Q3 results within our 3 primary businesses. Within Workspace Service business, which includes virtualization mobility, grew 5% total to $414 million, including a 5% year-on-year increase in product license revenue. This growth rate has been really moving up over the last 6 quarters and is a direct result of the focused strategy we adopted last year. As we've discussed a few times, there's a number of very specific initiatives that we're driving to accelerate growth in this area through much faster innovation, more verticalized solutions, integration of our unique assets across the portfolio and the reinvigoration of our channel partnerships. 
Just a couple of other dynamics that are worth noting. That includes the license revenue in the Americas geo, with across all of Workspace Services has accelerated last quarter. In Q3, this was up 18% year-on-year, and this is after already posting 16% license growth through the first half of the year. Much of this has been coming from mid-, large enterprise customers, often in verticals where security and compliance are major concerns. 
Additionally, we continue to grow our cloud service provider subscriptions, where partners are primarily utilizing XenApp to deliver cloud-based offerings to their customers. Overall, the Citrix Service Provider revenue grew about 30% to now have an ARR of over $75 million. 
Next, looking at Delivery Networking. Total revenue increased 1% in the quarter to $191 million. The largest part of this overall business, NetScaler ADC, posted license revenue growth of 5% against the strong Q3 a year ago. But impacting the results in the rest of the BU were the comps from the ByteMobile and cloud platform products that are part of the restructuring at the start of this year. 
Staying on NetScaler for a minute. I'll remind everybody that the business is essentially made up of 3 segments: cloud infrastructure and e-commerce; Citrix solution sales; and enterprise ADC. So within the quarter, demand from cloud and e-commerce continued to be really strong, consistent with what we've seen over the last 5 quarters. This segment, which is made up of roughly 200 different customers in the quarter, contributed about 40% of NetScaler product sales. The solution-attached segment represented 15% of the mix, with a number of app and mobile opportunities that included networking as part of an overall Citrix solution was up modestly from a year ago. And then enterprise ADC was the remaining 45% of the mix. All in, we sold over 1,600 networking customers during the period, with 1/3 of those being net new to Citrix. 
And finally, our SaaS-delivered revenue was up 9% to $207 million in the quarter. The contribution from the GoTo business was $173 million. And as far as the merger between GoTo and LogMeIn, we received U.S. antitrust approval in September and continue to expect this to close in the Q1 2017 time frame. 
When you look at just the cloud-based services that are part of core Citrix, we delivered $35 million in total revenue, growing 28% in the quarter. The bulk of this is coming from ShareFile, our secure data platform, with the other new offerings addressing workspaces and service needs for our customers. So clearly, we continue to see a shift in the way products are being consumed by customers, evolving slowly towards a more ratable model. So when you include revenue that is being generated from the Citrix Service Provider program, plus our own cloud-based services and the annual term license, the aggregate ARR is now over $225 million, growing very rapidly. 
So turning to operations. We've driven a lot of efficiencies in the company over the past 6 quarters and continue to do so in Q3. The actions across the business were designed to generate permanent expense reductions while reallocating investments to those areas that will drive profitable growth in the future. In Q3, adjusted operating margin was over 30%. This is up more than 400 basis points from last year. We're clearly operating well ahead of our stated goal of reaching 30% full year margins in 2017. 
The focus on leverage has also helped increase our cash flow profile for the company. Q3 cash flow from operations was a record $288 million. And over the trailing 12 months, we've generated a total of $1.14 billion in cash from ops, and this is up 21%. 
As you start to model fiscal 2017, I want to point out that historically, about 80% to 90% of cash flow from operations can be attributed to core Citrix business, with the remainder coming from GoTo. Exiting Q3, we had nearly $2.5 billion in cash and investments on the balance sheet, which is up sharply from last quarter. Over the last several years, our stated target has been to utilize half of free cash flow for capital return, a level which, frankly, we've regularly exceeded. As you know, this program has been on hold due to the pending separation of the GoTo business. So once that's completed, we intend to restart our programmatic capital return, and we'll talk definitively about those plans once the transaction is closed. 
Before I wrap up, let me talk about our current outlook and expectations for the remainder of the year. Our growth strategy and operational programs are clearly working. We're happy with the results, and we're confident in our plans for the balance of the year and looking into 2017. At the same time, we're going to continue our conservative outlook, given the pending GoTo merger with LogMeIn and the significant revenue upside we posted in Q4 of last year. That said, we're increasing our assumptions for Q4 and the full year. So for 2016, we now expect consolidated revenue between $3.4 billion and $3.41 billion and adjusted EPS of $5.18 to $5.20 this year. This represents revenue for core Citrix to be in the range of $2.71 billion to $2.72 billion or roughly 3.5 -- or excuse me, 2.5% to 3% growth, when you exclude the GoTo business. 
With respect to 2017, we're just finishing up our planning cycle, which is very normal for this point in Q4. At this stage, we still expect the GoTo merger to be completed in Q1 '17, so we're completely focused on the ongoing business at core Citrix. We're feeling good about the continued improvement in results, in the new product cycles and the early returns from Citrix cloud. We're also making the GoTo market capacity investments that should drive additional growth next year, particularly in the second half of 2017. Therefore, we're currently modeling 2017 full year revenue growth of 3% to 4% for core Citrix and adjusted operating margins of 32% to 33%. 
So now I'd like to turn it over to Kirill to give further color on the quarter and our focus areas looking forward. Kirill?"

I'm obviously very pleased with our results, clearly demonstrating how our renewed focus is resonating in the marketplace. We're seeing growth in all of our core areas of business, most importantly in our Workspace Services business, showing growth for the second consecutive quarter. 
Our efforts in accelerating product innovation and improving operational processes are working. And the progress on cultural transformation that defines us in the company will continue to power us forward. We're seeing improved stability in our workforce and incredibly strong employee engagement as evidenced by very strong results and participation in our recent global employee survey. 
Specific to our field organization, through these improvements, we now have approximately 100 more quota-carrying reps since our restructuring about a year ago. Our America sales team continues to fire on all cylinders with consistently strong execution quarter after quarter. And with the leadership changes we have implemented in APJ and more change upcoming in EMEA, we see great opportunity to replicate what's working so strongly in the Americas. 
Our vision is clear. Our strategy is crisp, and our execution has improved dramatically. We now have had 5 straight quarters of continuous operating improvement. 
A few additional comments on our solution areas. There's a big story this quarter, of course, Workspace Services or our Xen family. It's exciting to see this core part of our business delivering 5% year-over-year increase in license revenue. I'm encouraged by sales energy and tremendous product innovation in this area. After 2 quarters of solid growth, this is clearly not a fluke or just a blip on the radar. This is an exciting change deliberately driven by the strongest, highly differentiated products and much-improved competitive edge. 
Additionally, in September, we delivered XenApps and Desktop 7.11, a major release featuring day 1 support for Windows Server 2016, management innovations and user experience enhancements. We also acquired NorthScale, greatly complementary technology that adds extra capabilities in the user environment management and adds very smart workspace performance optimization techniques, unmatched in the industry. 
We saw more than 650 competitive wins in virtual client computing this quarter, and our win rate has been consistently improving. Specifically, one of the nation's largest grocery retail and supply chain services companies chose XenDesktop for VDI delivery to support their retail corporations, thanks to our partnership with Microsoft. 
And another major win against the top competitor in the space, one of the world's largest insurance providers chose to leverage XenDesktop to enable the efficient upgrade to Windows 10 on more than 20,000 desktops, also driven by our unique support for Skype for Business. 
We continue to see more customers choosing our entire portfolio due to stronger-than-ever product integration. For example, in a dual competitive win, a top clinical teaching hospital in the Netherlands is rethinking their Workspace Services end-to-end, chose Citrix Workspace Suite against both the virtualization competitor and the networking competitor, so they can implement a full coherent solution for hospital workplace innovation. 
Moving on to network delivery business. As David mentioned, we saw good growth in the core ADC area, with a 5% year-over-year increase from the already strong Q3 in 2015. On the product innovation front, we released a major update to NetScaler SD-WAN. We continue to be very encouraged by growth in that area. This update featured more advanced routing, simple deployment and unrivaled security capabilities. We also released NetScaler support for the fifth standard, a testament to our commitment to security in the U.S. federal government. And we released NetScaler CPX, a free developer version of NetScaler in a container, that allows for rapid deployment methodologies such as DevOps. It's a clear indicator of our team's focus on new technologies and increased innovation. 
We saw more than 500 competitive wins in the network delivery space globally, including a major African mobile communications company, a major international electronics company and a global technology company. All of which are using NetScaler to ensure high network availability, resilience and security in their services. 
On to data delivery. As with previous quarters, ShareFile continued to prove itself as a growing force in the Enterprise file, sync and share market, growing 25% year-over-year. We continue to drive rapid product innovation and expand ShareFile functionality in target industries, adding more workflows and cloud connectors. We're starting to see increased traction of ShareFile outside of the United States, where it's still the strongest, and in the larger Enterprise segment. Specifically, Daimler AG, one of the largest and well-known producers of premium cars and manufacturers of commercial vehicles, chose Citrix ShareFile to improve large file exchange across their organization, and it will help them reduce storage costs and support business departments when dealing with big amounts of data. 
On to the industry trends. Cybersecurity, bring-your-own-device phenomenon, cloud adoption and Microsoft refresh cycle all served as catalysts to our business in Q3. We saw a strong demand for our solutions to support organizations' initiatives to secure their data, applications and networks. This is particularly evident in highly regulated industries, including financial services and health care, which had more than a dozen large deals this quarter, as David mentioned. 
We also had several defense ministries and government agencies around the world choosing Citrix to address security concerns, the cybersecurity being the #1 concern for enterprises of all sizes and governments around the world. It is becoming increasingly evident that Citrix solutions are indeed one of the strongest defenses against potential endpoint device and perimeter attacks. 
Moving on to our progress in the cloud. This was a tremendous quarter in our cloud transformation. While it's still in early progress, the momentum is building, with wins coming from businesses of all sizes. Highlighting just a few examples. Hilti, a well-known provider of worldwide leading-edge technology for international construction professionals, has partnered with us to drive their cloud transformation and enable a bring-your-own-device policy for employees through Citrix cloud. Columbia University and another major Ivy League school both chose Citrix cloud to assist in their transition and reduce infrastructure costs and IT support needs. Citrix cloud overall is really starting to shine. 
A couple of remarks on our partnerships. This quarter, we saw a major step forward in our stronger-than-ever relationship with Microsoft. As you may recall, earlier this year, we had announced an elevated and more strategic partnership with Microsoft and now I'm happy to report that it's starting to bear fruit. We're seeing good alignment of our teams in the field, bringing those joint wins I previously mentioned. 
Also in August, Microsoft announced that they would transitioning out of Azure RemoteApp, and Citrix XenApp was designated as the destination for Azure RemoteApp customers. We're creating a clear migration path for Azure RemoteApp customers that want to use all of XenApp's capabilities. This announcement served as a continued vote of confidence that Citrix is clearly the right partner for future success to deliver more workloads on Azure and more adoption of Windows 10 and Office 365. 
As to our broader partner channel, the momentum is continuing to grow. And while we have nearly 50 $1 million-plus deals in Q3, the ShareFile sales coming from the mid-market is increasing, a clear signal that our strategy to expand in the mid-market is working and that our partner channel is more vibrant than ever. 
Just last week, we hosted our top partners in the Americas who gave us tremendous feedback on our mutual progress. 
And last but certainly not least, last month, we held our Annual Industry Analyst event, where we had the opportunity to share our vision, strategy and core messaging. The feedback was remarkable. I previously shared the confidence I heard from our customers and partners, and now hearing such positive reinforcement in our direction and focus from industry analysts was truly encouraging. Our strategy and overall positioning was very well-received, proving to me that we're on the right path. 
As I mentioned, with highly differentiated products, we have stepped up our competitive edge, and it is paying off. We're taking share in all our core areas of business. Overall, I feel very enthusiastic about the business and look forward to closing out the year strong and starting 2017 with Citrix being better and stronger than ever. 
Thank you, and we look forward to your questions."

This is the second quarter, and 5% growth in license is truly remarkable. As I mentioned, it is driven by tremendous strength in our product. We've just simply never had such a strong technology, and the team has done a remarkable job innovating on this. 7.9 release coming out, at about the Synergy conference in May, it was very strong and it's driving tremendous adoption. And we just made it even stronger with 7.11 release and with a small tuck-in acquisition of NorthScale. I think it's also fair to say that virtual client computing, in many cases, is viewed as sort of one of the core parts in cybersecurity efforts that everybody is driving. And we're seeing it from regulated industries. We're seeing it from the governments. We certainly see that trend driving the business forward. And I expect that only to continue and only to accelerate. And last but not least, we're in the midst of a very significant refresh cycle in Microsoft environments, driven by Windows 10 adoption and the recent introduction of Windows Server 2016.

Even in the last presidential debate, we heard about cybersecurity. I think it's for the first time in history, and I think it's certainly served as a call to action to many. And it's just a continuous escalation that we see, from attackers being hobbyists a few years ago, to organized crime, to now rouge governments and cyber terrorists. This is certainly a major threat that everybody's feeling and everybody's experiencing. And people are truly starting to see virtual client computing, our core business, as one of the major defenses. And many people realize that essentially virtualizing their device may be one of the only ways they can truly secure the data and secure the device. So certainly, secular trend is helping. From the product perspective, we definitely continue to amp it up across the portfolio. With NetScaler capabilities that were released in June, with updates to the entire NetScaler portfolio and NetScaler gateway serving as essentially conditional access, with multi-factor authentication that many customers are starting to deploy, with information rights management being introduced into ShareFile and with continuous improvement in our core business, XenApps and Desktop, certainly, from the product point of view, we have continued to drive improvement. But I would say, last but not least, it's the sort of overall awareness that we've been driving in the marketplace. And I think as I shared with you when I first joined 9 months ago, even when I was doing my due diligence on Citrix a year ago, what I discovered was that there's a whole lot more to Citrix than the world knows about. And in the last 6 months, most importantly starting with Synergy in May, we have delivered the driven awareness to make sure that the world actually understands what we stand for and what we have to offer. And the world actually understands that improving cybersecurity defenses is the most significant outcome that our customer gets from deploying Citrix solutions. So all combined, that's what we're seeing and that's why we're amplifying this, and that's why it's going to be so important on a go-forward basis."

And I think most people took a bit of a pause and took a bit more time to do proof of concepts that were largely taking place in the spring. But now we're seeing adoption, and now we're seeing broad adoption in the enterprise and also that's what our friends at Microsoft is sharing with us. And as in the past, in major Microsoft refresh cycles, Citrix gets the benefit. As I mentioned, some major, major clients are deploying Windows 10 through VDI mechanisms, and that's tremendously helpful. We're now in the sort of final phases to implement Windows 10 VDI on Azure, which is coming in just the next short few months, and that will serve as additional catalyst. But certainly, our partnership with Microsoft and overall rate of adoption of Windows 10 is strong and it's accelerating, and we're really excited about it. On Windows Server 2016, this is the best server release ever that Microsoft had. And we're seeing good momentum. We expect strong adoption. I think if you read analyst reports about Windows Server adoption, sort of, obviously, in addition to all the rapid move to the cloud and to Azure, today, the majority of Windows Servers run Windows Server 2008, so their major refresh cycle is coming. And we believe that Windows Server 2016 will be right there and we'll be right there with it since we have supported it from day 1 when it was released."

One is the margin you see; and then two is our ability to reinvest a lot of the savings, if you will, back into things that will drive growth. I'd say that the team is much more focused on driving growth into the future that margins because we're building that muscle just kind of in the ongoing operations of the company. As you mentioned, we're up a better part of 800 basis points over 2 years. There's still a number of specific projects in flight, those that have a longer tail, whether it's real-estate-related or procurement or those types of things that will continue to generate permanent savings.

But just to talk about that a little bit more, everything that Kirill mentioned earlier in terms of the momentum around the Xen family business, that's just pure execution. And the other thing that we've talked about is that there is an ongoing subscription component of that, the Citrix Service Provider business that I mentioned, which is largely Xen family. That's up to about $75 million ARR, growing at 30%. So we're addressing both more and more incremental efficiencies at the higher end of the market and also programs like CSP, which are just net new, largely targeting SMB and some mid-market. So it's coming from a number of different factors, and we feel like that momentum can continue. In terms of networking, there's really 3 big segments of that business as everyone knows. It's primarily around the secular trend towards cloud and e-commerce and SaaS providers. We're doing extremely well in that business, and we'll continue to expand the base. The attached motion, where today represents about 15% of the mix, that's been a function of what's been going on in the last 5 years around Workspace Services. So as that business reaccelerates, we'll just have many more opportunities to go on attach. And then third, around the part that we just termed core enterprise ADC, that's probably our single biggest capacity add from a go-to-market standpoint in '17. We've been ramping that up really last quarter, and we'll finish that up in Q4 time frame. But by the end of next year, we'll probably have a 20% increase in networking capacity across the board. So while it's largely a second half story, it's an area that we believe that we can continue this trend of taking share each and every year. We just need to be involved in more places where our customers are. And so that's just a little contextual flavor around the business. But in terms of overall guidance, just to reiterate, this year, the core business is doing about 2.5%, 3% growth. Our prelim guidance for next year is to actually accelerate that to 3% to 4%, and we think we can do that at a higher-margin structure."

It served us well, and we now see early signals that it's working to add more breadth back into business and to expand in the mid-market, and we expect to do more of that. On the sort of product portfolio, if there's one most significant major transformation that is happening at Citrix right now, it is cloud transformation. We started it earlier this year. We've declared that we're all in on the cloud, and we're absolutely going to continue. And it is starting to serve us very well from an awareness perspective, from the engagement perspective with even our existing customers, who all want to run their entire infrastructures in the cloud at some point in the future. And for them to know that Citrix is going to be there with them serves as tremendous reassurance, and we're going to continue to give them more proof points of how strong we're going to be growing there and how we're going to become a leader in this emerging discipline of Workspace-as-a-Service. And perhaps, sort of on a couple of additional major trends that we're embracing and that you're going to start seeing us sort of be central to is Workspaces IoT. This is overall Internet of Things taking place at people's workplace. It's really a scenario where you can imagine everything around you in your office now has a certain amount of compute capacity and connected to the Internet and what magical things can you do there. Now Citrix, being essentially a workspace transformation company for the last 27 years, has amazing DNA to essentially take advantage of this secular technological trend and give people the ability to help their people work better and work differently. And we're already engaged with some of our partners, in the systems integrated community in particular, who are starting to see those scenarios, and we're very engaged with some of our larger customers, who are now sort of turning into early adopters of those workplace IoT approaches. So really exciting things happening in the industry, and with Citrix being truly back on our sort of innovation edge, we're very excited about being a participant in that."

In terms of hyperscale, they would fall within that segment that we talk about as cloud infrastructure and e-commerce. It's 40% of the mix last quarter. And then those what I would call hyperscale, it's only a handful and that would represent part of that market. The trend continues, and I mean, the meta-trend around just capacity buildout is -- has been great. So that business, whereas it used to be 1 or 2 quarters per year, has been strong for 4 or 5 quarters in a row now. And that's one of the things that you see us lapsing really, really tough comps in Q3 and Q4 of last year. Expect that to continue. We always have pretty good visibility on a full year basis. The quarter-to-quarter is somewhat subject to just the needs and capacity buildout of the hyperscale. As we go into next year, as I mentioned a minute ago, I mean, part of the strategy is expanding that category so that you're touching, what I'd call, Tier 2 clouds as well as broader e-commerce providers and others as well as the capacity investments and attach motion for the other segments. So that's what's going on in overall -- on networking. As far as VPX, I mean, remind everybody that the most important element of NetScaler is the fact that it's a software product. It's deployed across a number of form factors, everything from fully virtualized data center appliances, all the way down through virtual appliances and even in the form factor of a container. And we get a lot of leverage by being able to utilize one code base across all those different use case scenarios. So VPX on a license count was probably the fastest growing in Q3, and that's just a function of broad distribution. You can use that in the cloud. You can use that in your own data center. You can use it as part of a networking fabric, if you will. And it's just having that base for us is what -- one of the things that we leverage from a differentiation point of view."

As David mentioned, our Citrix Service Provider segment is growing very, very nicely. And we see while we don't break out individual elements of what Citrix Service Providers deliver through their private -- through their part in the cloud, we see the share of networking in that segment overall growing, and that's all driven by VPX. So I would say, in that respect, it is additive."

And companies are doing that in pretty broad scale, both from an engagement standpoint, but probably more importantly, from a real estate consolidation point of view, and just ways to increase their density and immediately bring down costs. So that's just another phenomenon we're seeing."
