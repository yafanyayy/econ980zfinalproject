Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our fourth quarter and year-end conference call. We appreciate you being with us this morning. This morning, I'm joined by Doug Howell, our Chief Financial Officer, as well as the heads of our operating divisions.
Today, I'm going to comment on total company financial results, make some comments on our merger and acquisition program and then I'll move into each segment's results and provide a bit of a wrap before for Doug's comments -- after Doug's comments and about really an awesome recognition we received by J.D. Power and Associates, and then we'll get to your questions. 
We had a great quarter capping a great year. Total company, a strong finish to an excellent 2015. Our combined Brokerage and Risk Management core operations in the fourth quarter posted 4.2% total organic growth, 10% total adjusted revenue growth, adjusted EBITDAC was up 12% and we expanded our adjusted margins by 46 basis points.
For the year, on a combined basis, we posted 5.1% total organic growth, that's 5.1%; 17% growth in total adjusted revenue surpassing $4 billion in revenues; 22% growth in adjusted EBITDAC; and we expanded our adjusted margins by over 90 basis points. And to top it all off, we tapped the $100 million of net earnings mark from our clean energy investments. That's up from less than $4 million in net earnings in 2011. What an amazing run and we've got more of that to come in clean energy.
Let me move to some comments on our merger and acquisition program. We completed 15 mergers, totaling $46 million of new annualized revenue in the fourth quarter. For the year, we did 44 mergers, 2 of which were in the Risk Management segment
[Audio Gap]
$5 million of that was in the United States, split half property/casualty and half employee benefits, $15 million was in Australia and New Zealand, $15 million in the U.K. and about $5 million in Canada. That averages out to about $5 million in revenue per merger, and we paid a weighted average price to EBITDAC of 7.6x. As I do every quarter, I'd like to thank all of our new partners for joining us and extend a very warm welcome to our growing family. 
Two further comments on mergers and acquisitions. First, since July 2014, when we did our last big deal, Noraxis in Canada, we've returned to our program of doing smaller tuck-in mergers as we forecasted in every conference call and investor meeting since then. Further, for these mergers, we're still paying fair prices and only slightly more than what we're paying for smaller tuck-in deals prior to 2014, consistently in the 6.5 to 77.5 range. So when I look forward, I see a merger and acquisition program in 2016 as being very similar to the last 18 months. Our merger pipeline remains very strong, particularly in the United States, and we're also seeing good opportunities in Canada, New Zealand and Australia. With having platforms in those locations now and most of our integration efforts behind us, merger prospects now see Gallagher as a partner with vast capabilities and they want to join us. Further, we do not have any large deals on our plate right now, neither domestic nor international, and based on our current pipeline, we do not see the need to use stock to fund mergers in 2016. 
And second final comment on mergers, one of the first things we do when we complete a merger is to quickly collect and analyze their client and carrier data. Today, we have nearly all of our data from every client and carrier globally in one spot. We use this data to help pir carrier partners develop better programs for our clients, and we use this data to help our clients match up with the right carrier based in their needs. This value add to both our carriers and to our clients gives us the opportunity to enhance our compensation. We see tremendous opportunities for that in 2016 and beyond. 
Let me move now to the Brokerage segment. Brokerage, fourth quarter results were very strong. Adjusted revenues up 11%; 2.8% in total organic growth; adjusted EBITDAC is up 12%; and our adjusted margins expanded by 30 basis points. Brokerage results for the year were terrific. For the full year, adjusted revenues were up 19%, 3.6% total organic. Adjusted EBITDAC , up 22%; and adjusted margins expanded 70 basis points. And in 2015, we posted adjusted EBITDAC margins of 26.1%. That's up over 400 basis points since the full year 2011, 4 full points of margin expansion. What a fantastic accomplishment and it shows our Brokerage business is really, really healthy and vibrant. 
So let me drill down a bit into each of our Brokerage operations around the world. First, domestically in the United States, that's our retail property/casualty, our retail employee benefits consulting and our wholesale operations, which for the year, combined for about $2.1 billion of our $3.3 billion of Brokerage segment revenues. In the fourth quarter, these units combined to pose 3.5% organic and expanded their margins by about 80 basis points. For the year, they posted 3% organic growth and expanded margins by 120 basis points. These units all have annual adjusted margins in the very high 20s, about 28%, and each unit is nearing the upper end of our margin expectations. To put this into perspective, the 4-year period, as I said just a moment ago, margins in these units are up over 400 basis points, which is really a nice work. 
Looking towards 2016, we'll seeing domestic retail and wholesale PC units having a slight rate headwind on average down about 5%, property off more like 10%, with casualty a little less than flat. But we're seeing increases in exposure units offsetting that a little bit, and we are also continuing to have nice new business growth and our retentions are holding. So we see 2016 a lot like 2015 in our domestic retail wholesale PC units. 
As for our retail employee benefits business, we're seeing more activity in 2016. Our clients and prospects are now having to deal with the complexities of the ACA. Much of that happens in the second half of the year, but we still see organic better in 2016 than in 2015 in our benefits units. 
Next, our international operations. That's our PC Brokerage operations in Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the U.K, which for the year, they combined for a little over $1.2 billion of our $3.3 billion Brokerage segment revenues. Combined, they posted 4% organic growth for the full year and expanded margins by 50 basis points. In aggregate, they are posting mid-20s annual adjusted margins. 
I think it's worthwhile for me to touch on each country for just a moment. So I'll start with Canada, about $125 million of annualized revenues. Fourth quarter organic was in the mid-2% range. Margins are similar to our U.S. operations, in the very high 20s, so also near the top of our margin expectations. When I look at our January 1 renewals, rates are fairly stable to even slightly a bit positive. As for exposures, while we are not really significantly exposed to energy risks, the broader Canadian economy is suffering because the knock on effect of those businesses rely on the energy sector. But despite all this, the team is in the final push of integration efforts to convert our systems, and they haven't missed a step so I see a similar 2016. 
Next, moving to Australia and New Zealand, about $265 million of annualized revenue. Fourth quarter organic was near 2%. Of the 2 units, New Zealand performed better in terms of organic and margins, which was in line with what we saw when we did the acquisition in 2014. Both countries have been faced for several years with soft renewal rates, especially in property, and their economies are weak but starting to show a bit of recovery with their weaker currencies. In addition, our January 1 renewals are starting to show a bottoming of the cycle. Both New Zealand and Australia are effectively finished with their integration efforts. It's important to note, in aggregate, margins are nicely in the very high 20s, which is a touch better than what we expected when we purchased them in mid-2014.  So while we do have some modest opportunity for margin efficiencies in Australia, in 2016, our real focus is to energize the sales culture in Australia. I was there in the fall, and I can tell you, the Australian team is working with their counterparts in the U.S. and New Zealand to build a similar sales and service culture. 
Finally, let me move to the U.K. About $775 million of annualized revenues, $360 million of that is retail property/casualty, that's our branch network, $325 million is London and Bermuda specialty, and about $90 million is underwriting and programs. Altogether, about 1% organic growth in the fourth quarter and a little over 3% for the full year. Aggregate margins are a little bit over 20%. 
So let me make a couple of comments on the 3 units. U.K. retail, we posted flat organic and the quarter and full year 2015, and margins are in the very high teens. We're seeing rates flat to slightly down and we're not seeing much growth and exposures due to the stable economic conditions in the U.K. But posting flat organic is actually quite an accomplishment, given it is this unit that's going through most of the integration work that's remaining from our larger deals. Remember, we are pushing 4 different retail organizations together and we've become a top 5 retailer in the U.K. in just 2 year's time. These retail branches are going through the similar processes that we did in the U.S. over the last 5 years. Those are standardization, simplification, using common technologies, migrating work to our offshore centers of excellence, using our niches and adapting the Gallagher sales culture and learning our retail playbook. 2016 will be the year where we evolve from a unit going through integration, to a unit focused on harvesting synergies and executing on our sales and service plans. Accordingly, we should see a little margin improvement in 2016, and then hopefully, much more in '17. 
U.K. underwriting. Underwriting program is about $90 million in revenues, about 10% margins, which is similar to prior years. Organic growth was flat for the year, but our efforts to improve this business showed promise in the fourth quarter, and we posted over 5% organic growth. This is a collection of underwriting businesses, many of which came with the retail acquisitions of Heath, Giles and Oval. We have reconstituted to the management and these businesses have a line of sight towards improvement in 2016 and 2017. 
London and Bermuda specialty, about $325 million in revenue. For the year, these units posted over 5% organic growth but, it was closer to 1% in the fourth quarter. We're seeing some pressure on rates in most lines, and in particular, in the Energy and Marine lines written by our London specialty units. Margins are in the lower mid-20s, which is really respectable, given the nature and complexity of this business. 
This is the unit that also has about $30 million in revenues from smaller and emerging markets. That breaks down to about 1/3 in the Caribbean, 1/3 in Norway and 1/3 in South America, which posts similar margins. Clearly, none of these smaller units is financially significant, but we did these mergers because they have specialties that align well and trade with our U.K. and Bermuda specialty businesses. 
So to recap our Brokerage segment. In 2016, while we see retail PC rates as a headwind, we do see PC exposure growth offsetting this partially. We also see employment growth and complexity surrounding the Affordable Care Act as tailwinds for our employee benefits units. In addition, our history of strong new business generation, solid retention and enhanced value-added services for our carrier partners should all result in further organic growth opportunities around the world. Integration efforts related to our larger mergers we did in the U.S, Australia, New Zealand and Canada are effectively done, and we expect our integration efforts in the U.K. to be nearly done by the end of 2016. Integration costs in 2016 should be less than half of our 2015 amounts. Margins are excellent in most of our units around the world, with some further opportunities for efficiencies in Australia and our U.K. retail and underwriting businesses. 
So let me move to our Risk Management segment, essentially, Gallagher Bassett Services. Risk Management finished the year with an outstanding fourth quarter. Adjusted organic growth of 10.5%; adjusted EBITDAX grew 17%; and margins improved 140 basis points. For the full year, we posted over 11% organic growth, 18% growth in EBITDAC, surpassed 17% of adjusted margins, and we expanded margins by 120 basis points. 
Gallagher Bassett is now over $700 million of annual revenue. And since we embarked on our retooling efforts 5 years ago, it has shown consistent excellent, top and bottom line results, and we see it continuing to gain momentum. In fact, 2015 was the third year in a row where we posted around 10% organic growth and also hit or exceeded our annual margin targets, up nearly 2 full margin points since 2011. 17% EBITDAC margin is our 2016 margin target and near the top of our expectations. Our U.S. Claims Management business is about $575 million in annualized revenues and posted a specialty strong double-digit organic growth for the quarter and full year margins, as I said earlier, of around 17%. 
We have been successful in developed new and improved services for our clients. 
Following last quarter's introduction of Luminos, which is Gallagher Bassett's acclaimed risk management information system for clients, we rolled out GBGO, the first of the suite of mobile technology products designed specifically for use on smartphones and tablet devices. In addition, new medical management products and approaches, together with broader adoption of GB products by clients, has led to improved claim outcomes, as well as increased revenue for Gallagher Bassett. 
Strong performance in stated ministered worker compensation schemes in Australia pushed Gallagher Bassett's operations to well over $130 million in revenue in 2015, or roughly 20% of the segment's revenue, also posting organic growth of about 10%. GB's international operations are expected to make a strong contribution again in 2016, with investments in our self-insured and carrier segments scheduled to come online later this year. 
So really, truly, a remarkable year on all measures, which is a testament to an incredibly strong sales and service culture. These results don't just happen. Our team gets up every day and works relentlessly to service our clients and to aggressively demonstrate our capabilities to new prospects. A great quarter, great year, I couldn't be prouder of our colleagues' efforts and what we've accomplished. Over to you Dough."

Before I start some housekeeping, starting with this quarter, you'll see on our investor website 2 documents plus our earnings release.

Before I start some housekeeping, starting with this quarter, you'll see on our investor website 2 documents plus our earnings release. One is the supplemental quarterly data document, that's the one that we've been providing for over a decade. But you'll now see that it contains only historical reported and adjusted information. The other is a new document. It's called CFO commentary. It is this document that contains our forward-looking items, in other words, summarizes both the commentary I typically provide in these calls, plus it has the corporate segment earnings forecast that were previously at the back of the supplement. We hope the CFO Commentary Document makes a more investor friendly and easier to use rather than having to dig out my comments from the conference call transcripts and back pages of the soft. 
Okay onto my comments, and like Pat said, an excellent quarter to end a terrific year. Yes, the quarter -- the fourth quarter is a little noisy on the face, but all items are right in line with the forecast we gave you in our October earnings call, and then again, at our December Investor Meeting. Two additional items we didn't forecast back then. In the Brokerage segment, you'll see $0.02 one-time tax item gain. That benefit results from the newly enacted lower statutory rates in the U.K. related to our net deferred tax obligations on our balance sheet related to our U.K. operations. 
The other item is in the corporate line and the Corporate segment in the tax column. We had a favorable tax item of about $4 million in the fourth quarter. We're a little conservative in our estimates in the first 3 quarters of 2015 when we estimated certain permitted items. So when we those estimates in the fourth quarter, it adds a couple of pennies of gain in the fourth quarter. But it has no impact on full year. 
As for adjustments in 2016, when you digest the information on the new CFO commentary document, 2 items will stand out. First, you'll see FX in 2016 being half the headwind that we saw in 2015. And second, you'll see that we are forecasting integration costs in 2016 to be less than half of the 2015 levels. I'm really pleased that we're effectively done integrating the larger mergers like Bollinger, OMs, and Noraxis. And by year end 2016, we should be nearly done with Oval and Giles in the U.K. 
Now let's turn to Page 3 of the earnings release, to the Brokerages segment organic table. You'll see supplementals way out and contingents way down in the quarter. Ignore the geography as we simply had a couple of contracts that have slight language modifications that is causing the flip between lines. Rather, I suggest that you look at supplementals and contingents in total. And you'll see we're up organically 10% in the quarter and up 8% organically for the full year. Based on current conditions, we expect in 2016 that these lines will organically grow better than the core commissions and fee line. 
At the bottom of that same Page 3, we also see that we used next to no stock this quarter to fund M&A. And you'll see at the bottom of the CFO commentary, first page, we don't anticipate using stock to fund M&A in 2016 either. I'll have some cash flow comments more in a minute. On Page 5 and 6 of the earnings release, you'll see that we had nice margin expansion in the Brokerage and Risk Management segment. In the CFO commentary, you'll see that we still believe margin expansion for the Brokerage segment is difficult if we don't have 3% organic growth. And you'll also see that we're moving up our Risk Management target in 2016 to 17% from our target of 16.5% in 2015. 
All right, let's move the Page 7, to the clean energy line on that page. I'm really pleased that we crossed the $100 million of net earnings mark this year, which is right -- which came in right at the midpoint of what we forecasted a year ago. That's really, really great work by the team. I also want to point out we've added some more convenient disclosure. 
On Page 12 of our earnings release, on the deferred tax asset line in our balance sheet, we've a disclosure showing that $342 million of our deferred tax asset relates to credits that we've generated but not yet deducted from our tax returns. Think about it this way. It's effectively a cash receivable from the government as it will reduce our cash taxes paid in the future. I've said before, our goal is to pay about 10% of our global EBITDAC in taxes, and these credits are a big part of that strategy. 
Looking forward to 2016, you'll see on the second page of the CFO Commentary document that we're forecasting about a 15% step up in earnings in 2016 for our clean energy investments. That's if we hit the midpoint of the range, but $116 million of net after-tax earnings. When we are preparing our 2016 estimates for clean energy, we work closely with our host utility partners and we assessed the ever-present risk surrounding these investments, like things like fuel source, substitution, are they going to burn coal or natural gas. It will take government the regulatory an IRS laws and policy changes. We've looked at plants shutdowns during the year, both temporary and permanent. We looked at the location of plants in the power grid utilization curve, we've looked at our supply chain distribution, so on and so forth. 
In the end, as we sit today, we've digested these risks and we feel comfortable with our 2016 estimates. In addition, our 2016 estimate makes a provision for continued warm weather -- warm winter and then reverts to more of a normal spring, summer and fall. 
Finally, let me move to debt and free cash. First, free cash. We have about $275 million of free cash in the balance sheet. As I said last quarter, all of that is technically free cash, of that $275 million, but until we complete our integration efforts to consolidate legal entities in the U.K, about $100 million of that cash is hard to access because it is hundreds of smaller bank accounts that need minimum balances. We have plans to free up most of those balances over the course of 2016. 
Second, you'll see in the CFO Commentary that we're at about 2.5x debt-to-EBITDAC ratio. That was down substantially from around 2.9 to 3x at the end of 2014. We believe 2.5x is about the right level going forward. 
Third, you'll also see in the CFO Commentary that we might go into the debt markets and raise another $200 million to $300 million. We might do that for several reasons. We can pay off the line, which is currently at about $200 million. We can use it for M&A, we have a strong pipeline. Or we can use it to have cash on hand to repay the $300 million tranche, which carries a 6.44% interest rate and comes due next year. Or, we can do a combination of all 3.
So finally, let me pull it altogether. If you assume 2 point times debt, if you assume that we use no stock use in acquisitions or if you assume that we continue to do mergers at the 7.5 weighted average multiple, just like we did in 2015, we all have ample cash to fund our M&A program in 2016, similar to a levels that we did in 2017. Okay, those are my comments. Back to you, Pat."

For those of you that have been on this call for years, we are a highly seasonal company. Our first quarter is by far our smallest quarter. Our second and third are about the same and then December comes in just a step below that. So we are a seasonal company. So that's why if you look at our margins, we had 26.1% margins for the entire year. And I think if you go back to the first quarter in the Brokerage segment, they were in the high teens, low 20s. I can pull that out -- but so we are a highly seasonal company."

Again, what comprises organic? Every single day, we try to get new business. We're fighting every single week to keep the business we've got and that's an ongoing battle. But frankly, we know that 90-plus-percent of the time when we go out to compete, we're competing with someone who's smaller than we are and doesn't have our resources. I think the ACA is beginning to show an opportunity to have expanded organic growth in our benefits units. Our wholesale units are -- have been very, very strong in terms of organic growth, so I'm a little bit more bullish than I was in December. As I said, I was coming off a week in October or November that I liked. I was very, very pleased with what we did in December, and if we can carry on with that kind of level of new business growth and hold onto our clients, we should do a little better. I would put that in about 2.5% to 3%, 3.5%."

Remember, if they do, we can move the plant to another location also, so it doesn't necessarily mean that, that plant also ceases to become a revenue-generating plant. But right now, based on what we're seeing, there is substantial amount displacement that happened to natural gas in the early 2000's or around -- like 2007, 2010, where natural gas prices fell to the floor.

If you go back and look at the charts starting in about 1970, this market was violently cyclical. There have been times where rates are going up 30% and 40% and times when rates are falling 15% to 25% through the '90s, it seems never-ending. Companies kept going broke and prices kept get getting cut. You get through 2001, you have a violent hard market. That softened substantially in '05, '06. But literally, since about '07, '08, this market places been pretty flat. And I would consider the present environment, which is about 4% off of general business to 10% off on large property schedules. Essentially, with the exception of property, 4% off is pretty close to flat when you used to what I've seen cyclically. So I do predict that management of these carriers today have better information. They absolutely understand loss cost inflation and they're going to fight hard not to have a deterioration in the returns. So my view is that I think they'll find a way to get that back closer to flat because they need to make money and underwriting to have any kind of return."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our fourth quarter and year-end conference call. We appreciate you being with us this morning. This morning, I'm joined by Doug Howell, our Chief Financial Officer, as well as the heads of our operating divisions.
Today, I'm going to comment on total company financial results, make some comments on our merger and acquisition program, and then I'll move into each segment's results and provide a bit of a wrap-up before Doug's comments -- after Doug's comments and -- about, really, an awesome recognition we received by J.D. Power and Associates, and then we'll get to your questions. 
We had a great quarter capping a great year. Total company, strong finish to an excellent 2015. Our combined Brokerage and Risk Management core operations in the fourth quarter posted 4.2% total organic growth, 10% total adjusted revenue growth, adjusted EBITDAC was up 12% and we expanded our adjusted margins by 46 basis points.
For the year, on a combined basis, we posted 5.1% total organic growth, that's 5.1%; 17% growth in total adjusted revenue, surpassing $4 billion in revenues; 22% growth in adjusted EBITDAC; and we expanded our adjusted margins by over 90 basis points. And to top it all off, we tapped the $100 million of net earnings mark from our clean energy investments. That's up from less than $4 million in net earnings in 2011. What an amazing run, and we've got more of that to come in clean energy.
Let me move to some comments on our merger and acquisition program. We completed 15 mergers totaling $46 million of new annualized revenue in the fourth quarter. For the year, we did 44 mergers, 2 of which were in the Risk Management segment,totaling about $230 million of new revenues. Let me break that down a bit. $195 million of that was in the United States, split half property/casualty and half employee benefits; $15 million was in Australia and New Zealand; $15 million in the U.K.; and about $5 million in Canada. That averages out to about $5 million in revenue per merger, and we paid a weighted average price to EBITDAC of 7.6x. As I do every quarter, I'd like to thank all of our new partners for joining us and extend a very warm welcome to our growing family.
Two further comments on mergers and acquisitions. First, since July 2014, when we did our last big deal, Noraxis in Canada, we returned to our program of doing smaller tuck-in mergers, as we forecasted in every conference call and investor meeting since then. Further, for these mergers, we're still paying fair prices and only slightly more than what we were paying for smaller tuck-in deals prior to 2014, consistently in the 6.5 to 7.5 range. So when I look forward, I see a merger and acquisition program in 2016 as being very similar to the last 18 months. Our merger pipeline remains very strong, particularly in the United States, and we are also seeing good opportunities in Canada, New Zealand and Australia. With having platforms in those locations now and most of our integration efforts behind us, merger prospects now see Gallagher as a partner with vast capabilities, and they want to join us. Further, we do not have any large deals on our plate right now, neither domestic nor international, and based on our current pipeline, we do not see the need to use stock to fund mergers in 2016. 
And second final comment on mergers. One of the first things we do when we complete a merger is to quickly collect and analyze their client and carrier data. Today, we have nearly all of our data from every client and carrier globally in one spot. We use this data to help our carrier partners develop better programs for our clients, and we use this data to help our clients match up with the right carrier based on their needs. This value-add to both our carriers and to our clients gives us the opportunity to enhance our compensation. We see tremendous opportunities for that in 2016 and beyond. 
Let me move now to the Brokerage segment. Brokerage fourth quarter results were very strong. Adjusted revenue's up 11%; 2.8% in total organic growth; adjusted EBITDAC is up 12%; and our adjusted margins expanded by 30 basis points. Brokerage results for the year were terrific. For full -- for the full year, adjusted revenues were up 19%; 3.6% total organic; adjusted EBITDAC, up 22%; and adjusted margins expanded 70 basis points. And in 2015, we posted adjusted EBITDAC margins of 26.1%. That's up over 400 basis points since the full year 2011, 4 full points of margin expansion. What a fantastic accomplishment, and it shows our Brokerage business is really, really healthy and vibrant. 
So let me drill down a bit into each of our Brokerage operations around the world. First, domestically in the United States, that's our retail property/casualty, our retail employee benefits consulting and our wholesale operations, which for the year combined for about $2.1 billion of our $3.3 billion of Brokerage segment revenues. In the fourth quarter, these units combined to pose 3.5% organic and expanded their margins by about 80 basis points. For the year, they posted 3% organic growth and expanded margins by 120 basis points. These units all have annual adjusted margins in the very high 20s, about 28%, and each unit is nearing the upper end of our margin expectations. To put this into perspective, over a 4-year period, as I said just a moment ago, margins in these units are up over 400 basis points, which is really nice work. 
Looking towards 2016, we are seeing domestic retail and wholesale PC units having a slight rate headwind, on average, down about 5%; property off more like 10%, with casualty a little less than flat. But we are seeing increases in exposure units offsetting that a little bit, and we are also continuing to have nice new business growth and our retentions are holding. So we see 2016 a lot like 2015 in our domestic retail/wholesale PC units. 
As for our retail employee benefits business, we're seeing more activity in 2016. Our clients and prospects are now having to deal with the complexities of the ACA. Much of that happens in the second half of the year, but we still see organic better in 2016 than in 2015 in our benefits units. 
Next, our international operations. That's our PC brokerage operations in Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the U.K., which, for the year, they combined for a little over $1.2 billion of our $3.3 billion Brokerage segment revenues. Combined, they posted 4% organic growth for the full year and expanded margins by 50 basis points. In aggregate, they are posting mid-20s annual adjusted margins. 
I think it's worthwhile for me to touch on each country for just a moment, so I'll start with Canada. About $125 million of annualized revenues. Fourth quarter organic was in the mid-2% range. Margins are similar to our U.S. operations, in the very high 20s, so also near the top of our margin expectations. When I look at our January 1 renewals, rates are fairly stable to even slightly a bit positive. As for exposures, while we are not really significantly exposed to energy risks, the broader Canadian economy is suffering because the knock-on effect of those businesses rely on the energy sector. But despite all this, the team is in the final push of integration efforts to convert to our systems, and they haven't missed a step, so I see a similar 2016. 
Next, moving to Australia and New Zealand. About $265 million of annualized revenue. Fourth quarter organic was near 2%. Of the 2 units, New Zealand performs better in terms of organic and margins, which was in line with what we saw when we did the acquisition in 2014. Both countries have been faced for several years with soft renewal rates, especially in property, and their economies are weak but starting to show a bit of recovery with their weaker currencies. In addition, our January 1 renewals are starting to show a bottoming of the cycle. Both New Zealand and Australia are effectively finished with their integration efforts. It's important to note, in aggregate, margins are nicely in the very high 20s, which is a touch better than what we expected when we purchased them in mid-2014.  So while we do have some modest opportunity for margin efficiencies in Australia, in 2016, our real focus is to energize the sales culture in Australia. I was there in the fall, and I can tell you, the Australian team is working with their counterparts in the U.S. and New Zealand to build a similar sales and service culture. 
Finally, let me move to the U.K. About $775 million of annualized revenues. $360 million of that is retail property/casualty, that's our branch network; $325 million is London and Bermuda specialty; and about $90 million is underwriting and programs. Altogether, about 1% organic growth in the fourth quarter and a little over 3% for the full year. Aggregate margins are a little bit over 20%. 
And so let me make a couple of comments on the 3 units. U.K. retail, we posted flat organic in the quarter and full year 2015, and margins are in the very high teens. We're seeing rates flat to slightly down, and we're not seeing much growth and exposures due to the stable economic conditions in the U.K. But posting flat organic is actually quite an accomplishment, given it is this unit that's going through most of the integration work that's remaining from our larger deals. Remember, we are pushing 4 different retail organizations together, and we've become a top 5 retailer in the U.K. in just 2 years' time. These retail branches are going through the similar processes that we did in the U.S. over the last 5 years. Those are standardization, simplification, using common technologies, migrating work to our offshore centers of excellence, using our niches and adapting the Gallagher sales culture and learning our retail playbook. 2016 will be the year where we evolve from a unit going through integration to a unit focused on harvesting synergies and executing on our sales and service plans. Accordingly, we should see a little margin improvement in 2016, and then hopefully, much more in '17. 
U.K. underwriting. Underwriting program is about $90 million in revenues, about 10% margins, which is similar to prior years. Organic growth was flat for the year, but our efforts to improve this business showed promise in the fourth quarter, and we posted over 5% organic growth. This is a collection of underwriting businesses, many of which came with the retail acquisitions of Heath, Giles and Oval. We have reconstituted management, and these businesses have a line of sight towards improvement in 2016 and 2017. 
London and Bermuda specialty, about $325 million in revenue. For the year, these units posted over 5% organic growth, but it was closer to 1% in the fourth quarter. We're seeing some pressure on rates in most lines, and in particular, in the Energy and Marine lines written by our London specialty units. Margins are in the lower mid-20s, which is really respectable, given the nature and complexity of this business. 
This is the unit that also has about $30 million in revenues from smaller and emerging markets. That breaks down to about 1/3 in the Caribbean, 1/3 in Norway and 1/3 in South America, which posts similar margins. Clearly, none of these smaller units is financially significant, but we did these mergers because they have specialties that align well and trade with our U.K. and Bermuda specialty businesses. 
So to recap our Brokerage segment. In 2016, while we see retail PC rates as a headwind, we do see PC exposure growth offsetting this partially. We also see employment growth and complexity surrounding the Affordable Care Act as tailwinds for our employee benefits units. In addition, our history of strong new business generation, solid retention and enhanced value-added services for our carrier partners should all result in further organic growth opportunities around the world. Integration efforts related to our larger mergers we did in the U.S, Australia, New Zealand and Canada are effectively done, and we expect our integration efforts in the U.K. to be nearly done by the end of 2016. Integration costs in 2016 should be less than half of our 2015 amounts. Margins are excellent in most of our units around the world, with some further opportunities for efficiencies in Australia and our U.K. retail and underwriting businesses. 
So let me move to our Risk Management segment, essentially, Gallagher Bassett Services. Risk Management finished the year with an outstanding fourth quarter. Adjusted organic growth of 10.5%; adjusted EBITDAX grew 17%; and margins improved 140 basis points. For the full year, we posted over 11% organic growth, 18% growth in EBITDAC, surpassed 17% of adjusted margins, and we expanded margins by 120 basis points. 
Gallagher Bassett is now over $700 million of annual revenue. And since we embarked on our retooling efforts 5 years ago, it has shown consistent, excellent, top and bottom line results, and we see it continuing to gain momentum. In fact, 2015 was the third year in a row where we posted around 10% organic growth and also hit or exceeded our annual margin targets, up nearly 2 full margin points since 2011. 17% EBITDAC margin is our 2016 margin target and near the top of our expectations. Our U.S. Claims Management business is about $575 million in annualized revenues and posted a specialty strong double-digit organic growth for the quarter and full year margins, as I said earlier, of around 17%. 
We have been successful in developing new and improved services for our clients. Following last quarter's introduction of Luminos, which is Gallagher Bassett's acclaimed risk management information system for clients, we rolled out GBGO, the first of a suite of mobile technology products designed specifically for use on smartphones and tablet devices. In addition, new medical management products and approaches, together with broader adoption of GB products by clients, has led to improved claim outcomes, as well as increased revenue for Gallagher Bassett. 
Strong performance instate-administered workers' compensation schemes in Australia pushed Gallagher Bassett's operations to well over $130 million in revenue in 2015, or roughly 20% of the segment's revenue, also posting organic growth of about 10%. GB's international operations are expected to make a strong contribution again in 2016, with investments in our self-insured and carrier segments scheduled to come online later this year. 
So really, truly a remarkable year on all measures, which is a testament to an incredibly strong sales and service culture. These results don't just happen. Our team gets up every day and works relentlessly to service our clients and to aggressively demonstrate our capabilities to new prospects. A great quarter, a great year. I couldn't be prouder of our colleagues' efforts and what we've accomplished. 
Over to you, Doug."

Before I start some housekeeping, starting with this quarter, you'll see on our investor website 2 documents plus our earnings release. One is the supplemental quarterly data document. That's the one that we've bee",1305,"Thanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone. Before I start some housekeeping, starting with this quarter, you'll see on our investor website 2 documents plus our earnings release. One is the supplemental quarterly data document. That's the one that we've been providing for over a decade. But you'll now see that it contains only historical reported and adjusted information. The other is a new document. It's called CFO commentary. It is this document that contains our forward-looking items. In other words, it summarizes both the commentary I typically provide in these calls, plus it has the corporate segment earnings forecast that were previously at the back of the supplement. We hope this CFO Commentary document makes it more investor friendly and easier to use rather than having to dig out my comments from the conference call transcripts and back pages of the soft one. 
Okay. Onto my comments, and like Pat said, an excellent quarter to end a terrific year. Yes, the quarter this -- the fourth quarter is a little noisy on the face, but all items are right in line with the forecast we gave you in our October earnings call, and then again, at our December Investor Meeting. 
Two additional items we didn't forecast back then. In the Brokerage segment, you'll see a $0.02 onetime tax item gain. That benefit results from the newly enacted lower statutory rates in the U.K. related to our net deferred tax obligations on our balance sheet related to our U.K. operations. 
The other item is in the corporate line of the Corporate segment in the tax column. We had a favorable tax item of about $4 million in the fourth quarter. We're a little conservative in our estimates in the first 3 quarters of 2015 when we estimated certain permitted items. So when we trued up those estimates in the fourth quarter, it added a couple pennies of gain in the fourth quarter, but it has no impact on full year. 
As for adjustments in 2016, when you digest the information on the new CFO commentary document, 2 items will stand out. First, you'll see FX in 2016 being half the headwind that we saw in 2015; and second, you'll see that we are forecasting integration costs in 2016 to be less than half of the 2015 levels. I'm really pleased that we're effectively done integrating the larger mergers like Bollinger, OAMPS, Crombie Lockwood and Noraxis, and by year-end 2016, we should be nearly done with Oval and Giles in the U.K. 
Now let's turn to Page 3 of the earnings release, to the Brokerage segment organic table. You'll see supplementals way up and contingents way down in the quarter. Ignore the geography, as we simply had a couple of contracts that had some slight language modification that is causing the flip between lines. Rather, I suggest that you look at supplementals and contingents in total, and you'll see we're up organically 10% in the quarter and up 8% organically for the full year. Based on current conditions, we expect in 2016 that these lines will organically grow better than the core commissions and fee line. 
At the bottom of that same Page 3, we also see that we used next to no stock this quarter to fund M&A, and you'll see at the bottom of the CFO commentary, first page, we don't anticipate using stock to fund M&A in 2016 either. I'll hit some cash flow comments more in a minute. 
On Pages 5 and 6 of the earnings release, you'll see that we had nice margin expansion in the Brokerage and Risk Management segment. In the CFO commentary, you'll see that we still believe margin expansion for the Brokerage segment is difficult if we don't have 3% organic growth. And you'll also see that we're moving up our Risk Management target in 2016 to 17% from our target of 16.5% in 2015. 
All right, let's move to Page 7 to the clean energy line on that page. I'm really pleased that we crossed the $100 million of net earnings mark this year, it's -- which is right -- which came in right at the midpoint of what we forecasted a year ago. That's really, really great work by the team. I also want to point out we've added some more convenient disclosure. 
On Page 12 of our earnings release, on the deferred tax asset line in our balance sheet, we've added a parenthetical disclosure showing that $342 million of our deferred tax asset relates to credits that we've generated but not yet deducted from our tax returns. Think about it this way. It is effectively a cash receivable from the government, as it will reduce our cash taxes paid in the future. I've said before, our goal is to pay about 10% of our global EBITDAC in taxes, and these credits are a big part of that strategy. 
Looking forward to 2016, you'll see on the second page of the CFO Commentary document that we're forecasting about a 15% step-up in earnings in 2016 for our clean energy investments. That's if we hit the midpoint of the range, about $116 million of net after-tax earnings. When we are preparing our 2016 estimates for clean energy, we work closely with our host utility partners and we assess the ever-present risks surrounding these investments, like -- things like fuel source, substitution. That's -- are they going to burn coal or natural gas? We looked at governmental, regulatory and IRS laws and policy changes. We looked at plant shutdowns during the year, both temporary and permanent. We looked at the location of the plants on the power grid utilization curve. We looked at our supply chain distribution, so on and so forth. 
In the end, as we sit today, we've digested these risks and we feel comfortable with our 2016 estimates. In addition, our 2016 estimate makes a provision for continued warm weather -- warm winter and then reverts to more of a normal spring, summer and fall. 
Finally, let me move to debt and free cash. First, free cash. We have about $275 million of free cash in the balance sheet. As I said last quarter, all of that is technically free cash, of that $275 million, but until we complete our integration efforts to consolidate legal entities in the U.K., about $100 million of that cash is hard to access because it is in hundreds of smaller bank accounts that need minimum balances. We have plans to free up that -- most of those balances over the course of 2016. 
Second, you'll see in the CFO Commentary that we're at about 2.5x debt-to-EBITDAC ratio. That was down substantially from around 2.9 to 3x at the end of 2014. We believe 2.5x is about the right level going forward. 
Third, you'll also see in the CFO commentary that we might go into the debt markets and raise another $200 million to $300 million. We might do that for several reasons: we can pay off the line, which is currently at about $200 million; we can use it for M&A, we have a strong pipeline; or we can use it to have cash on hand to repay the $300 million tranche, which carries a 6.44% interest rate and comes due next year; or we can do a combination of all 3.
So finally, let me pull it altogether. If you assume 2 point times debt, if you assume that we use no stock use in acquisitions earn-out, if you assume that we continue to do mergers at the 7.5 weighted average multiple, just like we did in 2015, we will have ample cash to fund our M&A program in 2016, similar to the level that we did in 2015. 
Okay, those are my comments. Back to you, Pat."

Other adjustments we have, though, I -- all of them are right in line with what we telegraphed in December on that. We had a noncash write-off related to a wholesaler down in Australia, the channel conflict that developed as a result of that. When we bought Wesfarmers, we had owned a wholesale; before that, when you buy a big retailer, it does cause some channel conflict there.

We think the margins of 17% still allow them to continue to build out their product offering. And the leverage on it is just the fact that this is still highly intensive people business. And when you get claims, you got to put adjusters on -- behind the desk in order to pay those claims.

I've been very -- I've been pleased and interested to find that over the last 5 years, I would say the PC market globally, and also very much in the United States, is really -- by and large have been flat. I mean, if you go back and look at the charts, starting in about 1970, this market was violently cyclical. You'd have times when rates were going up 30% and 40% and times when rates were falling 15% to 25%. Through the '90s, it was -- it seemed never-ending. Companies kept going broke and prices kept get getting cut. You get through 2001, you have a violent hard market. That softened substantially in '05, '06. But literally, since about '07, maybe '08, this marketplace has been pretty flat. And I would consider the present environment, which is about 4% off on general business to 10% off on large property schedules, essentially, with the exception of that property, 4% off is pretty close to flat when you're used to what I've seen cyclically. So I do predict that management of these carriers today has -- have better information. They absolutely understand lost cause inflation, and they're going to fight hard not to have a deterioration in their returns. So my view is that I think they'll find a way to get that back closer to flat because they need to make money in underwriting to have any kind of return."

The strengthening dollar certainly doesn't help exports, but it certainly does signify that we've got a pretty darn strong economy in the United States. When I look at Canada, anything that's exposed to energy or natural resources is down, but beyond that and beyond the knock-on effect, Canada seems to be pretty okay. New Zealand is strong. Australia is a bit weak, again, based on the economic impact of energy and natural resources, but not drastically so. And again, we're not exposed to those industries. So I kind of look around and go, where we're playing, we tend to be in a pretty good spot, and the United States seems like it's okay."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our fourth quarter and year-end conference call. We appreciate you being with us this morning. This morning, I'm joined by Doug Howell, our Chief Financial Officer, as well as the heads of our operating divisions.
Today, I'm going to comment on total company financial results, make some comments on our merger and acquisition program, and then I'll move into each segment's results and provide a bit of a wrap-up before Doug's comments -- after Doug's comments and -- about, really, an awesome recognition we received by J.D. Power and Associates, and then we'll get to your questions. 
We had a great quarter capping a great year. Total company, strong finish to an excellent 2015. Our combined Brokerage and Risk Management core operations in the fourth quarter posted 4.2% total organic growth, 10% total adjusted revenue growth, adjusted EBITDAC was up 12% and we expanded our adjusted margins by 46 basis points.
For the year, on a combined basis, we posted 5.1% total organic growth, that's 5.1%; 17% growth in total adjusted revenue, surpassing $4 billion in revenues; 22% growth in adjusted EBITDAC; and we expanded our adjusted margins by over 90 basis points. And to top it all off, we topped the $100 million of net earnings mark from our clean energy investments. That's up from less than $4 million in net earnings in 2011. What an amazing run, and we've got more of that to come in clean energy.
Let me move to some comments on our merger and acquisition program. We completed 15 mergers totaling $46 million of new annualized revenue in the fourth quarter. For the year, we did 44 mergers, 2 of which were in the Risk Management 
[Audio Gap]
segment, totaling about $230 million of new revenues. Let me break that down a bit. $195 
[End of Audio Gap]
million of that was in the United States, split half property/casualty and half employee benefits; $15 million was in Australia and New Zealand; $15 million in the U.K.; and about $5 million in Canada. That averages out to about $5 million in revenue per merger, and we paid a weighted average price to EBITDAC of 7.6x. As I do every quarter, I'd like to thank all of our new partners for joining us and extend a very warm welcome to our growing family.
Two further comments on mergers and acquisitions. First, since July 2014, when we did our last big deal, Noraxis in Canada, we've returned to our program of doing smaller tuck-in mergers, as we forecasted in every conference call and investor meeting since then. Further, for these mergers, we're still paying fair prices and only slightly more than what we were paying for smaller tuck-in deals prior to 2014, consistently in the 6.5 to 7.5 range. So when I look forward, I see a merger and acquisition program in 2016 as being very similar to the last 18 months. Our merger pipeline remains very strong, particularly in the United States, and we are also seeing good opportunities in Canada, New Zealand and Australia. With having platforms in those locations now and most of our integration efforts behind us, merger prospects now see Gallagher as a partner with vast capabilities, and they want to join us. Further, we do not have any large deals on our plate right now, neither domestic nor international, and based on our current pipeline, we do not see the need to use stock to fund mergers in 2016. 
And second and final comment on mergers. One of the first things we do when we complete a merger is to quickly collect and analyze their client and carrier data. Today, we have nearly all of our data from every client and carrier globally in one spot. We use this data to help our carrier partners develop better programs for our clients, and we use this data to help our clients match up with the right carrier based on their needs. This value-add to both our carriers and to our clients gives us the opportunity to enhance our compensation. We see tremendous opportunities for that in 2016 and beyond. 
Let me move now to the Brokerage segment. Brokerage fourth quarter results were very strong. Adjusted revenue's up 11%; 2.8% in total organic growth; adjusted EBITDAC is up 12%; and our adjusted margins expanded by 30 basis points. Brokerage results for the year were terrific. For full -- for the full year, adjusted revenues were up 19%; 3.6% total organic; adjusted EBITDAC, up 22%; and adjusted margins expanded 70 basis points. And in 2015, we posted adjusted EBITDAC margins of 26.1%. That's up over 400 basis points since the full year 2011, 4 full points of margin expansion. What a fantastic accomplishment, and it shows our Brokerage business is really, really healthy and vibrant. 
So let me drill down a bit into each of our Brokerage operations around the world. First, domestically in the United States, that's our retail property/casualty, our retail employee benefits consulting and our wholesale operations, which for the year combined for about $2.1 billion of our $3.3 billion of Brokerage segment revenues. In the fourth quarter, these units combined to post 3.5% organic and expanded their margins by about 80 basis points. For the year, they posted 3% organic growth and expanded margins by 120 basis points. These units all have annual adjusted margins in the very high 20s, about 28%, and each unit is nearing the upper end of our margin expectations. To put this into perspective, over a 4-year period, as I said just a moment ago, margins in these units are up over 400 basis points, which is really nice work. 
Looking towards 2016, we are seeing domestic retail and wholesale PC units having a slight rate headwind, on average, down about 5%; property off more like 10%, with casualty a little less than flat. But we are seeing increases in exposure units offsetting that a little bit, and we are also continuing to have nice new business growth and our retentions are holding. So we see 2016 a lot like 2015 in our domestic retail/wholesale PC units. 
As for our retail employee benefits business, we're seeing more activity in 2016. Our clients and prospects are now having to deal with the complexities of the ACA. Much of that happens in the second half of the year, but we still see organic better in 2016 than in 2015 in our benefits units. 
Next, our international operations. That's our PC brokerage operations in Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the U.K., which, for the year, they combined for a little over $1.2 billion of our $3.3 billion Brokerage segment revenues. Combined, they posted 4% organic growth for the full year and expanded margins by 50 basis points. In aggregate, they are posting mid-20s annual adjusted margins. 
I think it's worthwhile for me to touch on each country for just a moment, so I'll start with Canada. About $125 million of annualized revenues. Fourth quarter organic was in the mid-2% range. Margins are similar to our U.S. operations, in the very high 20s, so also near the top of our margin expectations. When I look at our January 1 renewals, rates are fairly stable to even slightly a bit positive. As for exposures, while we are not really significantly exposed to energy risks, the broader Canadian economy is suffering because the knock-on effect of those businesses relying on the energy sector. But despite all this, the team is in the final push of integration efforts to convert to our systems, and they haven't missed a step, so I see a similar 2016. 
Next, moving to Australia and New Zealand. About $265 million of annualized revenue. Fourth quarter organic was near 2%. Of the 2 units, New Zealand performs better in terms of organic and margins, which is in line with what we saw when we did the acquisition in 2014. Both countries have been faced for several years with soft renewal rates, especially in property, and their economies are weak but starting to show a bit of recovery with their weaker currencies. In addition, our January 1 renewals are starting to show a bottoming of the cycle. Both New Zealand and Australia are effectively finished with their integration efforts. It's important to note, in aggregate, margins are nicely in the very high 20s, which is a touch better than what we expected when we purchased them in mid-2014.  So while we do have some modest opportunity for margin efficiencies in Australia, in 2016, our real focus is to energize the sales culture in Australia. I was there in the fall, and I can tell you, the Australian team is working with their counterparts in the U.S. and New Zealand to build a similar sales and service culture. 
Finally, let me move to the U.K. About $775 million of annualized revenues. $360 million of that is retail property/casualty, that's our branch network; $325 million is London and Bermuda specialty; and about $90 million is underwriting and programs. Altogether, about 1% organic growth in the fourth quarter and a little over 3% for the full year. Aggregate margins are a little bit over 20%. 
And so let me make a couple of comments on the 3 units. U.K. retail, we posted flat organic in the quarter and full year 2015, and margins are in the very high teens. We're seeing rates flat to slightly down, and we're not seeing much growth and exposures due to the stable economic conditions in the U.K. But posting flat organic is actually quite an accomplishment, given it is this unit that's going through most of the integration work that's remaining from our larger deals. Remember, we are pushing 4 different retail organizations together, and we've become a top 5 retailer in the U.K. in just 2 years' time. These retail branches are going through the similar processes that we did in the U.S. over the last 5 years. Those are standardization, simplification, using common technologies, migrating work to our offshore centers of excellence, using our niches in adopting the Gallagher sales culture and learning our retail playbook. 2016 will be the year where we evolve from a unit going through integration to a unit focused on harvesting synergies and executing on our sales and service plans. Accordingly, we should see a little margin improvement in 2016, and then hopefully, much more in '17. 
U.K. underwriting. Underwriting program is about $90 million in revenues, about 10% margins, which is similar to prior years. Organic growth was flat for the year, but our efforts to improve this business showed promise in the fourth quarter, and we posted over 5% organic growth. This is a collection of underwriting businesses, many of which came with the retail acquisitions of Heath, Giles and Oval. We have reconstituted management, and these businesses have a line of sight towards improvement in 2016 and 2017. 
London and Bermuda specialty, about $325 million in revenue. For the year, these units posted over 5% organic growth, but it was closer to 1% in the fourth quarter. We're seeing some pressure on rates in most lines, and in particular, in the Energy and Marine lines written by our London specialty units. Margins are in the lower mid-20s, which is really respectable, given the nature and complexity of this business. 
This is the unit that also has about $30 million in revenues from smaller and emerging markets. That breaks down to about 1/3 in the Caribbean, 1/3 in Norway and 1/3 in South America, which posts similar margins. Clearly, none of these smaller units is financially significant, but we did these mergers because they have specialties that align well and trade with our U.K. and Bermuda specialty businesses. 
So to recap our Brokerage segment. In 2016, while we see retail PC rates as a headwind, we do see PC exposure growth offsetting this partially. We also see employment growth and complexity surrounding the Affordable Care Act as tailwinds for our employee benefits units. In addition, our history of strong new business generation, solid retention and enhanced value-added services for our carrier partners should all result in further organic growth opportunities around the world. Integration efforts related to our larger mergers we did in the U.S, Australia, New Zealand and Canada are effectively done, and we expect our integration efforts in the U.K. to be nearly done by the end of 2016. Integration costs in 2016 should be less than half of our 2015 amounts. Margins are excellent in most of our units around the world, with some further opportunities for efficiencies in Australia and our U.K. retail and underwriting businesses. 
So let me move to our Risk Management segment, essentially, Gallagher Bassett Services. Risk Management finished the year with an outstanding fourth quarter. Adjusted organic growth of 10.5%; adjusted EBITDAC grew 17%; and margins improved 140 basis points. For the full year, we posted over 11% organic growth, 18% growth in EBITDAC, surpassed 17% of adjusted margins, and we expanded margins by 120 basis points. 
Gallagher Bassett is now over $700 million of annual revenue. And since we embarked on our retooling efforts 5 years ago, it has shown consistent, excellent, top and bottom line results, and we see it continuing to gain momentum. In fact, 2015 was the third year in a row where we posted around 10% organic growth and also hit or exceeded our annual margin targets, up nearly 2 full margin points since 2011. 17% EBITDAC margin is our 2016 margin target and near the top of our expectations. Our U.S. Claims Management business is about $575 million in annualized revenues and posted especially strong double-digit organic growth for the quarter and full year margins, as I said earlier, of around 17%. 
We have been successful in developing new and improved services for our clients. Following last quarter's introduction of Luminos, which is Gallagher Bassett's acclaimed risk management information system for clients, we rolled out GBGO, the first of a suite of mobile technology products designed specifically for use on smartphones and tablet devices. In addition, new medical management products and approaches, together with broader adoption of GB products by clients, has led to improved claim outcomes, as well as increased revenue for Gallagher Bassett. 
Strong performance in state-administered workers' compensation schemes in Australia pushed Gallagher Bassett's operations to well over $130 million in revenue in 2015, or roughly 20% of the segment's revenue, also posting organic growth of about 10%. GB's international operations are expected to make a strong contribution again in 2016, with investments in our self-insured and carrier segments scheduled to come online later this year. 
So really, truly a remarkable year on all measures, which is a testament to an incredibly strong sales and service culture. These results don't just happen. Our team gets up every day and works relentlessly to service our clients and to aggressively demonstrate our capabilities to new prospects. A great quarter, a great year. I couldn't be prouder of our colleagues' efforts and what we've accomplished. 
Over to you, Doug."

Before I start some housekeeping, starting with this quarter, you'll see on our investor website 2 documents plus our earnings release. One is the supplemental quarterly data document. That's the one that we've bee",1305,"Thanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone. Before I start some housekeeping, starting with this quarter, you'll see on our investor website 2 documents plus our earnings release. One is the supplemental quarterly data document. That's the one that we've been providing for over a decade. But you'll now see that it contains only historical reported and adjusted information. The other is a new document. It's called CFO commentary. It is this document that contains our forward-looking items. In other words, it summarizes both the commentary I typically provide in these calls, plus it has the corporate segment earnings forecast that were previously at the back of the supplement. We hope this CFO Commentary document makes it more investor friendly and easier to use rather than having to dig out my comments from the conference call transcripts and back pages of the supplement. 
Okay. Onto my comments, and like Pat said, an excellent quarter to end a terrific year. Yes, the quarter this -- the fourth quarter is a little noisy on the face, but all items are right in line with the forecast we gave you in our October earnings call, and then again, at our December Investor Meeting. 
Two additional items we didn't forecast back then. In the Brokerage segment, you'll see a $0.02 onetime tax item gain. That benefit results from the newly enacted lower statutory rates in the U.K. related to our net deferred tax obligations on our balance sheet related to our U.K. operations. 
The other item is in the corporate line of the Corporate segment in the tax column. We had a favorable tax item of about $4 million in the fourth quarter. We were a little conservative in our estimates in the first 3 quarters of 2015 when we estimated certain permitted items. So when we trued up those estimates in the fourth quarter, it added a couple pennies of gain in the fourth quarter, but it has no impact on full year. 
As for adjustments in 2016, when you digest the information in the new CFO commentary document, 2 items will stand out. First, you'll see FX in 2016 being half the headwind that we saw in 2015; and second, you'll see that we are forecasting integration costs in 2016 to be less than half of the 2015 levels. I'm really pleased that we're effectively done integrating the larger mergers like Bollinger, OAMPS, Crombie Lockwood and Noraxis, and by year-end 2016, we should be nearly done with Oval and Giles in the U.K. 
Now let's turn to Page 3 of the earnings release, to the Brokerage segment organic table. You'll see supplementals way up and contingents way down in the quarter. Ignore the geography, as we simply had a couple of contracts that had some slight language modification that is causing the flip between lines. Rather, I suggest that you look at supplementals and contingents in total, and you'll see we're up organically 10% in the quarter and up 8% organically for the full year. Based on current conditions, we expect in 2016 that these lines will organically grow better than the core commissions and fee line. 
At the bottom of that same Page 3, we also see that we used next to no stock this quarter to fund M&A, and you'll see at the bottom of the CFO commentary, first page, we don't anticipate using stock to fund M&A in 2016 either. I'll hit some cash flow comments more in a minute. 
On Pages 5 and 6 of the earnings release, you'll see that we had nice margin expansion in the Brokerage and Risk Management segment. In the CFO commentary, you'll see that we still believe margin expansion for the Brokerage segment is difficult if we don't have 3% organic growth. And you'll also see that we're moving up our Risk Management target in 2016 to 17% from our target of 16.5% in 2015. 
All right, let's move to Page 7 to the clean energy line on that page. I'm really pleased that we crossed the $100 million of net earnings mark this year, it's -- which is right -- which came in right at the midpoint of what we forecasted a year ago. That's really, really great work by the team. I also want to point out we've added some more convenient disclosure. 
On Page 12 of our earnings release, on the deferred tax asset line in our balance sheet, we've added a parenthetical disclosure showing that $342 million of our deferred tax asset relates to credits that we've generated but not yet deducted from our tax returns. Think about it this way. It is effectively a cash receivable from the government, as it will reduce our cash taxes paid in the future. I've said before, our goal is to pay about 10% of our global EBITDAC in taxes, and these credits are a big part of that strategy. 
Looking forward to 2016, you'll see on the second page of the CFO Commentary document that we're forecasting about a 15% step-up in earnings in 2016 for our clean energy investments. That's if we hit the midpoint of the range, about $116 million of net after-tax earnings. When we were preparing our 2016 estimates for clean energy, we work closely with our host utility partners and we assess the ever-present risks surrounding these investments, like -- things like fuel source, substitution. That's -- are they going to burn coal or natural gas? We looked at governmental, regulatory and IRS laws and policy changes. We looked at plant shutdowns during the year, both temporary and permanent. We looked at the location of the plants on the power grid utilization curve. We looked at our supply chain distribution, so on and so forth. 
In the end, as we sit today, we've digested these risks and we feel comfortable with our 2016 estimates. In addition, our 2016 estimate makes a provision for continued warm weather -- warm winter and then reverts to more of a normal spring, summer and fall. 
Finally, let me move to debt and free cash. First, free cash. We have about $275 million of free cash in the balance sheet. As I said last quarter, all of that is technically free cash, of that $275 million, but until we complete our integration efforts to consolidate legal entities in the U.K., about $100 million of that cash is hard to access because it is in hundreds of smaller bank accounts that need minimum balances. We have plans to free up that -- most of those balances over the course of 2016. 
Second, you'll see in the CFO Commentary that we're at about 2.5x debt-to-EBITDAC ratio. That was down substantially from around 2.9 to 3x at the end of 2014. We believe 2.5x is about the right level going forward. 
Third, you'll also see in the CFO commentary that we might go into the debt markets and raise another $200 million to $300 million. We might do that for several reasons: we can pay off the line, which is currently at about $200 million; we can use it for M&A, we have a strong pipeline; or we can use it to have cash on hand to repay the $300 million tranche, which carries a 6.44% interest rate and comes due next year; or we can do a combination of all 3.
So finally, let me pull it altogether. If you assume 2 point times debt, if you assume that we use no stock used in acquisitions or earn-out, if you assume that we continue to do mergers at the 7.5 weighted average multiple, just like we did in 2015, we will have ample cash to fund our M&A program in 2016, similar to levels that we did in 2015. 
Okay, those are my comments. Back to you, Pat."

We see it in our successful integration efforts, we see it in our branding efforts around the world, and we see it in our service to our clients. In December, J.D. Power announced that Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. ranks as the highest in customer satisfaction among brokers for large commercial insurance. This is on top of the fact that earlier in the year, we were recognized as one of the world's most ethical companies by the Ethisphere Institute for the fourth straight year.

Over the last couple of years, we've priced an extra $50 million in the U.K. to put together the 4 different retailers that we basically have bought to become the top 5 broker there. So that's the problem. If you look back over the last couple of years, that's the difference in the spend there. Other adjustments we had, though, like -- all of them are right in line with what we telegraphed in December on that. We had a noncash write-off related to a wholesaler down in Australia, the channel conflict that developed as a result of that. When we bought Wesfarmers, we had owned a wholesaler; before that, when you buy a big retailer, it does cause some channel conflict there. So we had a noncash writeoff there that, I don't know, cost us about $0.09, something like that. Other than that, most of them are coming in right where we expect them to come in."

If the market goes in the tank, like it did in [indiscernible] , our organic's going to suffer. If the market tightens, and let's face it, there's some controversy out there right now. You've got a little bit of firming going on in places like Australia and New Zealand, got a little bit of controversy with some of our larger trading partners that are having some management issues, and there's some renewed discipline around that. If you get a harder market, 2001 and 2002, significant double-digit organic. So the market makes a huge difference.

I've been very -- I've been pleased and interested to find that over the last 5 years, I would say the PC market globally, and also very much in the United States, is really -- by and large been flat. I mean, if you go back and look at the charts, starting in about 1970, this market was violently cyclical. You'd have times when rates were going up 30% and 40% and times when rates were falling 15% to 25%. Through the '90s, it was -- it seemed never-ending. Companies kept going broke and prices kept get getting cut. You get through 2001, you have a violent hard market. That softened substantially in '05, '06. But literally, since about '07, maybe '08, this marketplace has been pretty flat. And I would consider the present environment, which is about 4% off on general business to 10% off on large property schedules, essentially, with the exception of that property, 4% off is pretty close to flat when you're used to what I've seen cyclically. So I do predict that management of these carriers today has -- have better information. They absolutely understand loss cost inflation, and they're going to fight hard not to have a deterioration in their returns. So my view is that I think they'll find a way to get that back closer to flat because they need to make money in underwriting to have any kind of return."

With me this morning is Doug Howell, our Chief Financial Officer; as well as the heads of our operating divisions. 
There are 4 key components to creating long-term value for Gallagher shareholders. Number one, we need to grow organically. Number two, we need to growth through mergers and acquisitions. Three, we improve our quality and our productivity every quarter. And number 4, we have to work hard to maintain a very unique culture. 
We excelled on each and every one of those this quarter. All in, we grew 4.8% organically in our combined Brokerage and Risk Management operations. We had another 6% of growth through net acquisitions for total adjusted revenue growth of 11%. Our quality was recently recognized by J.D. Power and Associates as ranking the highest in customer satisfaction among brokers in the large commercial insurance space. We became more productive with adjusted EBITDAC growth of 15% and we expanded our adjusted margins by nearly 4 percentage points. And our culture was recognized by the Ethisphere Institute as one of the world's most ethical companies for the fifth straight year. Simply put, an outstanding quarter on each component of our strategy. 
So let me spend a little more time on growth, both organic and acquisitions, and what we are seeing in terms of insurance pricing. Doug will then go into greater detail on margins, clean energy and capital management. 
First, in our Brokerage segment, let me talk about organic revenue growth. All in, organic was 4.8%. Excluding contingents, which are seasonally strongest in the first quarter, organic was 4.2%. This is similar to the first quarter of 2015 and up about 1 point relative to the fourth quarter of 2015. About half of this improvement is attributable to stronger new business and about half was due to less drag from rate and exposure. 
Focusing now on our domestic brokerage operations, which include our retail PC Brokerage, retail employee benefits consulting and our wholesale brokerage operations. These units account for about 2/3 of our Brokerage segment revenue. 
Domestically, organic revenue growth was about 4.5%. Of that, retail PC was over 5%; benefits at 4%; and wholesale at a little over 2%. Wholesale is feeling some impact from weaker property rates. 
Commercial PC rates are still down, but they are a manageable headwind and our exposure units are growing a bit. In our employee benefits consulting business, a tight multigenerational labor market combined with rising cost of health care, especially pharmacy costs, along with increased regulations for employers such as the ACA, are creating more new business opportunities. 
In the first quarter, the renewal impact from rate and exposure units has about 0.5 percentage negative impact on our organic growth domestically. So no real change from the past few quarters. I just came back from the conference in San Diego, and the tone from carriers seem to be similar to what we have been hearing for the past 3 quarters, some continued weakness in property. But otherwise, pretty consistent conditions. 
Moving to our international Brokerage operations, that's principally our PC operations in Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the U.K., which combined, represent about 1/3 of our Brokerage segment revenues. Organic revenue growth was about 5% within our international operations. U.K. retail posted about 3% organic and a relatively flat rate and exposure environment. London and Bermuda specially posted about 5% organic in a difficult rate and exposure environment. Australia and New Zealand had a little negative tiding. Otherwise, organic was flat, also in a difficult rate and exposure environment but we're starting to see pricing bottom out in Australia and New Zealand. And Canada posted 6% organic in a flat rate and moderately down economic environment. 
So when you look at our larger international mergers that we did in 2014, they're all doing very well. Integration is done in Australia and New Zealand, nearly done in Canada and should be mostly done in the U.K. by the end of the year. 
Let me turn to merger and acquisition growth. Over the past 20 months, we return to our almost exclusive focus on smaller tuck-in mergers. Today's competitive environment for mergers is similar to last 2 to 3 years, and a lot like most of the early 2000s for that matter. But what we're maintaining our pricing discipline, with weighted average valuations at about 7x EBITDAC for the 8 mergers we did here in the first quarter. We can pay these valuations because the merger partners that choose us see the long-term value in joining Gallagher. They see our vast capabilities, they see our proven track record, they embody our culture and they see themselves being more successful as part of us. 
As I do every quarter, I would like to thank all of our new partners for joining us and extend a very warm welcome to our growing family. 
So to wrap up our Brokerage segment, we posted first quarter results of 4%, 4.8% total organic growth. Total adjusted revenue growth was 12%, adjusted EBITDAC is up 16%, and our adjusted margins expanded by 79 basis points, a really, really strong quarter for our Brokerage segment. 
Let me move to our Risk Management segment, which is primarily Gallagher Bassett Services. Risk Management started the year with a good first quarter. Adjusted organic revenue growth was 4.7%. Adjusted EBITDAC grew 9%, and adjusted margins improved by 103 basis points to 17.6%. Gallagher Bassett continues to deliver consistent, attractive top and bottom line results for shareholders. GB's domestic plans management business delivered 6% organic growth in the first quarter, while international operations were closer to flat, excluding last year's run off fees. At 17.6% EBITDAC margin, we outpaced our margin target of 17%, while continuing to make investments that will drive future growth. 
I spent some time at the Gallagher Bassett booth and I was able to see firsthand how we are positioning ourselves in the marketplace. We have an amazing offering to provide clients. GB, in my opinion, is simply the best. Some of the recent innovations include Waypoint, our suite of decision support tools based on cutting-edge machine learning technology; Luminos, our acclaimed Risk Management information system; and our new GBGO, a mobile application to enhance communication and engagement with injured workers. All these innovations will continue to improve claim outcomes for clients and bring additional revenue to Gallagher Bassett. 
And I don't want to forget to mention our clean energy efforts, another solid quarter still on track to post 15% growth in annual after-tax earnings relative to 2015. So it's a great start to the year. I'm glad to have the first quarter in the books and we really are hitting on all cylinders. Over to you, Doug."

Like I said, it's nice to have a terrific first quarter under our belt. I'll make some comments on margins, corporate and clean energy, cash and capital management, and then highlight a couple of things in our investor supplement and CFO commentary documents that we posted on our IR website. 
Okay, first, to margins. Brokerage was up 79 basis points and Risk Management was up 103 basis points, really, really excellent work by the team. What then broke the Brokerage segment, adjusted margin expansion was about equal between our domestic and international operation. Domestic was up 75 basis points. International was up 90 basis points. And recall, our domestic units are running the annualized margins in the high 20s, so to expand here in the first quarter shows excellent discipline. 
Internationally, our Canadian, New Zealand and London and Bermuda specialty units are also posting margins nicely in the 20s. Yet we do have some opportunity to further improve margins in our Australia and U.K. retail units over the next 18 to 24 months. 
In terms of integration, the U.K. team is doing excellent work, and we remain on track to be nearly finished with integration by the end of this year. Integration costs for the first quarter right on our forecast, and we still expect 2016 integration charges to be about half the 2015 level. 
As for Risk Management segment, we exceeded our 17% margin target during the quarter and we still think 17% is a good margin to expect for the next 3 quarters. 
Moving to the Corporate segment. We landed a bit above the high end of the range we provided during our last earnings release, mostly due to clean energy. Most of that was timing. When you look at Page 4 of the CFO commentary document, you'll see the timing between the quarters, yet our full year is effectively unchanged from what we previously provided. So for the year, we are still estimating between $109 million and $124 million of net earnings from our clean energy investments. 
Okay, let's move to cash and capital management. Our first quarter is seasonally our smallest cash generation quarter, yet at the end of the first quarter, we had about $250 million of free cash on our balance sheet. We are working on freeing up about half of it as part of our integration efforts in the U.K. and the other half is in Australia, New Zealand and Canada that we'll use for M&A, merger and acquisition opportunities, in those geographies. 
We also announced a few weeks ago that we renewed and upsized our line of credit facility to $800 million, and we anticipate closing a $275 million debt private placement in early June. 
Our debt-to-EBITDA ratio in March 31 was about 2.6x on a covenant basis, and we're targeting a similar level at the end of 2016. We believe free cash -- we believe between free cash and debt, we can fund our M&A program in 2016, similar to the levels we completed in 2015 with no net shares used. And just to clarify, when I say no net shares used, there will be tax-free reorg mergers that require us to use stock, but we intend to offset that through buybacks, just like we did in the first quarter. 
All right, couple of items on housekeeping. First, please don't forget that our first quarter is seasonally our smallest in the Brokerage segment. Please use the document in our web -- IR website called Supplemental Quarterly Financial Information. We give you 5 years of both reported and adjusted results on a quarterly basis. From that historical information, you can easily see our seasonality. 
Second, we also provide a CFO commentary document on our website that has a lot of forward-looking information that should help you build your models. You'll see that items for the first quarter are in line with the forecast we gave you during our last earnings call. Some looking forward you'll see on that document. Fx headwinds are mostly behind us, integration is tapering off. And this is also now where we're providing all of the guidance related to our clean energy investments that used to be in our earnings release.
So a terrific quarter on all measures, and in the end, we're really well positioned for the remainder of the year. Back to you, Pat."

And the reason why is that as we look at some larger accounts, they typically will in January 1 or July 1 and there are some times where they -- we get them in the pipeline, that's in 2015, helping that they on January 1, but switching over to us can take some time. So we see more new business in July 1 this year, then let's say, maybe in the past we're incepted on January 1. So it's a little bit of a step function type business.

First, when it comes to the bankruptcies, most of those were in the coal mines go bankrupt, it's usually a holding bankruptcy but the are still operating because they have contracts that they have to continue to deliver coal on. And a lot of these utilities have had required to take contracts. So the coal is still moving even to the holding company might be bankrupt anything there's been 5 of them in the last years as they restructure and make themselves more efficient. Second of all, the power plants, as you recall, and when we put our clean energy plants in another power plant, we put them earlier in the dispatch curve, so when we do our plans, these are plans that are more likely to run unless they are less efficient plants that only get dispatched during high peak loads. We are at the mercy of whether. We did have a little bit of a warmer winter that did impact us a little bit. But we still see that we're on track. This program runs through 2021, so long-term displacement of coal to other fuels. It takes a long time to displace some plant. This program goes to just really for another 5 years. And the amount that's displacement that happened over the last 8 years probably is not likely to replete displays to natural gas in the plants that they could, and they really can't move these plans to natural gas that we're operating on efficiently and effectively over the next 5 years. So in summary, I was going to say that I think that we're still well positioned. i still see us having 15% growth in our net earnings this year. we still have other plants that we're working on putting in place that should continue to expand our earnings as you look into the future. So overall, I would say it's a steady state business."

Because we had a stronger first quarter that, that caused us to recognize a little bit more when you had more organic growth, you have more earnings and therefore, you recognize a little more tax credits, so that's the first one. Longer term, i think even we talked about the end of this program to generate credits being expiring in 2021, our plan is to hit the end of 2021 with a long glide path of having a balance sheet with a substantial amount of credits in it that can continue to reduce our tax rate well into the 2020s. So even though generation phase may be over, in 2021, the actually utilization of credits should go on. I think right now, we have about $375 million that's in our balance sheet right now. We're using about $100 million a year. I'd like to have a 5 or 7-year balance sheet at a time we hit that point. So I think that -- no, what do we have as opportunities after the we thought at the end of section 29, which was the precursor to section 45 credits that we were done. There's something else that the government does in order to foster tax credits. because the government really understands that better energy is a good policy. And therefore, they want to commercial enterprises to go out and develop new technologies to better the environment. So I think there could be another program after 2021 but we've got 5 years to work on that. In terms of our cash generation, look at this as well into the 20s."

With me this morning is Doug Howell, our Chief Financial Officer; as well as the heads of our operating divisions. 
There are 4 key components to creating long-term value for Gallagher's shareholders. Number one, we need to grow organically. Number two, we need to grow through mergers and acquisitions. Three, we improve our quality and our productivity every quarter. And number four, we have to work hard to maintain a very unique culture.
We excelled on each and every one of those this quarter. All in, we grew 4.8% organically in our combined Brokerage and Risk Management operations. We had another 6% of growth through net acquisitions for total adjusted revenue growth of 11%. Our quality was recently recognized by J.D. Power and Associates as ranking the highest in customer satisfaction among brokers in the large commercial insurance space. We became more productive with adjusted EBITDAC growth of 15% and we expanded our adjusted margins by nearly 4 percentage points. And our culture was recognized by the Ethisphere Institute as one of the world's most ethical companies for the fifth straight year. Simply put, an outstanding quarter on each component of our strategy. 
So let me spend a little more time on growth, both organic and acquisitions, and what we are seeing in terms of insurance pricing. Doug will then go into greater detail on margins, clean energy and capital management. 
First, in our Brokerage segment, let me talk about organic revenue growth. All in, organic was 4.8%. Excluding contingents, which are seasonally strongest in the first quarter, organic was 4.2%. This is similar to the first quarter of 2015 and up about a point relative to the fourth quarter of 2015. About half of this improvement is attributable to stronger new business and about half was due to less drag from rate and exposure. 
Focusing now on our domestic brokerage operations, which include our retail PC brokerage, retail employee benefits consulting and our wholesale brokerage operations. These units account for about 2/3 of our Brokerage segment revenue. 
Domestically, organic revenue growth was about 4.5%. Of that, retail PC was over 5%; benefits at 4%; and wholesale at a little over 2%. Wholesale is feeling some impact from weaker property rates.
Commercial PC rates are still down, but they are a manageable headwind and our exposure units are growing a bit. In our employee benefits consulting business, a tight multigenerational labor market, combined with rising cost of health care, especially pharmacy costs, along with increased regulations for employers such as the ACA, are creating more new business opportunities. 
In the first quarter, the renewal impact from rate and exposure units had about 0.5 percentage negative impact on our organic growth domestically. So no real change from the past few quarters. I just came back from the RIMS Conference in San Diego, and the tone from carriers seem to be similar to what we have been hearing for the past 3 quarters, some continued weakness in property, but otherwise, pretty consistent conditions.
Moving to our international brokerage operations, that's principally our PC operations in Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the U.K., which combined, represent about 1/3 of our Brokerage segment revenues. Organic revenue growth was about 5% within our international operations. U.K. retail posted about 3% organic and a relatively flat rate and exposure environment. London and Bermuda, especially, posted about 5% organic in a difficult rate and exposure environment. Australia and New Zealand had a little negative tiding. Otherwise, organic was flat, also in a difficult rate and exposure environment, but we're starting to see pricing bottom out in Australia and New Zealand. And Canada posted 6% organic in a flat rate and moderately down economic environment.
So when you look at our larger international mergers that we did in 2014, they're all doing very well. Integration is done in Australia and New Zealand, nearly done in Canada and should be mostly done in the U.K. by the end of the year. 
Let me turn to merger and acquisition growth. Over the past 20 months, we return to our almost exclusive focus on smaller tuck-in mergers. Today's competitive environment for mergers is similar to the last 2 to 3 years, and a lot like most of the early 2000s, for that matter. But we're maintaining our pricing discipline, with weighted average valuations at about 7x EBITDAC for the 8 mergers we did here in the first quarter. We can pay these valuations because the merger partners that choose us see the long-term value in joining Gallagher. They see our vast capabilities, they see our proven track record, they embody our culture and they see themselves being more successful as part of us. 
As I do every quarter, I would like to thank all of our new partners for joining us and extend a very warm welcome to our growing family. 
So to wrap up our Brokerage segment, we posted first quarter results of 4%, 4.8% total organic growth. Total adjusted revenue growth was 12%, adjusted EBITDAC is up 16%, and our adjusted margins expanded by 79 basis points, a really, really strong quarter for our Brokerage segment.
Let me move to our Risk Management segment, which is primarily Gallagher Bassett Services. Risk Management started the year with a good first quarter. Adjusted organic revenue growth was 4.7%. Adjusted EBITDAC grew 9% and adjusted margins improved by 103 basis points to 17.6%. Gallagher Bassett continues to deliver consistent, attractive top and bottom line results for shareholders. GB's domestic claims management business delivered 6% organic growth in the first quarter, while international operations were closer to flat, excluding last year's run-off fees. At 17.6% EBITDAC margin, we outpaced our margin target of 17%, while continuing to make investments that will drive future growth.
I spent some time at the Gallagher Bassett booth at RIMS, and I was able to see firsthand how we are positioning ourselves in the marketplace. We have an amazing offering to provide clients. GB, in my opinion, is simply the best. Some of the recent innovations include Waypoint, our suite of decision support tools based on cutting-edge machine learning technology; Luminos, our acclaimed Risk Management information system; and our new GBGO, a mobile application to enhance communication and engagement with injured workers. All these innovations will continue to improve claim outcomes for clients and bring additional revenue to Gallagher Bassett. 
And I don't want to forget to mention our clean energy efforts, another solid quarter still on track to post 15% growth in annual after-tax earnings relative to 2015. So it's a great start to the year. I'm glad to have the first quarter in the books and we really are hitting on all cylinders. Over to you, Doug."

Like he said, it's nice to have a terrific first quarter under our belt. I'll make some comments on margins, corporate and clean energy, cash and capital management, and then highlight a couple of things in our investor supplement and CFO commentary documents that we posted on our IR website. 
Okay, first, to margins. Brokerage was up 79 basis points and Risk Management was up 103 basis points, really, really excellent work by the team. Within the Brokerage segment, adjusted margin expansion was about equal between our domestic and international operation. Domestic was up 75 basis points, International was up 90 basis points. And recall, our domestic units are running annualized margins in the high 20s, so to expand here in the first quarter shows excellent discipline. 
Internationally, our Canadian, New Zealand and London and Bermuda specialty units are also posting margins nicely in the 20s. Yet we do have some opportunity to further improve margins in our Australia and U.K. retail units over the next 18 to 24 months.
In terms of integration, the U.K. team is doing excellent work, and we remain on track to be nearly finished with the integration by the end of this year. Integration costs for the first quarter were right on our forecast, and we still expect 2016 integration charges to be about half the 2015 level.
As for Risk Management segment, we exceeded our 17% margin target during the quarter and we still think 17% is a good margin to expect for the next 3 quarters.
Moving to the Corporate segment. We landed a bit above the high end of the range we provided during our last earnings release, mostly due to clean energy. Most of that was timing. When you look at Page 4 of the CFO commentary document, you'll see the timing between the quarters that our full year is effectively unchanged from what we've previously provided. So for the year, we are still estimating between $109 million and $124 million of net earnings from our clean energy investments.
Okay, to cash -- let's move to cash and capital management. Our first quarter is seasonally our smallest cash generation quarter, yet at the end of the first quarter, we had about $250 million of free cash on our balance sheet. We are working on freeing up about half of it as part of our integration efforts in the U.K. and the other half is in Australia, New Zealand and Canada that we'll use for M&A, merger and acquisition opportunities, in those geographies. 
We also announced a few weeks ago that we renewed and upsized our line of credit facility to $800 million, and we anticipate closing a $275 million debt private placement in early June. 
Our debt-to-EBITDA ratio on March 31 was about 2.6x on a covenant basis, and we're targeting a similar level at the end of 2016. We believe free cash and -- we believe between free cash and debt, we can fund our M&A program in 2016, similar to the levels we completed in 2015, with no net shares used. And just to clarify, when I say no net shares used, there will be tax-free reorg mergers that require us to use stock, but we intend to offset that through buybacks, just like we did in the first quarter. 
All right, a couple of items on housekeeping. First, please don't forget that our first quarter is seasonally our smallest in the Brokerage segment. Please use the document in our web -- IR website called Supplemental Quarterly Financial Information. We give you 5 years of both reported and adjusted results on a quarterly basis. From that historical information, you can easily see our seasonality.
Second, we also provide a CFO commentary document on our website that has a lot of forward-looking information that should help you build your models. You'll see that items for the first quarter are in line with the forecast we gave you during our last earnings call. 
Some soundbites looking forward that you'll see on that document. FX headwinds are mostly behind us, integration is tapering off, and this is also now where we're providing all of the guidance related to our clean energy investments that used to be in our earnings release.
So a terrific quarter on all measures and we're -- and in the end, we're really well positioned for the remainder of the year. Back to you, Pat."

And the reason why is that as we look at some larger accounts, they typically will incept on January 1 or on July 1. And there are some times where they -- we get them in the pipeline, let's say, in 2015, hoping that they incept on January 1. But switching over to us can take some time. So we see more new business incepting July 1 this year, than let's say, maybe in the past, where it incepted on January 1. So it's a little bit of a step function type business.

First, when it comes to the bankruptcies, most of those -- when the coal mines go bankrupt, it's usually a holding bankruptcy, but the mines are still operating because they have contracts that they have to continue to deliver coal on. And a lot of these utilities have had -- required to take contracts, so the coal is still moving even though the holding company might be bankrupt. And I think there's been 5 of them in the last year or so as they restructure and make themselves more efficient. Second of all, the power plants, as you recall, and when we put up our clean energy plants in another power plant, we put them earlier in a dispatch curve. So when we do our plants, these are plants that are more likely to run unless they have less efficient plants that only get dispatched during high peak loads. We are at the mercy of weather. We did have a little bit of a warmer winter that did impact us a little bit. But we still see that we're on track. This program runs through 2021, so long-term displacement of coal to other fuels. It takes a long time to displace some plant, and this program goes to just really for another 5 years. And truthfully, the amount of displacement that's happened over the last 8 years probably is not likely to repeat because they displace to natural gas and the plants that they could -- and they really can't move these plans to natural gas that we're operating on efficiently and effectively in the next 5 years. So in summary, I was going to say that I think that we're still well positioned. I still see us having 15% growth in our net earnings this year. We still have other plants that we're working on putting in place that should continue to expand our earnings as you look into the future. So overall, I would say it's a steady state business."

But when you take a look at workers' compensation, depending on the geography, the state, what have you, when it needs to go up, it goes up a bit, when it needs to come down, it comes down a bit. D&O, same sort of things. So what we're seeing is many cycles within the lines of coverage based on what really needs to happen to those lines.

Longer term, I think that even though we talk about the end of this program to generate credits being -- expiring in 2021, our plan is to hit the end of 2021 with a long glide ratio -- or glide path of having a balance sheet with a substantial amount of credits in it that can continue to reduce our tax rate well into the 2020s. So even though the generation phase may be over in 2021, the actually utilization of credits should go on. I think right now, we have about $375 million that's in our balance sheet right now. We're using about $100 million a year. I'd like to have a 5- or 6-, 7-year balance sheet by the time we hit that point. So I think that, that -- now what do we have as opportunities after the fact? Listen, we thought at the end of Section 29, which was the precursor to Section 45 credits that we were done, there's something else that the government does in order to foster tax credits. Because the government really understands that better energy is a good policy. And therefore, they want to incent commercial enterprises to go out and develop new technologies to better the environment. So I think there could be another program after 2021, but we've got 5 years to work on that. But in terms of our cash generation, look at this as well into the 20s."

With me this morning is Doug Howell, our Chief Financial Officer; as well as the heads of our operating divisions. 
There are 4 key components to creating long-term value for Gallagher's shareholders. Number one, we need to grow organically. Number two, we need to grow through mergers and acquisitions. Three, we improve our quality and our productivity every quarter. And number four, we have to work hard to maintain a very unique culture.
We excelled on each and every one of those this quarter. All-in, we grew 4.8% organically in our combined Brokerage and Risk Management operations. We had another 6% of growth through net acquisitions for total adjusted revenue growth of 11%. Our quality was recently recognized by J.D. Power and Associates as ranking the highest in customer satisfaction among brokers in the large commercial insurance space. We became more productive with adjusted EBITDAC growth of 15%, and we expanded our adjusted margins by nearly a full percentage point. And our culture was recognized by the Ethisphere Institute as one of the world's most ethical companies for the fifth straight year. Simply put, an outstanding quarter on each component of our strategy. 
So let me spend a little more time on growth, both organic and acquisitions, and what we are seeing in terms of insurance pricing. Doug will then go into greater detail on margins, clean energy and capital management. 
First, in our Brokerage segment, let me talk about organic revenue growth. All-in, organic was 4.8%. Excluding contingents, which are seasonally strongest in the first quarter, organic was 4.2%. This is similar to the first quarter of 2015 and up about a point relative to the fourth quarter of 2015. About half of this improvement is attributable to stronger new business and about half was due to less drag from rate and exposure. 
Focusing now on our domestic brokerage operations, which include our retail PC brokerage, retail employee benefits consulting and our wholesale brokerage operations. These units account for about 2/3 of our Brokerage segment revenue. 
Domestically, organic revenue growth was about 4.5%. Of that, retail PC was over 5%; benefits at 4%; and wholesale at a little over 2%. Wholesale is feeling some impact from weaker property rates.
Commercial PC rates are still down, but they are a manageable headwind, and our exposure units are growing a bit. In our employee benefit consulting business a tight multigenerational labor market combined with rising cost of health care, especially pharmacy costs, along with increased regulations for employers such as the ACA, are creating more new business opportunities. 
In the first quarter, the renewal impact from rate and exposure units had about 0.5 percentage negative impact on our organic growth, domestically. So no real change from the past few quarters. I just came back from the RIMS Conference in San Diego, and the tone from carriers seemed to be similar to what we have been hearing for the past 3 quarters: some continued weakness in property, but otherwise, pretty consistent conditions.
Moving to our international brokerage operations. That's principally our PC operations in Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the U.K., which combined, represent about 1/3 of our Brokerage segment revenues. Organic revenue growth was about 5% within our international operations. U.K. retail posted about 3% organic in a relatively flat rate and exposure environment. London and Bermuda, especially, posted about 5% organic in a difficult rate and exposure environment. Australia and New Zealand had a little negative timing. Otherwise, organic was flat, also in a difficult rate and exposure environment, but we're starting to see pricing bottom out in Australia and New Zealand. And Canada posted 6% organic in a flat rate and moderately down economic environment.
So when you look at our larger international mergers that we did in 2014, they're all doing very well. Integration is done in Australia and New Zealand, nearly done in Canada and should be mostly done in the U.K. by the end of the year. 
Let me turn to merger and acquisition growth. Over the past 20 months we returned to our almost exclusive focus on smaller tuck-in mergers. Today's competitive environment for mergers is similar to the last 2 to 3 years and a lot like most of the early 2000s, for that matter. But we're maintaining our pricing discipline, with weighted average valuations at about 7x EBITDAC for the 8 mergers we did here in the first quarter. We can pay these valuations because the merger partners that choose us see the long-term value in joining Gallagher. They see our vast capabilities. They see our proven track record. They embody our culture, and they see themselves being more successful as part of us. 
As I do every quarter, I would like to thank all of our new partners for joining us and extend a very warm welcome to our growing family. 
So to wrap up our Brokerage segment, we posted first quarter results of 4% -- 4.8% total organic growth. Total adjusted revenue growth was 12%, adjusted EBITDAC was up 16% and our adjusted margins expanded by 79 basis points, a really, really strong quarter for our Brokerage segment.
Let me move to our Risk Management segment, which is primarily Gallagher Bassett Services. Risk Management started the year with a good first quarter. Adjusted organic revenue growth was 4.7%. Adjusted EBITDAC grew 9%, and adjusted margins improved by 103 basis points to 17.6%. Gallagher Bassett continues to deliver consistent, attractive top and bottom line results for shareholders. GB's domestic claims management business delivered 6% organic growth in the first quarter, while international operations were closer to flat, excluding last year's run-off fees. At 17.6% EBITDAC margin, we outpaced our margin target of 17%, while continuing to make investments that will drive future growth.
I spent some time at the Gallagher Bassett booth at RIMS, and I was able to see firsthand how we are positioning ourselves in the marketplace. We have an amazing offering to provide clients. GB, in my opinion, is simply the best. Some of the recent innovations include Waypoint, our suite of decision support tools based on cutting-edge machine learning technology; Luminos, our acclaimed Risk Management information system; and our new GBGO, a mobile application to enhance communication and engagement with injured workers. All these innovations will continue to improve claim outcomes for clients and bring additional revenue to Gallagher Bassett. 
And I don't want to forget to mention our clean energy efforts, another solid quarter still on track to post 15% growth in annual after-tax earnings relative to 2015. So it was a great start to the year. I'm glad to have the first quarter in the books and we really are hitting on all cylinders. Over to you, Doug."

Like you said, it's nice to have a terrific first quarter under our belt. I'll make some comments on margins, corporate and clean energy, cash and capital management, and then highlight a couple of things in our investor supplement and CFO commentary documents that we posted on our IR website. 
Okay, first, to margins. Brokerage was up 79 basis points and Risk Management was up 103 basis points, really, really excellent work by the team. Within the Brokerage segment, adjusted margin expansion was about equal between our domestic and international operation. Domestic was up 75 basis points, international was up 90 basis points. And recall, our domestic units are running annualized margins in the high 20s so to expand here in the first quarter shows excellent discipline. 
Internationally, our Canadian, New Zealand and London and Bermuda specialty units are also posting margins nicely in the 20s. Yet we do have some opportunity to further improve margins in our Australia and U.K. retail units over the next 18 to 24 months.
In terms of integration, the U.K. team is doing excellent work, and we remain on track to be nearly finished with the integration by the end of this year. Integration costs for the first quarter were right on our forecast, and we still expect 2016 integration charges to be about half the 2015 level.
As for Risk Management segment, we exceeded our 17% margin target during the quarter and we still think 17% is a good margin to expect for the next 3 quarters.
Moving to the Corporate segment. We landed a bit above the high end of the range we provided during our last earnings release, mostly due to clean energy. Most of that was timing. When you look at Page 4 of the CFO commentary document you'll see the timing between the quarters, yet our full year is effectively unchanged from what we previously provided. So for the year, we are still estimating between $109 million and $124 million of net earnings from our clean energy investments.
Okay, to cash -- let's move to cash and capital management. Our first quarter is seasonally our smallest cash generation quarter. Yet at the end of the first quarter, we had about $250 million of free cash on our balance sheet. We are working on freeing up about half of it as part of our integration efforts in the U.K. and the other half is in Australia, New Zealand and Canada that we'll use for M&A, merger and acquisition opportunities in those geographies. 
We also announced a few weeks ago that we renewed and upsized our line of credit facility to $800 million, and we anticipate closing a $275 million debt private placement in early June. 
Our debt-to-EBITDAC ratio on March 31 was about 2.6x on a covenant basis, and we're targeting a similar level at the end of 2016. We believe free cash and -- we believe between free cash and debt, we can fund our M&A program in 2016, similar to the levels we completed in 2015 with no net shares used. And just to clarify, when I say no net shares used, there will be tax-free reorg mergers that require us to use stock, but we intend to offset that through buybacks, just like we did in the first quarter. 
All right, a couple items on housekeeping. First, please don't forget that our first quarter is seasonally our smallest in the Brokerage segment. Please use the document on our web -- IR website called Supplemental Quarterly Financial Information. We give you 5 years of both reported and adjusted results on a quarterly basis. From that historical information, you can easily see our seasonality.
Second, we also provide a CFO commentary document on our website that has a lot of forward-looking information that should help you build your models. You'll see that items for the first quarter are in line with the forecast we gave you during our last earnings call. 
Some soundbites looking forward that you'll see on that document. FX headwinds are mostly behind us, integration is tapering off and this is also now where we're providing all of the guidance related to our clean energy investment that used to be in our earnings release.
So a terrific quarter on all measures and we're -- and in the end, we're really well positioned for the remainder of the year. Back to you, Pat."

In terms of -- which is expansion over last year. In terms of what's happening on the organic side, if you go back and look at our supplement, over time, there have been some periods where Gallagher Bassett's growth has been in the 5% or 6% range, and then it jumps up to the 10% or 12% range. And the reason why is that as we look at some larger accounts, they typically will incept on January 1 or on July 1. And there are some times where they -- we get them in the pipeline, let's say, in 2015, hoping that they incept on January 1. But switching over to us can take some time. So we see more new business incepting July 1 this year than, let's say, maybe in the past where it incepted on January 1. So it's a little bit of a step function type business.

First, when it comes to the bankruptcies, most of those -- when the coal mines go bankrupt, it's usually a holding bankruptcy, but the mines are still operating because they have contracts that they have to continue to deliver coal on. And a lot of these utilities have had -- required to take contracts, so the coal is still moving even though the holding company might be bankrupt. And I think there's been 5 of them in the last year or so as they restructure and make themselves more efficient. Second of all, the power plants, as you recall, when we put up our clean energy plants in at a power plant, we put them earlier in the dispatch curve. So when we do our plants, these are plants that are more likely to run than, let's say, less efficient plants that only get dispatched during the high peak loads. We are at the mercy of weather. We did have a little bit of a warmer winter that did impact us a little bit. But we still see that we're on track. This program runs through 2021, so long-term displacement of coal to other fuels. It takes a long time to displace a plant, and this program goes to just really for another 5 years. And truthfully, the amount of displacement that's happened over the last 8 years probably is not likely to repeat because they displace to natural gas and the plants that they could -- and they really can't move these plants to natural gas that we're operating on efficiently and effectively in the next 5 years. So in summary, I was going to say that I think that we're still well positioned. I still see us having 15% growth in our net earnings this year. We still have other plants that we're working on putting in place that should continue to expand our earnings as you look into the future. So overall, I would say it's a steady state business."

Longer term, I think that even though we talk about the end of this program to generate credits being -- expiring in 2021, our plan is to hit the end of 2021 with a long glide ratio -- or glide path of having a balance sheet with a substantial amount of credits in it that can continue to reduce our tax rate well into the 2020s. So even though the generation phase may be over in 2021, the actually utilization of credits should go on. I think right now, we have about $375 million that's in our balance sheet right now. We're using about $100 million a year. I'd like to have a 5- or 6-, 7-year balance sheet by the time we hit that point. So I think that, that -- now what do we have as opportunities after the fact? Listen, we thought at the end of Section 29, which was the precursor to Section 45 credits that we were done. There's something else that the government does in order to foster tax credits. Because the government really understands that better energy is a good policy. And therefore, they want to incent commercial enterprises to go out and develop new technologies to better the environment. So I think there could be another program after 2021, but we've got 5 years to work on that. But in terms of our cash generation, look at this as well into the '20s."

Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2016 earnings call. With me this morning is Doug Howell, our Chief Financial Officer; as well as the heads of our operating divisions.Today, we are going to touch",1289,"Thank you, Donna. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2016 earnings call. With me this morning is Doug Howell, our Chief Financial Officer; as well as the heads of our operating divisions.
Today, we are going to touch on 4 key components of our strategy to drive shareholder growth: Organic growth; merger growth; improving our quality and productivity, which Doug will spend most of his time on; and fourth, maintaining our unique culture. We have excelled on all 4 year to date.
First, let me talk about organic growth. In our Brokerage segment, after a terrific first quarter of 4.8% organic growth, we posted 2.2%, but that was marked by the loss of a large account that we discussed at our June investor meeting. Excluding the large account, we would have been closer to 2.5%. So for the first half, Brokerage organic was 3.6%, which in retrospect is darn good based on how it felt coming to the year, especially in this environment.
Looking towards the second half of year, I see our organic summer between our second quarter year to date numbers so I see an improvement going forward. Let me
break down our organic around the world. I'm extremely pleased every single division posted positive organic growth in the quarter. Our sales culture is alive and well. Domestically, in the United States, we saw about 3% organic growth. Late in exposure had little over a point of negative impact on its domestic PC renewal results in the second quarter. Most of that was property, which for us, is proportionally higher in our second quarter.
Domestic casualty lines pricing remains similar to last year, where we are seeing a slight downward pressure and we are seeing a modest growth in exposure units overall. This remains an environment where our production teams can grow and outperform.
Our domestic employee benefit consulting business also posted about 3% organic and we're seeing a tremendous amount of new business opportunities. Our teams are showing new prospects are vast array of services, tools and insights that they need to navigate a tight multigenerational labor market, rising health-care costs and increasing regulatory complexities related to the ACA. Our smaller competitors are falling behind each and everyday. This business typically grows more in the second half of the year and it seems to me that, that will be the case again this year.
Let me move to our international brokerage operations. Since our last call, I spent a significant up Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the U.K. These teams are doing great. In fact, they're on a roll. After just 24 months of being part of the Gallagher family, I'm really pleased with how well we are working together, how our sales plans are becoming integrated and how our culture is thriving. Altogether, ex the 1 large account, our international operations posted about 2% organic growth in the second quarter, even with rates and exposures that are softer internationally than we seek here domestically. I'm pleased that our teams are growing through those headwinds and the results are solid. As a side note, it was really interesting being in the U.K. and Europe during Brexit. Remember, we don't have much business at all for mainland Europe, and insurance is not flowing in and out London for over 300 years, long before the EU is formed. So other than a possible recession hitting the U.K. and the other EU countries, and your guest but that is about as good as mine, I don't see it as a worse of event for us in the near term. Longer-term, I think we and the industry will successfully navigate any potential changes to the European insurance landscape.
Next, let me move to merger and acquisition growth. Over the past 2 years, our focus on smaller tuck-in mergers. The average size for the 13 acquisitions this quarter was $3 million of revenue and an average of 7x EBITDAC. So we're still finding with a good opportunities at fair prices and the comparative merger environment. Year-to-date, 21 acquisitions, which should add about $70 million of annualized revenue. And we see a stronger second half of the year for our acquisitions, our pipeline is outstanding. There are a lot of really talented individual sales and consulting professionals out there. They have excellent relationships with their clients, they have strong sales skills and they have a very strong entrepreneurial bend, they create value by joining Gallagher with their full access to our capabilities, expertise and resources.
I said for 30 years, pick your partners that have a culture similar to Gallagher and look out. One plus 1 together does make 3, 4 and 5. I'd like to thank all of our new partners for joining us, and I extend a very warm welcome to our growing Gallagher family professionals.
So to wrap up my comments on the Brokerage segment, halfway through the year, we posted 10% total revenue growth, of which 3.6% is organic. Adjusted EBITDAC growth of 13%, adjusted EBITDAC margin expansion of 60 basis points, integration costs are starting to wind down now and we have an excellent M&A pipeline at fair multiples. Truly excellent results for the first half.
Next, I'd like to move to our Risk Management segment, which is primarily Gallagher Bassett. Risk Management had a more challenging organic quarter, but I'm really pleased that we proactively manage expenses and exceeded our 17% margin target. Second quarter organic was challenged for 3 reasons. First, as we discussed at our Investor Day, we are seeing a bit of a wall in new business inception dates. Second, we express fewer new claims in the final few much of the quarter within the U.S. And third, we recently learned that we are not likely to earn a lot of performance bonus award from our participation in our Australian work over program where we are 1 of 5 provide us. For the fiscal year ended June 30, the program paid performance fees using 30 different criteria and several the metrics had a big stretch. Unfortunately, we fell short. And you'll see in the organic table on Page 6 of the earnings release that we're nothing near in the second quarter in 2016. We believe the other providers fell short too, but let me be clear, I'm disappointed. Going forward, we will return to positive organic growth in the third and fourth quarter. Our client value proposition of delivering superior claim outcomes is stronger than ever. In fact, we have recently we did a big program in Australia at 2 nice new business wins, 1 in Australia, 1 in the U.K., and our domestic new business pipeline is solid.
Let me move to clean energy. Once again, we had a great quarter. The Corporate segment earnings came in above the midpoint of the guidance range we previous provided. We're well on our way to delivering nearly 15% growth in annual after-tax earnings.
Lastly, on our culture. Over the past 3 months, as I said, I have visited the U.K, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. I can tell you that our unique Gallagher culture is thriving and strong across our entire global footprint. This includes the over 300 promising college students globally learning about the greatest business on Earth in our internship program. We're just wrapping up the 51st year of the Gallagher summer intern program. We believe the 2-month program is an important investment in our future as we like growing our own.
So we have delivered an excellent first half of the year, the fundamentals of our business remains strong and we think the second half will even be a bit stronger. Over to you Doug."
252186,372623883,1017116,"Arthur J Gallagher & Co., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2016",2016-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Executives","All right. Thanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone, Today, I'll do some earnings release housekeeping, spend some time in our quality productivity and margins, I'll hit on integration, highlight some clean energy items and then wrap up with some comments",1048,"All right. Thanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone, Today, I'll do some earnings release housekeeping, spend some time in our quality productivity and margins, I'll hit on integration, highlight some clean energy items and then wrap up with some comments on cash and capital management. Okay, to the housekeeping. You'll see that you made changes to our earnings real ease. We did so because in May, the SEC published new guidance on the presentation of non-GAAP measures and we believe we've now gone the additional mile in the spirit of new guidance. It makes the table a little busy but the punchline here is that we have not removed any of our previous disclosures as we strive to remain as transparent as possible. Also, please recall that many of my more forward-looking statements today can be found on the document called CFO commentary that we have posted in our investor website.
All right, let me turn to margins, which are a nice indicator, in my opinion, of our quality and productivity. Brokerage adjusted EBITDAC margins are up 57 basis points and Risk Management margin came in at above our 17% adjusted margin target. Year-to-date, our margins have expanded in both Brokerage by 60 basis points and Risk Management by 33 basis points. That's really terrific work by the team out there. Within the Brokerage segment, margin expansion came mostly from our international operations. We call that we believe there's an opportunity to expand margins in our Australia and U.K. retail businesses over the next couple of years. And we made good progress on that -- this last quarter asked our margin improvement initiatives have kicked in. Let me give you a couple of examples. First, we moved all of our transaction accounting out of London into Glasgow I want it to be clean it up in Glasgow, we then shipped the work into our offshore centers of [indiscernible] which is really following the blueprint that we built here in the USA over the last 10 years, which allows us to as we bring new entities on to move faster than ever before. Second is another example in the U.K. Our retail team standard escort service related processes such as endorsement, coding and renewals across our 50-plus branches. And in Australia, we've started consolidating our SME business from 25-plus branches into a few specialized centers that will focus on just a small customers. All this all work has driven down our back and middle of us cost as we can capitalize on our scale and [ph] three, what's even more exciting is we've dramatically improved the quality of our services and our customer experience. Everyday, our folks that work in the middle and back office get up to be better, faster and wiser on how we spend money.
Let me comment specifically also on integration. And recall that we did 5 large deals in late 2013 and early 2014, and we're nearly finished integration. I was in the U.K. a few weeks ago and the efforts to wrap up are impressive. And I was in Canada in May, and by the end of this year, we will migrate nearly all of the 6 or 7 business units onto a the same agency management system we use here in the USA. Second quarter integration costs were right on our forecast of $0.05 a share. About half of last year's amount. And you'll see on the CFO commentary sheet that we're anticipating about $0.06 to $0.07 total in the last half of 2016 in integration cost, which is down dramatically from the $0.21 we spent in the last half of 2015. So our efforts are well on track to be down by early 2017.
Let me turn to the Risk Management segment, Gallagher Bassett. Over the last several years, we have been improving our service offering to deliver better claim outcomes. Much of the back-office improvement is very similar to what we have done in the Brokerage segment. But in addition, we have improved the tools on our issues such as automating manual and high-volume processes that are really necessary to do a great job but frankly, can bog our folks down. We've also shifted nearly 1,000 associates into work-from-home locations and we developed some specialized centers to focus on comp works specialized case management. These efforts have allowed us to improve our margins in the Risk Management segment over the last couple of years and showed a lot of us the post margins for the year in the neighborhood of 17.5%, which is up from our previous target of 17%.
Shifting to the Corporate segment. We landed a [indiscernible] above the midpoint of our guidance that we provided during our investor meeting in June. Most of this was due to better clean energy earnings because our plans ran ahead of plan in June due to hot weather that hit various parts of the country. We're still forecasting between $110 million to $120 million of net earnings for the year.
First off was a little stronger for the full year should be about where we estimated 6 months ago. It's also important to note that by the end of the year, we will have over $400 million of credits on our balance sheet, effectively, that's a $400 million receivable from the government that will help us reduce our cash taxes paid for many years. As for cash, we've got about $150 million of available cash on our balance sheet and we're making really good progress in our U.K. bank account consolidation efforts to unlock available cash that we talked about before. I think that we're down about 30% in the number of open bank accounts since the beginning of the year.
As for stock. We use no net shares for M&A this quarter and we actually bought some shares back during the Brexit market selloff. We will use those shares for future tax exchange mergers coming up this year.

What I really am pleased about is not only they're expanding their individual margins. And remember, these are businesses that are still in the 20% margin rates so we're not talking about businesses that aren't making money, they're making terrific money. They're doing this in the same time that they're training their folks, they're adopting the Gallagher playbook when it comes to our sales culture. So they're working through just getting better in the back and then office at the same time, they're spending money it in order to get better at selling.

What we really don't see that, we haven't changed our guidance on the impact of EPS. If you recall, Gallagher like many other global brokers, have a lot of dollar-denominated revenues in the U.K. that is serviced with pound to denominated expenses so there's a little bit of a natural operating hedge there that mitigates some of the impact of the decrease pound. So it's more of a revenue headline story than it is an EPS, story. Unfortunately, for us, too, is that we have so many M&A opportunities around the world that we don't need to repatriate our cash into the U.S. to have good uses for it. So even if there is a sell off on the pound, there's some good opportunities for nice tuck-in mergers in the U.K. that we'll use our cash for."

So I'd like to say it's all done, but maybe towards -- maybe in our January call, we'll declare that. When it comes to CapEx, the spending that we've done on the home office build, I recall that we have an opportunity for a lot of tax credits to come through on that, that will improve future cash flow on it, that's about $125 million to $150 million this year that we won't have next year. Integration, we spent over $100 million in 2015, then we're running somewhere in that $50 million range right now, half, maybe less than that. So you'll free up $200 million next year just in those 2 numbers alone. So that's -- I don't see a lot of big real estate moves. We move the big piece of our real estate in the U.K. this year, we don't have those costs. And that is probably $150 million of building costs because there is $125 million and $25 million in the U.K. So I just don't see a lot of those big cash needs coming in 2017.

Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2016 earnings call. With me this morning is Doug Howell, our Chief Financial Officer, as well as the heads of our operating divisions.Today, we are going to touch",1295,"Thank you, Donna. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2016 earnings call. With me this morning is Doug Howell, our Chief Financial Officer, as well as the heads of our operating divisions.
Today, we are going to touch on 4 key components of our strategy to drive shareholder growth: organic growth; merger growth; improving our quality and productivity, which Doug will spend most of his time on; and fourth, maintaining our unique culture. We have excelled on all 4 year to date.
First, let me talk about organic growth. In our Brokerage segment, after a terrific first quarter of 4.8% organic growth, we posted 2.2%, but that was marked by the loss of a large account that we discussed in our June investor meeting. Excluding the large account, we would have been closer to 2.5%. So for the first half, brokerage organic was 3.6%, which in retrospect is darn good based on how it felt coming to the year, especially in this environment.
Looking towards the second half of year, I see our organic somewhere between our second quarter year-to-date numbers, so I see an improvement going forward. Let me breakdown our organic around the world. I'm extremely pleased every single division posted positive organic growth in the quarter. Our sales culture is alive and well. Domestically, in the United States, we saw about 3% organic growth. Rate and exposure had little over a point of negative impact on our domestic PC renewal results in the second quarter. Most of that was property which, for us, is proportionally higher in our second quarter.
Domestic casualty lines pricing remains similar to last year, where we're seeing a slight downward pressure and we are seeing a modest growth in exposure units overall. This remains an environment where our production teams can grow and outperform. Our domestic employee benefit consulting business also posted about 3% organic and is seeing a tremendous amount of new business opportunities. Our teams are showing new prospects are vast array of services, tools and insights that they need to navigate a tight multigenerational labor market, rising health care costs and increasing regulatory complexities related to the ACA. Our smaller competitors are falling behind each and every day. This business typically grows more in the second half of the year and it seems to me that that will be the case again this year.
Let me move to our international brokerage operations. Since our last call, I spent a significant amount of time in Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the U.K. These teams are doing great. In fact, they're on a roll. After just 24 months of being part of the Gallagher family, I'm really pleased with how well we are working together, how our sales plans are becoming integrated and how our culture is thriving. Altogether, ex the one large account, our international operations posted about 2% organic growth in the second quarter, even with rates and exposures that are softer internationally than we see here domestically. I'm pleased that our teams are growing through those headwinds and the results are solid. 
As a side note, it was really interesting being in the U.K. and Europe during Brexit. Remember, we don't have much business at all for mainland Europe, and insurance is not flowing in and out London for over 300 years, long before the EU is formed. So other than a possible recession hitting the U.K. and the other EU countries, and your guest about that is about as good as mine, I don't see it as a worrisome event for us in the near term. Longer term, I think we and the industry will successfully navigate any potential changes to the European insurance landscape.
Next, let me move to merger and acquisition growth. Over the past 2 years, we've returned to our focus on smaller tuck-in mergers. The average size for the 13 acquisitions this quarter was $3 million of revenue and an average of 7x EBITDAC. So we're still finding really good opportunities at fair prices in the competitive merger environment. Year to date, 21 acquisitions, which should add about $70 million of annualized revenue, and we see a stronger second half for the year for acquisitions. Our pipeline is outstanding. 
There are a lot of really talented independent family-owned sales and consulting professionals out there. They have excellent relationships with their clients, they have strong sales skills and they have a very strong entrepreneurial bent. They create value by joining Gallagher where they have full access to our capabilities, expertise and resources. I've said for 30 years, pick your partners that have a culture similar to Gallagher and look out. 1 plus 1 together does make 3, 4 and 5. I'd like to thank all of our new partners for joining us and I extend a very warm welcome to our growing Gallagher family of professionals.
So to wrap up my comments on the Brokerage segment, halfway through the year, we posted 10% total revenue growth, of which 3.6% is organic. Adjusted EBITDAC growth of 13%, adjusted EBITDAC margin expansion of 60 basis points, integration costs are starting to wind down and we have an excellent M&A pipeline at fair multiples. Truly excellent results for the first half.
Next, I'd like to move to our Risk Management segment, which is primarily Gallagher Bassett. Risk Management had a more challenging organic quarter, but I'm really pleased that we proactively manage expenses and exceeded our 17% margin target. Second quarter organic was challenged for 3 reasons. First, as we discussed at our Investor Day, we are seeing a bit of a lull in new business inception dates. Second, we experience fewer new claims in the final 2 months of the quarter within the U.S. And third, we recently learned that we are not likely to earn a large performance bonus award from our participation in an Australian work cover program, where we are 1 of 5 providers. For the fiscal year ended June 30, the program paid performance fees using 20 different criteria and several the metrics had a big stretch. Unfortunately, we fell short. And you'll see in the organic table on Page 6 of the earnings release that we are nothing here in the second quarter in 2016. We believe the other providers fell short too, but let me be clear, I'm disappointed. Going forward, we will return to positive organic growth in the third and fourth quarter. Our client value proposition of delivering superior claim outcomes is stronger than ever. In fact, we have recently renewed a big program in Australia and had 2 nice new business wins, one in Australia and one in the U.K., and our domestic new business pipeline is solid.
Let me move to clean energy. Once again, we had a great quarter. The Corporate segment earnings came in above the midpoint of the guidance range we previous provided. We're well on our way to delivering nearly 15% growth in annual after-tax earnings.
Lastly, on our culture. Over the past 3 months, as I said, I have visited the U.K, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. I can tell you that our unique Gallagher culture is thriving and strong across our entire global footprint. This includes the over 300 promising college students globally learning about the greatest business on Earth in our internship program. We're just wrapping up the 51st year of the Gallagher summer intern program. We believe the 2-month program is an important investment in our future as we like growing our own.
So we have delivered an excellent first half of the year, the fundamentals of our business remains strong and we think the second half will even be a bit stronger. Over to you Doug."
252186,372623883,1017485,"Arthur J Gallagher & Co., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2016",2016-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Executives","All right. Thanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone, Today, I'll do some earnings release housekeeping, spend some time on our quality productivity and margins, I'll hit on integration, highlight some clean energy items and then wrap up with some comments",1048,"All right. Thanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone, Today, I'll do some earnings release housekeeping, spend some time on our quality productivity and margins, I'll hit on integration, highlight some clean energy items and then wrap up with some comments on cash and capital management. Okay. To the housekeeping, you'll see that we made changes to our earnings release. We did so because in May, the SEC published new guidance on the presentation of non-GAAP measures, and we believe we've now gone the additional mile in the spirit of new guidance. It makes the table a little busy, but the punchline here is that we have not removed any of our previous disclosures as we strive to remain as transparent as possible. Also, please recall that many of my more forward-looking statements today can be found on the document called CFO commentary that we post on our Investor Relations website.
All right. Let me turn to margins, which are a nice indicator, in my opinion, of our quality and productivity. Brokerage adjusted EBITDAC margins are up 57 basis points and Risk Management margin came in at above our 17% adjusted margin target. Year to date, our margins have expanded in both Brokerage by 60 basis points and Risk Management by 33 basis points. That's really terrific work by the team out there. 
Within the Brokerage segment, margin expansion came mostly from our international operations. Recall that, we believe, there is an opportunity to expand margins in our Australia and U.K. retail businesses over the next couple of years. And we made good progress on that this last quarter, as our margin improvement initiatives have kicked in. Let me give you a couple of examples. First, we've moved all of our transactional accounting out of London into Glasgow. Once we cleaned it up in Glasgow, we then shipped the work into our offshore centers of excellence, which is really following the blueprint that we built here in the USA over the last 10 years, which allows us -- as we bring new entities on to move faster than ever before. 
Second is another example in the U.K., our retail team standardized core service related processes such as endorsements, quoting and renewals across our 50-plus branches. And in Australia, we've started consolidating our SME business from 25-plus branches into a few specialized centers that will focus on just small customers. 
All of these all work has driven down our back and middle office costs as we can capitalize on our scale, and to me, what's even more exciting is we've dramatically improved the quality of our services and our customer experience. Every day, our folks that work in the middle and back office get up to be better, faster and wiser on how we spend money.
Let me comment specifically also on integration. Recall that we did 5 large deals in late 2013 and early 2014, and we're nearly finished with the integration. I was in the U.K. a few weeks ago and the efforts to wrap this up are impressive. And I was in Canada in May, and by the end of this year, we will migrate nearly all of the 6 or 7 business units on to the same agency management system we use here in the USA. 
Second quarter integration costs were right on our forecast of $0.05 a share, about half of last year's amount. And you'll see on the CFO commentary sheet that we are anticipating about $0.06 to $0.07 total in the last half of 2016 in integration cost, which is down dramatically from the $0.21 we spent in the last half of 2015. So our efforts are well on track to be down by early 2017.
Let me turn to the Risk Management segment, Gallagher Bassett. Over the last several years, we've been improving our service offering to deliver better claim outcomes. Much of the back office improvement is very similar to what we have done in the Brokerage segment. But in addition, we have improved the tools our adjusters use, such as automating manual and high-volume processes that are really necessary to do a great job, but frankly, can bog our folks down. We've also shifted nearly 1,000 associates into work-from-home locations and we developed some specialized centers to focus on complex, specialized case management. These efforts have allowed us to improve our margins in the Risk Management segment over the last couple of years and should allow us to post margins for the year in the neighborhood of 17.5%, which is up from our previous target of 17%.
Shifting to the Corporate segment. We landed a $0.01 or so above the midpoint of our guidance that we provided during our investor meeting in June. Most of this was due to better clean energy earnings because our plants ran ahead of plan in June due to hot weather that hit the various parts of the country. We're still forecasting between $110 million to $120 million of net earnings for the year. First half was a little stronger, but the full year should be about where we estimated 6 months ago. 
It's also important to note that by the end of the year, we will have over $400 million of credits on our balance sheet, effectively, that's a $400 million receivable from the government that will help us reduce our cash taxes paid for many years. As for cash, we've got about $150 million of available cash on our balance sheet and we're making really good progress in our U.K. bank account consolidation efforts to unlock available cash that we talked about before. I think that we're down about 30% in the number of open bank accounts since the beginning of the year.
As for stock, we use no net shares for M&A this quarter and we actually bought some shares back during the Brexit market selloff. We'll use those shares on some future tax rate exchange mergers coming up this year. So when you look back, we haven't used any net shares to do M&A in over a year, and I think we can fund deals with cash and debt through year-end.
So those are my comments. I think it was an excellent first half of the year. Back to you Pat."

So I think a return to a normal 2.5% to 3.5% organic is in sight as it relates to margin improvement, where we see that opportunity is, again, as Doug mentioned in his comments, Australia and the U.K. And the little caution I have there is that those markets are a bit softer than what we're seeing domestically."

And remember, these are businesses that are still in the 20% margin range so we're not talking about businesses that aren't making money, they're making terrific money. They're doing this the same time that they're training their folks.

But we really don't see that, we haven't changed our guidance on the impact of EPS. If you recall, Gallagher like many other global brokers, have a lot of dollar-denominated revenues in the U.K. that is serviced with pound-denominated expenses, so there is a little bit of a natural operating hedge there that mitigates some of the impact of the decreasing pound. So it's more of a revenue headline story than it is an EPS story. Unfortunately, for us, too, is that we have so many M&A opportunities around the world that we don't need to repatriate our cash into the U.S. to have good uses for it. So even if there is a sell off on the pound, there are some good opportunities for nice tuck-in mergers in the U.K. that we'll use our cash for."

It's softer, as I said earlier, in New Zealand and Australia, Canada and the U.K, especially in our specialty business in London. Those markets are soft. But here in the United States, we're coming up 5, 6 years of what I would call flat. When rates are down 1%, 2% or up 1%, 2%, in my experience, that's a flat market. In a typical hard market, rates are jumping 15%, 25%, 30%, 40%, 50%. In a typical soft market, they're dropping 12%, 15%, could be 16%, 17%. We're 5 or 6 years now where that band is 1.5% to 2% up to 1.5% to 2% down. And I know that is driven by the lack of investment returns in the investment market, but it's pretty darn good discipline by the underwriting community and we saw that again in the quarter. Soft on the property side, and I've said this in past quarters, I think our clients deserve that softness. They will pay a price when the wind blows, and it hasn't for a number of years. And so the property market is soft, but casualty rate and exposures contributed less than 1% negative to our results this quarter domestically, that's pretty good. By the way, that's a great environment. That's a great environment for our clients and it's also a great environment for our producers. When rates are dropping 15% to 20%, anybody can throw a quote out there and catch it off guard with a number that's so low that you'll lose your clients. Today, it's all around how creative can you be and how helpful can you be to your client in helping them deal with their Risk Management costs."

So I'd like to say it's all done, but maybe towards -- maybe in our January call, we'll declare that. When it comes to CapEx, the spending that we've done on the home office build, and recall that we have an opportunity for a lot of tax credits to come through on that that will improve future cash flow on it, that's about $125 million to $150 million this year that we won't have next year. Integration, we spent well over $100 million in 2015 and we're running somewhere in that $50 million range right now -- half, maybe less than that. So you'll free up $200 million next year just in those 2 numbers alone. So that's -- I don't see a lot of big real estate moves. We move the big piece of our real estate in the U.K. this year and we don't have those costs.

Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2016 earnings call. With me this morning is Doug Howell, our Chief Financial Officer, as well as the heads of our operating divisions.Today, we are going to touch",1298,"Thank you, Donna. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2016 earnings call. With me this morning is Doug Howell, our Chief Financial Officer, as well as the heads of our operating divisions.
Today, we are going to touch on 4 key components of our strategy to drive shareholder growth: organic growth; merger growth; improving our quality and productivity, which Doug will spend most of his time on; and fourth, maintaining our unique culture. We have excelled on all 4, year to date.
First, let me talk about organic growth. In our Brokerage segment, after a terrific first quarter of 4.8% organic growth, we posted 2.2%, but that was marked by the loss of a large account that we discussed at our June investor meeting. Excluding the large account, we would have been closer to 2.5%. So for the first half, brokerage organic was 3.6%, which in retrospect is darn good based on how it felt coming into the year, especially in this environment.
Looking towards the second half of year, I see our organic somewhere between our second quarter and year-to-date numbers, so I see an improvement going forward. Let me break down our organic around the world. I'm extremely pleased every single division posted positive organic growth in the quarter. Our sales culture is alive and well. Domestically, in the United States, we saw about 3% organic growth. Rate and exposure had a little over a point of negative impact on our domestic PC renewal results in the second quarter. Most of that was property which, for us, is proportionally higher in our second quarter.
Domestic casualty lines pricing remains similar to last year, where we're seeing a slight downward pressure and we are seeing a modest growth in exposure units overall. This remains an environment where our production teams can grow and outperform. Our domestic employee benefit consulting business also posted about 3% organic and is seeing a tremendous amount of new business opportunities. Our teams are showing new prospects our vast array of services, tools and insights that they need to navigate a tight multigenerational labor market, rising health care costs and increasing regulatory complexities related to the ACA. Our smaller competitors are falling behind each and every day. This business typically grows more in the second half of the year and it seems to me that, that will be the case again this year.
Let me move to our international brokerage operations. Since our last call, I've spent a significant amount of time in Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the U.K. These teams are doing great. In fact, they're on a roll. After just 24 months of being part of the Gallagher family, I'm really pleased with how well we are working together, how our sales plans are becoming integrated and how our culture is thriving. Altogether, ex the one large account, our international operations posted about 2% organic growth in the second quarter, even with rates and exposures that are softer internationally than we see here domestically. I'm pleased that our teams are growing through those headwinds and the results are solid. 
As a side note, it was really interesting being in the U.K. and Europe during Brexit. Remember, we don't have much business at all from mainland Europe, and insurance is not flowing in and out London for over 300 years, long before the EU was formed. So other than a possible recession hitting the U.K. and the other EU countries, and your guest about that is about as good as mine, I don't see it as a worrisome event for us in the near term. Longer term, I think we and the industry will successfully navigate any potential changes to the European insurance landscape.
Next, let me move to merger and acquisition growth. Over the past 2 years, we've returned to our focus on smaller tuck-in mergers. The average size for the 13 acquisitions this quarter was $3 million of revenue at an average of 7x EBITDAC. So we're still finding really good opportunities at fair prices in the competitive merger environment. Year to date, 21 acquisitions, which should add about $70 million of annualized revenue, and we see a stronger second half for the year for acquisitions. Our pipeline is outstanding. 
There are a lot of really talented independent, family-owned sales and consulting professionals out there. They have excellent relationships with their clients, they have strong sales skills and they have a very strong entrepreneurial bent. They create value by joining Gallagher where they have full access to our capabilities, expertise and resources. I've said for 30 years, pick your partners that have a culture similar to Gallagher and look out. 1 plus 1 together does make 3, 4 and 5. I'd like to thank all of our new partners for joining us and I extend a very warm welcome to our growing Gallagher family of professionals.
So to wrap up my comments on the Brokerage segment, halfway through the year, we've posted 10% total revenue growth, of which 3.6% is organic. Adjusted EBITDAC growth of 13%, adjusted EBITDAC margin expansion of 60 basis points, integration costs are starting to wind down and we have an excellent M&A pipeline at fair multiples. Truly excellent results through the first half.
Next, I'd like to move to our Risk Management segment, which is primarily Gallagher Bassett. Risk Management had a more challenging organic quarter, but I'm really pleased that we proactively managed expenses and exceeded our 17% margin target. Second quarter organic was challenged for 3 reasons. First, as we discussed at our Investor Day, we are seeing a bit of a lull in new business inception dates. Second, we experienced fewer new claims in the final 2 months of the quarter within the U.S. And third, we recently learned that we are not likely to earn a large performance bonus award from our participation in an Australian work cover program, where we are 1 of 5 providers. For the fiscal year ended June 30, the program paid performance fees using 20 different criteria and several of the metrics had a big stretch. Unfortunately, we fell short. And you'll see in the organic table on Page 6 of the earnings release that we earned nothing here in the second quarter in 2016. We believe the other providers fell short too, but let me be clear, I'm disappointed. Going forward, we will return to positive organic growth in the third and fourth quarter. Our client value proposition of delivering superior claim outcomes is stronger than ever. In fact, we've recently renewed a big program in Australia and had 2 nice new business wins, one in Australia and one in the U.K., and our domestic new business pipeline is solid.
Let me move to clean energy. Once again, we had a great quarter. The Corporate segment earnings came in above the midpoint of the guidance range we previous provided. We're well on our way to delivering nearly 15% growth in annual after-tax earnings.
Lastly, on our culture. Over the past 3 months, as I said, I have visited the U.K, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. I can tell you that our unique Gallagher culture is thriving and strong across our entire global footprint. This includes the over 300 promising college students, globally, learning about the greatest business on Earth in our internship program. We're just wrapping up the 51st year of the Gallagher summer intern program. We believe the 2-month program is an important investment in our future as we like growing our own.
So we have delivered an excellent first half of the year, the fundamentals of our business remain strong and we think the second half will even be a bit stronger. Over to you Doug."
252186,372623883,1017653,"Arthur J Gallagher & Co., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2016",2016-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Executives","All right. Thanks, Pat, and good morning to everyone, Today, I'll do some earnings release housekeeping, spend some time on our quality, productivity and margins, I'll hit on integration, highlight some clean energy items and then wrap up with some commen",1048,"All right. Thanks, Pat, and good morning to everyone, Today, I'll do some earnings release housekeeping, spend some time on our quality, productivity and margins, I'll hit on integration, highlight some clean energy items and then wrap up with some comments on cash and capital management. Okay. To the housekeeping, you'll see that we made changes to our earnings release. We did so because in May, the SEC published new guidance on the presentation of non-GAAP measures, and we believe we've now gone the additional mile in the spirit of the new guidance. It makes the tables a little busy, but the punchline here is that we have not removed any of our previous disclosures as we strive to remain as transparent as possible. Also, please recall that many of my more forward-looking statements today can be found on the document called CFO commentary that we post on our Investor Relations website.
All right. Let me turn to margins, which are a nice indicator, in my opinion, of our quality and productivity. Brokerage adjusted EBITDAC margins are up 57 basis points and Risk Management margin came in above our 17% adjusted margin target. Year to date, our margins have expanded in both Brokerage by 60 basis points and Risk Management by 33 basis points. That's really terrific work by the team out there. 
Within the Brokerage segment, margin expansion came mostly from our international operations. Recall that, we believe, there is an opportunity to expand margins in our Australia and U.K. retail businesses over the next couple of years. And we made good progress on that this last quarter, as our margin improvement initiatives have kicked in. Let me give you a couple of examples. First, we've moved all of our transactional accounting out of London into Glasgow. Once we clean it up in Glasgow, we then shipped the work into our offshore centers of excellence, which is really following the blueprint that we built here in the USA over the last 10 years, which allows us -- as we bring new entities on to move faster than ever before. 
Second is another example in the U.K., our retail team standardized core service related processes such as endorsements, quoting and renewals across our 50-plus branches. And in Australia, we've started consolidating our SME business from 25-plus branches into a few specialized centers that will focus on just small customers. 
All of this work has driven down our back and middle office costs as we can capitalize on our scale, and to me, what's even more exciting is we've dramatically improved the quality of our services and our customer experience. Every day, our folks that work in the middle and back office get up to be better, faster and wiser on how we spend money.
Let me comment specifically also on integration. Recall that we did 5 large deals in late 2013 and early 2014, and we're nearly finished with the integration. I was in the U.K. a few weeks ago and the efforts to wrap this up are impressive. And I was in Canada in May, and by the end of this year, we will have migrated nearly all of the 6 or 7 business units onto the same agency management system we use here in the USA. 
Second quarter integration costs were right on our forecast of $0.05 a share, about half of last year's amount. And you'll see on the CFO commentary sheet that we are anticipating about $0.06 to $0.07 total in the last half of 2016 in integration costs, which is down dramatically from the $0.21 we spent in the last half of 2015. So our efforts are well on track to be done by early 2017.
Let me turn to the Risk Management segment, Gallagher Bassett. Over the last several years, we've been improving our service offering to deliver better claim outcomes. Much of the back office improvement is very similar to what we have done in the Brokerage segment. But in addition, we have improved the tools our adjusters use, such as automating manual and high-volume processes that are really necessary to do a great job, but frankly, can bog our folks down. We've also shifted nearly 1,000 associates into work-from-home locations and we developed some specialized centers to focus on complex, specialized case management. These efforts have allowed us to improve our margins in the Risk Management segment over the last couple of years and should allow us to post margins for the year in the neighborhood of 17.5%, which is up from our previous target of 17%.
Shifting to the Corporate segment. We landed a $0.01 or so above the midpoint of our guidance that we provided during our investor meeting in June. Most of this was due to better clean energy earnings because our plants ran ahead of plan in June due to the hot weather that hit the various parts of the country. We're still forecasting between $110 million to $120 million of net earnings for the year. First half was a little stronger, but the full year should be about where we estimated 6 months ago. 
It's also important to note that by the end of the year, we will have over $400 million of credits on our balance sheet, effectively, that's a $400 million receivable from the government that will help us reduce our cash taxes paid for many years. As for cash, we've got about $150 million of available cash on our balance sheet and we're making really good progress in our U.K. bank account consolidation efforts to unlock available cash that we talked about before. I think that we're down about 30% in the number of open bank accounts since the beginning of the year.
As for stock, we used no net shares for M&A this quarter and we actually bought some shares back during the Brexit market selloff. We'll use those shares on some future tax-free exchange mergers coming up this year. So when you look back, we haven't used any net shares to do M&A in over a year, and I think we can fund deals with cash and debt through year-end.
So those are my comments. I think it was an excellent first half of the year. Back to you Pat."

How do you see that kind of shaking out domestic and internationally? And then if you kind of -- if the organic growth stays at that -- comes in at that level, do you think that we could see kind of the same degree of margin improvement in the Brokerage business that we saw in the first half of the year, in the second half?"

I think going forward, we don't have any of those that I know that are under attack right now. So I think a return to a more normal 2.5% to 3.5% organic is in sight. As it relates to margin improvement, where we see that opportunity is, again, as Doug had mentioned in his comments, Australia and the U.K. And the little caution I have there is that those markets are a bit softer than what we're seeing domestically."

It's going to take us another year to 18 months to kind of harvest some of those. But every day, those folks are doing a great job, and what I really am pleased about is not only are they expanding their individual margins -- and remember, these are businesses that are still in the 20% margin range, so we're not talking about businesses that aren't making money, they're making terrific money. They're doing this at the same time that they're training their folks. They're adopting the Gallagher playbook when it comes to our sales culture, so they're working through just getting better in the back and mid office. At the same time, they're spending money in order to get better at selling. So there is margin opportunity there.

But we really don't see that, we haven't changed our guidance on the impact of EPS. If you recall, Gallagher like many other global brokers, have a lot of dollar-denominated revenues in the U.K. that is serviced with pound-denominated expenses, so there is a little bit of a natural operating hedge there that mitigates some of the impact of the decreasing pound. So it's more of a revenue headline story than it is an EPS story. And fortunately, for us, too, is that we have so many M&A opportunities around the world that we don't need to repatriate our cash into the U.S. to have good uses for it. So even if there is a sell off on the pound, there are some good opportunities for nice tuck-in mergers in the U.K. that we'll use our cash for."

It's softer, as I said earlier, in New Zealand and Australia, Canada and the U.K, especially in our specialty business in London. Those markets are soft. But here in the United States, we're coming up 5, 6 years of what I would call flat. When rates are down 1%, 2% or up 1%, 2%, in my experience, that's a flat market. In a typical hard market, rates are jumping 15%, 25%, 30%, 40%, 50%. In a typical soft market, they're dropping 12%, 15%, could be 16%, 17%. We're 5 or 6 years now where that band is 1.5% to 2% up to 1.5% to 2% down. And I know that is driven by the lack of investment returns in the investment market, but it's pretty darn good discipline by the underwriting community and we saw that again in the quarter. Soft on the property side, and I've said this in past quarters, I think our clients deserve that softness. They will pay a price when the wind blows, and it hasn't for a number of years. And so the property market is soft, but casualty -- rate and exposure has contributed less than 1% negative to our results this quarter domestically, that's pretty good. By the way, that's a great environment. That's a great environment for our clients and it's also a great environment for our producers. When rates are dropping 15% to 20%, anybody can throw a quote out there and catch you off guard with a number that's so low that you lose your client.

When it comes to CapEx, the spending that we've done on the home office build, and recall that we have an opportunity for a lot of tax credits to come through on that, that will improve future cash flow on it, that's about $125 million to $150 million this year that we won't have next year. Integration, we spent well over $100 million in 2015 and we're running somewhere in that $50 million range right now -- half, maybe less than that.

We won't have those costs, and that was probably in that $150 million of building costs, so there was $125 million in the U.S. and $25 million in the U.K. So I just don't see a lot of those big cash needs coming in 2017. So that's a nice pot of money to have."

Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2016 earnings call. With me this morning is Doug Howell, our Chief Financial Officer as well as the heads of our operating divisions.Today, we are going to touch o",1298,"Thank you, Donna. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2016 earnings call. With me this morning is Doug Howell, our Chief Financial Officer as well as the heads of our operating divisions.
Today, we are going to touch on 4 key components of our strategy to drive shareholder growth: organic growth; merger growth; improving our quality and productivity, which Doug will spend most of his time on; and fourth, maintaining our unique culture. We have excelled on all 4, year to date.
First, let me talk about organic growth. In our Brokerage segment, after a terrific first quarter of 4.8% organic growth, we posted 2.2%, but that was marked by the loss of a large account that we discussed at our June investor meeting. Excluding the large account, we would have been closer to 2.5%. So for the first half, brokerage organic was 3.6%, which in retrospect is darn good based on how it felt coming into the year, especially in this environment.
Looking towards the second half of year, I see our organic somewhere between our second quarter and year-to-date numbers, so I see an improvement going forward. Let me break down our organic around the world. I'm extremely pleased every single division posted positive organic growth in the quarter. Our sales culture is alive and well. Domestically, in the United States, we saw about 3% organic growth. Rate and exposure had a little over a point of negative impact on our domestic PC renewal results in the second quarter. Most of that was property which, for us, is proportionally higher in our second quarter.
Domestic casualty lines pricing remains similar to last year, where we're seeing a slight downward pressure and we are seeing a modest growth in exposure units overall. This remains an environment where our production teams can grow and outperform. Our domestic employee benefit consulting business also posted about 3% organic and is seeing a tremendous amount of new business opportunities. Our teams are showing new prospects our vast array of services, tools and insights that they need to navigate a tight multigenerational labor market, rising health care costs and increasing regulatory complexities related to the ACA. Our smaller competitors are falling behind each and every day. This business typically grows more in the second half of the year and it seems to me that, that will be the case again this year.
Let me move to our international brokerage operations. Since our last call, I've spent a significant amount of time in Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the U.K. These teams are doing great. In fact, they're on a roll. After just 24 months of being part of the Gallagher family, I'm really pleased with how well we are working together, how our sales plans are becoming integrated and how our culture is thriving. Altogether, ex the one large account, our international operations posted about 2% organic growth in the second quarter, even with rates and exposures that are softer internationally than we see here domestically. I'm pleased that our teams are growing through those headwinds and the results are solid. 
As a side note, it was really interesting being in the U.K. and Europe during Brexit. Remember, we don't have much business at all from mainland Europe, and insurance is not flowing in and out London for over 300 years, long before the EU was formed. So other than a possible recession hitting the U.K. and the other EU countries, and your guest about that is about as good as mine, I don't see it as a worrisome event for us in the near term. Longer term, I think we and the industry will successfully navigate any potential changes to the European insurance landscape.
Next, let me move to merger and acquisition growth. Over the past 2 years, we've returned to our focus on smaller tuck-in mergers. The average size for the 13 acquisitions this quarter was $3 million of revenue at an average of 7x EBITDAC. So we're still finding really good opportunities at fair prices in the competitive merger environment. Year to date, 21 acquisitions, which should add about $70 million of annualized revenue, and we see a stronger second half for the year for acquisitions. Our pipeline is outstanding. 
There are a lot of really talented independent, family-owned sales and consulting professionals out there. They have excellent relationships with their clients, they have strong sales skills and they have a very strong entrepreneurial bent. They create value by joining Gallagher where they have full access to our capabilities, expertise and resources. I've said for 30 years, pick your partners that have a culture similar to Gallagher and look out. 1 plus 1 together does make 3, 4 and 5. I'd like to thank all of our new partners for joining us and I extend a very warm welcome to our growing Gallagher family of professionals.
So to wrap up my comments on the Brokerage segment, halfway through the year, we've posted 10% total revenue growth, of which 3.6% is organic. Adjusted EBITDAC growth of 13%, adjusted EBITDAC margin expansion of 60 basis points, integration costs are starting to wind down and we have an excellent M&A pipeline at fair multiples. Truly excellent results through the first half.
Next, I'd like to move to our Risk Management segment, which is primarily Gallagher Bassett. Risk Management had a more challenging organic quarter, but I'm really pleased that we proactively managed expenses and exceeded our 17% margin target. Second quarter organic was challenged for 3 reasons. First, as we discussed at our Investor Day, we are seeing a bit of a lull in new business inception dates. Second, we experienced fewer new claims in the final 2 months of the quarter within the U.S. And third, we recently learned that we are not likely to earn a large performance bonus award from our participation in an Australian work cover program, where we are 1 of 5 providers. For the fiscal year ended June 30, the program paid performance fees using 20 different criteria and several of the metrics had a big stretch. Unfortunately, we fell short. And you'll see in the organic table on Page 6 of the earnings release that we earned nothing here in the second quarter in 2016. We believe the other providers fell short too, but let me be clear, I'm disappointed. Going forward, we will return to positive organic growth in the third and fourth quarter. Our client value proposition of delivering superior claim outcomes is stronger than ever. In fact, we've recently renewed a big program in Australia and had 2 nice new business wins, one in Australia and one in the U.K., and our domestic new business pipeline is solid.
Let me move to clean energy. Once again, we had a great quarter. The Corporate segment earnings came in above the midpoint of the guidance range we previous provided. We're well on our way to delivering nearly 15% growth in annual after-tax earnings.
Lastly, on our culture. Over the past 3 months, as I said, I have visited the U.K, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. I can tell you that our unique Gallagher culture is thriving and strong across our entire global footprint. This includes the over 300 promising college students, globally, learning about the greatest business on Earth in our internship program. We're just wrapping up the 51st year of the Gallagher summer intern program. We believe the 2-month program is an important investment in our future as we like growing our own.
So we have delivered an excellent first half of the year, the fundamentals of our business remain strong and we think the second half will even be a bit stronger. Over to you Doug."
252186,372623883,1018480,"Arthur J Gallagher & Co., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2016",2016-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Executives","All right. Thanks, Pat, and good morning to everyone, Today, I'll do some earnings release housekeeping, spend some time on our quality, productivity and margins, I'll hit on integration, highlight some clean energy items and then wrap up with some commen",1048,"All right. Thanks, Pat, and good morning to everyone, Today, I'll do some earnings release housekeeping, spend some time on our quality, productivity and margins, I'll hit on integration, highlight some clean energy items and then wrap up with some comments on cash and capital management. Okay. To the housekeeping, you'll see that we made changes to our earnings release. We did so because in May, the SEC published new guidance on the presentation of non-GAAP measures, and we believe we've now gone the additional mile in the spirit of the new guidance. It makes the tables a little busy, but the punchline here is that we have not removed any of our previous disclosures as we strive to remain as transparent as possible. Also, please recall that many of my more forward-looking statements today can be found on the document called CFO commentary that we post on our Investor Relations website.
All right. Let me turn to margins, which are a nice indicator, in my opinion, of our quality and productivity. Brokerage adjusted EBITDAC margins are up 57 basis points and Risk Management margin came in above our 17% adjusted margin target. Year to date, our margins have expanded in both Brokerage by 60 basis points and Risk Management by 33 basis points. That's really terrific work by the team out there. 
Within the Brokerage segment, margin expansion came mostly from our international operations. Recall that, we believe, there is an opportunity to expand margins in our Australia and U.K. retail businesses over the next couple of years. And we made good progress on that this last quarter, as our margin improvement initiatives have kicked in. Let me give you a couple of examples. First, we've moved all of our transactional accounting out of London into Glasgow. Once we clean it up in Glasgow, we then shipped the work into our offshore centers of excellence, which is really following the blueprint that we built here in the USA over the last 10 years, which allows us -- as we bring new entities on to move faster than ever before. 
Second is another example in the U.K., our retail team standardized core service related processes such as endorsements, quoting and renewals across our 50-plus branches. And in Australia, we've started consolidating our SME business from 25-plus branches into a few specialized centers that will focus on just small customers. 
All of this work has driven down our back and middle office costs as we can capitalize on our scale, and to me, what's even more exciting is we've dramatically improved the quality of our services and our customer experience. Every day, our folks that work in the middle and back office get up to be better, faster and wiser on how we spend money.
Let me comment specifically also on integration. Recall that we did 5 large deals in late 2013 and early 2014, and we're nearly finished with the integration. I was in the U.K. a few weeks ago and the efforts to wrap this up are impressive. And I was in Canada in May, and by the end of this year, we will have migrated nearly all of the 6 or 7 business units onto the same agency management system we use here in the USA. 
Second quarter integration costs were right on our forecast of $0.05 a share, about half of last year's amount. And you'll see on the CFO commentary sheet that we are anticipating about $0.06 to $0.07 total in the last half of 2016 in integration costs, which is down dramatically from the $0.21 we spent in the last half of 2015. So our efforts are well on track to be done by early 2017.
Let me turn to the Risk Management segment, Gallagher Bassett. Over the last several years, we've been improving our service offering to deliver better claim outcomes. Much of the back office improvement is very similar to what we have done in the Brokerage segment. But in addition, we have improved the tools our adjusters use, such as automating manual and high-volume processes that are really necessary to do a great job, but frankly, can bog our folks down. We've also shifted nearly 1,000 associates into work-from-home locations and we developed some specialized centers to focus on complex, specialized case management. These efforts have allowed us to improve our margins in the Risk Management segment over the last couple of years and should allow us to post margins for the year in the neighborhood of 17.5%, which is up from our previous target of 17%.
Shifting to the Corporate segment. We landed a $0.01 or so above the midpoint of our guidance that we provided during our investor meeting in June. Most of this was due to better clean energy earnings because our plants ran ahead of plan in June due to the hot weather that hit the various parts of the country. We're still forecasting between $110 million to $120 million of net earnings for the year. First half was a little stronger, but the full year should be about where we estimated 6 months ago. 
It's also important to note that by the end of the year, we will have over $400 million of credits on our balance sheet, effectively, that's a $400 million receivable from the government that will help us reduce our cash taxes paid for many years. As for cash, we've got about $150 million of available cash on our balance sheet and we're making really good progress in our U.K. bank account consolidation efforts to unlock available cash that we talked about before. I think that we're down about 30% in the number of open bank accounts since the beginning of the year.
As for stock, we used no net shares for M&A this quarter and we actually bought some shares back during the Brexit market selloff. We'll use those shares on some future tax-free exchange mergers coming up this year. So when you look back, we haven't used any net shares to do M&A in over a year, and I think we can fund deals with cash and debt through year-end.
So those are my comments. I think it was an excellent first half of the year. Back to you Pat."

I think, overall, if you just look across the whole group, 3% organic growth is kind of the tipping point of margin expansion. But when you look at what we're doing to get better in the U.K. retail space and down in Australia in the retail space, there are some opportunities there. It's going to take us another year to 18 months to kind of harvest some of those. But every day, those folks are doing a great job, and what I really am pleased about is not only are they expanding their individual margins -- and remember, these are businesses that are still in the 20% margin range, so we're not talking about businesses that aren't making money, they're making terrific money. They're doing this at the same time that they're training their folks. They're adopting the Gallagher playbook when it comes to our sales culture, so they're working through just getting better in the back and mid office. At the same time, they're spending money in order to get better at selling. So there is margin opportunity there. But remember, these are still businesses that are in the 20% margin -- plus-20% margin range."

But we really don't see that, we haven't changed our guidance on the impact of EPS. If you recall, Gallagher like many other global brokers, have a lot of dollar-denominated revenues in the U.K. that is serviced with pound-denominated expenses, so there is a little bit of a natural operating hedge there that mitigates some of the impact of the decreasing pound. So it's more of a revenue headline story than it is an EPS story. And fortunately, for us, too, is that we have so many M&A opportunities around the world that we don't need to repatriate our cash into the U.S. to have good uses for it. So even if there is a sell off on the pound, there are some good opportunities for nice tuck-in mergers in the U.K. that we'll use our cash for."

It's softer, as I said earlier, in New Zealand and Australia, Canada and the U.K, especially in our specialty business in London. Those markets are soft. But here in the United States, we're coming up 5, 6 years of what I would call flat. When rates are down 1%, 2% or up 1%, 2%, in my experience, that's a flat market. In a typical hard market, rates are jumping 15%, 25%, 30%, 40%, 50%. In a typical soft market, they're dropping 12%, 15%, could be 16%, 17%. We're 5 or 6 years now where that band is 1.5% to 2% up to 1.5% to 2% down. And I know that is driven by the lack of investment returns in the investment market, but it's pretty darn good discipline by the underwriting community and we saw that again in the quarter. Soft on the property side, and I've said this in past quarters, I think our clients deserve that softness. They will pay a price when the wind blows, and it hasn't for a number of years. And so the property market is soft, but casualty -- rate and exposure has contributed less than 1% negative to our results this quarter domestically, that's pretty good. By the way, that's a great environment. That's a great environment for our clients and it's also a great environment for our producers.

I think that, first of all, on the integration, for our integration teams out there that are listening, I know you've got a lot of hard work left, but financially, it's not going to cost us that much between now and the end of the year. So I'd like to say it's all done, but maybe towards -- maybe in our January call, we'll declare that. When it comes to CapEx, the spending that we've done on the home office build, and recall that we have an opportunity for a lot of tax credits to come through on that, that will improve future cash flow on it, that's about $125 million to $150 million this year that we won't have next year. Integration, we spent well over $100 million in 2015 and we're running somewhere in that $50 million range right now -- half, maybe less than that. So you'll free up $200 million next year just in those 2 numbers alone. So that's -- I don't see a lot of big real estate moves. We moved a big piece of our real estate in the U.K. this year. We won't have those costs, and that was probably in that $150 million of building costs, so there was $125 million in the U.S. and $25 million in the U.K. So I just don't see a lot of those big cash needs coming in 2017.

Before I get down to some serious business, I have to start the call by saying go Cubs. With me this morning is Doug Howell, our Chief Financial Officer; as well as the heads of our operating divisions. 
As I do every quarter, today, we're going to touch on the 4 key components of our strategy to drive shareholder value. Those 4 are, one, organic growth; two, growing our business through mergers and acquisitions; three, improving our quality and productivity; and fourth, maintaining a very unique Gallagher culture. 
The team executed on all 4 of these pillars this past quarter and on a year-to-date basis. 
First, let me start with organic growth. In our Brokerage segment, we posted all inorganic of 3.4%, up nicely over second quarter and right in line with our year-to-date organic of 3.6%. 
I recently returned from the Council of Insurance Agents and Brokers' Annual Meeting, where I met with more than 20 insurance carriers. Based on my conversations with carriers and consistent with our own experience in data, we continue to see the domestic pricing environment as stable. In fact, rate and exposure only had a little over 1 point of negative impact on our domestic property/casualty renewal results in the third quarter. 
I also spent time with our leadership teams in the U.K., Canada, Australia and New Zealand over the past few weeks, and pricing outside the U.S. remains broadly soft. So I see environment for us that could lead to organic growth in the fourth quarter similar to what we saw through the first 9 months of this year. Clearly, that depends on our new and lost business in the fourth quarter. And you may recall, we did have a very large new business month in December of 2015. 
Let me break down our organic around the world. I'm extremely pleased that every single division around the world posted organic growth in the quarter. Our sales culture is truly alive and well. 
Domestically, we saw about 4% organic growth. Within our retail P&C, operation up 3%; wholesale was up 1%; and benefits up nicely, over 5%. We did experience some incremental pressure within our wholesale unit, driven by continued weak property pricing in the quarter, with domestic casualty lines pricing remained similar to last year. 
Exposure units are showing some growth, offsetting some of the rate pressure. Property/casualty insurance market remains in a level where our production teams can grow organically and outperform. 
Our employee benefit consulting operation continues to see great new business opportunities. This business could typically grow us more in the second half of the year, and it did nicely here in the third quarter, and organic growth looks promising for the fourth quarter, too. 
In August, we released results of our annual Benefits Strategy & Benchmarking Survey, one of the large of its kind, with over 3,000 U.S. employers participating. This type of thought leadership and research is a great value to our clients and invaluable, and we are showing new prospects our best capabilities and insights. 
Let me move to our international brokerage operations. As I discussed in our July earnings call and our September 23 Investor Day, all of our operations globally are working together, with integrated sales plans and are living and breathing our unique Gallagher culture. This quarter, we saw 2% organic from our U.K. and Canadian teams and similar organic growth from our teams in New Zealand and Australia. This is simply excellent work as these international teams continue to grow through a rate and exposure headwind that is different than we are seeing here domestically. 
Next, let me move to merger and acquisition growth. The average size for the 7 acquisitions this quarter is $4 million of revenue at an average of 7.6x EBITDAC, putting our year-to-date multiple at 7x. Third quarter acquisition activity was a little slower than normal, but our pipeline remains very robust. 
We have approximately $90 million of revenue associated with agreed-upon term sheets and another $140 million of revenues with term sheets issued being prepared. While not all of these transactions will close, I do think we'll catch up to a more normal pace of transactions here in the fourth quarter. Our pipeline is as strong as ever and full of small, independent entrepreneurs with strong sales skills and excellent client relationships. 
Looking forward towards 2017, we will continue to focus on smaller tuck-in mergers, where we believe we can create value by giving these professionals full access to our capabilities, expertise and resources. 
I want to stop and thank all of our new partners for joining us and extend a very warm-up welcome to our growing Gallagher family of professionals. 
So how did we do through the first 3 quarters in our Brokerage segment? Over 9% total adjusted revenue growth, of which 3.6% is organic; adjusted EBITDAC growth of 11%; adjusted EBITDAC margin expansion of 47 basis points, and we continue to have an excellent merger and acquisition pipeline at fair multiples. 
I couldn't be more pleased with our 9 months' result in the Brokerage segment. 
Next, I'd like to move to our Risk Management segment, which is primarily Gallagher Bassett Services. Risk Management had a nice rebound from the second quarter, with organic back-end-positive territory. The turnaround from the second quarter is due to a smaller impact from performance bonus income and more normal patterns of the business. Client retention rates remain strong, and client satisfaction, both in the U.S. and internationally, continues to enhance GB's reputation and standing, with new sales results surpassing prior year. Going forward, for the Risk Management segment, we believe we can deliver positive organic in the fourth quarter and even better organic in 2017 as recent new business wins in Australia and the U.K. come online. 
Our value proposition of delivering superior claim outcomes for clients will continue to be a differentiator of this business versus our competitors. Further, Gallagher Bassett is an excellent [indiscernible] to our brokerage operations as it is another business that helps our clients manage and mitigate their total cost of risk. 
Moving now to clean energy. Once again, we had an excellent quarter, and we are 3 quarters into delivering nearly 15% growth in annual after-tax earnings. 
Lastly, let me speak a bit on culture. I hope you had a chance to attend or to listen to our September Investor Day. Tom Tropp, our Chief Ethics and Sustainability Officer, discussed how our unique Gallagher culture drives shareholder value. I truly hope you could take away from Tom's discussion how our culture directly contributes to our organic growth, how it distinguishes us from others in a highly competitive merger environment and how it is the basis for our people coming together as a team to service clients consistently focused on doing the right thing. 
After the meeting, we were asked why culture wasn't in Tom's title. As a simple answer to that, the Gallagher culture is every single person's responsibility, and our culture continues to flourish. 
Okay. Another great quarter and an excellent first 9 months. Over to you, Doug."

We'll do a refresher on modeling revenues, some comments on margins. We'll do an update on winding down our integration efforts. I'll move to -- and then I'll move to clean energy results, and I'll end with some comments on cash and capital management. 
Okay. Let's go to modeling revenues. I suggest using the CFO commentary document that we posted on our IR website as follows: starting on Page 2 of the CFO commentary. Adjust fourth quarter 2015 revenues for the impact of foreign currency exchange that we currently estimate at about $29 million. Remember, start by adjusting fourth quarter '15, not '16. Then apply your organic pick to that number. Next, layer in rollover M&A revenues from mergers that we completed in the first 9 months of this year. Page 5 of the CFO commentary shows that we estimate about $28 million rolling in, in the fourth quarter. 
And then, finally, make a pick -- make your own pick for new M&A revenue that might come from mergers we've closed here the fourth quarter. But please remember to assume a mid-quarter closing date. 
Following these steps should help you from over- or undershooting on revenues and avoid the related EPS impact. 
Okay, moving to margins. Adjusted brokerage EBITDAC margin expanded 20 basis points in the quarter. We continue to get some margin uplift from our international operations, but overall margin expansion was a bit muted because we have some adverse domestic medical plan experience in the quarter, cost us about 20 basis points. It's unfortunate but does happen from time to time. 
Looking towards the fourth quarter, if we hit 3% organic, and I'm not saying we will or we won't, we could hold margins flat with last year's fourth quarter or even squeak out a little expansion. 
As for the Risk Management segment, margin of 16.8% was right in line with our expectations that we shared with you at our investor meeting in September. This is really great work by the team. 
With a return to low single-digit organic in the fourth quarter, we seen margins in the lower 17% range. 
Next, let's move to integration. We're nearly finished. We're about done combining the 4 large acquisitions we did in the U.K. You can see it in the numbers. 
Third quarter integration costs were $0.04 this year versus $0.10 last year. And in the CFO commentary document, you'll see our fourth quarter estimates are -- for integration are at about $0.03, also down from $0.10 in the fourth quarter 2015. 
I'll be back in London in a couple of weeks and I look forward to congratulating the team for a really, really terrific effort over this last year. 
And also, I should -- deserves mentioning, too. Our Canadian merger is also substantially complete with their integration efforts. So it's really nice work to those folks up in Canada, too. 
Moving next to clean energy. We heard Pat say that we had another excellent third quarter, and we remain on track to deliver about 15% earnings growth over last year. Warmer weather helped us beat our forecast in the third quarter, but production might me a little lower in the fourth quarter because we haven't seen much cold weather yet. 
For example, you'll see that there's still a lot of green in the ivy at Wrigley tonight. And don't forget that our production has not only reduced our current year taxes, but we have also generated $430 million of credit that are sitting in our balance sheet. Effectively, that's a $430 million receivable from the government that will help us reduce our cash taxes paid for many, many years. We believe this has meaningful value for the shareholders. 
We also have about $230 million of available cash on our balance sheet. And as I've commented on before, we're making really good progress our bank account consolidation efforts that help us unlock available cash. 
So looking forward, you heard Pat say that our M&A pipeline is strong. We've got nice cash and nice cash flows developing. So I think that we can fund our activity for the remainder -- our M&A activity for the remainder of this year with cash and debt. 
As for 2017, I see even stronger cash flows, given integration will be behind us, and we won't have real estate moves that we have this year either. So we should be well positioned in 2017 to continue funding M&A with free cash and debt. 
So over my comments and another quarter and an excellent first 9 months of the year. Back to you, Pat."

The exchange is one of the things that we help our clients take a look at is they decide how they're going to treat the employee base. We look really at what we're doing from a consulting standpoint as a view of the total rewards that a client is going to use to maintain the employment of their best people. Really, when you come down to it, every business is all about people. And so you have to look at the entire list of benefits that you're going to provide and then figure out how you're going to actually work to help insurance into that. So exchange is popular. We've got probably about 15% of our clients out there taking a serious look at our exchange. And the rest are going to treat their insurance in a more traditional manner."

If you listen to our September 23 IR Day, I got on the high horse a little bit about supplementals and contingents versus base contingent -- base commissions and fees. I think that you should evaluate us using all-in organic or at least combine the base and supplementals because contingents can be a little bit volatile. Like I said in September, it's important for everybody to understand in 1 year, we may place a piece of -- place of policy with a carrier that have a strong base commissions and doesn't pay much in supplementals. The next year, that policy might be better for the customer to be placed with another carrier that pays higher supplementals at a lower base or maybe that carry would pay contingent step. We are completely in different in how that gets classified in our financial statements. As long as we're being compensated appropriately and with full transparency to our clients. We've got to do the right thing for our clients first, and we can't worry about where that gets posted in our financial statement. So we have had strong growth in supplementals and contingents.

Before I get down to some serious business, I have to start the call by saying go Cubs. With me this morning is Doug Howell, our Chief Financial Officer; as well as the heads of our operating divisions. 
As I do every quarter, today, we're going to touch on the 4 key components of our strategy to drive shareholder value. Those 4 are, one, organic growth; two, growing our business through mergers and acquisitions; three, improving our quality and productivity; and fourth, maintaining a very unique Gallagher culture. 
The team executed on all 4 of these pillars this past quarter and on a year-to-date basis. 
First, let me start with organic growth. In our Brokerage segment, we posted all inorganic of 3.4%, up nicely over second quarter and right in line with our year-to-date organic of 3.6%. 
I recently returned from the Council of Insurance Agents and Brokers' Annual Meeting, where I met with more than 20 insurance carriers. Based on my conversations with carriers and consistent with our own experience in data, we continue to see the domestic pricing environment as stable. In fact, rate and exposure only had a little over 1 point of negative impact on our domestic property/casualty renewal results in the third quarter. 
I also spent time with our leadership teams in the U.K., Canada, Australia and New Zealand over the past few weeks, and pricing outside the U.S. remains broadly soft. So I see environment for us that could lead to organic growth in the fourth quarter similar to what we saw through the first 9 months of this year. Clearly, that depends on our new and lost business in the fourth quarter. And you may recall, we did have a very large new business month in December of 2015. 
Let me break down our organic around the world. I'm extremely pleased that every single division around the world posted organic growth in the quarter. Our sales culture is truly alive and well. 
Domestically, we saw about 4% organic growth. Within our retail P&C, operation up 3%; wholesale was up 1%; and benefits up nicely, over 5%. We did experience some incremental pressure within our wholesale unit, driven by continued weak property pricing in the quarter, with domestic casualty lines pricing remained similar to last year. 
Exposure units are showing some growth, offsetting some of the rate pressure. Property/casualty insurance market remains in a level where our production teams can grow organically and outperform. 
Our employee benefit consulting operation continues to see great new business opportunities. This business could typically grow us more in the second half of the year, and it did nicely here in the third quarter, and organic growth looks promising for the fourth quarter, too. 
In August, we released results of our annual Benefits Strategy & Benchmarking Survey, one of the large of its kind, with over 3,000 U.S. employers participating. This type of thought leadership and research is a great value to our clients and invaluable, and we are showing new prospects our best capabilities and insights. 
Let me move to our international brokerage operations. As I discussed in our July earnings call and our September 23 Investor Day, all of our operations globally are working together, with integrated sales plans and are living and breathing our unique Gallagher culture. This quarter, we saw 2% organic from our U.K. and Canadian teams and similar organic growth from our teams in New Zealand and Australia. This is simply excellent work as these international teams continue to grow through a rate and exposure headwind that is different than we are seeing here domestically. 
Next, let me move to merger and acquisition growth. The average size for the 7 acquisitions this quarter is $4 million of revenue at an average of 7.6x EBITDAC, putting our year-to-date multiple at 7x. Third quarter acquisition activity was a little slower than normal, but our pipeline remains very robust. 
We have approximately $90 million of revenue associated with agreed-upon term sheets and another $140 million of revenues with term sheets issued being prepared. While not all of these transactions will close, I do think we'll catch up to a more normal pace of transactions here in the fourth quarter. Our pipeline is as strong as ever and full of small, independent entrepreneurs with strong sales skills and excellent client relationships. 
Looking forward towards 2017, we will continue to focus on smaller tuck-in mergers, where we believe we can create value by giving these professionals full access to our capabilities, expertise and resources. 
I want to stop and thank all of our new partners for joining us and extend a very warm-up welcome to our growing Gallagher family of professionals. 
So how did we do through the first 3 quarters in our Brokerage segment? Over 9% total adjusted revenue growth, of which 3.6% is organic; adjusted EBITDAC growth of 11%; adjusted EBITDAC margin expansion of 47 basis points, and we continue to have an excellent merger and acquisition pipeline at fair multiples. 
I couldn't be more pleased with our 9 months' result in the Brokerage segment. 
Next, I'd like to move to our Risk Management segment, which is primarily Gallagher Bassett Services. Risk Management had a nice rebound from the second quarter, with organic back-end-positive territory. The turnaround from the second quarter is due to a smaller impact from performance bonus income and more normal patterns of the business. Client retention rates remain strong, and client satisfaction, both in the U.S. and internationally, continues to enhance GB's reputation and standing, with new sales results surpassing prior year. Going forward, for the Risk Management segment, we believe we can deliver positive organic in the fourth quarter and even better organic in 2017 as recent new business wins in Australia and the U.K. come online. 
Our value proposition of delivering superior claim outcomes for clients will continue to be a differentiator of this business versus our competitors. Further, Gallagher Bassett is an excellent [indiscernible] to our brokerage operations as it is another business that helps our clients manage and mitigate their total cost of risk. 
Moving now to clean energy. Once again, we had an excellent quarter, and we are 3 quarters into delivering nearly 15% growth in annual after-tax earnings. 
Lastly, let me speak a bit on culture. I hope you had a chance to attend or to listen to our September Investor Day. Tom Tropp, our Chief Ethics and Sustainability Officer, discussed how our unique Gallagher culture drives shareholder value. I truly hope you could take away from Tom's discussion how our culture directly contributes to our organic growth, how it distinguishes us from others in a highly competitive merger environment and how it is the basis for our people coming together as a team to service clients consistently focused on doing the right thing. 
After the meeting, we were asked why culture wasn't in Tom's title. As a simple answer to that, the Gallagher culture is every single person's responsibility, and our culture continues to flourish. 
Okay. Another great quarter and an excellent first 9 months. Over to you, Doug."

We'll do a refresher on modeling revenues, some comments on margins. We'll do an update on winding down our integration efforts. I'll move to -- and then I'll move to clean energy results, and I'll end with some comments on cash and capital management. 
Okay. Let's go to modeling revenues. I suggest using the CFO commentary document that we posted on our IR website as follows: starting on Page 2 of the CFO commentary. Adjust fourth quarter 2015 revenues for the impact of foreign currency exchange that we currently estimate at about $29 million. Remember, start by adjusting fourth quarter '15, not '16. Then apply your organic pick to that number. Next, layer in rollover M&A revenues from mergers that we completed in the first 9 months of this year. Page 5 of the CFO commentary shows that we estimate about $28 million rolling in, in the fourth quarter. 
And then, finally, make a pick -- make your own pick for new M&A revenue that might come from mergers we've closed here the fourth quarter. But please remember to assume a mid-quarter closing date. 
Following these steps should help you from over- or undershooting on revenues and avoid the related EPS impact. 
Okay, moving to margins. Adjusted brokerage EBITDAC margin expanded 20 basis points in the quarter. We continue to get some margin uplift from our international operations, but overall margin expansion was a bit muted because we have some adverse domestic medical plan experience in the quarter, cost us about 20 basis points. It's unfortunate but does happen from time to time. 
Looking towards the fourth quarter, if we hit 3% organic, and I'm not saying we will or we won't, we could hold margins flat with last year's fourth quarter or even squeak out a little expansion. 
As for the Risk Management segment, margin of 16.8% was right in line with our expectations that we shared with you at our investor meeting in September. This is really great work by the team. 
With a return to low single-digit organic in the fourth quarter, we seen margins in the lower 17% range. 
Next, let's move to integration. We're nearly finished. We're about done combining the 4 large acquisitions we did in the U.K. You can see it in the numbers. 
Third quarter integration costs were $0.04 this year versus $0.10 last year. And in the CFO commentary document, you'll see our fourth quarter estimates are -- for integration are at about $0.03, also down from $0.10 in the fourth quarter 2015. 
I'll be back in London in a couple of weeks and I look forward to congratulating the team for a really, really terrific effort over this last year. 
And also, I should -- deserves mentioning, too. Our Canadian merger is also substantially complete with their integration efforts. So it's really nice work to those folks up in Canada, too. 
Moving next to clean energy. We heard Pat say that we had another excellent third quarter, and we remain on track to deliver about 15% earnings growth over last year. Warmer weather helped us beat our forecast in the third quarter, but production might me a little lower in the fourth quarter because we haven't seen much cold weather yet. 
For example, you'll see that there's still a lot of green in the ivy at Wrigley tonight. And don't forget that our production has not only reduced our current year taxes, but we have also generated $430 million of credit that are sitting in our balance sheet. Effectively, that's a $430 million receivable from the government that will help us reduce our cash taxes paid for many, many years. We believe this has meaningful value for the shareholders. 
We also have about $230 million of available cash on our balance sheet. And as I've commented on before, we're making really good progress our bank account consolidation efforts that help us unlock available cash. 
So looking forward, you heard Pat say that our M&A pipeline is strong. We've got nice cash and nice cash flows developing. So I think that we can fund our activity for the remainder -- our M&A activity for the remainder of this year with cash and debt. 
As for 2017, I see even stronger cash flows, given integration will be behind us, and we won't have real estate moves that we have this year either. So we should be well positioned in 2017 to continue funding M&A with free cash and debt. 
So over my comments and another quarter and an excellent first 9 months of the year. Back to you, Pat."

We look really at what we're doing from a consulting standpoint as a view of the total rewards that a client is going to use to maintain the employment of their best people. Really, when you come down to it, every business is all about people.

If you listen to our September 23 IR Day, I got on the high horse a little bit about supplementals and contingents versus base contingent -- base commissions and fees. I think that you should evaluate us using all-in organic or at least combine the base and supplementals because contingents can be a little bit volatile. Like I said in September, it's important for everybody to understand in 1 year, we may place a piece of -- place of policy with a carrier that have a strong base commissions and doesn't pay much in supplementals. The next year, that policy might be better for the customer to be placed with another carrier that pays higher supplementals at a lower base or maybe that carry would pay contingent step. We are completely in different in how that gets classified in our financial statements. As long as we're being compensated appropriately and with full transparency to our clients. We've got to do the right thing for our clients first, and we can't worry about where that gets posted in our financial statement. So we have had strong growth in supplementals and contingents.

Before I get down to some serious business, I have to start the call by saying go Cubs. With me this morning is Doug Howell, our Chief Financial Officer; as well as the heads of our operating divisions. 
As I do every quarter, today, we're going to touch on the 4 key components of our strategy to drive shareholder value. Those 4 are, one, organic growth; two, growing our business through mergers and acquisitions; three, improving our quality and productivity; and fourth, maintaining a very unique Gallagher culture. 
The team executed on all 4 of these pillars this past quarter and on a year-to-date basis. 
First, let me start with organic growth. In our Brokerage segment, we posted all inorganic of 3.4%, up nicely over second quarter and right in line with our year-to-date organic of 3.6%. 
I recently returned from the Council of Insurance Agents and Brokers' Annual Meeting, where I met with more than 20 insurance carriers. Based on my conversations with carriers and consistent with our own experience in data, we continue to see the domestic pricing environment as stable. In fact, rate and exposure only had a little over 1 point of negative impact on our domestic property/casualty renewal results in the third quarter. 
I also spent time with our leadership teams in the U.K., Canada, Australia and New Zealand over the past few weeks, and pricing outside the U.S. remains broadly soft. So I see environment for us that could lead to organic growth in the fourth quarter similar to what we saw through the first 9 months of this year. Clearly, that depends on our new and lost business in the fourth quarter. And you may recall, we did have a very large new business month in December of 2015. 
Let me break down our organic around the world. I'm extremely pleased that every single division around the world posted organic growth in the quarter. Our sales culture is truly alive and well. 
Domestically, we saw about 4% organic growth. Within our retail P&C, operation up 3%; wholesale was up 1%; and benefits up nicely, over 5%. We did experience some incremental pressure within our wholesale unit, driven by continued weak property pricing in the quarter, with domestic casualty lines pricing remained similar to last year. 
Exposure units are showing some growth, offsetting some of the rate pressure. Property/casualty insurance market remains in a level where our production teams can grow organically and outperform. 
Our employee benefit consulting operation continues to see great new business opportunities. This business could typically grow us more in the second half of the year, and it did nicely here in the third quarter, and organic growth looks promising for the fourth quarter, too. 
In August, we released results of our annual Benefits Strategy & Benchmarking Survey, one of the large of its kind, with over 3,000 U.S. employers participating. This type of thought leadership and research is a great value to our clients and invaluable, and we are showing new prospects our best capabilities and insights. 
Let me move to our international brokerage operations. As I discussed in our July earnings call and our September 23 Investor Day, all of our operations globally are working together, with integrated sales plans and are living and breathing our unique Gallagher culture. This quarter, we saw 2% organic from our U.K. and Canadian teams and similar organic growth from our teams in New Zealand and Australia. This is simply excellent work as these international teams continue to grow through a rate and exposure headwind that is different than we are seeing here domestically. 
Next, let me move to merger and acquisition growth. The average size for the 7 acquisitions this quarter is $4 million of revenue at an average of 7.6x EBITDAC, putting our year-to-date multiple at 7x. Third quarter acquisition activity was a little slower than normal, but our pipeline remains very robust. 
We have approximately $90 million of revenue associated with agreed-upon term sheets and another $140 million of revenues with term sheets issued being prepared. While not all of these transactions will close, I do think we'll catch up to a more normal pace of transactions here in the fourth quarter. Our pipeline is as strong as ever and full of small, independent entrepreneurs with strong sales skills and excellent client relationships. 
Looking forward towards 2017, we will continue to focus on smaller tuck-in mergers, where we believe we can create value by giving these professionals full access to our capabilities, expertise and resources. 
I want to stop and thank all of our new partners for joining us and extend a very warm-up welcome to our growing Gallagher family of professionals. 
So how did we do through the first 3 quarters in our Brokerage segment? Over 9% total adjusted revenue growth, of which 3.6% is organic; adjusted EBITDAC growth of 11%; adjusted EBITDAC margin expansion of 47 basis points, and we continue to have an excellent merger and acquisition pipeline at fair multiples. 
I couldn't be more pleased with our 9 months' result in the Brokerage segment. 
Next, I'd like to move to our Risk Management segment, which is primarily Gallagher Bassett Services. Risk Management had a nice rebound from the second quarter, with organic back-end-positive territory. The turnaround from the second quarter is due to a smaller impact from performance bonus income and more normal patterns of the business. Client retention rates remain strong, and client satisfaction, both in the U.S. and internationally, continues to enhance GB's reputation and standing, with new sales results surpassing prior year. Going forward, for the Risk Management segment, we believe we can deliver positive organic in the fourth quarter and even better organic in 2017 as recent new business wins in Australia and the U.K. come online. 
Our value proposition of delivering superior claim outcomes for clients will continue to be a differentiator of this business versus our competitors. Further, Gallagher Bassett is an excellent complement to our brokerage operations as it is another business that helps our clients manage and mitigate their total cost of risk. 
Moving now to clean energy. Once again, we had an excellent quarter, and we are 3 quarters into delivering nearly 15% growth in annual after-tax earnings. 
Lastly, let me speak a bit on culture. I hope you had a chance to attend or to listen to our September Investor Day. Tom Tropp, our Chief Ethics and Sustainability Officer, discussed how our unique Gallagher culture drives shareholder value. I truly hope you could take away from Tom's discussion how our culture directly contributes to our organic growth, how it distinguishes us from others in a highly competitive merger environment and how it is the basis for our people coming together as a team to service clients consistently focused on doing the right thing. 
After the meeting, we were asked why culture wasn't in Tom's title. As a simple answer to that, the Gallagher culture is every single person's responsibility, and our culture continues to flourish. 
Okay. Another great quarter and an excellent first 9 months. Over to you, Doug."

Thanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone. Why he's like that, it's another excellent quarter by the team. Today, I have 5 items. We'll do a refresher on modeling revenues, some comments on margins.

We'll do a refresher on modeling revenues, some comments on margins. We'll do an update on winding down our integration efforts. I'll move to -- and then I'll move to clean energy results, and I'll end with some comments on cash and capital management. 
Okay. Let's go to modeling revenues. I suggest using the CFO commentary document that we posted on our IR website as follows: starting on Page 2 of the CFO commentary. Adjust fourth quarter 2015 revenues for the impact of foreign currency exchange that we currently estimate at about $29 million. Remember, start by adjusting fourth quarter '15, not '16. Then apply your organic pick to that number. Next, layer in rollover M&A revenues from mergers that we completed in the first 9 months of this year. Page 5 of the CFO commentary shows that we estimate about $28 million rolling in, in the fourth quarter. 
And then, finally, make a pick -- make your own pick for new M&A revenue that might come from mergers we've closed here the fourth quarter. But please remember to assume a mid-quarter closing date. 
Following these steps should help you from over- or undershooting on revenues and avoid the related EPS impact. 
Okay, moving to margins. Adjusted brokerage EBITDAC margin expanded 20 basis points in the quarter. We continue to get some margin uplift from our international operations, but overall margin expansion was a bit muted because we have some adverse domestic medical plan experience in the quarter, cost us about 20 basis points. It's unfortunate but does happen from time to time. 
Looking towards the fourth quarter, if we hit 3% organic, and I'm not saying we will or we won't, we could hold margins flat with last year's fourth quarter or even squeak out a little expansion. 
As for the Risk Management segment, margin of 16.8% was right in line with our expectations that we shared with you at our investor meeting in September. This is really great work by the team. 
With a return to low single-digit organic in the fourth quarter, we seen margins in the lower 17% range. 
Next, let's move to integration. We're nearly finished. We're about done combining the 4 large acquisitions we did in the U.K. You can see it in the numbers. 
Third quarter integration costs were $0.04 this year versus $0.10 last year. And in the CFO commentary document, you'll see our fourth quarter estimates are -- for integration are at about $0.03, also down from $0.10 in the fourth quarter 2015. 
I'll be back in London in a couple of weeks and I look forward to congratulating the team for a really, really terrific effort over this last year. 
And also, I should -- deserves mentioning, too. Our Canadian merger is also substantially complete with their integration efforts. So it's really nice work to those folks up in Canada, too. 
Moving next to clean energy. We heard Pat say that we had another excellent third quarter, and we remain on track to deliver about 15% earnings growth over last year. Warmer weather helped us beat our forecast in the third quarter, but production might me a little lower in the fourth quarter because we haven't seen much cold weather yet. 
For example, you'll see that there's still a lot of green in the ivy at Wrigley tonight. And don't forget that our production has not only reduced our current year taxes, but we have also generated $430 million of credit that are sitting in our balance sheet. Effectively, that's a $430 million receivable from the government that will help us reduce our cash taxes paid for many, many years. We believe this has meaningful value for the shareholders. 
We also have about $230 million of available cash on our balance sheet. And as I've commented on before, we're making really good progress our bank account consolidation efforts that help us unlock available cash. 
So looking forward, you heard Pat say that our M&A pipeline is strong. We've got nice cash and nice cash flows developing. So I think that we can fund our activity for the remainder -- our M&A activity for the remainder of this year with cash and debt. 
As for 2017, I see even stronger cash flows, given integration will be behind us, and we won't have real estate moves that we have this year either. So we should be well positioned in 2017 to continue funding M&A with free cash and debt. 
So those are my comments and another great quarter and an excellent first 9 months of the year. Back to you, Pat."

And what that does is create an awful lot of consulting opportunities for us. Our clients need a lot of help. The exchange is one of the things that we help our clients take a look at as they decide how they're going to treat their employee base. We look at the -- we look really at what we're doing from a consulting standpoint as a view of the total rewards that a client is going to use to maintain the employment of their best people. Really, when you come down to it, every business is all about people. And so you have to look at the entire list of benefits that you're going to provide and then figure out how you're going to actually work to help insurance into that. So exchange is popular. We've got probably about 15% of our clients out there taking a serious look at our exchange. And the rest are going to treat their insurance in a more traditional manner."

So that's why we end up with a de minimis amount of impact on our EPS. And I see, right now, I don't know if the pound going lower or not, but I would say that, that trend would continue then that you could have an impact on revenues but not that much impact on EPS."

If you listened to our September 23 IR Day, I got on my high horse a little bit about supplementals and contingents versus base contingent -- or base commissions and fees. I think that you should evaluate us using all-in organic or at least combine the base and supplementals because contingents can be a little bit volatile. Like I said in September, it's important for everybody to understand in 1 year, we may place a piece of -- place a policy with a carrier that has strong base commissions and doesn't pay much in supplementals. But next year, that policy might be better for the customer to be placed with another carrier that pays higher supplementals at a lower base or maybe that carrier would pay a contingent instead. We are completely indifferent in how that gets classified in our financial statements as long as we're being compensated appropriately and with full transparency to our clients. We've got to do the right thing for our clients first, and we can't worry about where that gets posted in our financial statements. So we have had strong growth in supplementals and contingents. And I think that's basically the carrier's preference on that rather than paying base commissions at this point."

I think M&A opportunities, there's tons of them there. And we are -- again, we just want to make sure we're picking the right partners to join us.

I think skill positions are expensive. They're going up in some of the IT security areas and other areas. And there's always competition for really good brokerage talent, too, that's out there. There's a little wage inflation. We have an opportunity to continue to push work into our centers of excellence in primarily in India and the Philippines. And so we have an opportunity to maybe reduce the impact of the domestic wage inflation by continuing to move offshore to our folks over there. So we have an opportunity to control it, but there is a little bit of inflation out there in the marketplace."

Before I get down to some serious business, I have to start the call by saying go Cubs. With me this morning is Doug Howell, our Chief Financial Officer; as well as the heads of our operating divisions. 
As I do every quarter, today we're going to touch on the 4 key components of our strategy to drive shareholder value. Those 4 are, one, organic growth; two, growing our business through mergers and acquisitions; three, improving our quality and productivity; and fourth, maintaining a very unique Gallagher culture. 
The team executed on all 4 of these pillars this past quarter and on a year-to-date basis. 
First, let me start with organic growth. In our Brokerage segment, we posted all inorganic of 3.4%, up nicely over second quarter and right in line with our year-to-date organic of 3.6%. 
I recently returned from the Council of Insurance Agents and Brokers' Annual Meeting, where I met with more than 20 insurance carriers. Based on my conversations with carriers and consistent with our own experience in data, we continue to see the domestic pricing environment as stable. In fact, rate and exposure only had a little over 1 point of negative impact on our domestic property/casualty renewal results in the third quarter. 
I also spent time with our leadership teams in the U.K., Canada, Australia and New Zealand over the past few weeks, and pricing outside the U.S. remains broadly soft. So I see an environment for us that could lead to organic growth in the fourth quarter similar to what we saw through the first 9 months of this year. Clearly, that depends on our new and lost business in the fourth quarter. And you may recall, we did have a very large new business month in December of 2015. 
Let me break down our organic around the world. I'm extremely pleased that every single division around the world posted organic growth in the quarter. Our sales culture is truly alive and well. 
Domestically, we saw about 4% organic growth. Within our retail P&C, operation up 3%; wholesale was up 1%; and benefits up nicely, over 5%. We did experience some incremental pressure within our wholesale unit, driven by continued weak property pricing in the quarter, with domestic casualty lines pricing remained similar to last year. 
Exposure units are showing some growth, offsetting some of the rate pressure. Property/casualty insurance market remains in a level where our production teams can grow organically and outperform. 
Our employee benefit consulting operation continues to see great new business opportunities. This business could typically grows more in the second half of the year, and it did nicely here in the third quarter, and organic growth looks promising for the fourth quarter, too. 
In August, we released the results of our annual Benefits Strategy & Benchmarking Survey, one of the large of its kind, with over 3,000 U.S. employers participating. This type of thought leadership and research is a great value to our clients and invaluable when we are showing new prospects our best capabilities and insights. 
Let me move to our international brokerage operations. As I discussed in our July earnings call and our September 23 Investor Day, all of our operations globally are working together, with integrated sales plans and are living and breathing our unique Gallagher culture. This quarter, we saw 2% organic from our U.K. and Canadian teams and similar organic growth from our teams in New Zealand and Australia. This is simply excellent work as these international teams continue to grow through a rate and exposure headwind that is stiffer than we are seeing here domestically. 
Next, let me move to merger and acquisition growth. The average size for the 7 acquisitions this quarter is $4 million of revenue at an average of 7.6x EBITDAC, putting our year-to-date multiple at 7x. Third quarter acquisition activity was a little slower than normal, but our pipeline remains very robust. 
We have approximately $90 million of revenue associated with agreed-upon term sheets and another $140 million of revenues with term sheets issued or being prepared. While not all of these transactions will close, I do think we'll catch up to a more normal pace of transactions here in the fourth quarter. Our pipeline is as strong as ever and full of small, independent entrepreneurs with strong sales skills and excellent client relationships. 
Looking forward towards 2017, we will continue to focus on smaller tuck-in mergers, where we believe we can create value by giving these professionals full access to our capabilities, expertise and resources. 
I wanted to stop and thank all of our new partners for joining us and extend a very warm-up welcome to our growing Gallagher family of professionals. 
So how did we do through the first 3 quarters in our Brokerage segment? Over 9% total adjusted revenue growth, of which 3.6% is organic; adjusted EBITDAC growth of 11%; adjusted EBITDAC margin expansion of 47 basis points, and we continue to have an excellent merger and acquisition pipeline at fair multiples. 
I couldn't be more pleased with our 9 months' result in the Brokerage segment. 
Next, I'd like to move to our Risk Management segment, which is primarily Gallagher Bassett Services. Risk Management had a nice rebound from the second quarter, with organic back in positive territory. The turnaround from the second quarter is due to a smaller impact from performance bonus income and more normal patterns of new business. Client retention rates remain strong, and client satisfaction, both in the U.S. and internationally, continues to enhance GB's reputation and standing, with new sales results surpassing prior year. Going forward, for the Risk Management segment, we believe we can deliver positive organic in the fourth quarter and even better organic in 2017 as recent new business wins in Australia and the U.K. come online. 
Our value proposition of delivering superior claim outcomes for clients will continue to be a differentiator of this business versus our competitors. Further, Gallagher Bassett is an excellent complement to our brokerage operations as it is another business that helps our clients manage and mitigate their total cost of risk. 
Moving now to clean energy. Once again, we had an excellent quarter, and we are 3 quarters into delivering nearly 15% growth in annual after-tax earnings. 
Lastly, let me speak a bit on culture. I hope you had a chance to attend or to listen to our September Investor Day. Tom Tropp, our Chief Ethics and Sustainability Officer, discussed how our unique Gallagher culture drives shareholder value. I truly hope you could take away from Tom's discussion how our culture directly contributes to our organic growth, how it distinguishes us from others in a highly competitive merger environment and how it is the basis for our people coming together as a team to service clients consistently focused on doing the right thing. 
After the meeting, we were asked why culture wasn't in Tom's title. As a simple answer to that, the Gallagher culture is every single person's responsibility, and our culture continues to flourish. 
Okay. Another great quarter and an excellent first 9 months. Over to you, Doug."

Thanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone. Why he's like that, it's another excellent quarter by the team. Today, I have 5 items. We'll do a refresher on modeling revenues, some comments on margins.

We'll do a refresher on modeling revenues, some comments on margins. We'll do an update on winding down our integration efforts. I'll move to -- and then I'll move to clean energy results, and I'll end with some comments on cash and capital management. 
Okay. Let's go to modeling revenues. I suggest using the CFO commentary document that we posted on our IR website as follows: starting on Page 2 of the CFO commentary. Adjust fourth quarter 2015 revenues for the impact of foreign currency exchange that we currently estimate at about $29 million. Remember, start by adjusting fourth quarter '15, not '16. Then apply your organic pick to that number. Next, layer in rollover M&A revenues from mergers that we completed in the first 9 months of this year. Page 5 of the CFO commentary shows that we estimate about $28 million rolling in, in the fourth quarter. 
And then, finally, make a pick -- make your own pick for new M&A revenue that might come from mergers we've closed here the fourth quarter. But please remember to assume a mid-quarter closing date. 
Following these steps should help you from over- or undershooting on revenues and avoid the related EPS impact. 
Okay, moving to margins. Adjusted brokerage EBITDAC margin expanded 20 basis points in the quarter. We continue to get some margin uplift from our international operations, but overall margin expansion was a bit muted because we had some adverse domestic medical plan experience in the quarter, cost us about 20 basis points. It's unfortunate but does happen from time to time. 
Looking towards the fourth quarter, if we hit 3% organic, and I'm not saying we will or we won't, we could hold margins flat with last year's fourth quarter or even squeak out a little expansion. 
As for the Risk Management segment, margin of 16.8% was right in line with our expectations that we shared with you at our investor meeting in September. This is really great work by the team. 
With a return to low single-digit organic in the fourth quarter, we seen margins in the lower 17% range. 
Next, let's move to integration. We're nearly finished. We're about done combining the 4 large acquisitions we did in the U.K. You can see it in the numbers. 
Third quarter integration costs were $0.04 this year versus $0.10 last year. And in the CFO commentary document, you'll see our fourth quarter estimates are -- for integration are at about $0.03, also down from $0.10 in the fourth quarter 2015. 
I'll be back in London in a couple of weeks and I look forward to congratulating the team for a really, really terrific effort over this last year. 
And also, I should -- deserves mentioning, too. Our Canadian merger is also substantially complete with their integration efforts. So it's really nice work to those folks up in Canada, too. 
Moving next to clean energy. We heard Pat say that we had another excellent third quarter, and we remain on track to deliver about 15% earnings growth over last year. Warmer weather helped us beat our forecast in the third quarter, but production might me a little lower in the fourth quarter because we haven't seen much cold weather yet. 
For example, you'll see that there's still a lot of green in the ivy at Wrigley tonight. And don't forget that our production has not only reduced our current year taxes, but we have also generated $430 million of credit that are sitting in our balance sheet. Effectively, that's a $430 million receivable from the government that will help us reduce our cash taxes paid for many, many years. We believe this has meaningful value for the shareholders. 
We also have about $230 million of available cash on our balance sheet. And as I've commented on before, we're making really good progress on our bank account consolidation efforts that help us unlock available cash. 
So looking forward, you heard Pat say that our M&A pipeline is strong. We've got nice cash and nice cash flows developing. So I think that we can fund our activity for the remainder -- our M&A activity for the remainder of this year with cash and debt. 
As for 2017, I see even stronger cash flows, given integration will be behind us, and we won't have real estate moves that we had this year either. So we should be well positioned in 2017 to continue funding M&A with free cash and debt. 
So those are my comments and another great quarter and an excellent first 9 months of the year. Back to you, Pat."

The exchange is one of the things that we help our clients take a look at as they decide how they're going to treat their employee base. We look at the -- we look really at what we're doing from a consulting standpoint as a view of the total rewards that a client is going to use to maintain the employment of their best people. Really, when you come down to it, every business is all about people. And so you have to look at the entire list of benefits that you're going to provide and then figure out how you're going to actually work to health insurance into that. So exchange is popular.

If you listened to our September 23 IR Day, I got on my high horse a little bit about supplementals and contingents versus base contingent -- or base commissions and fees. I think that you should evaluate us using all-in organic or at least combine the base and supplementals because contingents can be a little bit volatile. Like I said in September, it's important for everybody to understand in 1 year, we may place a piece of -- place a policy with a carrier that has strong base commissions and doesn't pay much in supplementals. But next year, that policy might be better for the customer to be placed with another carrier that pays higher supplementals at a lower base or maybe that carrier would pay a contingent instead. We are completely indifferent in how that gets classified in our financial statements as long as we're being compensated appropriately and with full transparency to our clients. We've got to do the right thing for our clients first, and we can't worry about where that gets posted in our financial statements. So we have had strong growth in supplementals and contingents.

And there's always competition for really good brokerage talent, too, that's out there. There's a little wage inflation. We have an opportunity to continue to push work into our centers of excellence in primarily in India and the Philippines. And so we have an opportunity to maybe reduce the impact of the domestic wage inflation by continuing to move offshore to our folks over there. So we have an opportunity to control it, but there is a little bit of inflation out there in the marketplace."

Before I get down to some serious business, I have to start the call by saying go Cubs. With me this morning is Doug Howell, our Chief Financial Officer; as well as the heads of our operating divisions. 
As I do every quarter, today we're going to touch on the 4 key components of our strategy to drive shareholder value. Those 4 are, one, organic growth; two, growing our business through mergers and acquisitions; three, improving our quality and productivity; and fourth, maintaining a very unique Gallagher culture. 
The team executed on all 4 of these pillars this past quarter and on a year-to-date basis. 
First, let me start with organic growth. In our Brokerage segment, we posted all inorganic of 3.4%, up nicely over second quarter and right in line with our year-to-date organic of 3.6%. 
I recently returned from the Council of Insurance Agents and Brokers' Annual Meeting, where I met with more than 20 insurance carriers. Based on my conversations with carriers and consistent with our own experience in data, we continue to see the domestic pricing environment as stable. In fact, rate and exposure only had a little over 1 point of negative impact on our domestic property/casualty renewal results in the third quarter. 
I also spent time with our leadership teams in the U.K., Canada, Australia and New Zealand over the past few weeks, and pricing outside the U.S. remains broadly soft. So I see an environment for us that could lead to organic growth in the fourth quarter similar to what we saw through the first 9 months of this year. Clearly, that depends on our new and lost business in the fourth quarter. And you may recall, we did have a very large new business month in December of 2015. 
Let me break down our organic around the world. I'm extremely pleased that every single division around the world posted organic growth in the quarter. Our sales culture is truly alive and well. 
Domestically, we saw about 4% organic growth. Within our retail P&C, operation up 3%; wholesale was up 1%; and benefits up nicely, over 5%. We did experience some incremental pressure within our wholesale unit, driven by continued weak property pricing in the quarter, with domestic casualty lines pricing remained similar to last year. 
Exposure units are showing some growth, offsetting some of the rate pressure. Property/casualty insurance market remains in a level where our production teams can grow organically and outperform. 
Our employee benefit consulting operation continues to see great new business opportunities. This business could typically grows more in the second half of the year, and it did nicely here in the third quarter, and organic growth looks promising for the fourth quarter, too. 
In August, we released the results of our annual Benefits Strategy & Benchmarking Survey, one of the large of its kind, with over 3,000 U.S. employers participating. This type of thought leadership and research is a great value to our clients and invaluable when we are showing new prospects our best capabilities and insights. 
Let me move to our international brokerage operations. As I discussed in our July earnings call and our September 23 Investor Day, all of our operations globally are working together, with integrated sales plans and are living and breathing our unique Gallagher culture. This quarter, we saw 2% organic from our U.K. and Canadian teams and similar organic growth from our teams in New Zealand and Australia. This is simply excellent work as these international teams continue to grow through a rate and exposure headwind that is stiffer than we are seeing here domestically. 
Next, let me move to merger and acquisition growth. The average size for the 7 acquisitions this quarter is $4 million of revenue at an average of 7.6x EBITDAC, putting our year-to-date multiple at 7x. Third quarter acquisition activity was a little slower than normal, but our pipeline remains very robust. 
We have approximately $90 million of revenue associated with agreed-upon term sheets and another $140 million of revenues with term sheets issued or being prepared. While not all of these transactions will close, I do think we'll catch up to a more normal pace of transactions here in the fourth quarter. Our pipeline is as strong as ever and full of small, independent entrepreneurs with strong sales skills and excellent client relationships. 
Looking forward towards 2017, we will continue to focus on smaller tuck-in mergers, where we believe we can create value by giving these professionals full access to our capabilities, expertise and resources. 
I wanted to stop and thank all of our new partners for joining us and extend a very warm-up welcome to our growing Gallagher family of professionals. 
So how did we do through the first 3 quarters in our Brokerage segment? Over 9% total adjusted revenue growth, of which 3.6% is organic; adjusted EBITDAC growth of 11%; adjusted EBITDAC margin expansion of 47 basis points, and we continue to have an excellent merger and acquisition pipeline at fair multiples. 
I couldn't be more pleased with our 9 months' result in the Brokerage segment. 
Next, I'd like to move to our Risk Management segment, which is primarily Gallagher Bassett Services. Risk Management had a nice rebound from the second quarter, with organic back in positive territory. The turnaround from the second quarter is due to a smaller impact from performance bonus income and more normal patterns of new business. Client retention rates remain strong, and client satisfaction, both in the U.S. and internationally, continues to enhance GB's reputation and standing, with new sales results surpassing prior year. Going forward, for the Risk Management segment, we believe we can deliver positive organic in the fourth quarter and even better organic in 2017 as recent new business wins in Australia and the U.K. come online. 
Our value proposition of delivering superior claim outcomes for clients will continue to be a differentiator of this business versus our competitors. Further, Gallagher Bassett is an excellent complement to our brokerage operations as it is another business that helps our clients manage and mitigate their total cost of risk. 
Moving now to clean energy. Once again, we had an excellent quarter, and we are 3 quarters into delivering nearly 15% growth in annual after-tax earnings. 
Lastly, let me speak a bit on culture. I hope you had a chance to attend or to listen to our September Investor Day. Tom Tropp, our Chief Ethics and Sustainability Officer, discussed how our unique Gallagher culture drives shareholder value. I truly hope you could take away from Tom's discussion how our culture directly contributes to our organic growth, how it distinguishes us from others in a highly competitive merger environment and how it is the basis for our people coming together as a team to service clients consistently focused on doing the right thing. 
After the meeting, we were asked why culture wasn't in Tom's title. As a simple answer to that, the Gallagher culture is every single person's responsibility, and our culture continues to flourish. 
Okay. Another great quarter and an excellent first 9 months. Over to you, Doug."

Okay. Let's go to modeling revenues. I suggest using the CFO commentary document that we posted on our IR website as follows: starting on Page 2 of the CFO commentary. Adjust fourth quarter 2015 revenues for the impact of foreign currency exchange that we currently estimate at about $29 million. Remember, start by adjusting fourth quarter '15, not '16. Then apply your organic pick to that number. Next, layer in rollover M&A revenues from mergers that we completed in the first 9 months of this year. Page 5 of the CFO commentary shows that we estimate about $28 million rolling in, in the fourth quarter. 
And then, finally, make a pick -- make your own pick for new M&A revenue that might come from mergers we've closed here the fourth quarter. But please remember to assume a mid-quarter closing date. 
Following these steps should help you from over- or undershooting on revenues and avoid the related EPS impact. 
Okay, moving to margins. Adjusted brokerage EBITDAC margin expanded 20 basis points in the quarter. We continue to get some margin uplift from our international operations, but overall margin expansion was a bit muted because we had some adverse domestic medical plan experience in the quarter, cost us about 20 basis points. It's unfortunate but does happen from time to time. 
Looking towards the fourth quarter, if we hit 3% organic, and I'm not saying we will or we won't, we could hold margins flat with last year's fourth quarter or even squeak out a little expansion. 
As for the Risk Management segment, margin of 16.8% was right in line with our expectations that we shared with you at our investor meeting in September. This is really great work by the team. 
With a return to low single-digit organic in the fourth quarter, we seen margins in the lower 17% range. 
Next, let's move to integration. We're nearly finished. We're about done combining the 4 large acquisitions we did in the U.K. You can see it in the numbers. 
Third quarter integration costs were $0.04 this year versus $0.10 last year. And in the CFO commentary document, you'll see our fourth quarter estimates are -- for integration are at about $0.03, also down from $0.10 in the fourth quarter 2015. 
I'll be back in London in a couple of weeks and I look forward to congratulating the team for a really, really terrific effort over this last year. 
And also, I should -- deserves mentioning, too. Our Canadian merger is also substantially complete with their integration efforts. So it's really nice work to those folks up in Canada, too. 
Moving next to clean energy. We heard Pat say that we had another excellent third quarter, and we remain on track to deliver about 15% earnings growth over last year. Warmer weather helped us beat our forecast in the third quarter, but production might me a little lower in the fourth quarter because we haven't seen much cold weather yet. 
For example, you'll see that there's still a lot of green in the ivy at Wrigley tonight. And don't forget that our production has not only reduced our current year taxes, but we have also generated $430 million of credit that are sitting in our balance sheet. Effectively, that's a $430 million receivable from the government that will help us reduce our cash taxes paid for many, many years. We believe this has meaningful value for the shareholders. 
We also have about $230 million of available cash on our balance sheet. And as I've commented on before, we're making really good progress on our bank account consolidation efforts that help us unlock available cash. 
So looking forward, you heard Pat say that our M&A pipeline is strong. We've got nice cash and nice cash flows developing. So I think that we can fund our activity for the remainder -- our M&A activity for the remainder of this year with cash and debt. 
As for 2017, I see even stronger cash flows, given integration will be behind us, and we won't have real estate moves that we had this year either. So we should be well positioned in 2017 to continue funding M&A with free cash and debt. 
So those are my comments and another great quarter and an excellent first 9 months of the year. Back to you, Pat."

If you listened to our September 23 IR Day, I got on my high horse a little bit about supplementals and contingents versus base contingent -- or base commissions and fees. I think that you should evaluate us using all-in organic or at least combine the base and supplementals because contingents can be a little bit volatile. Like I said in September, it's important for everybody to understand in 1 year, we may place a piece of -- place a policy with a carrier that has strong base commissions and doesn't pay much in supplementals. But next year, that policy might be better for the customer to be placed with another carrier that pays higher supplementals at a lower base or maybe that carrier would pay a contingent instead. We are completely indifferent in how that gets classified in our financial statements as long as we're being compensated appropriately and with full transparency to our clients. We've got to do the right thing for our clients first, and we can't worry about where that gets posted in our financial statements. So we have had strong growth in supplementals and contingents. And I think that's basically the carrier's preference on that rather than paying base commissions at this point."
