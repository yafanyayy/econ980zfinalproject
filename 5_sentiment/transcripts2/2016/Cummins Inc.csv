I'll start with a summary of our fourth quarter and full-year results and finish with a discussion of our outlook for 2016. Pat will then take you through more details about our fourth quarter financial performance and our forecast for this year. 
Included in our fourth quarter results were 3 unusual charges, which I'll cover before summarizing our operating results. As market conditions weakened in the fourth quarter, we made a decision to scale back the range of light-duty engines that we plan to manufacture in North America. This decision, combined with the uncertainty of winning additional customers with our V8 engine in the short term, caused us to reassess the book value of our light-duty manufacturing assets in North America in the fourth quarter. 
As a result of our evaluation, we recorded a noncash pretax impairment charge of $211 million. While it's disappointing to record the charge, we remain committed to our light-duty engine customers and confident in the growth prospects for our light-duty engine business globally, including the V8 engine in North America. 
Included in the fourth quarter Engine business results is a $60 million charge related to a quality issue impacting specific population of vehicles manufactured by one OEM customer. The quality issue is a result of a defect in the substrate wash coat within a third-party aftertreatment system which is paired with our engines in an OEM vehicle. Cummins did not manufacture or sell the aftertreatment system and does not provide warranty on the OEM vehicle. As the defect is impacting performance of the overall engine system, we are taking responsibility for the effort to resolve the issue and have recorded the cost of the campaign and other related costs in other expense. 
In addition, as expected, we recorded a restructuring charge of $90 million in the fourth quarter. We reduced our workforce by more than 1,900 people, including 1,700 professional staff and we expect that these actions will result in a full-year cost savings of $160 million. 
Now let me summarize our fourth quarter and full-year results and comment on key drivers of the results within each business. All references to EBIT and EBIT percent exclude restructuring and impairment charges. 
Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2015 were $4.8 billion, a decrease of 6% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. Gross margins of 25.4% were the same as the year-ago despite the lower sales due primarily to strong execution on material cost reduction projects and lower warranty costs. Operating expenses declined year-over-year, both in dollars and as a percent of sales. EBIT was $531 million or 11.1% compared to $661 million or 13% a year ago. EBIT percent declined due to a change in other income or expense. 
In the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded a charge for the quality campaign that I've just described in the fourth quarter. And in the fourth quarter of 2014, we generated one-time gains on distributor acquisitions. These 2 items explain the majority of the variance in other income or expense. 
For the full year, Cummins sales were $19.1 billion, down 1% year-over-year. Gross margin of 25.9% improved by 50 basis points as a result of material cost savings and lower warranty costs which more than offset the negative impacts of currency and lower volumes. Operating expenses declined in dollars and as a percent of sales. Our full year EBIT margin was 12.5%, down from 13.2% in 2014. EBIT percent declined due to the change in other income or expense, largely for the same reasons that I just described for the fourth quarter, lower gains on distributor acquisitions and the impact of the quality campaign. 
The Components segment delivered strong fourth quarter and full-year performance, which is largely attributable to strong execution on a number of cost reduction initiatives and successfully capturing profitable growth in China as new emissions regulations came into force. 
Within the Distribution business, we've successfully completed the acquisition and integration of 3 distributors in 2015, for a total of 10 acquisitions over the past 2 years. Despite challenging economic conditions, the financial benefits of these acquisitions exceeded our 2013 projection, yielding $0.63 per share of additional earnings over 2 years compared to our original projection of $0.50 per share. 
EBIT margins of existing distributor operations improved by 90 basis points in 2015 and we expect further operational improvements in 2016. Unfortunately, the improvement in underlying performance in 2015 were masked by the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar, which caused a result of international operations to translate into fewer U.S. dollars. We expect the stronger U.S. dollar to be a continuing challenge in 2016. 
The Engine business faced challenging off-highway market throughout 2015 and had to adjust to sharp reduction in heavy-duty truck volumes in North America in the second half of the year. Our production of engines for Class 8 trucks declined by 28% between the second and fourth quarter of 2015. We quickly responded to the demand drop by flexing down our operating cost in our Jamestown Engine Plant which will help protect margins as we head into a weaker 2016. The Engine business also made significant progress in reducing product quality and warranty cost during 2015. Warranty cost as a percent of sales improved by 90 basis points from the first half of 2015 to the second half and we expect cost to improve further in 2016. 
The main challenge facing the Power Generation Business is weak global demand, especially for larger units. We do not believe that the fourth quarter results represent a run rate for future performance as we did incur some additional cost that we do not anticipate will repeat in future quarters. We expect improvement in our EBIT percent in 2016 as a result of our restructuring and other cost reduction work in Power Generation. 
Now I will comment on some of our key markets in 2015, starting with North America and then I'll comment on some of our largest international markets. Our revenues in North America grew 7% in 2015, with approximately 3% of the growth coming from acquisitions in our Distribution business. Industry production of North America in heavy-duty trucks reached approximately 290,000 units in 2015, an increase of 9% from 2014 levels. Our full-year market share was 33%, down from 35% in 2014. 
The market size for medium-duty trucks was approximately 124,000 units in 2015, in line with 2014. And our market share improved by 610 basis points to 78%. Shipments to Chrysler increased by 5% in 2015 to 130,000 units reflecting strong demand in the U.S. for pickup trucks. Engine shipments to industrial off-highway markets in North America declined by 29% year-over-year, reflecting weaker demand in all end markets except rail where we picked up market share following the transition to Tier 4 Final Emission Standards. Revenues in our Power Generation Business decreased by 9% with shipment to the U.S. Military down 12% and lower demand from U.S. data center customers. 
Our international revenues declined by 11% in 2015. In Brazil our revenues decreased 48% due to a 50% reduction in truck production as the economy fell into recession and a more than 30% depreciation of the real against the U.S. dollar. 
Revenues in our Power Generation and Distribution business fell less than in our on-highway business while conditions remain very challenging in all end markets. 
Our full-year revenues in China, including joint ventures, were $3.3 billion, in line with 2014 as we significantly outperformed very weak end markets. Industry demand for medium and heavy-duty trucks in China decreased by 24% for the full year as the industrial economy slowed. Our market share reached 18% in the fourth quarter of 2015, taking our full-year market share above 16% and up 460 basis points compared to 2014. This represents significant achievement in a very competitive market. In addition, our Components business capitalized on the transition to NS4 emission standards, delivering 17% revenue growth despite the sharp decline in market size. 
Shipments of our light-duty engine in China increased by 5% in a market that declined 6%, as Foton increased the proportion of its trucks powered by our joint venture engines, displacing local competitor engines. Our full-year share in the light-duty truck market exceeded 6% in 2015, up 140 basis points. 
Cummins share of earnings from our joint ventures at Foton increased by $60 million in 2015. Our heavy-duty engine joint venture was consistently profitable from the second quarter onwards, less than a year after production started there. 
Industry demand for excavators in China dropped 38% in 2015, the fourth consecutive year of decline. And demand for Power Generation equipment dropped more than 10% due to weaker infrastructure investment. Our revenues in bulk [ph] markets declined a little less than industry demand. 
Full-year revenues in India, including joint ventures were $1.5 billion, a 15% increase over 2014. Industry truck production increased 28% to 318,000 units and our market share was 41% versus 42% a year ago. 
Our penetration within Tata Motors increased year-over-year. However, this was offset by a decline in Tata's truck share. Revenues for our Power Generation Business increased by 6%, in line with the pace of the economy. 
Now let me provide our overall outlook for 2016 and then comment on individual regions and end markets. 
We are currently forecasting total company revenues to decline by 5% to 9%, driven by a decline on heavy-duty truck production in North America, continued weakness in the global off-highway and power generation markets and further strengthening of the U.S. dollar against a number of currencies. Industry production for heavy-duty trucks in North America is projected to be 220,000 units, a 25% decrease year-over-year with our market share projected to be between 30% and 33%. 
In the medium-duty truck market, we expect the market size to be 124,000 units or flat compared to 2015. We project our market share to be between 72% and 75%. 
Our engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America are expected to increase by 12%, reflecting strong demand from Chrysler and a ramp up in sales to Nissan. 
In China, we expect domestic revenues, including joint ventures, to be flat again in 2016, with market share gains in heavy and light-duty truck markets, helping to offset weaker market demand. We expect that our full-year market share in the heavy and medium-duty truck market will exceed 18% for the full year and that we will achieve 8% share of the light-duty truck market. 
We expect demand in most end markets in China to be down 10% with industry truck market sales of light and heavy-duty trucks combined expected to decline by 4%. 
In India, we expect total revenues, including joint ventures to increase by 4% in 2016 with stronger demand in most end markets, partially offset by depreciation of the rupee against the U.S. dollar. We expect the truck market to grow by 8% in 2016 and continue to outpace the recovery in off-highway markets. The government in India is strongly promoting investment infrastructure, which will be positive for our Power Generation, Construction and Rail businesses. However, the pace of new projects achieving full approval and moving forward has been slow. We are optimistic that the economy in India will continue to improve in 2016 and we are best positioned to benefit as investment increases and demand for capital goods picks up. 
In Brazil, we expect truck production for 2016 decline by up to 20% as the country remains in recession. At some point, we will see a return to growth in Brazil but that appears unlikely in 2016 given the current economic challenges. As a result of weak commodity prices and lower capital spending by energy and mining companies, we expect demand for our high-horsepower engines to decline again in 2016. In aggregate, we expect a 4% decline in engine revenues. 
Sales of our new QSK95 engine will add more than 5% to [indiscernible] engine sales in 2016 but will be more than offset by weaker sales in most markets. 
Due to weak or slowing demand in many of our markets, major markets, 2016 will be another challenging year. As I said, we expect sales to decline by 5% to 9% and we expect EBIT margins to be in the range of 11.6%, 12.2%, resulting in 25% detrimental margins at the midpoint of our guidance. 
Strong performance and cost reduction initiatives drove gross margin improvement in 2015 despite weaker sales. Through our restructuring actions and ongoing initiative to reduce material costs and improve quality, we expect to deliver even more savings in 2016, as Pat will cover in more detail. 
We did complete the reduction in professional headcount in the fourth quarter as planned and have already taken a number of actions within our manufacturing plants to lower cost. We have announced our plan to close a generator assembly plant in India and an alternator plant in Mexico and there will be at least one more significant announcement in the near term. 
Finally, as discussed in our investment day -- Investor Day, we plan to return 50% of operating cash flow to shareholders over time. But that, we may return more or less in any given year depending on business needs and market conditions. 
In 2016, we plan to return 75% of operating cash flow to shareholders, building [ph] on our record $1.5 billion we have returned in 2015. Thank you for your interest today and now I'll turn it over to Pat who will cover our 2015 performance and our 2016 guidance in more detail."

I will start with a review of the full year 2015 financial results before moving on to our fourth quarter performance.

I will start with a review of the full year 2015 financial results before moving on to our fourth quarter performance. 
As Tom has already discussed, we had recorded restructuring and impairment charges totaling $301 million pretax or $194 million after tax in the fourth quarter. In order to focus on the operational performance of the business, I am going to exclude these items and the $32 million of cost reduction activities in the Power Generation segment in the fourth quarter of 2014 in my following comments. 
Full-year revenues for the company were $19.1 billion, a decrease of 1% compared to the prior year. Increased revenues from the acquisitions of our North American distributors, along with higher demand in North America on-highway markets were more than offset by a decline in global off-highway demand, weaker demand in the Brazilian tough market and an unfavorable currency impact from the stronger U.S. dollar. 
Revenues in North America improved 7% in 2015 and represented 61% of total 2015 revenues, up from 56% last year. International revenues declined by 11% compared 2014 with lower sales in Latin America, Europe and Russia and the most regions in Asia with the exception of India. 
Unfavorable currency movements negatively impacted full-year sales by approximately 4% or over $700 million. Gross margins of 25.9% were 50 basis points higher than in 2014, with improvements in material costs and in warranty more than offsetting the negative impacts of product mix and from currency movements. 
Selling, admin and research and development cost decreased by $12 million in the year and were flat as a percent of sales, despite the acquisitions on Distribution segment which added $86 million in expense. 
Joint venture income decreased $55 million compared to last year with higher earnings from our Foton Cummins joint venture in China, more than offset by the impact of distributor acquisitions in North America. A combination of other operating expense and non operating income was $161 million lower than last year, most of which relates to the $60 million loss contingency, $55[ph]  million in lower fair market value gains on the consolidation of our Distribution joint ventures and $27 million from the gains recorded last year from changes in the cash [indiscernible] value from [indiscernible] life insurance policies. 
In total, earnings before interest and tax, or EBIT, was $2.4 billion or 12.5% of sales. Down from $2.5 billion or 13.2% of sales in the previous year. 
Foreign currency negatively impacted EBIT by approximately $95 million. Net income was $1.6 billion or $8.93 per share, excluding the asset impairment and restructuring charges. This compares to $1.7 billion or $9.13 per share in 2014. And the operating tax rate for the full year came at 27.4%. 
Now let me comment specifically on the fourth quarter and provide some more details on our performance there. Fourth quarter revenues were $4.8 billion, a decrease of 6% from a year ago. Currency movements reduced sales by 4% while Distribution acquisitions added approximately 1.4% to sales. 
Sales in North America represented 60% of the fourth quarter revenues but declined 2% from a year ago due primarily to lower demand in heavy-duty truck, [indiscernible] oil and gas and power generation markets. 
International sales declined by 12% compared to the prior year, with the biggest contributor being very weak demand in Latin America and the negative impact of currency movements. Gross margins were 25.4% of sales, which is the same as a year ago as improvements to warranty cost and material cost offset the negative impact of lower volumes, currency and unfavorable product mix. 
Selling, admin and research and development cost of $685 million or 14.4% of sales decreased $60 million from a year ago and were 20 basis points lower as a percent of sales. Joint venture income of $75 million decreased by $1 million compared to last year. Increased earnings in China primarily due to the introduction of new products and market share gains in top markets were offset by the impact of acquiring our North American distributors which were previously held as joint ventures. 
A combination of other operating expense and nonoperating income decreased by $104 million. The main drivers of this change were the provision for a loss contingency in 2015 and the one-time fair market value gains on distributor acquisitions recorded in the fourth quarter of 2014. 
Earnings before interest and tax were $531 million or 11.1% of sales for the quarter compared to $661 million or 13% of sales last year. Foreign currency negatively impacted EBIT by $34 million. 
Net earnings for the quarter excluding asset impairment and restructuring charges were $355 million or $2.02 per diluted share compared to $2.56 in 2014. The all-in tax rate of 16% in the quarter included a $25 million benefit from the research and development tax credit that is passed late in 2015. 
Moving on to operating segments, let me summarize their performance in the fourth quarter, their results for the full year 2015 and then provide our current projections for 2016. I will then review the full year cash flow and conclude with the company's revenue and profitability expectations for the upcoming year. 
In the Engine segment, revenues were $2.5 billion, a decrease of 11% from last year. Higher revenues declined 22% due to weak global demand for engines and construction, marine and oil and gas markets. On-highway revenues declined by 5% as production in the North American heavy-duty truck market declined compared to a strong quarter in 2014. 
Segment EBIT was $189 million or 7.5% of sales compared to 11.1% last year. Excluding the loss contingency, EBIT was 9.8% in the quarter. 
Improvements in material costs and lower warranty expenses were more than offset by the impact of lower volumes and unfavorable product mix. For the full year, revenues decreased 5% from a year ago and earnings before interest and taxes declined from 11.2% to 9.9%. 
For the Engine business in 2016, we expect revenues to be down by 5% to 9%. Industry production for heavy-duty trucks in North America is expected to decline by 25%. We expect global industrial revenues will decline due to lower demand in construction and in marine markets. In 2016, we will begin to see increased sales of our largest engines, the QSK95, which will help us outperform a weak market for high-horsepower engines. We expect full-year high-horsepower engine volumes to decline by 5%. 
2016 EBIT margins are expected to be in the range of 9% to 10% of sales compared to 9.9% for full year 2015. The benefits from restructuring, lower material costs and higher joint venture earnings in China will help to offset the negative impact of the lower volumes. 
For the Distribution segment, fourth quarter revenues were $1.7 billion, which increased 1% compared to the prior year. Acquisitions added more than 9% to segment revenues year-over-year, partially offset by a 6% negative impact in foreign currency. Organic sales declined by 2% due to weak off-highway markets. 
EBIT margins for the quarter decreased from 9.3% to 6.5%, with foreign currency movements negatively impacting margins by 200 basis points. In addition, in 2014, we recorded $33 million of one-time fair market value gains in the acquisitions which should not repeat in the fourth quarter of 2015. Improvements in existing operations added 60 basis points to margins despite lower organic sales. 
For 2015, the Distribution business delivered record sales, up 20% compared to 2014. EBIT as a percent of sales declined from 9.5% to 7%. Currency negatively impacted earnings by $127 million, lowering the EBIT percentage by 200 basis points. In addition, we recorded $55 million less in one-time fair market value gains compared to the previous year. 
For 2016, Distribution revenue is projected to be flat to down 4% due to weak demand in off-highway markets and from the negative impact of the depreciating U.S. dollar. We expect EBIT margins to be in the range of 6.25% to 7.25% of sales. 
The Components segment recorded sales of $1.2 billion, a 6% decline from a year ago. Compared to the fourth quarter last year, lower demand in the North American and Brazilian truck markets, along with negative foreign currency impacts led to the sales decline. 
Sales in China were up in the fourth quarter by 12%, and up 17% for the full year despite significantly weaker market demand as we continue to capture benefits from the transition to a more advanced emission standards. Segment EBIT was $175 million or 14.2% of sales, an increase of 210 basis points, due primarily to strong execution on cost reduction initiatives which more than offset lower pricing. 
2015 was a record year for our Components segment in terms of revenues, EBIT dollars and EBIT percent. Revenues were up 1% and EBIT improved from 13.4% to 14.5% of sales. 
Looking forward into 2016. We expect revenue to decline by 6% to 10% as a result of weaker demand in North America. And EBIT is projected to be in the range of 12.75% to 13.75% of sales. 
In the Power Generation segment, fourth quarter sales were $654 million, down 14%, reflecting continued weakness in global markets. Year-over-year, international sales decreased 15% with Latin America accounting for half of the decline. Sales in North America were down 12% due to lower military sales and softer demand from data center customers. EBIT margins were 4.1% in the quarter, down from 7.1% last year. Lower sales volumes, adverse mix and lower pricing contributed to the lower EBIT margin, along with inventory write-downs due to very weak demand in some specific segments of the business. 
For the full year, Power Generation revenues were down 5% from 2014 and EBIT margins dropped from 6.9% to 6.4% of sales. 
For 2016, we expect Power Gen revenues to decline by a further 3% to 7% with continued weakness in most major markets. EBIT margins are expected to improve in 2016, to between 6.5% to 7.5% as the benefits of restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives more than offset the impact of lower volumes. 
As Tom mentioned, we are projecting total company revenues to be down 5% to 9% in 2016. Lower levels of production in the North American heavy-duty truck market, reduced demand globally for off-highway and Power Generation equipment and continued pressure from the strong U.S. dollar will drive the majority of the reduction in revenue. The introduction of new products and increased revenue from Distribution acquisitions will add between 1% to 2% to our revenues. Joint venture income is expected to be flat compared to 2015 with some improvements due to market share gains in China, offset by weaker off-highway demand. We expect EBIT margins of between 11.6% and 12.2% for 2016, which compares to 12.5% in 2015. At the midpoint of the guidance, we expect to generate $300 million of cost savings that will partially offset the negative impact of lower volumes, currency, pricing and unfavorable product mix and will help contain detrimental EBIT margins at 25%. 
The $300 million of savings will result from the benefits of restructuring actions, material cost reduction initiatives and lower warranty costs net of targeted investments. We are currently projecting the tax rate to be approximately 28.5% in 2016, excluding any discrete items compared to 27.4% in 2015. 
And finally, let me turn to cash flow. In the fourth quarter, we reduced inventory by $352 million as we aligned production to the lower levels of demand. The improvement in inventory contributed to a positive $928 million in cash from operations in the fourth quarter. 
For the full year, we generated $2.1 billion in cash from operating activities, with [indiscernible] of above $2 billion. We continue to use that cash to lead us back into the company and to return value to our shareholders. We returned 74% of the cash generated from operations to our shareholders in 2015. We increased our dividend by 25% and we repurchased 7.2 million shares for a combined total of $1.5 billion, up 29% over the amount [indiscernible] in 2014. 
We'll also continue to invest in the business with $744 million in capital expenditure projects in 2015 and $170 million for acquisitions. We anticipate operating cash flow performance in 2016 will be within our long-term guidance range of 10% to 15% of sales. Capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $600 million to $650 million. We will continue to repurchase shares. And as we indicated at our Analyst Day last November, we plan to return 75% of operating cash flow to our shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases in 2016. 
Now let me turn it over to Mark."

And so probably 3 major areas. But one is the restructuring work that we kicked off before we get a full-year impact of that in 2015. The actions we took in Q4 for example, roughly a 7% professional headcount reduction was much heavier in the Power Gen business. We exceeded 10% in the Power Gen business. Tom mentioned that some plant restructuring that we've done, that was all on the Power Generation Business. And again, we're looking further actions in that area.

Frankly, there's a couple of things going on in China. One, you know obviously is that from an economic point of view, there is a shift going on from what was largely industrial and export economy to some more balanced economy, at least that's what they're trying to do. So almost all of our markets are declining, even as the economy grows. And that's just a reflection of that shift that we provide a lot to infrastructure and those kind of segments. And second thing that's going on, of course, is efficiency improvement. So in the truck market for example, there are a number of trucks sold. In its peak, it's not clear that we'll ever hit that number again. It kind of depends. The efficiencies are improving. But so is the potential. So many parts of China, where there's not much infrastructure build yet, the government is likely to build more infrastructure there. So it's kind of hard to know, frankly, from our point of view what, which -- right now, the trends are efficiency is improving faster than growth which again why we're seeing shrinkage in that market, trucks for example. But our view is that as the economy begins to grow and industrial begin to grow more, we'll see more expansion of the market overall. But all that's a long way of saying we don't exactly know what the peak looks like again. Here's what we do know, is that as they increase their focus on emissions out of their equipment and the quality, the demand for quality and more professional fleets and operators increases, the demand for our products is increasing. So as a percentage of the total trucks sold, our market share continues to increase and we are benefiting significant from that, along with our partners there. And that is primarily a truck phenomenon today. But my expectation is that will be across all segments in China over time."

I know Jerry asked about your Power Gen margins and your Power Gen margins improving in a modest sales decline in '16. I guess the flipside to that is at the Analyst Day, you talked about Power Gen margins doubling -- I mean, hitting I think, the double-digit range on sort of lower sales.

And the things that may be could have flattened out or got better did not. So all the resource markets look worse, not better. FX looks worse, not better. So again, what you -- as we are rolling through these things, you never know which things starts, which might start to bottom out. And right now, nothing seems to be that way. Really, there's no major shift in any 1 market. What I would say is all things we are concerned about, our concern turned out to be well-founded and the things that were -- could maybe have stabilized haven't really yet. So again, we're operating in that environment. You know we've been there before. We're urgent and flexible operator in this environment so I wish it wasn't this. But I think we'll do relatively well because we'll react quickly. I gave the example of our Jamestown Engine Plant, which is already down to the levels of production that we expect for this year and we'll produce efficiently at that level. So hopefully, we'll do well compared to circumstances. But there's no question that the market circumstances are everything we expected and when we talked to Investor Day and slightly worse, as couple of things that I mentioned FX and just the general large engine area."

So one is that plant savings and some of the restructuring we've done in plants and are continuing to do. The 2 plans that we already announced and some more stuff to come. Those will play out over a couple of years. You don't get the savings immediately like you do in the restructuring of overhead savings. So the plant savings are yet to come. We've continued, we've hit hard on the overhead reductions and we're continuing some work in there and how we do work in the Power Gen business. So less about taking a lot of people out. With significantly increasing the efficiency of how we get after quality, how we bring products to market faster. And that will again be a piece that will play out over the next 2 years.

I'll start with a summary of our fourth quarter and full year results and finish with a discussion of our outlook for 2016. Pat will then take you through more details about our fourth quarter financial performance and our forecast for this year. 
Included in our fourth quarter results were 3 unusual charges, which I'll cover before summarizing our operating results. As market conditions weakened in the fourth quarter, we made a decision to scale back the range of light-duty engines that we planned to manufacture in North America. This decision, combined with the uncertainty of winning additional customers with our V8 engine in the short term, caused us to reassess the book value of our light-duty manufacturing assets in North America in the fourth quarter. 
As a result of our evaluation, we recorded a noncash pretax impairment charge of $211 million. While it's disappointing to record the charge, we remain committed to our light-duty engine customers and confident in the growth prospects for our light-duty engine business globally, including the V8 engine in North America. 
Included in the fourth quarter Engine business results is a $60 million charge related to a quality issue impacting specific population of vehicles manufactured by one OEM customer. The quality issue is a result of a defect in the substrate wash coat within a third-party aftertreatment system which is paired with our engines in an OEM vehicle. Cummins did not manufacture or sell the aftertreatment system and does not provide warranty on the OEM vehicle. As the defect is impacting performance of the overall engine system, we are taking responsibility for the effort to resolve the issue and have recorded the cost of the campaign and other related costs in other expense. 
In addition, as expected, we recorded a restructuring charge of $90 million in the fourth quarter. We reduced our workforce by more than 1,900 people, including 1,700 professional staff, and we expect that these actions will result in a full year cost savings of $160 million. 
Now let me summarize our fourth quarter and full year results and comment on key drivers of the results within each business. All references to EBIT and EBIT percent exclude restructuring and impairment charges. 
Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2015 were $4.8 billion, a decrease of 6% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. Gross margins of 25.4% were the same as last -- as the year ago despite the lower sales, due primarily to strong execution on material cost reduction projects and lower warranty costs. Operating expenses declined year-over-year, both in dollars and as a percent of sales. EBIT was $531 million or 11.1% compared to $661 million or 13% a year ago. EBIT percent declined due to a change in other income or expense. 
In the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded the charge for the quality campaign that I've just described in the fourth quarter. And in the fourth quarter of 2014, we generated onetime gains on distributor acquisitions. These 2 items explain the majority of the variance in other income or expense. 
For the full year, Cummins sales were $19.1 billion, down 1% year-over-year. Gross margin of 25.9% improved by 50 basis points as a result of material cost savings and lower warranty costs which more than offset the negative impacts of currency and lower volumes. Operating expenses declined in dollars and as a percent of sales. Our full year EBIT margin was 12.5%, down from 13.2% in 2014. EBIT percent declined due to the change in other income or expense, largely for the same reasons that I just described for the fourth quarter: Lower gains on distributor acquisitions and the impact of the quality campaign. 
The Components segment delivered strong fourth quarter and full year performance, which is largely attributable to strong execution on a number of cost reduction initiatives and successfully capturing profitable growth in China as new emissions regulations came into force. 
Within the Distribution business, we successfully completed the acquisition and integration of 3 distributors in 2015 for a total of 10 acquisitions over the past 2 years. Despite challenging economic conditions, the financial benefits of these acquisitions exceeded our 2013 projection, yielding $0.63 per share of additional earnings over 2 years compared to our original projection of $0.50 per share. 
EBIT margins of existing distributor operations improved by 90 basis points in 2015, and we expect further operational improvements in 2016. Unfortunately, the improvement in underlying performance in 2015 were masked by the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar, which caused a result of international operations to translate into fewer U.S. dollars. We expect the strong U.S. dollar to be a continuing challenge in 2016. 
The Engine business faced challenging off-highway markets throughout 2015 and had to adjust to sharp reduction in heavy-duty truck volumes in North America in the second half of the year. Our production of engines for Class 8 trucks declined by 28% between the second and fourth quarters of 2015. We quickly responded to the demand drop by flexing down our operating cost in our Jamestown Engine Plant, which will help protect margins as we head into a weaker 2016. The Engine business also made significant progress in reducing product quality and warranty cost during 2015. Warranty cost as a percent of sales improved by 90 basis points from the first half of 2015 to the second half, and we expect cost to improve further in 2016. 
The main challenge facing the Power Generation Business is weak global demand, especially for larger units. We do not believe that the fourth quarter results represent a run rate for future performance as we did incur some additional cost that we do not anticipate will repeat in future quarters. We expect improvement in our EBIT percent in 2016 as a result of our restructuring and other cost reduction work in Power Generation. 
Now I will comment on some of our key markets in 2015, starting with North America, and then I'll comment on some of our largest international markets. Our revenues in North America grew 7% in 2015, with approximately 3% of the growth coming from acquisitions in our Distribution business. Industry production of North American heavy-duty trucks reached approximately 290,000 units in 2015, an increase of 9% from 2014 levels. Our full year market share was 33%, down from 35% in 2014. 
The market size for medium-duty trucks was approximately 124,000 units in 2015, in line with 2014. And our market share improved by 610 basis points to 78%. 
Shipments to Chrysler increased by 5% in 2015 to 130,000 units, reflecting strong demand in the U.S. for pickup trucks. 
Engine shipments to industrial or off-highway markets in North America declined by 29% year-over-year, reflecting weaker demand in all end markets except rail, where we picked up market share following the transition to Tier 4 Final emission standards. 
Revenues in our Power Generation Business decreased by 9%, with shipment to the U.S. Military down 12% and lower demand from U.S. data center customers. 
Our international revenues declined by 11% in 2015. In Brazil, our revenues decreased 48% due to a 50% reduction in truck production as the economy fell into recession and a more than 30% depreciation of the real against the U.S. dollar. 
Revenues in our Power Generation and Distribution business fell less than in our on-highway business, but conditions remain very challenging in all end markets. 
Our full year revenues in China, including joint ventures, were $3.3 billion, in line with 2014 as we significantly outperformed very weak end markets. Industry demand for medium and heavy-duty trucks in China decreased by 24% for the full year as the industrial economy slowed. Our market share reached 18% in the fourth quarter of 2015, taking our full year market share above 16% and up 460 basis points compared to 2014. This represents significant achievement in a very competitive market. In addition, our Components business capitalized on the transition to NS4 emission standards, delivering 17% revenue growth despite the sharp decline in market size. 
Shipments of our light-duty engines in China increased by 5% in a market that declined 6%, as Foton increased the proportion of its trucks powered by our joint venture engines, displacing local competitor engines. Our full year share in the light-duty truck market exceeded 6% in 2015, up 140 basis points. 
Cummins share of earnings from our joint ventures with Foton increased by $60 million in 2015. Our heavy-duty engine joint venture was consistently profitable from the second quarter onwards, less than a year after production started there. 
Industry demand for excavators in China dropped 38% in 2015, the fourth consecutive year of decline. And demand for Power Generation equipment dropped more than 10% due to weaker infrastructure investment. Our revenues in both markets declined a little less than industry demand. 
Full year revenues in India, including joint ventures, were $1.5 billion, a 15% increase over 2014. Industry truck production increased 28% to 318,000 units, and our market share was 41% versus 42% a year ago. 
Our penetration within Tata Motors increased year-over-year. However, this was offset by a decline in Tata's truck share. Revenues for our Power Generation Business increased by 6%, in line with the pace of the economy. 
Now let me provide our overall outlook for 2016 and then comment on individual regions and end markets. 
We're currently forecasting total company revenues to decline by 5% to 9%, driven by a decline in heavy-duty truck production in North America, continued weakness in the global off-highway and power generation markets and further strengthening of the U.S. dollar against a number of currencies. Industry production for heavy-duty trucks in North America is projected to be 220,000 units, a 25% decrease year-over-year, with our market share projected to be between 30% and 33%. 
In the medium-duty truck market, we expect the market size to be 124,000 units or flat compared to 2015. We project our market share to be between 72% and 75%. 
Our engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America are expected to increase by 12%, reflecting strong demand from Chrysler and a ramp up in sales to Nissan. 
In China, we expect domestic revenues, including joint ventures, to be flat again in 2016, with market share gains in heavy- and light-duty truck markets helping to offset weaker market demand. We expect that our full year market share in the heavy- and medium-duty truck market will exceed 18% for the full year and that we will achieve 8% share of the light-duty truck market. 
We expect demand in most end markets in China to be down 10%, with industry truck market sales of light- and heavy-duty trucks combined expected to decline by 4%. 
In India, we expect total revenues, including joint ventures, to increase by 4% in 2016, with stronger demand in most end markets partially offset by depreciation of the rupee against the U.S. dollar. We expect the truck market to grow by 8% in 2016 and continue to outpace the recovery in off-highway markets. 
The Government of India is strongly promoting investment in infrastructure, which will be positive for our Power Generation, Construction and Rail businesses. However, the pace of new projects achieving full approval and moving forward has been slow. We are optimistic that the economy in India will continue to improve in 2016 and we are best positioned to benefit as investment increases and demand for capital goods picks up. 
In Brazil, we expect truck production for 2016 to decline by up to 20% as the country remains in recession. At some point, we will see a return to growth in Brazil, but that appears unlikely in 2016 given the current economic challenges. As a result of weak commodity prices and lower capital spending by energy and mining companies, we expect demand for our high-horsepower engines to decline again in 2016. In aggregate, we expect a 4% decline in engine revenues. 
Sales of our new QSK95 engine will add more than 5% to high-horsepower engine sales in 2016 but will be more than offset by weaker sales in most markets. 
Due to weak or slowing demand in many of our major markets, 2016 will be another challenging year. As I said, we expect sales to decline by 5% to 9%, and we expect EBIT margins to be in the range of 11.6%, 12.2%, resulting in 25% decremental margins at the midpoint of our guidance. 
Strong performance and cost reduction initiatives drove gross margin improvement in 2015 despite weaker sales. Through our restructuring actions and ongoing initiative to reduce material cost and improve quality, we expect to deliver even more savings in 2016, as Pat will cover in more detail. 
We did complete the reduction in professional headcount in the fourth quarter as planned and have already taken a number of actions within our manufacturing plants to lower costs. We have announced our plan to close a generator assembly plant in India, an alternator plant in Mexico and there will be at least one more significant announcement in the near term. 
Finally, as discussed in our investment day -- Investor Day, we plan to return 50% of operating cash flow to shareholders over time, but that we may return more or less in any given year depending on business needs and market conditions. In 2016, we plan to return 75% of operating cash flow to shareholders, building on our record $1.5 billion we have returned in 2015. 
Thank you for your interest today. And now I'll turn it over to Pat who will cover our 2015 performance and our 2016 guidance in more detail."

I will start with a review of the full year 2015 financial results before moving on to our fourth quarter performance. As Tom has already discussed, we had recorded restructuring and impairment charges totalin",2115,"Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I will start with a review of the full year 2015 financial results before moving on to our fourth quarter performance. 
As Tom has already discussed, we had recorded restructuring and impairment charges totaling $301 million pretax or $194 million after tax in the fourth quarter. In order to focus on the operational performance of the business, I am going to exclude these items and the $32 million of cost reduction activities in the Power Generation segment incurred in the fourth quarter of 2014 in my following comments. 
Full year revenues for the company were $19.1 billion, a decrease of 1% compared to the prior year. Increased revenues from the acquisitions of our North American distributors, along with higher demand in North American on-highway markets, were more than offset by a decline in global off-highway demand, weaker demand in the Brazilian truck market and the unfavorable currency impact from the stronger U.S. dollar. 
Revenues in North America improved 7% in 2015 and represented 61% of total 2015 revenues, up from 56% last year. International revenues declined by 11% compared 2014, with lower sales in Latin America, Europe and Russia and the most regions in Asia, with the exception of India. 
Unfavorable currency movements negatively impacted full year sales by approximately 4% or over $700 million. Gross margins of 25.9% were 50 basis points higher than in 2014, with improvements in material cost and in warranty more than offsetting the negative impacts of product mix and from currency movements. 
Selling, admin and research and development cost decreased by $12 million in the year and were flat as a percent of sales, despite the acquisitions in our Distribution segment, which added $86 million in expense. 
Joint venture income decreased $55 million compared to last year, with higher earnings from our Foton-Cummins joint ventures in China, more than offset by the impact of distributor acquisitions in North America. A combination of other operating expense and nonoperating income was $161 million lower than last year, most of which relates to the $60 million loss contingency, $55 million in lower fair market value gains on the consolidation of our Distribution joint ventures and $27 million from the gains recorded last year from changes in the cash surrender value of our corporate owned life insurance policies. 
In total, earnings before interest and tax, or EBIT, was $2.4 billion or 12.5% of sales, down from $2.5 billion or 13.2% of sales in the previous year. Foreign currency negatively impacted EBIT by approximately $95 million. Net income was $1.6 billion or $8.93 per share, excluding the asset impairment and restructuring charges. This compares to $1.7 billion or $9.13 per share in 2014. And the operating tax rate for the full year came at 27.4%. 
Now let me comment specifically on the fourth quarter and provide some more details on our performance there. Fourth quarter revenues were $4.8 billion, a decrease of 6% from a year ago. Currency movements reduced sales by 4% while Distribution acquisitions added approximately 1.4% to sales. 
Sales in North America represented 60% of our fourth quarter revenues but declined 2% from a year ago due primarily to lower demand in heavy-duty truck, construction, oil and gas and power generation markets. 
International sales declined by 12% compared to the prior year, with the biggest contributor the very weak demand in Latin America and the negative impact of currency movements. Gross margins were 25.4% of sales, which is the same as a year ago as improvements to warranty cost and material costs offset the negative impact of lower volumes, currency and unfavorable product mix. 
Selling, admin and research and development cost of $685 million or 14.4% of sales decreased $60 million from a year ago and were 20 basis points lower as a percent of sales. Joint venture income of $75 million decreased by $1 million compared to last year. Increased earnings in China primarily due to the introduction of new products and market share gains in top markets were offset by the impact of acquiring our North American distributors which were previously held as joint ventures. 
A combination of other operating expense and nonoperating income decreased by $104 million. The main drivers of this change were the provision for a loss contingency in 2015 and the onetime fair market value gains on distributor acquisitions recorded in the fourth quarter of 2014. 
Earnings before interest and tax were $531 million or 11.1% of sales for the quarter compared to $661 million or 13% of sales last year. Foreign currency negatively impacted EBIT by $34 million. 
Net earnings for the quarter, excluding asset impairment and restructuring charges, were $355 million or $2.02 per diluted share compared to $2.56 in 2014. The all-in tax rate of 16% in the quarter included a $25 million benefit from the research and development tax credit that was passed late in 2015. 
Moving on to the operating segments, let me summarize their performance in the fourth quarter, their results for the full year of 2015 and then provide our current projections for 2016. I will then review the full year cash flow and conclude with the company's revenue and profitability expectations for the upcoming year. 
In the Engine segment, revenues were $2.5 billion, a decrease of 11% from last year. Off-highway revenues declined 22% due to weak global demand for engines in construction, marine and oil and gas markets. On-highway revenues declined by 5% as production in the North American heavy-duty truck market declined compared to a strong quarter in 2014. 
Segment EBIT was $189 million or 7.5% of sales compared to 11.1% last year. Excluding the loss contingency, EBIT was 9.8% in the quarter. 
Improvements in material costs and lower warranty expenses were more than offset by the impact of lower volumes and unfavorable product mix. For the full year, revenues decreased 5% from a year ago, and earnings before interest and taxes declined from 11.2% to 9.9%. 
For the Engine business in 2016, we expect revenues to be down by 5% to 9%. Industry production for heavy-duty trucks in North America is expected to decline by 25%. We expect global industrial revenues will decline due to lower demand in construction and in marine markets. In 2016, we will begin to see increased sales of our largest engine, the QSK95, which will help us outperform a weak market for high-horsepower engines. We expect full year high-horsepower engine volumes to decline by 5%. 
2016 EBIT margins are expected to be in the range of 9% to 10% of sales compared to 9.9% for full year 2015. The benefits from restructuring, lower material costs and higher joint venture earnings in China will help to offset the negative impact of the lower volumes. 
For the Distribution segment, fourth quarter revenues were $1.7 billion, which increased 1% compared to the prior year. Acquisitions added more than 9% to segment revenues year-over-year, partially offset by a 6% negative impact from foreign currency. Organic sales declined by 2% due to weak off-highway markets. 
EBIT margins for the quarter decreased from 9.3% to 6.5%, with foreign currency movements negatively impacting margins by 200 basis points. In addition, in 2014, we recorded $33 million of onetime fair market value gains in the acquisitions which would not repeat in the fourth quarter of 2015. Improvements in existing operations added 60 basis points to margins despite lower organic sales. 
For 2015, the Distribution business delivered record sales, up 20% compared to 2014. EBIT as a percent of sales declined from 9.5% to 7%. Currency negatively impacted earnings by $127 million, lowering the EBIT percentage by 200 basis points. In addition, we recorded $55 million less in onetime fair market value gains compared to the previous year. 
For 2016, Distribution revenue is projected to be flat to down 4% due to weak demand in off-highway markets and from the negative impact of the appreciating U.S. dollar. We expect EBIT margins to be in the range of 6.25% to 7.25% of sales. 
The Components segment recorded sales of $1.2 billion, a 6% decline from a year ago. Compared to the fourth quarter last year, lower demand in the North American and Brazilian truck markets, along with negative foreign currency impacts, led to the sales decline. 
Sales in China were up in the fourth quarter by 12%, and up 17% for the full year despite significantly weaker market demand as we continue to capture benefits from the transition to more advanced emission standards. Segment EBIT was $175 million or 14.2% of sales, an increase of 210 basis points, due primarily to strong execution on cost reduction initiatives which more than offset lower pricing. 
2015 was a record year for our Components segment in terms of revenues, EBIT dollars and EBIT percent. Revenues were up 1% and EBIT improved from 13.4% to 14.5% of sales. 
Looking forward into 2016. We expect revenue to decline by 6% to 10% as a result of weaker demand in North America. And EBIT is projected to be in the range of 12.75% to 13.75% of sales. 
In the Power Generation segment, fourth quarter sales were $654 million, down 14%, reflecting continued weakness in global markets. Year-over-year international sales decreased 15%, with Latin America accounting for half of the decline. Sales in North America were down 12% due to lower military sales and softer demand from data center customers. EBIT margins were 4.1% in the quarter, down from 7.1% last year. Lower sales volumes, adverse mix and lower pricing contributed to the lower EBIT margin, along with inventory write-downs due to very weak demand in some specific segments of the business. 
For the full year, Power Generation revenues were down 5% from 2014, and EBIT margins dropped from 6.9% to 6.4% of sales. 
For 2016, we expect Power Gen revenues to decline by a further 3% to 7%, with continued weakness in most major markets. EBIT margins are expected to improve in 2016 to between 6.5% to 7.5% as the benefits of restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives more than offset the impact of the lower volumes. 
As Tom mentioned, we are projecting total company revenues to be down 5% to 9% in 2016. Lower levels of production in the North American heavy-duty truck market, reduced demand globally for off-highway and power generation equipment and continued pressure from the strong U.S. dollar will drive the majority of the reduction in revenue. 
The introduction of new products and increased revenue from Distribution acquisitions will add between 1% to 2% to our revenues. Joint venture income is expected to be flat compared to 2015, with some improvements due to market share gains in China offset by weaker off-highway demand. 
We expect EBIT margins of between 11.6% and 12.2% for 2016, which compares to 12.5% in 2015. At the midpoint of the guidance, we expect to generate $300 million of cost savings that will partially offset the negative impact of lower volumes, currency, pricing and unfavorable product mix and will help contain decremental EBIT margins to 25%. 
The $300 million of savings will result from the benefits of restructuring actions, material cost reduction initiatives and lower warranty costs net of targeted investments. We are currently projecting the tax rate to be approximately 28.5% in 2016, excluding any discrete items, compared to 27.4% in 2015. 
And finally, let me turn to cash flow. In the fourth quarter, we reduced inventory by $352 million as we aligned production to the lower levels of demand. The improvement in inventory contributed to a positive $928 million in cash from operations in the fourth quarter. 
For the full year, we generated $2.1 billion in cash from operating activities, the third straight year above $2 billion. We continue to use that cash to reinvest back into the company and to return value to our shareholders. We returned 74% of the cash generated from operations to our shareholders in 2015. We increased our dividend by 25% and we repurchased 7.2 million shares for a combined total of $1.5 billion, up 29% over the amount returned in 2014. 
We also continue to invest in the business, with $744 million in capital expenditure projects in 2015 and $117 million for acquisitions. We anticipate operating cash flow performance in 2016 will be within our long-term guidance range of 10% to 15% of sales. Capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $600 million to $650 million. We will continue to repurchase shares. And as we indicated at our Analyst Day last November, we plan to return 75% of operating cash flow to our shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases in 2016. 
Now let me turn it over to Mark."

And so probably 3 major areas, but 1 is the restructuring work that we kicked off before, we'll get a full year impact of that in 2015. The actions we took in Q4, for example the roughly a 7% professional headcount reduction was much heavier in the Power Gen Business. So it exceeded 10% in the Power Gen Business. Tom mentioned that some plants restructuring that we've done, that was all in the Power Generation Business. And again, we're looking to further actions in that area. So we feel confident, even with the lower sales levels, it will in fact increase the EBIT going forward in 2016 with those actions."

Frankly, there's a couple of things going on in China. One you know obviously is that from an economic point of view, there's a shift going on from what was largely an industrial and export economy to some more balanced economy, at least that's what they're trying to do. So almost all of our markets are declining even as the economy grows. And that's just a reflection of that shift, that we provide a lot to infrastructure and those kind of segments. And second thing that's going on, of course, is efficiency improvement. So in the truck market, for an example, there are a number of trucks sold in its peak, it's not clear that we'll ever hit that number again. It kind of depends. The efficiencies are improving, but so is the potential. So many parts of China where there's not much infrastructure built yet, the government is likely to build more infrastructure there. So it's kind of hard to know, frankly, from our point of view what, which -- right now, the trends are efficiency is improving faster than growth, which again, why we're seeing shrinkage in that market, trucks for example. But our view is that as the economy begins to grow and industrial begin to grow more, we'll see more expansion of the market overall. But all that's a long way of saying we don't exactly know what the peak looks like again. Here's what we do know, is that as they increase their focus on emissions out of their equipment and the quality, the demand for quality and more professional fleets and operators increases, the demand for our products is increasing. So as a percentage of the total trucks sold, our market share continues to increase and we are benefiting significantly from that, along with our partners there. And that is primarily a truck phenomenon today. But my expectation is that will be across all segments in China over time."

So as you remember from our Analyst Day, I said sales to be down at least 5%. But nonetheless, there's no question that from our point of view, things that were rough, like the truck market, which we haven't really changed our outlook very much on, stayed rough. And the things that may be could have flattened out or got better did not. So all the resource markets look worse, not better. FX looks worse, not better. So again, what you -- as we're rolling through these things, you never know which things start -- which might start to bottom out. And right now, nothing seems to be that way. So really, there's no major shift in any one market. What I'd would say is all the things we were concerned about turned -- our concern turned out to be well-founded, and the things that were -- could maybe have stabilized haven't really yet. So again, we're operating in that environment. You know we've been there before. We're an urgent and flexible operator in this environment. So I wish it wasn't this, but I think we'll do relatively well because, well, we react quickly. I gave the example of our Jamestown Engine Plant, which is already down to the levels of production that we expect for this year and will produce efficiently at that level. So hopefully, we'll do well compared to the circumstances, but there's no question that the market circumstances are everything we expected and -- when we talked to you on Investor Day and slightly worse on those couple of things I mentioned, FX and just the general large engine area."

Although we're seeing sales maybe could be worse than flat, is what you're seeing in 2016. But the actions are the same. So and there's maybe -- in 3 areas. So one is that plant savings and some of the restructuring we've done in plants and are continuing to do, the 2 plans that we already announced and some more stuff to come, those will play out over a couple of years. You don't get the savings immediately like you do with the restructuring of overhead savings. So the plant savings are yet to come. We've continued -- we've hit hard on the overhead reductions and we're continuing some work in there and how we do work in the Power Gen business. So less about taking a lot of people out, but significantly increasing the efficiency of how we get after quality, how we bring products to market faster. And that will again be a piece of it that will play out over the next 2 years. And then lastly, from -- the Hedgehog will be another tailwind that we'll get. So we just -- we've only really started on that with small numbers in 2015. That begins to ramp up in 2016 and will accelerate going forward."

And as you mentioned, the reason it's sort of held in a different line than we normally would hold, product quality or warranty is because it's not on a product that we actually technically produce. In my judgment and the rest of this group, it's a product quality issue or system quality issue that we're trying to make right with our partners. And we're going to do that. But it technically needs to be held in a different part of the profit and loss statement because we don't actually manufacturer that engine -- that system, and therefore we cannot accrue warranty the way we would with anything else."

I'll start with a summary of our fourth quarter and full year results and finish with a discussion of our outlook for 2016. Pat will then take you through more details about our fourth quarter financial performance and our forecast for this year. 
Included in our fourth quarter results were 3 unusual charges, which I'll cover before summarizing our operating results. As market conditions weakened in the fourth quarter, we made a decision to scale back the range of light-duty engines that we planned to manufacture in North America. This decision, combined with the uncertainty of winning additional customers with our V8 engine in the short term, caused us to reassess the book value of our light-duty manufacturing assets in North America in the fourth quarter. 
As a result of our evaluation, we recorded a noncash pretax impairment charge of $211 million. While it's disappointing to record the charge, we remain committed to our light-duty engine customers and confident in the growth prospects for our light-duty engine business globally, including the V8 engine in North America. 
Included in the fourth quarter Engine business results is a $60 million charge related to a quality issue impacting specific population of vehicles manufactured by one OEM customer. The quality issue is a result of a defect in the substrate wash coat within a third-party aftertreatment system which is paired with our engines in an OEM vehicle. Cummins did not manufacture or sell the aftertreatment system and does not provide warranty on the OEM vehicle. As the defect is impacting performance of the overall engine system, we are taking responsibility for the effort to resolve the issue and have recorded the cost of the campaign and other related costs in other expense. 
In addition, as expected, we recorded a restructuring charge of $90 million in the fourth quarter. We reduced our workforce by more than 1,900 people, including 1,700 professional staff, and we expect that these actions will result in a full year cost savings of $160 million. 
Now let me summarize our fourth quarter and full year results and comment on key drivers of the results within each business. All references to EBIT and EBIT percent exclude restructuring and impairment charges. 
Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2015 were $4.8 billion, a decrease of 6% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. Gross margins of 25.4% were the same as last -- as the year ago despite the lower sales, due primarily to strong execution on material cost reduction projects and lower warranty costs. Operating expenses declined year-over-year, both in dollars and as a percent of sales. EBIT was $531 million or 11.1% compared to $661 million or 13% a year ago. EBIT percent declined due to a change in other income or expense. 
In the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded the charge for the quality campaign that I've just described in the fourth quarter. And in the fourth quarter of 2014, we generated onetime gains on distributor acquisitions. These 2 items explain the majority of the variance in other income or expense. 
For the full year, Cummins sales were $19.1 billion, down 1% year-over-year. Gross margin of 25.9% improved by 50 basis points as a result of material cost savings and lower warranty costs which more than offset the negative impacts of currency and lower volumes. Operating expenses declined in dollars and as a percent of sales. Our full year EBIT margin was 12.5%, down from 13.2% in 2014. EBIT percent declined due to the change in other income or expense, largely for the same reasons that I just described for the fourth quarter: Lower gains on distributor acquisitions and the impact of the quality campaign. 
The Components segment delivered strong fourth quarter and full year performance, which is largely attributable to strong execution on a number of cost reduction initiatives and successfully capturing profitable growth in China as new emissions regulations came into force. 
Within the Distribution business, we successfully completed the acquisition and integration of 3 distributors in 2015 for a total of 10 acquisitions over the past 2 years. Despite challenging economic conditions, the financial benefits of these acquisitions exceeded our 2013 projection, yielding $0.63 per share of additional earnings over 2 years compared to our original projection of $0.50 per share. 
EBIT margins of existing distributor operations improved by 90 basis points in 2015, and we expect further operational improvements in 2016. Unfortunately, the improvement in underlying performance in 2015 were masked by the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar, which caused the results of international operations to translate into fewer U.S. dollars. We expect the strong U.S. dollar to be a continuing challenge in 2016. 
The Engine business faced challenging off-highway markets throughout 2015 and had to adjust to sharp reduction in heavy-duty truck volumes in North America in the second half of the year. Our production of engines for Class 8 trucks declined by 28% between the second and fourth quarters of 2015. We quickly responded to the demand drop by flexing down our operating cost in our Jamestown Engine Plant, which will help protect margins as we head into a weaker 2016. The Engine business also made significant progress in reducing product quality and warranty cost during 2015. Warranty cost as a percent of sales improved by 90 basis points from the first half of 2015 to the second half, and we expect cost to improve further in 2016. 
The main challenge facing the Power Generation Business is weak global demand, especially for larger units. We do not believe that the fourth quarter results represent a run rate for future performance as we did incur some additional cost that we do not anticipate will repeat in future quarters. We expect improvement in our EBIT percent in 2016 as a result of our restructuring and other cost reduction work in Power Generation. 
Now I will comment on some of our key markets in 2015, starting with North America, and then I'll comment on some of our largest international markets. Our revenues in North America grew 7% in 2015, with approximately 3% of the growth coming from acquisitions in our Distribution business. Industry production of North American heavy-duty trucks reached approximately 290,000 units in 2015, an increase of 9% from 2014 levels. Our full year market share was 33%, down from 35% in 2014. 
The market size for medium-duty trucks was approximately 124,000 units in 2015, in line with 2014. And our market share improved by 610 basis points to 78%. 
Shipments to Chrysler increased by 5% in 2015 to 130,000 units, reflecting strong demand in the U.S. for pickup trucks. 
Engine shipments to industrial or off-highway markets in North America declined by 29% year-over-year, reflecting weaker demand in all end markets except rail, where we picked up market share following the transition to Tier 4 Final emission standards. 
Revenues in our Power Generation Business decreased by 9%, with shipment to the U.S. Military down 12% and lower demand from U.S. data center customers. 
Our international revenues declined by 11% in 2015. In Brazil, our revenues decreased 48% due to a 50% reduction in truck production as the economy fell into recession and a more than 30% depreciation of the real against the U.S. dollar. 
Revenues in our Power Generation and Distribution business fell less than in our on-highway business, but conditions remain very challenging in all end markets. 
Our full year revenues in China, including joint ventures, were $3.3 billion, in line with 2014 as we significantly outperformed very weak end markets. Industry demand for medium and heavy-duty trucks in China decreased by 24% for the full year as the industrial economy slowed. Our market share reached 18% in the fourth quarter of 2015, taking our full year market share above 16% and up 460 basis points compared to 2014. This represents significant achievement in a very competitive market. In addition, our Components business capitalized on the transition to NS4 emission standards, delivering 17% revenue growth despite the sharp decline in market size. 
Shipments of our light-duty engines in China increased by 5% in a market that declined 6%, as Foton increased the proportion of its trucks powered by our joint venture engines, displacing local competitor engines. Our full year share in the light-duty truck market exceeded 6% in 2015, up 140 basis points. 
Cummins share of earnings from our joint ventures with Foton increased by $60 million in 2015. Our heavy-duty engine joint venture was consistently profitable from the second quarter onwards, less than a year after production started there. 
Industry demand for excavators in China dropped 38% in 2015, the fourth consecutive year of decline. And demand for Power Generation equipment dropped more than 10% due to weaker infrastructure investment. Our revenues in both markets declined a little less than industry demand. 
Full year revenues in India, including joint ventures, were $1.5 billion, a 15% increase over 2014. Industry truck production increased 28% to 318,000 units, and our market share was 41% versus 42% a year ago. 
Our penetration within Tata Motors increased year-over-year. However, this was offset by a decline in Tata's truck share. Revenues for our Power Generation Business increased by 6%, in line with the pace of the economy. 
Now let me provide our overall outlook for 2016 and then comment on individual regions and end markets. 
We're currently forecasting total company revenues to decline by 5% to 9%, driven by a decline in heavy-duty truck production in North America, continued weakness in the global off-highway and power generation markets and further strengthening of the U.S. dollar against a number of currencies. Industry production for heavy-duty trucks in North America is projected to be 220,000 units, a 25% decrease year-over-year, with our market share projected to be between 30% and 33%. 
In the medium-duty truck market, we expect the market size to be 124,000 units or flat compared to 2015. We project our market share to be between 72% and 75%. 
Our engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America are expected to increase by 12%, reflecting strong demand from Chrysler and a ramp up in sales to Nissan. 
In China, we expect domestic revenues, including joint ventures, to be flat again in 2016, with market share gains in heavy- and light-duty truck markets helping to offset weaker market demand. We expect that our full year market share in the heavy- and medium-duty truck market will exceed 18% for the full year and that we will achieve 8% share of the light-duty truck market. 
We expect demand in most end markets in China to be down 10%, with industry truck market sales of light- and heavy-duty trucks combined expected to decline by 4%. 
In India, we expect total revenues, including joint ventures, to increase by 4% in 2016, with stronger demand in most end markets partially offset by depreciation of the rupee against the U.S. dollar. We expect the truck market to grow by 8% in 2016 and continue to outpace the recovery in off-highway markets. 
The Government of India is strongly promoting investment in infrastructure, which will be positive for our Power Generation, Construction and Rail businesses. However, the pace of new projects achieving full approval and moving forward has been slow. We are optimistic that the economy in India will continue to improve in 2016 and we are best positioned to benefit as investment increases and demand for capital goods picks up. 
In Brazil, we expect truck production for 2016 to decline by up to 20% as the country remains in recession. At some point, we will see a return to growth in Brazil, but that appears unlikely in 2016 given the current economic challenges. As a result of weak commodity prices and lower capital spending by energy and mining companies, we expect demand for our high-horsepower engines to decline again in 2016. In aggregate, we expect a 4% decline in engine revenues. 
Sales of our new QSK95 engine will add more than 5% to high-horsepower engine sales in 2016 but will be more than offset by weaker sales in most markets. 
Due to weak or slowing demand in many of our major markets, 2016 will be another challenging year. As I said, we expect sales to decline by 5% to 9%, and we expect EBIT margins to be in the range of 11.6%, 12.2%, resulting in 25% decremental margins at the midpoint of our guidance. 
Strong performance and cost reduction initiatives drove gross margin improvement in 2015 despite weaker sales. Through our restructuring actions and ongoing initiative to reduce material cost and improve quality, we expect to deliver even more savings in 2016, as Pat will cover in more detail. 
We did complete the reduction in professional headcount in the fourth quarter as planned and have already taken a number of actions within our manufacturing plants to lower costs. We have announced our plan to close a generator assembly plant in India, an alternator plant in Mexico and there will be at least one more significant announcement in the near term. 
Finally, as discussed in our investment day -- Investor Day, we plan to return 50% of operating cash flow to shareholders over time, but that we may return more or less in any given year depending on business needs and market conditions. In 2016, we plan to return 75% of operating cash flow to shareholders, building on our record $1.5 billion we have returned in 2015. 
Thank you for your interest today. And now I'll turn it over to Pat who will cover our 2015 performance and our 2016 guidance in more detail."

I will start with a review of the full year 2015 financial results before moving on to our fourth quarter performance. As Tom has already discussed, we had recorded restructuring and impairment charges totalin",2116,"Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I will start with a review of the full year 2015 financial results before moving on to our fourth quarter performance. 
As Tom has already discussed, we had recorded restructuring and impairment charges totaling $301 million pretax or $194 million after tax in the fourth quarter. In order to focus on the operational performance of the business, I am going to exclude these items and the $32 million of cost reduction activities in the Power Generation segment incurred in the fourth quarter of 2014 in my following comments. 
Full year revenues for the company were $19.1 billion, a decrease of 1% compared to the prior year. Increased revenues from the acquisitions of our North American distributors, along with higher demand in North American on-highway markets, were more than offset by a decline in global off-highway demand, weaker demand in the Brazilian truck market and the unfavorable currency impact from the stronger U.S. dollar. 
Revenues in North America improved 7% in 2015 and represented 61% of total 2015 revenues, up from 56% last year. International revenues declined by 11% compared to 2014, with lower sales in Latin America, Europe and Russia and the most regions in Asia, with the exception of India. 
Unfavorable currency movements negatively impacted full year sales by approximately 4% or over $700 million. Gross margins of 25.9% were 50 basis points higher than in 2014, with improvements in material cost and in warranty more than offsetting the negative impacts of product mix and from currency movements. 
Selling, admin and research and development cost decreased by $12 million in the year and were flat as a percent of sales, despite the acquisitions in our Distribution segment, which added $86 million in expense. 
Joint venture income decreased $55 million compared to last year, with higher earnings from our Foton-Cummins joint ventures in China, more than offset by the impact of distributor acquisitions in North America. A combination of other operating expense and nonoperating income was $161 million lower than last year, most of which relates to the $60 million loss contingency, $55 million in lower fair market value gains on the consolidation of our Distribution joint ventures and $27 million from the gains recorded last year from changes in the cash surrender value of our corporate owned life insurance policies. 
In total, earnings before interest and tax, or EBIT, was $2.4 billion or 12.5% of sales, down from $2.5 billion or 13.2% of sales in the previous year. Foreign currency negatively impacted EBIT by approximately $95 million. Net income was $1.6 billion or $8.93 per share, excluding the asset impairment and restructuring charges. This compares to $1.7 billion or $9.13 per share in 2014. And the operating tax rate for the full year came at 27.4%. 
Now let me comment specifically on the fourth quarter and provide some more details on our performance there. Fourth quarter revenues were $4.8 billion, a decrease of 6% from a year ago. Currency movements reduced sales by 4% while Distribution acquisitions added approximately 1.4% to sales. 
Sales in North America represented 60% of our fourth quarter revenues but declined 2% from a year ago due primarily to lower demand in heavy-duty truck, construction, oil and gas and power generation markets. 
International sales declined by 12% compared to the prior year, with the biggest contributor the very weak demand in Latin America and the negative impact of currency movements. Gross margins were 25.4% of sales, which is the same as a year ago as improvements to warranty cost and material costs offset the negative impact of lower volumes, currency and unfavorable product mix. 
Selling, admin and research and development cost of $685 million or 14.4% of sales decreased $60 million from a year ago and were 20 basis points lower as a percent of sales. Joint venture income of $75 million decreased by $1 million compared to last year. Increased earnings in China primarily due to the introduction of new products and market share gains in top markets were offset by the impact of acquiring our North American distributors which were previously held as joint ventures. 
A combination of other operating expense and nonoperating income decreased by $104 million. The main drivers of this change were the provision for a loss contingency in 2015 and the onetime fair market value gains on distributor acquisitions recorded in the fourth quarter of 2014. 
Earnings before interest and tax were $531 million or 11.1% of sales for the quarter compared to $661 million or 13% of sales last year. Foreign currency negatively impacted EBIT by $34 million. 
Net earnings for the quarter, excluding asset impairment and restructuring charges, were $355 million or $2.02 per diluted share compared to $2.56 in 2014. The all-in tax rate of 16% in the quarter included a $25 million benefit from the research and development tax credit that was passed late in 2015. 
Moving on to the operating segments, let me summarize their performance in the fourth quarter, their results for the full year of 2015 and then provide our current projections for 2016. I will then review the full year cash flow and conclude with the company's revenue and profitability expectations for the upcoming year. 
In the Engine segment, revenues were $2.5 billion, a decrease of 11% from last year. Off-highway revenues declined 22% due to weak global demand for engines in construction, marine and oil and gas markets. On-highway revenues declined by 5% as production in the North American heavy-duty truck market declined compared to a strong quarter in 2014. 
Segment EBIT was $189 million or 7.5% of sales compared to 11.1% last year. Excluding the loss contingency, EBIT was 9.8% in the quarter. 
Improvements in material costs and lower warranty expenses were more than offset by the impact of lower volumes and unfavorable product mix. For the full year, revenues decreased 5% from a year ago, and earnings before interest and taxes declined from 11.2% to 9.9%. 
For the Engine business in 2016, we expect revenues to be down by 5% to 9%. Industry production for heavy-duty trucks in North America is expected to decline by 25%. We expect global industrial revenues will decline due to lower demand in construction and in marine markets. In 2016, we will begin to see increased sales of our largest engine, the QSK95, which will help us outperform a weak market for high-horsepower engines. We expect full year high-horsepower engine volumes to decline by 5%. 
2016 EBIT margins are expected to be in the range of 9% to 10% of sales compared to 9.9% for full year 2015. The benefits from restructuring, lower material costs and higher joint venture earnings in China will help to offset the negative impact of the lower volumes. 
For the Distribution segment, fourth quarter revenues were $1.7 billion, which increased 1% compared to the prior year. Acquisitions added more than 9% to segment revenues year-over-year, partially offset by a 6% negative impact from foreign currency. Organic sales declined by 2% due to weak off-highway markets. 
EBIT margins for the quarter decreased from 9.3% to 6.5%, with foreign currency movements negatively impacting margins by 200 basis points. In addition, in 2014, we recorded $33 million of onetime fair market value gains in the acquisitions which would not repeat in the fourth quarter of 2015. Improvements in existing operations added 60 basis points to margins despite lower organic sales. 
For 2015, the Distribution business delivered record sales, up 20% compared to 2014. EBIT as a percent of sales declined from 9.5% to 7%. Currency negatively impacted earnings by $127 million, lowering the EBIT percentage by 200 basis points. In addition, we recorded $55 million less in onetime fair market value gains compared to the previous year. 
For 2016, Distribution revenue is projected to be flat to down 4% due to weak demand in off-highway markets and from the negative impact of the appreciating U.S. dollar. We expect EBIT margins to be in the range of 6.25% to 7.25% of sales. 
The Components segment recorded sales of $1.2 billion, a 6% decline from a year ago. Compared to the fourth quarter last year, lower demand in the North American and Brazilian truck markets, along with negative foreign currency impacts, led to the sales decline. 
Sales in China were up in the fourth quarter by 12%, and up 17% for the full year despite significantly weaker market demand as we continue to capture benefits from the transition to more advanced emission standards. Segment EBIT was $175 million or 14.2% of sales, an increase of 210 basis points, due primarily to strong execution on cost reduction initiatives which more than offset lower pricing. 
2015 was a record year for our Components segment in terms of revenues, EBIT dollars and EBIT percent. Revenues were up 1% and EBIT improved from 13.4% to 14.5% of sales. 
Looking forward into 2016. We expect revenue to decline by 6% to 10% as a result of weaker demand in North America. And EBIT is projected to be in the range of 12.75% to 13.75% of sales. 
In the Power Generation segment, fourth quarter sales were $654 million, down 14%, reflecting continued weakness in global markets. Year-over-year international sales decreased 15%, with Latin America accounting for half of the decline. Sales in North America were down 12% due to lower military sales and softer demand from data center customers. EBIT margins were 4.1% in the quarter, down from 7.1% last year. Lower sales volumes, adverse mix and lower pricing contributed to the lower EBIT margin, along with inventory write-downs due to very weak demand in some specific segments of the business. 
For the full year, Power Generation revenues were down 5% from 2014, and EBIT margins dropped from 6.9% to 6.4% of sales. 
For 2016, we expect Power Gen revenues to decline by a further 3% to 7%, with continued weakness in most major markets. EBIT margins are expected to improve in 2016 to between 6.5% to 7.5% as the benefits of restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives more than offset the impact of the lower volumes. 
As Tom mentioned, we are projecting total company revenues to be down 5% to 9% in 2016. Lower levels of production in the North American heavy-duty truck market, reduced demand globally for off-highway and power generation equipment and continued pressure from the strong U.S. dollar will drive the majority of the reduction in revenue. 
The introduction of new products and increased revenue from Distribution acquisitions will add between 1% to 2% to our revenues. Joint venture income is expected to be flat compared to 2015, with some improvements due to market share gains in China offset by weaker off-highway demand. 
We expect EBIT margins of between 11.6% and 12.2% for 2016, which compares to 12.5% in 2015. At the midpoint of the guidance, we expect to generate $300 million of cost savings that will partially offset the negative impact of lower volumes, currency, pricing and unfavorable product mix and will help contain decremental EBIT margins to 25%. 
The $300 million of savings will result from the benefits of restructuring actions, material cost reduction initiatives and lower warranty costs net of targeted investments. We are currently projecting the tax rate to be approximately 28.5% in 2016, excluding any discrete items, compared to 27.4% in 2015. 
And finally, let me turn to cash flow. In the fourth quarter, we reduced inventory by $352 million as we aligned production to the lower levels of demand. The improvement in inventory contributed to a positive $928 million in cash from operations in the fourth quarter. 
For the full year, we generated $2.1 billion in cash from operating activities, the third straight year above $2 billion. We continue to use that cash to reinvest back into the company and to return value to our shareholders. We returned 74% of the cash generated from operations to our shareholders in 2015. We increased our dividend by 25% and we repurchased 7.2 million shares for a combined total of $1.5 billion, up 29% over the amount returned in 2014. 
We also continue to invest in the business, with $744 million in capital expenditure projects in 2015 and $117 million for acquisitions. We anticipate operating cash flow performance in 2016 will be within our long-term guidance range of 10% to 15% of sales. Capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $600 million to $650 million. We will continue to repurchase shares.

And so probably 3 major areas, but 1 is the restructuring work that we kicked off before, we'll get a full year impact of that in 2015. The actions we took in Q4, for example the roughly a 7% professional headcount reduction was much heavier in the Power Gen Business. So it exceeded 10% in the Power Gen Business. Tom mentioned that some plants restructuring that we've done, that was all in the Power Generation Business. And again, we're looking to further actions in that area.

Frankly, there's a couple of things going on in China. One you know obviously is that from an economic point of view, there's a shift going on from what was largely an industrial and export economy to some more balanced economy, at least that's what they're trying to do. So almost all of our markets are declining even as the economy grows. And that's just a reflection of that shift, that we provide a lot to infrastructure and those kind of segments. And second thing that's going on, of course, is efficiency improvement. So in the truck market, for an example, there are a number of trucks sold in its peak, it's not clear that we'll ever hit that number again. It kind of depends. The efficiencies are improving, but so is the potential. So many parts of China where there's not much infrastructure built yet, the government is likely to build more infrastructure there. So it's kind of hard to know, frankly, from our point of view what, which -- right now, the trends are efficiency is improving faster than growth, which again, why we're seeing shrinkage in that market, trucks for example. But our view is that as the economy begins to grow and industrial begins to grow more, we'll see more expansion of the market overall. But all that's a long way of saying we don't exactly know what the peak looks like again. Here's what we do know, is that as they increase their focus on emissions out of their equipment and the quality, the demand for quality and more professional fleets and operators increases, the demand for our products is increasing. So as a percentage of the total trucks sold, our market share continues to increase and we are benefiting significantly from that, along with our partners there. And that is primarily a truck phenomenon today. But my expectation is that will be across all segments in China over time."

So I want to get a sense for what's sort of changed. And are you seeing that -- seeing any -- are there any different results, I guess, as you look at January? And then my second question is to Rich. I know Jerry asked about your Power Gen margins and your Power Gen margins improving and a modest sales decline in '16. I guess the flip side to that is at the Analyst Day, you talked about Power Gen margins doubling -- I mean, hitting I think, the double-digit range on sort of lower sales. And I think you even said over 2 years. So I'm just trying to get an update there. Is that largely relying on Hedgehog? Or how to think about that?"

So as you remember from our Analyst Day, I said sales to be down at least 5%. But nonetheless, there's no question that from our point of view, things that were rough, like the truck market, which we haven't really changed our outlook very much on, stayed rough. And the things that may be could have flattened out or got better did not. So all the resource markets look worse, not better. FX looks worse, not better. So again, what you -- as we're rolling through these things, you never know which things start -- which might start to bottom out. And right now, nothing seems to be that way. So really, there's no major shift in any one market. What I'd would say is all the things we were concerned about turned -- our concern turned out to be well-founded, and the things that were -- could maybe have stabilized haven't really yet. So again, we're operating in that environment. You know we've been there before. We're an urgent and flexible operator in this environment. So I wish it wasn't this, but I think we'll do relatively well because, well, we react quickly. I gave the example of our Jamestown Engine Plant, which is already down to the levels of production that we expect for this year and will produce efficiently at that level. So hopefully, we'll do well compared to the circumstances, but there's no question that the market circumstances are everything we expected and -- when we talked to you on Investor Day and slightly worse on those couple of things I mentioned, FX and just the general large engine area."

Although we're seeing sales maybe could be worse than flat, is what you're seeing in 2016. But the actions are the same. So and there's maybe -- in 3 areas. So one is that plant savings and some of the restructuring work we've done in plants and are continuing to do, the 2 plants that we already announced and some more stuff to come, those will play out over a couple of years. You don't get the savings immediately like you do with the restructuring of overhead savings. So the plant savings are yet to come. We've continued -- we've hit hard on the overhead reductions and we're continuing some work in there in how we do work in the Power Gen business. So less about taking a lot of people out, but significantly increasing the efficiency of how we get after quality, how we bring products to market faster. And that will again be a piece of it that will play out over the next 2 years. And then lastly, from -- the Hedgehog will be another tailwind that we'll get.

So you probably know I can't announce anything until I have something to announce, but the fact is we are -- I'm significantly involved in those, we have significant resources looking at those strategic growth opportunities.

Pat will then take you through more details on both our first quarter financial performance and our forecast for the full year. 
Revenues for the first quarter were $4.3 billion, a decrease of 9% compared to the first quarter of 2015. First quarter EBIT was $484 million or 11.3% of sales compared to $562 million or 11.9% in the same quarter last year. Our detrimental [ph] EBIT margin was 19% as the benefits of restructuring actions, improved quality, lower material costs all helped mitigate the impact of lower sales. 
Engine business revenues decreased by 10% year-over-year due to lower demand in North America heavy-duty truck market and weaker sales to global off-highway and Power Generation markets. 
Shipments of High Horsepower engines declined by 20% and reached the second lowest quarterly total in the past 12 years. EBITDA of 8.6% of sales declined from 9.7% a year ago as strong operational performance from our manufacturing plant and benefits from restructuring, material cost reduction initiatives and improved quality were offset by the lower impact -- or the impact, excuse me, of lower volumes. 
Revenues in our Components segment decreased 5% from a year ago, with lower demand North America more than offsetting growth in China. Sales in China increased by 27%, outpacing our end markets as we continue to capitalize on tighter emissions regulations and capture increased content and market share. EBIT of $173 million or 14% of sales declined from $195 million or 15% due to the impact of lower volumes and currency. 
Distribution revenues decreased by 1% compared to the first quarter of 2015. The negative impact of currency and weaker sales to off-highway markets more than offset the positive impact of acquisitions made in the second half of 2015. EBIT for the quarter of 6.5% improved from 6% a year ago with operational improvements more than offsetting the negative impact of currency. 
In the Power Generation business, revenues declined by 19% year-over-year, with weaker sales in most markets, especially in Asia and Latin America. EBIT declined from 7.2% to 5.6% as the impact of lower sales more than offset a 17% reduction in operating expenses. The first quarter is typically the weakest quarter for revenues in the Power Generation business and we do expect sales and margins to improve in subsequent quarters due to improving order intake in Europe and North America. 
Over the past 3 months, we've announced plans to further rationalize our manufacturing footprint, including the closure of an alternator facility in Mexico, a generator assembly plant in India and the exit of generator set assembly operations in Kent, England. These actions will start to generate savings in the second half of 2016, with additional savings in 2017 and 2018 and should help us stay ahead of any further risk of declining volumes. 
Now I will comment on some of our key markets, starting with North America. Our revenues in North America declined by 10% in the first quarter, due to weaker demand in on-highway markets, especially heavy-duty truck. Shipments to the North American heavy-duty truck market exceeded 16,000 units in the first quarter, a decrease of 33% from 2015 levels. First quarter market share was 29%. We have lowered our projection for full-year industry production to 210,000 units, at the midpoint of our guidance, down from our prior forecast of 22,000 units a slower freight activities has contributed to weak industry orders and higher dealer inventories. 
We currently expect our market share to be in the range of 27% to 30% for the year, down from our prior forecast of 30% to 33%, as Daimler has reduced the number of engines that it plans to order from Cummins and Navistar's market share has declined. 
In the medium-duty truck market, we delivered almost 22,000 engines in the first quarter, down 13% from last year. Our market share in the first quarter was 78%, down from 80% a year ago, only to complete our final shipments to Ford. We expect full-year industry production to be 123,000 units, down 1% compared to 2015 and our market share to be 75%, unchanged from our prior forecast. 
Our engine shipments to North American pickup truck OEMs increased by 29% in the first quarter. Shipments to Chrysler increased 9% to more than 34,000 units, the highest first quarter volume in 10 years. Sales also increased to Nissan following the launch of our 5-liter V8 engine in the fourth quarter last year. We currently expect our revenues in the pickup segment to increase by 12% in 2015[ph] , unchanged from our prior forecast. 
Our Engine revenues from the North American construction market decreased by 9% compared to the first quarter last year. While housing and commercial construction activity remains positive, demand for new equipment from rental companies has declined due to a slowdown in business in the oil and gas market. 
Power Generation revenues declined 4% in North America in the first quarter due to lower orders from data center customers. We expect full-year revenues in North America to be flat to up 2% as order rates have improved this year, following the weak close to 2015. 
Our international revenues declined by 8% year-over-year, with weaker sales in Latin America and Asia driving the decline. First quarter revenues in China including joint ventures were $767 million, a decrease of 5% due to the negative impact of the depreciation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar and weaker demand for power generation equipment. 
Industry demand for heavy and medium-duty trucks in China increased by 9% in the first quarter. We continue to increase our penetration at Foton which is now at 74%, up from 55% a year ago and at Dongfeng which is up more than 5% to 50%. Our overall market share was over 15% in the first quarter, down slightly from a year ago. As Dongfeng and Foton adopted a more cautious start to the year than some of their competitors, and under produced relative to the overall industry. We still expect our share will reach 80% for the year as our partners increase production sales more in line with the industry and our penetration continues to grow. 
We currently forecast full year industry sales to decline by 4%, unchanged from our previous forecast. Industry demand for the first quarter was stronger than expected. But visibility to demand in the second half is limited and we believe it is prudent to be cautious about market improvement. 
Shipments of our light-duty engines in China grew 9% in the first quarter compared to 3% decline for the overall market, as we increased penetration at Foton, displacing local competitor engines. Our share of the overall market reached 7% in the first quarter, up from 6% a year ago. We currently project industry sales to decline by 4% for the year, again, unchanged from 3 months ago. 
Our Power Generation revenues decreased by 27% year-over-year compared to a strong quarter a year ago. Sales weakened in the second half of 2015 as the industrial economies slowed and we have not seen any signs of improvement yet. Industry sales of excavators in China increased by 15% in the first quarter as OE dealers pushed sales of Tier 2 inventory ahead of the transition to Tier 3 emission standards and came into force in April. 
Overall numbers of excavators sold though remains low, and while there is little downside risk left, there is no obvious catalyst for significant growth in the near term. 
Full-year revenues in China across all segments including joint ventures are expected to be flat for the year consistent with our view 3 months ago with no major changes to any of our market assumptions. 
First quarter revenues in India including joint ventures were $390 million, up 7% year-over-year, primarily due to recovery in the Indian truck market. Industry demand in the truck market increased 25% compared to the first quarter a year ago as the economy continues to improve. Our market share in the first quarter was 38%, down from 39% due to stronger growth in sales of vehicles below 10% -- excuse me, below 10 tons in weight where our penetration in the market is lower. We now expect industry truck production to increase 10% for the year, up from our prior forecast of 8% growth. 
Power Generation revenues in India declined 1% in the first quarter with a weaker rupee offsetting 3% growth in volumes. We currently project full-year revenues, including joint ventures to be flat to up 2% with higher domestic volumes, largely offset by the depreciation of rupee against the U.S. dollar. 
First quarter revenues in Brazil were $72 million, down 42% from the first quarter last year, with the economy in recession and the real have been depreciated a further 16% against the U.S. dollar. Industry truck production fell 36% year-over-year while our engine shipments declined 35%. Revenues in all of our businesses were lower than a year ago due to the economic challenges in the region. We currently expect a full-year decline of 20% in industry truck production, with slightly easier comparisons to come in the second half of the year. 
Let me now make a few comments on High Horsepower markets. As I said in my opening remarks, volumes are extremely weak, with the first quarter's volumes down 20% due to lower demand in commercial marine, mining and power generation markets. New orders in the U.S. oil and gas market are very scarce. 
We expect full-year shipments of high-horsepower engines to decline by 6%, helped by growth in sales of our new QSK95 liter engine and easier comparisons in the second half of the year. We are very pleased to receive EPA Tier 4 final certification for our QSK95 engine for rail applications recently, allowing us to win some important business in the high-speed passenger rail market. 
In summary, we currently expect company revenues to decrease between 5% and 9% for the year, unchanged from 3 months ago. We did lower our outlook for heavy-duty truck production in North America, offset by an additional North American distributor acquisition and a less negative impact from currency in our forecast from 3 months ago. We expect EBIT to be in the range of 11.6% to 12.2% for the year, consistent with our prior forecast. We've made solid progress in executing our cost reduction plans in the first quarter and every organization throughout Cummins remains focused on driving further productivity and cost improvements. 
As one example, starting in April, we combined our Power Generation segment and High Horsepower Engine business into a newly formed segment called Power Systems. This reorganization will consolidate two businesses that are already strongly interdependent and will allow us to streamline business and technical processes to accelerate innovation in those markets, to grow market share and more efficiently manage our supply chain and manufacturing operations. [indiscernible] content previously leader of the Engine business is now leading the new Power Systems segment and [indiscernible] as the remaining Engine business. [indiscernible] and Tony Satterthwaite will continue to lead Components and Distribution segments, respectively. 
Finally, we returned $745 million to shareholders in the first quarter through dividends and the execution of our accelerated share repurchase program, consistent with our plan to return approximately 75% of our operating cash flow to shareholders in 2016. Thank you for your interest today. 
Now I'll turn it over to Pat, who will cover our first quarter results and full-year guidance in more detail."

First quarter revenues were $4.3 billion, a decrease of 9% from a year ago, with currency movements reducing our sales by 3%. Sales in North America which represents 61% of our first quarter revenues declined 1",1072,"Thank you, Tom, and good morning everyone. First quarter revenues were $4.3 billion, a decrease of 9% from a year ago, with currency movements reducing our sales by 3%. 
Sales in North America which represents 61% of our first quarter revenues declined 10% from a year ago, due primarily to lower demand in North American truck markets and continued weakness in industrial markets. International sales declined by 8% as a result of lower demand in Power Generation and industrial markets and the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar. 
Gross margins were 24.6% of sales, a decline of 80 basis points from a year ago. Lower volumes and an unfavorable product mix were partially offset by improvements in material costs and warranty expenses and the benefits from the restructuring actions. 
Selling, admin and research and development expense of $656 million or 15.3% of sales decreased $56 million from a year ago after taking restructuring actions in the fourth quarter of last year. This was 20 basis points higher as a percent of sales due to lower revenues. 
Joint venture income of $72 million increased by $4 million compared to a year ago, results in the first quarter a year ago included an impairment of an investment in the North Highway joint venture which did not repeat. 
Earnings before interest and tax were $484 million or 11.3% of sales for the quarter compared to 11.9% of sales last year and this equates to a detrimental [ph] EBIT margin of 19%. 
Net earnings for the quarter were $321 million or $1.87 per diluted share compared to $387 million or $2.14 per share from a year ago. And the effective tax rate for the quarter was 28.4%. 
I will now highlight the performance of the individual operating segments during the first quarter. In the Engine segment, revenues were $2.3 billion, a decrease of 10% from last year. Industrial revenues declined by 13% from weak global demand for engines in marine, mining and oil and gas markets. On-highway revenues decreased 8% as production in the North American heavy-duty truck market declined compared to a year ago. Segment EBIT was $200 million or 8.6% of sales compared to 9.7% last year. The benefits of the restructuring actions, material cost savings and lower warranty expense were more than offset by lower volumes and an unfavorable product mix, primarily from a reduction in North American heavy and medium-duty truck volumes and a 20% reduction in high-horsepower engine shipments. For the Distribution segment, first quarter revenues were $1.5 billion, a decrease of 1% compared to the prior year. Foreign currency movements negatively impacted sales by 4% while organic sales declined by 5% with lower sales in North American off-highway markets more than offsetting growth in China and in Europe. Acquisitions added 8% to revenues. EBIT margins for the quarter increased from 6% to 6.5%, despite a 70 basis point unfavorable impact from foreign currency. Excluding the currency impact, margins improved by 120 basis points due to the benefits of restructuring, a stronger mix of aftermarket revenues and positive pricing. 
The Components segment recorded sales of $1.2 billion, a decrease of 5% from a year ago. Sales in China increased in the first quarter by 27%, which helped partially offset the decline from lower heavy-duty truck production in North America and the negative impact of foreign currency. Segment EBIT was $173 million or 14% of sales compared to 15% of sales a year ago as lower volumes, unfavorable pricing and currency more than offset the benefits of material cost reductions and restructuring actions. 
In the Power Generation segment, first quarter sales were $550 million, down 19% from last year. International sales declined 27%, with Asia and South America experiencing the largest declines year-over-year due to the small piece of investment in infrastructure projects. EBIT margins were 5.6% in the quarter, down from 7.2% last year. The benefits from the restructuring actions and lower material costs partially offset the impact of the volume decline and helped keep detrimental margins to 14%. 
For the company. Cash flow from operations was $263 million, better than the same quarter last year by $19 [ph] million due to lower working capital requirements as sales declined. As we indicated at the beginning of the year, we plan to return approximately 75% of cash generated from operations to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases this year. 
During the first quarter, we repurchased 4.9 million shares, primarily resulting from the previously announced $500 million accelerated share repurchase program and we made dividend payments totaling $170 million, up from $140 million a year ago. Our cash and marketable securities balance declined in the quarter by $537 million, primarily due to the share repurchases, the increased dividend payments of $170 million and capital expenditure of $71 million. 
As Tom mentioned, our guidance for our full-year performance is unchanged from 3 months ago. We are projecting total company revenues to be down 5% to 9% in 2016, lower levels of production in the North American on-highway markets, reduced demand globally for off-highway and Power Generation equipment and negative impact of currency movements will drive the majority of the reduction in revenue. 
We expect some offset from introduction of new products and increased revenue from distributor acquisitions. We expect EBIT margins of between 11.6% to 12.2% for 2016 and this compares to 12.5% for the full year 2015 excluding the restructuring and impairment charges and represents a decremental EBIT margin of 25%. 
Benefits from material cost savings, restructuring and other actions will help mitigate the impact of lower volumes. Joint venture income are still expected to be flat compared to 2015. We anticipate operating cash flow performance in 2016 will be within our long-term guidance range of 10% to 15% of sales. And capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $600 million to $650 million in 2016. As Tom just discussed, effective April, we reorganized the company into new operating segments. We will issue restated results for the first quarter of 2016 and results for 2015 and 2014 to reflect our new operating segments before we report second quarter results. We will issue [indiscernible] full-year guidance for each of the new operating segments [indiscernible] before we report second quarter results. And just to confirm, our current full year guidance for the company is unchanged from 3 months ago. 
Now let me turn it back over to Mark."

But I -- we are of course preparing, as you can tell from these actions for continued weakness for some time. I think that's why we decided to take further actions in the business. When we did our restructuring in the fourth quarter, we did much more out of the Power Generation segment. We've now taken some plant capacity -- significant plant capacity out now with these 3 closures. So we are anticipating that we may be weak for some period. Hopefully, it improves faster than that. But we're prepared for it now after watching it decline for quite some time. Joel, if I could just add, the combination of our segments also, I think our gives us the opportunity now to begin the share overhead, drive improvement and efficiency in our processes between the large engine and the PowerGen business, which we think, not only will help us in this tough time, but as the market springs back, we'll be able to capture more share and respond more quickly. So we think it's good for the short run to reduce cost but also, it drives productivity and launch and ramp up processes and get much better in the future."

That is what we are committed to do and that's what we're doing. And we've said that along, would be to take more actions, will take them. So these are an example of that. So we don't know what's going to happen in the future but we feel more prepared to deal with it whatever it is and feel like we've got our cost structure in place for what the business is now and again, if it's gets a lot worse, we'll figure that out and take action when we need to. But we really like the actions we've taken here that's better positioning us for a really really challenging market that exists today. And Rich, can you talk about inventory question?"

So the long-term view on share, let me just repeat what I think is going on the market today with we see is we took that down as we saw our shares [indiscernible] and we forecast [indiscernible] down. But I think in the environmental excess capacity, we're clearly seeing more pressure to utilize internal resources and more incentives and discounting to do that. We also have seen some modest increase in Navistar this year. Again, nothing major but actually seen that go down. So those 2 things were behind the immediate change we put in place. Our approach, we are going to stay disciplined. We're not going to chase share with discounting. The products performing well and so we're going to continue to just sell that [indiscernible] a customer to get that back. at the same time, align our cost and deliverability financials in this environment. I think longer-term, as we think about the share, our view is it's still a 50% [indiscernible] 50% [indiscernible] market, okay? So that's -- and today, we compete really with the 15-liter product. And that was part of our announcement that we made in New York that we will be bringing the medium [indiscernible] to the market in 2017 to compete on the other end where we used to have kind of [indiscernible] product were going to have a terrific product down there at that end. So we see our share with PACCAR kind of in that 50% or 57% range now. That market tends to be a little more big board than medium board. So we feel from -- horsepower range, 13-liter products can over a large, larger part of the horsepower range. So just the right product in certain cycle and the customer kind of draws that to more 50-50. So that's what kind our guidance kind of looking forward."

The biggest concern, I think in the market place, really, is unused equipment. It's where our people and equipment. The mining market, this is an issue, and the oil and gas market, it's an issue. And what that means is that the business starts to pick up, they will be a little before we start to see the kind of equipment orders that we like to see when that business picks up.

I think what we see, what projecting in light, and again, not that we have a great insight.

In the first quarter, we had a 3% negative impact from sales and then a $19 million impact on profitability negative for the company. Given where currency rates currently are today, we expect foreign currency headwind on the company for the rest of the year to be much less than what we've seen for the past 1.5 years. We have now guided for the full year in currency to be down about $200 million in sales so 1 percentage point. And fairly neutral actually on profitability for the full year. So if we just back into the rest of the year, that would imply that the sales impact is going to be less than 1% negative as opposed to 3% in the first quarter and profitability should be a little bit better across all of the segments than what we've seen in Q1 and for most of last year. And obviously, distribution, we have the [indiscernible] the segment has been more exposed to currency movements. So that should help as it moves to quarter 2."

Still, we can have currencies which are strengthening or weakening relative to the U.S. dollar. But on balance, they can work their way out because some might be going the other way. But so I think distributions still has currency exposure. But hopefully, as Pat said, on balance, we'll see a little bit less of a negative impact. The one thing I would just highlight to you is we did see improvement in margin this quarter and that's despite currency and other challenges there. So that's a pretty good evidence that some of the synergies and other things that what they've been doing is starting to pay off to the question earlier. I think with the distributor acquisition, you're right. There's just the 1 month in North America left to do. That's the 1 we'll finish this year. That's in California. So it's not that small distributor actually. It's not the biggest. But it's decent in size. But we'll be acquiring that in the second half of the year and when that's complete, we will now then own all of the North American distributors and the process will be complete for North America.

The other thing that's, I'm just going to mention indirectly to your question, it relates a little bit on the Components and heavy-duty space, our strategy is to -- we sell engines to people who are vertically integrated. And so -- and we sell engines. But when we don't sell engines, we sell components. So some of the movement between engines and components, the components business continues to benefit from that.

Revenues for the first quarter were $4.3 billion, a decrease of 9% compared to the first quarter of 2015. First quarter EBIT was $484 million or 11.3% of sales compared to $562 million or 11.9% in the same quarter last year. Our detrimental [ph] EBIT margin was 19% as the benefits of restructuring actions, improved quality, lower material costs all helped mitigate the impact of lower sales. 
Engine business revenues decreased by 10% year-over-year due to lower demand in North America heavy-duty truck market and weaker sales to global off-highway and Power Generation markets. 
Shipments of High Horsepower engines declined by 20% and reached the second lowest quarterly total in the past 12 years. EBITDA of 8.6% of sales declined from 9.7% a year ago as strong operational performance from our manufacturing plant and benefits from restructuring, material cost reduction initiatives and improved quality were offset by the lower impact -- or the impact, excuse me, of lower volumes. 
Revenues in our Components segment decreased 5% from a year ago, with lower demand North America more than offsetting growth in China. Sales in China increased by 27%, outpacing our end markets as we continue to capitalize on tighter emissions regulations and capture increased content and market share. EBIT of $173 million or 14% of sales declined from $195 million or 15% due to the impact of lower volumes and currency. 
Distribution revenues decreased by 1% compared to the first quarter of 2015. The negative impact of currency and weaker sales to off-highway markets more than offset the positive impact of acquisitions made in the second half of 2015. EBIT for the quarter of 6.5% improved from 6% a year ago with operational improvements more than offsetting the negative impact of currency. 
In the Power Generation business, revenues declined by 19% year-over-year, with weaker sales in most markets, especially in Asia and Latin America. EBIT declined from 7.2% to 5.6% as the impact of lower sales more than offset a 17% reduction in operating expenses. The first quarter is typically the weakest quarter for revenues in the Power Generation business and we do expect sales and margins to improve in subsequent quarters due to improving order intake in Europe and North America. 
Over the past 3 months, we've announced plans to further rationalize our manufacturing footprint, including the closure of an alternator facility in Mexico, a generator assembly plant in India and the exit of generator set assembly operations in Kent, England. These actions will start to generate savings in the second half of 2016, with additional savings in 2017 and 2018 and should help us stay ahead of any further risk of declining volumes. 
Now I will comment on some of our key markets, starting with North America. Our revenues in North America declined by 10% in the first quarter, due to weaker demand in on-highway markets, especially heavy-duty truck. Shipments to the North American heavy-duty truck market exceeded 16,000 units in the first quarter, a decrease of 33% from 2015 levels. First quarter market share was 29%. We have lowered our projection for full-year industry production to 210,000 units, at the midpoint of our guidance, down from our prior forecast of 22,000 units a slower freight activities has contributed to weak industry orders and higher dealer inventories. 
We currently expect our market share to be in the range of 27% to 30% for the year, down from our prior forecast of 30% to 33%, as Daimler has reduced the number of engines that it plans to order from Cummins and Navistar's market share has declined. 
In the medium-duty truck market, we delivered almost 22,000 engines in the first quarter, down 13% from last year. Our market share in the first quarter was 78%, down from 80% a year ago, only to complete our final shipments to Ford. We expect full-year industry production to be 123,000 units, down 1% compared to 2015 and our market share to be 75%, unchanged from our prior forecast. 
Our engine shipments to North American pickup truck OEMs increased by 29% in the first quarter. Shipments to Chrysler increased 9% to more than 34,000 units, the highest first quarter volume in 10 years. Sales also increased to Nissan following the launch of our 5-liter V8 engine in the fourth quarter last year. We currently expect our revenues in the pickup segment to increase by 12% in 2015[ph] , unchanged from our prior forecast. 
Our Engine revenues from the North American construction market decreased by 9% compared to the first quarter last year. While housing and commercial construction activity remains positive, demand for new equipment from rental companies has declined due to a slowdown in business in the oil and gas market. 
Power Generation revenues declined 4% in North America in the first quarter due to lower orders from data center customers. We expect full-year revenues in North America to be flat to up 2% as order rates have improved this year, following the weak close to 2015. 
Our international revenues declined by 8% year-over-year, with weaker sales in Latin America and Asia driving the decline. First quarter revenues in China including joint ventures were $767 million, a decrease of 5% due to the negative impact of the depreciation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar and weaker demand for power generation equipment. 
Industry demand for heavy and medium-duty trucks in China increased by 9% in the first quarter. We continue to increase our penetration at Foton which is now at 74%, up from 55% a year ago and at Dongfeng which is up more than 5% to 50%. Our overall market share was over 15% in the first quarter, down slightly from a year ago. As Dongfeng and Foton adopted a more cautious start to the year than some of their competitors, and under produced relative to the overall industry. We still expect our share will reach 80% for the year as our partners increase production sales more in line with the industry and our penetration continues to grow. 
We currently forecast full year industry sales to decline by 4%, unchanged from our previous forecast. Industry demand for the first quarter was stronger than expected. But visibility to demand in the second half is limited and we believe it is prudent to be cautious about market improvement. 
Shipments of our light-duty engines in China grew 9% in the first quarter compared to 3% decline for the overall market, as we increased penetration at Foton, displacing local competitor engines. Our share of the overall market reached 7% in the first quarter, up from 6% a year ago. We currently project industry sales to decline by 4% for the year, again, unchanged from 3 months ago. 
Our Power Generation revenues decreased by 27% year-over-year compared to a strong quarter a year ago. Sales weakened in the second half of 2015 as the industrial economies slowed and we have not seen any signs of improvement yet. Industry sales of excavators in China increased by 15% in the first quarter as OE dealers pushed sales of Tier 2 inventory ahead of the transition to Tier 3 emission standards and came into force in April. 
Overall numbers of excavators sold though remains low, and while there is little downside risk left, there is no obvious catalyst for significant growth in the near term. 
Full-year revenues in China across all segments including joint ventures are expected to be flat for the year consistent with our view 3 months ago with no major changes to any of our market assumptions. 
First quarter revenues in India including joint ventures were $390 million, up 7% year-over-year, primarily due to recovery in the Indian truck market. Industry demand in the truck market increased 25% compared to the first quarter a year ago as the economy continues to improve. Our market share in the first quarter was 38%, down from 39% due to stronger growth in sales of vehicles below 10% -- excuse me, below 10 tons in weight where our penetration in the market is lower. We now expect industry truck production to increase 10% for the year, up from our prior forecast of 8% growth. 
Power Generation revenues in India declined 1% in the first quarter with a weaker rupee offsetting 3% growth in volumes. We currently project full-year revenues, including joint ventures to be flat to up 2% with higher domestic volumes, largely offset by the depreciation of rupee against the U.S. dollar. 
First quarter revenues in Brazil were $72 million, down 42% from the first quarter last year, with the economy in recession and the real have been depreciated a further 16% against the U.S. dollar. Industry truck production fell 36% year-over-year while our engine shipments declined 35%. Revenues in all of our businesses were lower than a year ago due to the economic challenges in the region. We currently expect a full-year decline of 20% in industry truck production, with slightly easier comparisons to come in the second half of the year. 
Let me now make a few comments on High Horsepower markets. As I said in my opening remarks, volumes are extremely weak, with the first quarter's volumes down 20% due to lower demand in commercial marine, mining and power generation markets. New orders in the U.S. oil and gas market are very scarce. 
We expect full-year shipments of high-horsepower engines to decline by 6%, helped by growth in sales of our new QSK95 liter engine and easier comparisons in the second half of the year. We are very pleased to receive EPA Tier 4 final certification for our QSK95 engine for rail applications recently, allowing us to win some important business in the high-speed passenger rail market. 
In summary, we currently expect company revenues to decrease between 5% and 9% for the year, unchanged from 3 months ago. We did lower our outlook for heavy-duty truck production in North America, offset by an additional North American distributor acquisition and a less negative impact from currency in our forecast from 3 months ago. We expect EBIT to be in the range of 11.6% to 12.2% for the year, consistent with our prior forecast. We've made solid progress in executing our cost reduction plans in the first quarter and every organization throughout Cummins remains focused on driving further productivity and cost improvements. 
As one example, starting in April, we combined our Power Generation segment and High Horsepower Engine business into a newly formed segment called Power Systems. This reorganization will consolidate two businesses that are already strongly interdependent and will allow us to streamline business and technical processes to accelerate innovation in those markets, to grow market share and more efficiently manage our supply chain and manufacturing operations. [indiscernible] content previously leader of the Engine business is now leading the new Power Systems segment and [indiscernible] as the remaining Engine business. [indiscernible] and Tony Satterthwaite will continue to lead Components and Distribution segments, respectively. 
Finally, we returned $745 million to shareholders in the first quarter through dividends and the execution of our accelerated share repurchase program, consistent with our plan to return approximately 75% of our operating cash flow to shareholders in 2016. Thank you for your interest today. 
Now I'll turn it over to Pat, who will cover our first quarter results and full-year guidance in more detail."

First quarter revenues were $4.3 billion, a decrease of 9% from a year ago, with currency movements reducing our sales by 3%. Sales in North America which represents 61% of our first quarter revenues declined 1",1072,"Thank you, Tom, and good morning everyone. First quarter revenues were $4.3 billion, a decrease of 9% from a year ago, with currency movements reducing our sales by 3%. 
Sales in North America which represents 61% of our first quarter revenues declined 10% from a year ago, due primarily to lower demand in North American truck markets and continued weakness in industrial markets. International sales declined by 8% as a result of lower demand in Power Generation and industrial markets and the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar. 
Gross margins were 24.6% of sales, a decline of 80 basis points from a year ago. Lower volumes and an unfavorable product mix were partially offset by improvements in material costs and warranty expenses and the benefits from the restructuring actions. 
Selling, admin and research and development expense of $656 million or 15.3% of sales decreased $56 million from a year ago after taking restructuring actions in the fourth quarter of last year. This was 20 basis points higher as a percent of sales due to lower revenues. 
Joint venture income of $72 million increased by $4 million compared to a year ago, results in the first quarter a year ago included an impairment of an investment in the North Highway joint venture which did not repeat. 
Earnings before interest and tax were $484 million or 11.3% of sales for the quarter compared to 11.9% of sales last year and this equates to a detrimental [ph] EBIT margin of 19%. 
Net earnings for the quarter were $321 million or $1.87 per diluted share compared to $387 million or $2.14 per share from a year ago. And the effective tax rate for the quarter was 28.4%. 
I will now highlight the performance of the individual operating segments during the first quarter. In the Engine segment, revenues were $2.3 billion, a decrease of 10% from last year. Industrial revenues declined by 13% from weak global demand for engines in marine, mining and oil and gas markets. On-highway revenues decreased 8% as production in the North American heavy-duty truck market declined compared to a year ago. Segment EBIT was $200 million or 8.6% of sales compared to 9.7% last year. The benefits of the restructuring actions, material cost savings and lower warranty expense were more than offset by lower volumes and an unfavorable product mix, primarily from a reduction in North American heavy and medium-duty truck volumes and a 20% reduction in high-horsepower engine shipments. For the Distribution segment, first quarter revenues were $1.5 billion, a decrease of 1% compared to the prior year. Foreign currency movements negatively impacted sales by 4% while organic sales declined by 5% with lower sales in North American off-highway markets more than offsetting growth in China and in Europe. Acquisitions added 8% to revenues. EBIT margins for the quarter increased from 6% to 6.5%, despite a 70 basis point unfavorable impact from foreign currency. Excluding the currency impact, margins improved by 120 basis points due to the benefits of restructuring, a stronger mix of aftermarket revenues and positive pricing. 
The Components segment recorded sales of $1.2 billion, a decrease of 5% from a year ago. Sales in China increased in the first quarter by 27%, which helped partially offset the decline from lower heavy-duty truck production in North America and the negative impact of foreign currency. Segment EBIT was $173 million or 14% of sales compared to 15% of sales a year ago as lower volumes, unfavorable pricing and currency more than offset the benefits of material cost reductions and restructuring actions. 
In the Power Generation segment, first quarter sales were $550 million, down 19% from last year. International sales declined 27%, with Asia and South America experiencing the largest declines year-over-year due to the small piece of investment in infrastructure projects. EBIT margins were 5.6% in the quarter, down from 7.2% last year. The benefits from the restructuring actions and lower material costs partially offset the impact of the volume decline and helped keep detrimental margins to 14%. 
For the company. Cash flow from operations was $263 million, better than the same quarter last year by $19 [ph] million due to lower working capital requirements as sales declined. As we indicated at the beginning of the year, we plan to return approximately 75% of cash generated from operations to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases this year. 
During the first quarter, we repurchased 4.9 million shares, primarily resulting from the previously announced $500 million accelerated share repurchase program and we made dividend payments totaling $170 million, up from $140 million a year ago. Our cash and marketable securities balance declined in the quarter by $537 million, primarily due to the share repurchases, the increased dividend payments of $170 million and capital expenditure of $71 million. 
As Tom mentioned, our guidance for our full-year performance is unchanged from 3 months ago. We are projecting total company revenues to be down 5% to 9% in 2016, lower levels of production in the North American on-highway markets, reduced demand globally for off-highway and Power Generation equipment and negative impact of currency movements will drive the majority of the reduction in revenue. 
We expect some offset from introduction of new products and increased revenue from distributor acquisitions. We expect EBIT margins of between 11.6% to 12.2% for 2016 and this compares to 12.5% for the full year 2015 excluding the restructuring and impairment charges and represents a decremental EBIT margin of 25%. 
Benefits from material cost savings, restructuring and other actions will help mitigate the impact of lower volumes. Joint venture income are still expected to be flat compared to 2015. We anticipate operating cash flow performance in 2016 will be within our long-term guidance range of 10% to 15% of sales. And capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $600 million to $650 million in 2016. As Tom just discussed, effective April, we reorganized the company into new operating segments. We will issue restated results for the first quarter of 2016 and results for 2015 and 2014 to reflect our new operating segments before we report second quarter results. We will issue [indiscernible] full-year guidance for each of the new operating segments [indiscernible] before we report second quarter results. And just to confirm, our current full year guidance for the company is unchanged from 3 months ago.

When we did our restructuring in the fourth quarter, we did much more out of the Power Generation segment. We've now taken some plant capacity -- significant plant capacity out now with these 3 closures. So we are anticipating that we may be weak for some period. Hopefully, it improves faster than that. But we're prepared for it now after watching it decline for quite some time. Joel, if I could just add, the combination of our segments also, I think our gives us the opportunity now to begin the share overhead, drive improvement and efficiency in our processes between the large engine and the PowerGen business, which we think, not only will help us in this tough time, but as the market springs back, we'll be able to capture more share and respond more quickly.

There was a really strong quarter in China in the first quarter but I think there's some signs that things maybe good and improving and we're just remaining a little cautious. So again, we left our forecast where it was and it's partially because we've just seen China promise better and beat the market, not be that strong the rest of the year, couple of years in a row so just want to be prudent and watch and see as see a couple of quarters before we really called an upside and also, just fundamentals don't look that much different. So I think that's the place where maybe, if things are improving, as some people suggest, we could have some upside in JV income there. But right now, our view is we're just -- we think we're pretty -- we're going to stay where we are from the point of view of forecasting. And on the off-highway side, maybe it's the opposite. It's not that things are great now. But I just feel like it's weak markets all over the place. And so maybe there's a little bit of downside still on off-highway. But again, I -- there's not much to go. The good news is we're selling there's not much to go. But there a lot of a lot of equipment and a lot of challenge in those markets.

And Steve here, Steve talked about revolutionary. And the main fact are, just are -- they're lighter weight, they're high-performance, they don't break down I mean, just one number, the RSG engine is 150 pounds per liter and all the competitive engines are for 200. And so they're just engines, it's a different market where the old model was you had an engine that was easy to fix, because if they broke, their parts were not expensive. We're changing the market here with an engine that you had to get into and you don't had to change and have telematics on it. And so we had to rapid rise we're just displacing.

There was quite a bit of activity in the market and quite a bit of discounting by a couple of folks. But just more activity. They didn't participate in that same sort of thing and so they step back in their truck share. We're not the least bit worried about that. We think that works itself out over the course of the year.

The distribution piece is more indirect on the part sales. So we think by our regional distribution strategy, increasing availability, et cetera, we'll get some upside there. But it's more around the synergies of getting product out there on parts. So I don't -- I wouldn't attribute the acquisition to increasing part sales although not we participate in those revenue didn't use to we didn't joint venture at the same level. The other thing that's, I'm just going to mention indirectly to your question, it relates a little bit on the Components and heavy-duty space, our strategy is to -- we sell engines to people who are vertically integrated. And so -- and we sell engines. But when we don't sell engines, we sell components. So some of the movement between engines and components, the components business continues to benefit from that. And our share in things like turbos are over 60% and that's remain solid. Our share in aftertreatment are over 50%. And so we've continued to maintain that in a time regardless of what's happening on market share on the engine side."

I'll start with a summary of our first quarter results and provide an update on our outlook for the full year. Pat will then take you through more details of both our first quarter financial performance and our forecast for the full year.
Revenues for the first quarter were $4.3 billion, a decrease of 9% compared to the first quarter of 2015. First quarter EBIT was $484 million or 11.3% of sales compared to $562 million or 11.9% in the same quarter last year. Our decremental EBIT margin was 19% as the benefits of restructuring actions, improved quality, lower material costs all helped mitigate the impact of lower sales.
Engine business revenues decreased by 10% year-over-year due to lower demand in North American heavy-duty truck market and weaker sales to global off-highway and power generation markets. Shipments of high-horsepower engines declined by 20% and reached the second lowest quarterly total in the past 12 years. EBITDA of 8.6% of sales declined from 9.7% a year ago as strong operational performance from our manufacturing plant and benefits from restructuring, material cost reduction initiatives and improved quality were offset by the lower impact -- by the impact, excuse me, of lower volumes.
Revenues in our Components segment decreased 5% from a year ago, with lower demand in North America more than offsetting growth in China. Sales in China increased by 27%, outpacing our end markets as we continue to capitalize on tighter emissions regulations and capture increased content and market share. EBIT of $173 million or 14% of sales declined from $195 million or 15% due to the impact of lower volumes and currency.
Distribution revenues decreased by 1% compared to the first quarter of 2015. The negative impact of currency and weaker sales to off-highway markets more than offset the positive impact of acquisitions made in the second half of 2015. EBIT for the quarter of 6.5% improved from 6% a year ago, with operational improvements more than offsetting the negative impact of currency.
In the Power Generation business, revenues declined by 19% year-over-year, with weaker sales in most markets, especially Asia and Latin America. EBIT declined from 7.2% to 5.6% as the impact of lower sales more than offset a 17% reduction in operating expenses. The first quarter is typically the weakest quarter for revenues in the Power Generation business, and we do expect sales and margins to improve in subsequent quarters due to improving order intake in Europe and North America.
Over the past 3 months, we've announced plans to further rationalize our manufacturing footprint, including the closure of an alternator facility in Mexico, a generator assembly plant in India and the exit of generator set assembly operations in Kent, England. These actions will start to generate savings in the second half of 2016, with additional savings in 2017 and 2018, and should help us stay ahead of any further risk of declining volumes.
Now I will comment on some of our key markets, starting with North America. Our revenues in North America declined by 10% in the first quarter due to weaker demand in on-highway markets, especially heavy-duty truck.
Shipments to the North American heavy-duty truck market exceeded 16,000 units in the first quarter, a decrease of 33% from 2015 levels. First quarter market share was 29%. We have lowered our projection for full year industry production to 210,000 units, at the midpoint of our guidance, down from our prior forecast of 22,000 units as lower -- slower freight activity has contributed to weak industry orders and higher dealer inventories. We currently expect our market share to be in the range of 27% to 30% for the year, down from our prior forecast of 30% to 33%, as Daimler has reduced the number of engines that it plans to order from Cummins and Navistar's market share has declined.
In the medium-duty truck market, we delivered almost 22,000 engines in the first quarter, down 13% from last year. Our market share in the first quarter was 78%, down from 80% a year ago when we completed our final shipments to Ford. We expect full year industry production to be 123,000 units, down 1% compared to 2015, and our market share to be 75%, unchanged from our prior forecast.
Our engine shipments to North American pickup truck OEMs increased by 29% in the first quarter. Shipments to Chrysler increased 9% to more than 34,000 units, the highest first quarter volume in 10 years. Sales also increased to Nissan, following the launch of our 5-liter V8 engine in the fourth quarter last year. We currently expect our revenues in the pickup segment to increase by 12% in 2015, unchanged from our prior forecast.
Our Engine revenues from the North American construction market decreased by 9% compared to the first quarter last year. While housing and commercial construction activity remains positive, demand for new equipment from rental companies has declined due to a slowdown in business in the oil and gas market.
Power Generation revenues declined 4% in North America in the fourth -- first quarter due to lower orders from data center customers. We expect full year revenues in North America to be flat to up 2% as order rates have improved this year following the weak close to 2015.
Our international revenues declined by 8% year-over-year, with weaker sales in Latin America and Asia driving the decline. First quarter revenues in China, including joint ventures, were $767 million, a decrease of 5% due to the negative impact of the depreciation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar and weaker demand for power generation equipment.
Industry demand for heavy and medium-duty trucks in China increased by 9% in the first quarter. We continue to increase our penetration at Foton, which is now at 74%, up from 55% a year ago; and at Dongfeng, which is up more than 5% to 50%. Our overall market share was over 15% in the first quarter, down slightly from a year ago, as both Dongfeng and Foton adopted a more cautious start to the year than some of their competitors and underproduced relative to the overall industry. We still expect that our share will reach 18% for the year as our partners increase production sales more in line with the industry and our penetration continues to grow.
We currently forecast full year industry sales to decline by 4%, unchanged from our previous forecast. Industry demand for the first quarter was stronger than expected, but visibility to demand in the second half is limited, and we believe it is prudent to be cautious about market improvement.
Shipments of our light-duty engines in China grew 9% in the first quarter compared to 3% decline for the overall market as we increased penetration at Foton displacing local competitor engines. Our share of the overall market reached 7% in the first quarter, up from 6% a year ago. We currently project industry sales to decline by 4% for the year, again, unchanged from 3 months ago.
Our Power Generation revenues decreased by 27% year-over-year compared to a strong quarter a year ago. Sales weakened in the second half of 2015 as the industrial economy slowed and we haven't seen any signs of improvement yet. Industry sales of excavators in China increased by 15% in the first quarter as OE dealers pushed sales of Tier 2 inventory ahead of the transition to Tier 3 emission standards that came into force in April. Overall numbers of excavators sold though remains low. And while there is little downside risk left, there is no obvious catalyst for significant growth in the near-term.
Full year revenues in China across all segments, including joint ventures, are expected to be flat for the year, consistent with our view 3 months ago, with no major changes to any of our market assumptions.
First quarter revenues in India, including joint ventures, were $390 million, up 7% year-over-year, primarily due to recovery in the Indian truck market. Industry demand in the truck market increased 25% compared to the first quarter a year ago as the economy continues to improve. Our market share in the first quarter was 38%, down from 39% due to stronger growth in sales of vehicles below 10% -- excuse me, below 10 tons in weight where our penetration in the market is lower. We now expect industry truck production to increase 10% for the year, up from our prior forecast of 8% growth.
Power Generation revenues in India declined 1% in the first quarter, with a weaker rupee offsetting 3% growth in volumes. We currently project full year revenues, including joint ventures, to be flat to up 2%, with higher domestic volumes largely offset by the depreciation of rupee against the U.S. dollar.
First quarter revenues in Brazil were $72 million, down 42% from the first quarter last year, with the economy in recession and the real having depreciated a further 16% against the U.S. dollar. Industry truck production fell 36% year-over-year, while our engine shipments declined 35%. Revenues in all of our businesses were lower than a year ago due to the economic challenges in the region. We currently expect a full year decline of 20% in industry truck production, with slightly easier comparisons to come in the second half of the year.
Let me now make a few comments on high-horsepower markets. As I said in my opening remarks, volumes are extremely weak, with the first quarter's volumes down 20% due to lower demand in commercial marine, mining and power generation markets. New orders in the U.S. oil and gas markets are very scarce.
We expect full year shipments of high-horsepower engines to decline by 6%, helped by growth in sales of our new QSK95-liter engine and easier comparisons in the second half of the year. We were very pleased to receive EPA Tier 4 final certification for our QSK95 engine for rail applications recently, allowing us to win some important business in the high-speed passenger rail market.
In summary, we currently expect company revenues to decrease between 5% and 9% for the year, unchanged from 3 months ago. We did lower our outlook for heavy-duty truck production in North America, offset by an additional North American distributor acquisition and a less negative impact from currency in our forecast from 3 months ago. We expect EBIT to be in the range of 11.6% to 12.2% for the year, consistent with our prior forecast.
We made solid progress in executing our cost reduction plans in the first quarter and every organization throughout Cummins remains focused on driving further productivity and cost improvements. As one example, starting in April, we combined our Power Generation segment and High-Horsepower Engine business into a newly-formed segment called Power Systems. This reorganization will consolidate 2 businesses that are already strongly interdependent and will allow us to streamline business and technical processes to accelerate innovation in those markets, to grow market share and more efficiently manage our supply chain and manufacturing operations. Dave Crompton, previously leader of the Engine business, is now leading the new Power Systems segment; and Srikanth Padmanabhan as the remaining Engine business. Tracy Embree and Tony Satterthwaite will continue to lead Components and Distribution segments, respectively.
Finally, we returned $745 million to shareholders in the first quarter through dividends and the execution of our accelerated share repurchase program, consistent with our plan to return approximately 75% of our operating cash flow to shareholders in 2016.
Thank you for your interest today. Now I'll turn it over to Pat, who will cover our first quarter results and full year guidance in more detail."

First quarter revenues were $4.3 billion, a decrease of 9% from a year ago, with currency movements reducing our sales by 3%. 
Sales in North America, which represents 61% of our first quarter revenues, declined 10% from a year ago due primarily to lower demand in North American truck markets and continued weakness in industrial markets.
International sales declined by 8% as a result of lower demand in power generation and industrial markets and the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar.
Gross margins were 24.6% of sales, a decline of 80 basis points from a year ago. Lower volumes and an unfavorable product mix were partially offset by improvements in material costs and warranty expenses and the benefits from the restructuring actions.
Selling, admin and research and development expense of $656 million or 15.3% of sales increased $56 million from a year ago after taking restructuring actions in the fourth quarter of last year. This was 20 basis points higher as a percent of sales due to the lower revenues.
Joint venture income of $72 million increased by $4 million compared to a year ago. Results in the first quarter a year ago included an impairment of an investment in an off-highway joint venture, which did not repeat.
Earnings before interest and tax were $484 million or 11.3% of sales for the quarter compared to 11.9% of sales last year, and this equates to a decremental EBIT margin of 19%.
Net earnings for the quarter were $321 million or $1.87 per diluted share compared to $387 million or $2.14 per share from a year ago, and the effective tax rate for the quarter was 28.4%.
I will now highlight the performance of the individual operating segments during the first quarter. In the Engine segment, revenues were $2.3 billion, a decrease of 10% from last year. Industrial revenues declined by 13% from weak global demand for engines in marine, mining and oil and gas markets. On-highway revenues decreased 8% as production in the North American heavy-duty truck market declined compared to a year ago.
Segment EBIT was $200 million or 8.6% of sales compared to 9.7% last year. The benefits of the restructuring actions, material cost savings and lower warranty expense were more than offset by lower volumes and an unfavorable product mix, primarily from a reduction in North American heavy and medium-duty truck volumes and a 20% reduction in high-horsepower engine shipments.
For the Distribution segment, first quarter revenues were $1.5 billion, a decrease of 1% compared to the prior year. Foreign currency movements negatively impacted sales by 4%, while organic sales declined by 5%, with lower sales in North American off-highway markets more than offsetting growth in China and in Europe. Acquisitions added 8% to revenues.
EBIT margins for the quarter increased from 6% to 6.5% despite a 70 basis point unfavorable impact from foreign currency. Excluding the currency impact, margins improved by 120 basis points due to the benefits of restructuring, a stronger mix of aftermarket revenues and positive pricing.
The Components segment recorded sales of $1.2 billion, a decrease of 5% from a year ago. Sales in China increased in the first quarter by 27%, which helped partially offset the decline from lower heavy-duty truck production in North America and the negative impact of foreign currency.
Segment EBIT was $173 million or 14% of sales compared to 15% of sales a year ago as lower volumes, unfavorable pricing and currency more than offset the benefits of material cost reductions and restructuring actions.
In the Power Generation segment, first quarter sales were $550 million, down 19% from last year. International sales declined 27%, with Asia and South America experiencing the largest declines year-over-year due to the slow pace of investment in infrastructure projects.
EBIT margins were 5.6% in the quarter, down from 7.2% last year. The benefits from the restructuring actions and lower material costs partially offset the impact of the volume decline and helped keep decremental margins to 14%.
For the company, cash flow from operations was $263 million, better than same quarter last year by $90 million due to lower working capital requirements as sales declined.
As we indicated at the beginning of the year, we plan to return approximately 75% of cash generated from operations to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases this year. During the first quarter, we repurchased 4.9 million shares primarily resulting from the previously announced $500 million accelerated share repurchase program and we made dividend payments totaling $170 million, up from $140 million a year ago. Our cash and marketable securities balance declined in the quarter by $537 million primarily due to the share repurchases, the increased dividend payments of $170 million and capital expenditure of $71 million.
As Tom mentioned, our guidance for our full year performance is unchanged from 3 months ago. We are projecting total company revenues to be down 5% to 9% in 2016. Lower levels of production in the North American on-highway markets, reduced demand globally for off-highway and power generation equipment and the negative impact of currency movements will drive the majority of the reduction in revenue. We expect some offset from the introduction of new products and increased revenue from distributor acquisitions.
We expect EBIT margins of between 11.6% to 12.2% for 2016 and this compares to 12.5% for the full year 2015, excluding the restructuring and impairment charges, and represents a decremental EBIT margin of 25%. Benefits from material cost savings, restructuring and other actions will help mitigate the impact of lower volumes. Joint venture income is still expected to be flat compared to 2015.
We anticipate operating cash flow performance in 2016 will be within our long-term guidance range of 10% to 15% of sales and capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $600 million to $650 million in 2016.
As Tom just discussed, effective April, we reorganized the company into new operating segments. We will issue restated results for the first quarter of 2016 and results for 2015 and 2014 to reflect our new operating segments before we report second quarter results. We will also issue full year guidance for each of the new operating segments before we report second quarter results. And just to confirm, our current full year guidance for the company is unchanged from 3 months ago.
Now let me turn it back over to Mark."

I think that's why you've seen us take a succession of actions as opposed to just one bigger one, which, in retrospect, would have been better. But I -- we are, of course, preparing, as you can tell from these actions, for continued weakness for some time. I think that's why we decided to take further actions in the business. When we did our restructuring in the fourth quarter, we did much more out of the Power Generation segment. We've now taken some plant capacity -- significant plant capacity out now with these 3 closures, so we are anticipating that we may be weak for some period. Hopefully, it improves faster than that, but we're prepared for it now after watching it decline for quite some time.
Joel, if I could just add that the combination of our segments also, I think, gives us the opportunity now to begin to share overhead, drive improvement and efficiency in our processes between the large engine and the Power Gen business, which we think not only will help us in this tough time, but as the market springs back, we will be able to capture more share and respond more quickly. So we think it's good for the short run to reduce cost, but it also, I think, drives productivity, and launch and ramp-up processes are much better in the future."

The reason we still have work to do is, as you'd know, we just combined the segments. We just figured out -- we were just now eliminating some of the capacity and the comparison, like-for-like, will be a little complicated, given the combination of segments.

Let me take your last question first, Jamie, then I'll get to the high-horsepower inventory. So the long-term view on share -- let me just repeat what I think is going on in the market today, what we see is that we took it down as we saw our share go down [indiscernible] that -- and we had forecasted it to go down. But I think in a environment of excess capacity, we're clearly seeing more pressure to utilize internal resources and more incentives and discountings to do that. We also have seen some modest increase in Navistar this year. Again, nothing major, but we've actually seen that go down. So those 2 things were behind the immediate change that we've put in place.
Our approach, we're going to stay disciplined. We're not going to chase share with discounting. The product's performing well. And so we're going to continue to just sell that value to the customer to get that back and, at the same time, align our cost to deliver really good financials in this environment.
I think, longer-term, as we think about the share, our view is it's still a 50% big-bore, 50% medium-bore market, okay? And so that's -- and today, we compete really with the 15-liter product. And that was part of our announcement that we made in New York that we'll be bringing a medium-bore product to the market in 2017 to compete on the other end where we used to have kind of the ISM product. We're going to have a terrific product down there at that end.
So we see our share with PACCAR kind of in that 50% or 57% range now. Their market tends to be a little more big-bore than medium-bore. And so we see while the -- from a horsepower range, 13-liter products can cover a large part -- a larger part of the horsepower range, they're just the wrong -- they're the wrong product in certain being [ph] cycles. And the customer kind of draws that to more of a 50/50. And so that's what's behind our guidance kind of looking forward."

So to the contrary, we continue to make inroads with -- for exactly the reasons Rich mentioned. The engines are doing really well. They're advantaging our customers.
What happened was our truck customers basically didn't discount as much and didn't participate in the market as much in the first quarter. There was quite a bit of activity in the market and quite a bit of discounting by a couple of folks, but just more activity. They didn't participate in that same sort of thing, and so they stepped back in their truck share. We're not the least bit worried about that.
We think that, that all works itself out over the course of the year. So we feel very good about our market share projections. In fact, our penetration is ahead of where we hoped it would be. So we're feeling really good about that. So very good position, very strong. The real question really is going to be how well will the market do? The market does well, we'll see good pick up. We'll -- it's a better position we've ever been, and so that -- we'll just wait for the market to pick back up."

And so we are having much more equipment go on Chinese engines, both aftertreatment, it's the main one, but also fuel systems going into these equipment because electronic fuel systems are now pretty much required in order to meet the standard. So what we're seeing is more content on our customers' engines and our own engines in order to meet these new standards. That's really what's driving that. They do -- it's good business. It does contribute to our business. But it's not a higher mix in terms of margin or anything else. So I would say our 14% margin is good all the way around."

We have now guided for the full year in currency to be down around $200 million in sales, so 1 percentage point, and fairly neutral actually on profitability for the full year. So if you just back into the rest of the year, that would imply that the sales impact is going to be less than 1% negative as opposed to 3% in the first quarter and profitability should be a little bit better across all of the segments than what we've seen in Q1 and for most of last year.

So that's a pretty good evidence that some of the synergies and other work we've been doing is starting to pay off is -- to the question earlier.
I think with the distributor acquisition, you're right. There's just the one left in North America left to do, that's the one we'll finish this year, that's in California. So it's not that small a distributor actually. It's not the biggest, but it's decent-sized. And we'll be acquiring that in the second half of the year.

I'll start with a summary of our first quarter results and provide an update on our outlook for the full year. Pat will then take you through more details of both our first quarter financial performance and our forecast for the full year.
Revenues for the first quarter were $4.3 billion, a decrease of 9% compared to the first quarter of 2015. First quarter EBIT was $484 million or 11.3% of sales compared to $562 million or 11.9% in the same quarter last year. Our decremental EBIT margin was 19% as the benefits of restructuring actions, improved quality, lower material costs all helped mitigate the impact of lower sales.
Engine business revenues decreased by 10% year-over-year due to lower demand in North American heavy-duty truck market and weaker sales to global off-highway and power generation markets. Shipments of high-horsepower engines declined by 20% and reached the second lowest quarterly total in the past 12 years. EBIT of 8.6% of sales declined from 9.7% a year ago as strong operational performance from our manufacturing plant and benefits from restructuring, material cost reduction initiatives and improved quality were offset by the lower impact -- by the impact, excuse me, of lower volumes.
Revenues in our Components segment decreased 5% from a year ago, with lower demand in North America more than offsetting growth in China. Sales in China increased by 27%, outpacing our end markets as we continue to capitalize on tighter emissions regulations and capture increased content and market share. EBIT of $173 million or 14% of sales declined from $195 million or 15% due to the impact of lower volumes and currency.
Distribution revenues decreased by 1% compared to the first quarter of 2015. The negative impact of currency and weaker sales to off-highway markets more than offset the positive impact of acquisitions made in the second half of 2015. EBIT for the quarter of 6.5% improved from 6% a year ago, with operational improvements more than offsetting the negative impact of currency.
In the Power Generation business, revenues declined by 19% year-over-year, with weaker sales in most markets, especially Asia and Latin America. EBIT declined from 7.2% to 5.6% as the impact of lower sales more than offset a 17% reduction in operating expenses. The first quarter is typically the weakest quarter for revenues in the Power Generation business, and we do expect sales and margins to improve in subsequent quarters due to improving order intake in Europe and North America.
Over the past 3 months, we've announced plans to further rationalize our manufacturing footprint, including the closure of an alternator facility in Mexico, a generator assembly plant in India and the exit of generator set assembly operations in Kent, England. These actions will start to generate savings in the second half of 2016, with additional savings in 2017 and 2018, and should help us stay ahead of any further risk of declining volumes.
Now I will comment on some of our key markets, starting with North America. Our revenues in North America declined by 10% in the first quarter due to weaker demand in on-highway markets, especially heavy-duty truck.
Shipments to the North American heavy-duty truck market exceeded 16,000 units in the first quarter, a decrease of 33% from 2015 levels. First quarter market share was 29%. We have lowered our projection for full year industry production to 210,000 units, at the midpoint of our guidance, down from our prior forecast of 22,000 (sic) [220,000] units as lower -- slower freight activity has contributed to weak industry orders and higher dealer inventories. We currently expect our market share to be in the range of 27% to 30% for the year, down from our prior forecast of 30% to 33%, as Daimler has reduced the number of engines that it plans to order from Cummins and Navistar's market share has declined.
In the medium-duty truck market, we delivered almost 22,000 engines in the first quarter, down 13% from last year. Our market share in the first quarter was 78%, down from 80% a year ago when we completed our final shipments to Ford. We expect full year industry production to be 123,000 units, down 1% compared to 2015, and our market share to be 75%, unchanged from our prior forecast.
Our engine shipments to North American pickup truck OEMs increased by 29% in the first quarter. Shipments to Chrysler increased 9% to more than 34,000 units, the highest first quarter volume in 10 years. Sales also increased to Nissan, following the launch of our 5-liter V8 engine in the fourth quarter last year. We currently expect our revenues in the pickup segment to increase by 12% in 2015, unchanged from our prior forecast.
Our Engine revenues from the North American construction market decreased by 9% compared to the first quarter last year. While housing and commercial construction activity remains positive, demand for new equipment from rental companies has declined due to a slowdown in business in the oil and gas market.
Power Generation revenues declined 4% in North America in the fourth -- first quarter due to lower orders from data center customers. We expect full year revenues in North America to be flat to up 2% as order rates have improved this year following the weak close to 2015.
Our international revenues declined by 8% year-over-year, with weaker sales in Latin America and Asia driving the decline. First quarter revenues in China, including joint ventures, were $767 million, a decrease of 5% due to the negative impact of the depreciation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar and weaker demand for power generation equipment.
Industry demand for heavy and medium-duty trucks in China increased by 9% in the first quarter. We continue to increase our penetration at Foton, which is now at 74%, up from 55% a year ago; and at Dongfeng, which is up more than 5% to 50%. Our overall market share was over 15% in the first quarter, down slightly from a year ago, as both Dongfeng and Foton adopted a more cautious start to the year than some of their competitors and underproduced relative to the overall industry. We still expect that our share will reach 18% for the year as our partners increase production sales more in line with the industry and our penetration continues to grow.
We currently forecast full year industry sales to decline by 4%, unchanged from our previous forecast. Industry demand for the first quarter was stronger than expected, but visibility to demand in the second half is limited, and we believe it is prudent to be cautious about market improvement.
Shipments of our light-duty engines in China grew 9% in the first quarter compared to 3% decline for the overall market as we increased penetration at Foton displacing local competitor engines. Our share of the overall market reached 7% in the first quarter, up from 6% a year ago. We currently project industry sales to decline by 4% for the year, again, unchanged from 3 months ago.
Our Power Generation revenues decreased by 27% year-over-year compared to a strong quarter a year ago. Sales weakened in the second half of 2015 as the industrial economy slowed and we haven't seen any signs of improvement yet. Industry sales of excavators in China increased by 15% in the first quarter as OE dealers pushed sales of Tier 2 inventory ahead of the transition to Tier 3 emission standards that came into force in April. Overall numbers of excavators sold though remains low. And while there is little downside risk left, there is no obvious catalyst for significant growth in the near-term.
Full year revenues in China across all segments, including joint ventures, are expected to be flat for the year, consistent with our view 3 months ago, with no major changes to any of our market assumptions.
First quarter revenues in India, including joint ventures, were $390 million, up 7% year-over-year, primarily due to recovery in the Indian truck market. Industry demand in the truck market increased 25% compared to the first quarter a year ago as the economy continues to improve. Our market share in the first quarter was 38%, down from 39% due to stronger growth in sales of vehicles below 10% -- excuse me, below 10 tons in weight where our penetration in the market is lower. We now expect industry truck production to increase 10% for the year, up from our prior forecast of 8% growth.
Power Generation revenues in India declined 1% in the first quarter, with a weaker rupee offsetting 3% growth in volumes. We currently project full year revenues, including joint ventures, to be flat to up 2%, with higher domestic volumes largely offset by the depreciation of rupee against the U.S. dollar.
First quarter revenues in Brazil were $72 million, down 42% from the first quarter last year, with the economy in recession and the real having depreciated a further 16% against the U.S. dollar. Industry truck production fell 36% year-over-year, while our engine shipments declined 35%. Revenues in all of our businesses were lower than a year ago due to the economic challenges in the region. We currently expect a full year decline of 20% in industry truck production, with slightly easier comparisons to come in the second half of the year.
Let me now make a few comments on high-horsepower markets. As I said in my opening remarks, volumes are extremely weak, with the first quarter's volumes down 20% due to lower demand in commercial marine, mining and power generation markets. New orders in the U.S. oil and gas markets are very scarce.
We expect full year shipments of high-horsepower engines to decline by 6%, helped by growth in sales of our new QSK95-liter engine and easier comparisons in the second half of the year. We were very pleased to receive EPA Tier 4 final certification for our QSK95 engine for rail applications recently, allowing us to win some important business in the high-speed passenger rail market.
In summary, we currently expect company revenues to decrease between 5% and 9% for the year, unchanged from 3 months ago. We did lower our outlook for heavy-duty truck production in North America, offset by an additional North American distributor acquisition and a less negative impact from currency in our forecast from 3 months ago. We expect EBIT to be in the range of 11.6% to 12.2% for the year, consistent with our prior forecast.
We made solid progress in executing our cost reduction plans in the first quarter and every organization throughout Cummins remains focused on driving further productivity and cost improvements. As one example, starting in April, we combined our Power Generation segment and High-Horsepower Engine business into a newly-formed segment called Power Systems. This reorganization will consolidate 2 businesses that are already strongly interdependent and will allow us to streamline business and technical processes to accelerate innovation in those markets, to grow market share and more efficiently manage our supply chain and manufacturing operations. Dave Crompton, previously leader of the Engine business, is now leading the new Power Systems segment; and Srikanth Padmanabhan heads the remaining Engine business. Tracy Embree and Tony Satterthwaite will continue to lead Components and Distribution segments, respectively.
Finally, we returned $745 million to shareholders in the first quarter through dividends and the execution of our accelerated share repurchase program, consistent with our plan to return approximately 75% of our operating cash flow to shareholders in 2016.
Thank you for your interest today. Now I'll turn it over to Pat, who will cover our first quarter results and full year guidance in more detail."

First quarter revenues were $4.3 billion, a decrease of 9% from a year ago, with currency movements reducing our sales by 3%. Sales in North America, which represents 61% of our first quarter revenues, decline",1072,"Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. First quarter revenues were $4.3 billion, a decrease of 9% from a year ago, with currency movements reducing our sales by 3%. 
Sales in North America, which represents 61% of our first quarter revenues, declined 10% from a year ago due primarily to lower demand in North American truck markets and continued weakness in industrial markets.
International sales declined by 8% as a result of lower demand in power generation and industrial markets and the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar.
Gross margins were 24.6% of sales, a decline of 80 basis points from a year ago. Lower volumes and an unfavorable product mix were partially offset by improvements in material costs and warranty expenses and the benefits from the restructuring actions.
Selling, admin and research and development expense of $656 million or 15.3% of sales increased $56 million from a year ago after taking restructuring actions in the fourth quarter of last year. This was 20 basis points higher as a percent of sales due to the lower revenues.
Joint venture income of $72 million increased by $4 million compared to a year ago. Results in the first quarter a year ago included an impairment of an investment in an off-highway joint venture, which did not repeat.
Earnings before interest and tax were $484 million or 11.3% of sales for the quarter compared to 11.9% of sales last year, and this equates to a decremental EBIT margin of 19%.
Net earnings for the quarter were $321 million or $1.87 per diluted share compared to $387 million or $2.14 per share from a year ago, and the effective tax rate for the quarter was 28.4%.
I will now highlight the performance of the individual operating segments during the first quarter. In the Engine segment, revenues were $2.3 billion, a decrease of 10% from last year. Industrial revenues declined by 13% from weak global demand for engines in marine, mining and oil and gas markets. On-highway revenues decreased 8% as production in the North American heavy-duty truck market declined compared to a year ago.
Segment EBIT was $200 million or 8.6% of sales compared to 9.7% last year. The benefits of the restructuring actions, material cost savings and lower warranty expense were more than offset by lower volumes and an unfavorable product mix, primarily from a reduction in North American heavy and medium-duty truck volumes and a 20% reduction in high-horsepower engine shipments.
For the Distribution segment, first quarter revenues were $1.5 billion, a decrease of 1% compared to the prior year. Foreign currency movements negatively impacted sales by 4%, while organic sales declined by 5%, with lower sales in North American off-highway markets more than offsetting growth in China and in Europe. Acquisitions added 8% to revenues.
EBIT margins for the quarter increased from 6% to 6.5% despite a 70 basis point unfavorable impact from foreign currency. Excluding the currency impact, margins improved by 120 basis points due to the benefits of restructuring, a stronger mix of aftermarket revenues and positive pricing.
The Components segment recorded sales of $1.2 billion, a decrease of 5% from a year ago. Sales in China increased in the first quarter by 27%, which helped partially offset the decline from lower heavy-duty truck production in North America and the negative impact of foreign currency.
Segment EBIT was $173 million or 14% of sales compared to 15% of sales a year ago as lower volumes, unfavorable pricing and currency more than offset the benefits of material cost reductions and restructuring actions.
In the Power Generation segment, first quarter sales were $550 million, down 19% from last year. International sales declined 27%, with Asia and South America experiencing the largest declines year-over-year due to the slow pace of investment in infrastructure projects.
EBIT margins were 5.6% in the quarter, down from 7.2% last year. The benefits from the restructuring actions and lower material costs partially offset the impact of the volume decline and helped keep decremental margins to 14%.
For the company, cash flow from operations was $263 million, better than same quarter last year by $90 million due to lower working capital requirements as sales declined.
As we indicated at the beginning of the year, we plan to return approximately 75% of cash generated from operations to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases this year. During the first quarter, we repurchased 4.9 million shares primarily resulting from the previously announced $500 million accelerated share repurchase program and we made dividend payments totaling $170 million, up from $140 million a year ago. Our cash and marketable securities balance declined in the quarter by $537 million primarily due to the share repurchases, the increased dividend payments of $170 million and capital expenditure of $71 million.
As Tom mentioned, our guidance for our full year performance is unchanged from 3 months ago. We are projecting total company revenues to be down 5% to 9% in 2016. Lower levels of production in the North American on-highway markets, reduced demand globally for off-highway and power generation equipment and the negative impact of currency movements will drive the majority of the reduction in revenue. We expect some offset from the introduction of new products and increased revenue from distributor acquisitions.
We expect EBIT margins of between 11.6% to 12.2% for 2016 and this compares to 12.5% for the full year 2015, excluding the restructuring and impairment charges, and represents a decremental EBIT margin of 25%. Benefits from material cost savings, restructuring and other actions will help mitigate the impact of lower volumes. Joint venture income is still expected to be flat compared to 2015.
We anticipate operating cash flow performance in 2016 will be within our long-term guidance range of 10% to 15% of sales and capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $600 million to $650 million in 2016.
As Tom just discussed, effective April, we reorganized the company into new operating segments. We will issue restated results for the first quarter of 2016 and results for 2015 and 2014 to reflect our new operating segments before we report second quarter results. We will also issue full year guidance for each of the new operating segments before we report second quarter results. And just to confirm, our current full year guidance for the company is unchanged from 3 months ago.
Now let me turn it back over to Mark."

I think that's why you've seen us take a succession of actions as opposed to just one bigger one, which, in retrospect, would have been better. But I -- we are, of course, preparing, as you can tell from these actions, for continued weakness for some time. I think that's why we decided to take further actions in the business. When we did our restructuring in the fourth quarter, we did much more out of the Power Generation segment. We've now taken some plant capacity -- significant plant capacity out now with these 3 closures, so we are anticipating that we may be weak for some period. Hopefully, it improves faster than that, but we're prepared for it now after watching it decline for quite some time.
Joel, if I could just add that the combination of our segments also, I think, gives us the opportunity now to begin to share overhead, drive improvement and efficiency in our processes between the large engine and the Power Gen business, which we think not only will help us in this tough time, but as the market springs back, we will be able to capture more share and respond more quickly. So we think it's good for the short run to reduce cost, but it also, I think, drives productivity, and launch and ramp-up processes are much better in the future."

We just figured out -- we were just now eliminating some of the capacity and the comparison, like-for-like, will be a little complicated, given the combination of segments.

So that's what we're putting into, where we've taken the guidance down to 200,000 to 220,000 from the 220,000 range before. It's potentially some back-end, but most of the reductions happened.

So we talked about getting $100 million in synergies, kind of maybe $40 million to $50 million of it in cost and the rest in sales. We're just really getting started. We're probably a quarter away through that on the cost side and more to come over the next couple of years."

Let me take your last question first, Jamie, then I'll get to the high-horsepower inventory. So the long-term view on share -- let me just repeat what I think is going on in the market today, what we see is that we took it down as we saw our share go down [indiscernible] that -- and we had forecasted it to go down. But I think in an environment of excess capacity, we're clearly seeing more pressure to utilize internal resources and more incentives and discountings to do that. We also have seen some modest increase in Navistar this year. Again, nothing major, but we've actually seen that go down. So those 2 things were behind the immediate change that we've put in place.
Our approach, we're going to stay disciplined. We're not going to chase share with discounting. The product's performing well. And so we're going to continue to just sell that value to the customer to get that back and, at the same time, align our costs to deliver really good financials in this environment.
I think, longer-term, as we think about the share, our view is it's still a 50% big-bore, 50% medium-bore market, okay? And so that's -- and today, we compete really with the 15-liter product. And that was part of our announcement that we made in New York that we'll be bringing a medium-bore product to the market in 2017 to compete on the other end where we used to have kind of the ISM product. We're going to have a terrific product down there at that end.
So we see our share with PACCAR kind of in that 50% or 57% range now. Their market tends to be a little more big-bore than medium-bore. And so we see while the -- from a horsepower range, 13-liter products can cover a large part -- a larger part of the horsepower range, they're just the wrong -- they're the wrong product in certain duty cycles. And the customer kind of draws that to more of a 50/50. And so that's what's behind our guidance kind of looking forward."

In the oil and gas market, it's an issue.

And I just think we're in more of a normal replacement cycle right now, which is in kind of the 220,000 to 240,000 range is where we are.

So I think what you'll see -- or what we're projecting anyway -- and again, not that we have in -- great insight, it just happened in past cycles is production rates come down a bit the second half of the year to build up a little bit of backlog.

So I think that's the place where maybe, if things are improving as some people suggest, we could have some upside in JV income there. But right now, our view is we're just -- we think we're pretty -- we're going to stay where we are from the point of view of forecasting.
And on the off-highway side, maybe it's the opposite. It's not that things are great now, but I just feel like it's weak markets all over the place. And so maybe there's a little bit of downside still on off-highway.

I'm very optimistic that we're looking in the right places and thinking about the right things, and that whatever we do, if we -- when we do something, it will be beneficial to our shareholders and beneficial to the company long run, that part I'm sure. I'm sorry that I can't provide you more details, and it's just because anything I'd say would just not help us in anyway and help our shareholders. But I would just tell you that nothing has changed about our process. We are still very active and I still feel good about what we're looking at."

We have now guided for the full year in currency to be down around $200 million in sales, so 1 percentage point, and fairly neutral actually on profitability for the full year. So if you just back into the rest of the year, that would imply that the sales impact is going to be less than 1% negative as opposed to 3% in the first quarter and profitability should be a little bit better across all of the segments than what we've seen in Q1 and for most of last year.

So that's a pretty good evidence that some of the synergies and other work we've been doing is starting to pay off is -- to the question earlier.
I think with the distributor acquisition, you're right. There's just the one left in North America left to do, that's the one we'll finish this year, that's in California. So it's not that small a distributor actually. It's not the biggest, but it's decent-sized. And we'll be acquiring that in the second half of the year.

The other thing that I was just going to mention indirectly to your question, and it relates a little bit to Components in the heavy-duty space, our strategy is to -- we sell engines to people who are vertically-integrated. And so -- and we sell engines. But where we don't sell engines, we sell components. So some of the movement between engines and components, the Components business continues to benefit from that.

I'll start out with a summary of our second quarter results and provide an update on our outlook for the full year. Pat will then take you through more details of both our second quarter financial performance and our forecast for the year. 
Revenues for the second quarter were $4.5 billion, a decrease of 10% compared to the second quarter of 2015. Second quarter EBIT was $591 million or 13.1% of sales compared to $721 million or 14.4% in the same quarter last year. 
We made strong progress in our cost-reduction initiatives in the second quarter as benefits from restructuring actions, material cost-reduction initiatives and improvements in product quality helped to mitigate the impact of weak demand in a number of important markets. 
Our decremental EBIT margin was 27% for the second quarter and 23% for the first half of 2016 compared to our full year guidance of 25%. Engine business revenues decreased by 14% year-over-year, primarily due to lower demand in heavy and medium-duty truck market in North America. EBIT of 10.3% of sales declined from 12% a year ago as a strong operational performance and benefits from restructuring, material cost-reduction initiatives and a 90 basis point improvement in warranty costs were offset by the impacts of lower volumes. 
Second quarter results include a $39 million increase in our provision for a product campaign that we initially recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015. As we previously discussed, this provision is for a quality issue related to third-party aftertreatment system that's impacting the performance of some of our engines in vehicles produced by one of our OEM customers. The increase in our provision reflects a more conservative approach to protecting vehicle owners with a higher proportion of vehicles now planned to have full replacement of aftertreatment system hardware than we had originally anticipated, resulting in higher estimated cost for the campaign. Discussions over how the cost of this campaign should be shared with our OEM customer are ongoing. 
Revenues in our Components segment decreased 8% from a year ago, with lower demand in North America more than offsetting growth in China. Sales in China increased by 17% due to a stronger demand in the truck market. EBIT of $190 million or 14.9% of sales declined from $223 million or 16% as the impact of lower volumes offset the benefit of material and other cost reductions. 
Earlier today, we announced the closure of a filtration manufacturing facility in Turkey as we continue to implement plans to improve our cost structure. Distribution revenues increased 3% compared to the second quarter of 2015. The positive impact of acquisitions made in the second half of 2015 more than offset the negative impact of currency and weaker sales to off-highway markets. EBIT for the quarter of 5.6% declined from 7.6% a year ago, due mainly to the negative impact of currency and weaker organic sales. 
Last quarter, we announced our plans to acquire the last remaining distributor joint venture in North America, and we currently expect to complete the acquisition in the fourth quarter of this year. 
Revenues for the Power Systems business declined by 16% year-over-year with lower sales in most regions due to weaker demand in the Power Generation, commercial marine and oil and gas markets. EBIT declined from 11.6% to 9.8% a year ago as the impact of lower sales more than offset an 18% reduction in operating expenses. EBIT did improve from 5.7% in the first quarter due to good operating leverage on incremental sales and strong cost control. We continued to make progress with our plans to close 3 Power Systems manufacturing operations in India, Mexico and the U.K. Our actions in India and Mexico will be completed in the second half of 2016. In the U.K., we are on track to commence assembly of high-horsepower generator sets at our Daventry engine plant in the fourth quarter of this year, a key milestone in the first phase of our closure plan for our assembly operations in Kent. There would be both expenses and savings in the second half of 2016 associated with these actions that will improve our cost structure when complete. 
Now I will comment on some of our key markets starting with North America. Our revenues in North America declined by 13% in the second quarter due to weaker demand in on-highway markets, especially heavy-duty trucks. We shipped 16,000 engines to the North American heavy-duty truck market in the second quarter, a decrease of 43% from a year ago. We have lowered our projection for full year industry production to 200,000 units at the midpoint of our guidance, down from our prior forecast of 210,000 units as weak industry orders and high dealer inventories are likely to cause OEMs to lower their build rates in the second half of the year. Our market share through the end of June was 28.9%, and we expect our full year market share to be in the range of 27% to 30% for the year, unchanged from our projections 3 months ago. 
In the medium-duty truck market, we delivered almost 21,000 engines in the second quarter, down 20% from last year as our customers produced at a lower rate compared to the overall industry. Our market share through the end of May was almost 75%, slightly ahead of our full year forecast of 74%, which is unchanged from last quarter. We have lowered our forecast for full year industry production to 117,000 units, down 6% compared to both 2015 and our prior guidance for 2016 as the growth in new orders has leveled off in recent months and OEMs are trimming build rates. 
Our engine shipments to North American pickup truck customers increased by 18% in the second quarter. Shipments to Chrysler increased 4% to more than 33,000 units. Sales also increased in Nissan, following the launch of our 5-liter V8 engine in the fourth quarter last year. We currently expect our revenues in the pickup segment to increase by 12% in 2016, again unchanged from our prior forecast. 
Our engine revenues from the North American construction market decreased by 30% compared to the second quarter last year. While housing and commercial construction activity remains positive, demand from rental companies for new equipment has declined due to weakness in the oil and gas market. 
Power Systems revenues declined 9% in North America in the second quarter due primarily to lower engine orders from oil and gas customers, which more than offset 4% growth in Power Generation. Our international revenues declined by 4% year-over-year, with weaker sales in Latin America and the Middle East. Second quarter revenues in China, including joint ventures, were $940 million, an increase of 3% with growth in on-highway revenues, partially offset by the depreciation of the renminbi against the U.S. dollar and weaker demand for Power Generation equipment and industrial engines. 
Industry demand for heavy and medium-duty trucks in China increased by 21% in the second quarter. Our market share in the second quarter was just under 15%, level with last year. Although demand from Foton for our heavy-duty ISG engine increased year-over-year, growth in shipments to our other primary partner, Dongfeng, did not keep pace with the market. One truck OEM, in particular, is being very aggressive on pricing this year and has increased its share at the expense of several OEMs, including Dongfeng. We now expect forecast full year industry sales to grow by 9% for the year, up from our prior forecast of a decline of 4% as industry sales were well ahead of our expectations in the first half of the year. 
Visibility to demand in the second half is limited, and we remain cautious until we see broader improvement in gross margin indicators. Shipments of our light-duty engines in China grew 14% in the second quarter compared to a 6% decline for the overall market as we increased penetration at Foton, displacing local competitor engines. Our share of the overall market was almost 7%, up more than 100 basis points year-over-year. We currently project industry sales to decline by 4% for the year, unchanged from 3 months ago. 
Industry sales of excavators in China decreased by 11% in the second quarter as sales moderated from inflated first quarter levels following the transition to Tier 3 emission standards that came into force in April. The overall numbers of excavators sold remain very low with no obvious catalyst for significant growth in this near term. 
Revenues for our Power Systems business in China declined by 25% in the second quarter, reflecting weak demand in mining, marine and Power Generation markets. Full year revenues in China across all segments, including joint ventures, are expected to grow 3% for the year, up from our prior forecast of flat due to stronger demand in the heavy and medium-duty truck market. 
Second quarter revenues in India, including joint ventures, were $423 million, up 9% year-over-year, primarily due to the strong demand in the truck market, which more than offset the impact of a weaker rupee. Industry demand in the truck market increased 22% as the economy continue to improve. Our market share in the second quarter was 44%, up from 42% a year ago, and our penetration with Tata increased to 78% from 73% a year ago. We now expect industry truck production to increase 15% for the full year, up from our prior forecast of 10% growth. 
Power Systems revenues in India declined by 6% in the second quarter with a week rupee offsetting volume growth. We currently project full year revenues across all segments, and including joint ventures, to increase 5% in India, up from our prior forecast of 1% -- up 1% due to stronger truck demand. 
Second quarter revenues in Brazil were $80 million, down 27% from the second quarter last year as the economy remains in recession, and the real depreciated 14% against the U.S. dollar. Industry truck production fell 12% year-over-year while our engine shipments declined 30%. Industry production for heavy commercial vehicles greater than 15 tons increased in the quarter while medium and light vehicles, in which we have a higher market share, declined significantly. We project full year industry truck production to decline by 20%, unchanged from 3 months ago. 
Revenues for our Power Systems business in Brazil declined by 45% due to the continuing economic challenges in the region. Our sales in the Middle East also declined by more than 30% in the second quarter, primarily impacting our Power Systems business and reflecting a slowdown in infrastructure investments in the region. Clearly, we are facing challenging market conditions. However, in the face of a 43% decline in shipments to North American heavy-duty truck market and very weak conditions in most of our end markets, strong operational performance and execution of our cost-reduction initiatives enable us to deliver EBIT above 13% of sales in second quarter. 
Looking forward, we now expect company revenues to decrease between 8% and 10% for the year, lower than our prior guidance of 5% to 9% due to a lower outlook for truck production in North America and weaker demand in Power Generation and off-highway markets. Revenues in the third and fourth quarter of this year are projected to be lower than second quarter levels, and we continue to identify opportunities to further improve our productivity and lower our cost structure. 
We expect EBIT to be in the range of 11.6% to 12.2% for the year, unchanged from our prior forecast, reflecting full year decremental EBIT margin of 25%. In the first half of this year, we returned more than $1 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, and our Board of Directors recently increased quarterly dividend by more than 5%, all consistent with our plans to return 75% of operating cash to shareholders. 
Thank you for your interest today. And now I'll turn it over to Pat, who will cover our second quarter results and full year guidance in more detail."

I would like to make clear to everyone that the results and the very good share reflect the recently reorganized business segments.

I would like to make clear to everyone that the results and the very good share reflect the recently reorganized business segments. A copy of the restated segment financial results for prior periods referred to in my comments can be found in our 8-K filed with the SEC and on our website. 
For the second quarter, revenues were $4.5 billion, a decrease of 10% from a year ago. Sales in North America, which represented 58% of our second quarter revenues, declined 13% from last year due primarily to lower demand in North American on-highway truck markets and continued weakness in industrial markets. 
International sales declined by 4% from a year ago due to weak demand for industrial engines and Power Generation equipment. While revenues grew in India and in China, this was more than offset by weaker demand in Latin America and in the Middle East. 
Gross margins were 26.4% of sales, a decline of 20 basis points from last year. The negative impact of lower volumes and unfavorable product mix were offset by material cost savings, benefits from restructuring actions and more warranty expense. 
Selling, admin and research and development expenses of $679 million or 15% of sales decreased by $24 million from a year ago. The increase as a percent of sales by 100 basis points as sales declined. Joint venture income of $88 million decreased by $6 million compared to last year, primarily due to the acquisition of North American distributors previously held as unconsolidated joint ventures. Other income and expenses, including interest income netted to an expense of $15 [ph] million in the quarter, including an increase in the provision for a quality issue related to a third-party aftertreatment system that Tom referred to earlier. 
Earnings before interest and tax were $591 million or 13.1% of sales for the quarter, which equates to a 27% decremental margin when compared to a record $721 million or 14.4% of sales that we reported last year. For the first 6 months of the year, decremental EBIT margins of 23% [ph] slightly better than our target of 25%. 
Net earnings for the quarter were $406 million or $2.40 per diluted share compared with $2.62 from a year ago. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 25.7%, lower than a year ago due to the change in geographic mix of earnings. 
I will now highlight the performance of the individual operating segments during the second quarter. In the engine segment, revenues were $2 billion, a decrease of 14% from last year. On-highway revenues declined by 15% due to reduction in heavy and medium-duty truck industry production in North America, partially offset by stronger sales to bus and pickup truck customers. Off-highway revenues declined by 9%, primarily due to a decline in the construction and marine markets. 
Segment EBIT was $206 million or 10.3% of sales compared to 12% last year. Material cost savings for warranty expense and the benefits from previous restructuring actions offset the negative impact of lower volumes and an unfavorable product mix. Included in the results for the second quarter in the engine segment was a $39 million charge to increase our estimate for the loss contingency recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015. Excluding this additional provision, segment EBIT would have improved over last year despite the 14% drop in sales. 
For the full year 2016, we expect engine segment revenues to decline by 9% to 12%, primarily due to weaker truck demand in the truck market in North America. 2016 EBIT margins are expected to be in the range of 10% to 11% compared to 9.9% for the full year 2015, excluding restructuring and impairment charges. We expect that year-over-year improvement in EBIT percent is primarily due to the lower warranty cost, benefits from the restructuring actions and the fuel cost-reduction initiatives. 
For the distribution segment, second quarter revenues were $1.5 billion, which increased 3% compared to last year. Prior year acquisitions contributed 8% to the sales growth, partially offset by a 3% decline in organic sales and a 2% negative impact from currency. Engine and segment -- and service revenues declined in the quarter as demand from new engines and rebuilds remains weak in off-highway markets, especially in oil and gas and marine markets. 
EBIT margins for the quarter decreased from 7.6% to 5.6% due primarily to the unfavorable impact of currency and lower organic sales. On our prior earnings call, we showed our plans to acquire the last remaining unconsolidated North American distributor. We currently expect to complete the acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
We are updating our full year revenue guidance now to be between down 1% and up 1%, incorporating the new acquisitions and reflecting continued weakness in off-highway markets, especially in North America and weaker Power Generation sales in the Middle East. We expect full year EBIT margins to be in a range of 5.5% to 6.5% of sales. 
The Components segment recorded revenues of $1.3 billion, which declined 8% from a year ago. A 17% increase in revenue from China, along with increased revenue from Europe, helped to partially offset a 17% sales decline in North America. Segment EBIT was $190 million or 14.9% of sales compared to 16% of sales a year ago. Strong operating performance, material cost reductions and the benefits from restructuring actions helped to partially offset the impact from weaker sales in North America, lower pricing and the negative impact of currency. 
We currently expect full year revenue in 2016 to decline by 6% to 9%. EBIT guidance for the full year is unchanged from before and is expected to be in a range of 12.75% to 13.75% of sales. 
In the Power Systems segment, second quarter revenues were $921 million, down 16% from last year. Sales declined 20% in international markets, primarily due to lower demand for Power Generation equipment in Asia, in the Middle East and in Latin America. Sales in North America declined 9% compared to the same quarter last year, primarily due to the lower oil and gas demand. EBIT margins were 9.8% of sales in the quarter, down from 11.6% last year, primarily due to the much lower demand across most of our markets. 
We currently expect full year revenues for the Power Systems segment to decline between 12% and 14% with EBIT in a range of 7% to 8% of sales. Forecasted year-over-year volume declines, the negative impacts from our competitive pricing environment in international markets and additional expenses related to new cost-reduction actions in 2016 will more than offset the benefits of restructuring and material cost reductions. We'll now project the total company revenues to be down between 8% and 10% in 2016, which is lower than our prior guidance of down 5% to 9% due to a weaker outlook in North America and a softer demand in Power Generation markets. Declining production in the North American truck markets and weak demand globally for off-highway and Power Generation equipment will drive the majority of reduction in revenue for the full year. 
We expect EBIT margins of between 11.6% to 12.2% of sales, unchanged from our prior guidance. Cost-reduction initiatives across the company will mitigate the impact of weaker revenues. Joint venture income is still expected to be flat compared to 2015, and we now expect our effective tax rate to be 27% for the year. 
Turning to cash flow. Cash generated from operating activities was $471 million in the second quarter, better than the same quarter last year by $75 million, primarily due to the lower working capital. For the first 6 months of the year, cash from operations is $734 million compared to $569 million at the same point last year. We anticipate operating cash flow performance in 2016 will be within our long-term guidance range of 10% to 15% of sales. 
Capital expenditures were $189 million for the first 6 months of the year and are expected to be in the range of $600 million to $650 million for the full year. And year-to-date, we returned more than $1 billion to shareholders, which includes the repurchase of 6.7 million shares. And as Tom said, recently, our Board of Directors authorized an increase in our quarterly dividend of 5% to $1.025 per share, consistent with our plans to return 75% of full year operating cash flow to shareholders in this year. 
Now let me turn it back over to Mark."

As we discussed before, our view of Power Generation Business continues to be bullish long term, but what we've noticed is 3 things. First, that we set our overall view about growth in emerging markets to be moderated those over prior views. I think that's not -- that is why everyone probably done that. And then secondly, the time it's going to take to recover looks like it's going to be longer, and that's year-by-year, we've been pushing that out, unfortunately, which is one of the reasons we're in a bit of a catch-up mode in Power Generation, but we -- as we said, we need to act now because the recovery of the markets doesn't seem imminent. And I think the third thing that we talked about before is that one of the things that our company feels strongly about is when we have downturns, we want to use those as opportunities to improve the efficiency and productivity of our operations. So we think by combining our generator set assembly, for example, with our high-horsepower engine that we'll be able to restore the same capacity if not more, but reduce costs and reduce inefficiencies related to the supply chain. So we're going to put the entire capacity of that assembly line in the Daventry plant. We're going to save shipping, we're going to take test time, we're going to save logistics coming into the plant. So there's a whole bunch of opportunities, and we just couldn't make those changes when the market was strong because you can't reduce capacity for long enough to actually consolidate plant. So again, this is not the only one like that, but many of the operations changes that we are taking now are opportunities that we can take advantage of because markets are slower. So we can manage the inventory and things and the demand much better. And then our hope is as markets improved, we're then able to supply even greater capacity but at much lower cost and better efficiency. That's what we're aiming for through this effort."

So while I know you don't want to talk about guidance or end market, can you talk about the things in '17 that you can control to hold the profitability, whether it's incremental restructuring benefits we'll get in '17, whether the North American distributor acquisition or just your view on share repurchase."

We're looking at 1.4%, 1.5% for the full year, and we're taking warranty there. And warranty I believe for the first half of this year as a percent of sales might be the lowest in the last decade. So we're making some good progress there. So that's going to continue, I think, regardless of what's happening to the markets next year. Clearly, we'd like to seem some recovery, and most markets have been weaker for a while now but if they don't recover, we'll continue to pursue cost improvement in those areas in particular, material costs and warranty even more still just over 2% of sales, we can do the math and figure out that's $350 million.

I'll start out with a summary of our second quarter results and provide an update on our outlook for the full year. Pat will then take you through more details of both our second quarter financial performance and our forecast for the year. 
Revenues for the second quarter were $4.5 billion, a decrease of 10% compared to the second quarter of 2015. Second quarter EBIT was $591 million or 13.1% of sales compared to $721 million or 14.4% in the same quarter last year. 
We made strong progress in our cost-reduction initiatives in the second quarter as benefits from restructuring actions, material cost-reduction initiatives and improvements in product quality helped to mitigate the impact of weak demand in a number of important markets. 
Our decremental EBIT margin was 27% for the second quarter and 23% for the first half of 2016 compared to our full year guidance of 25%. Engine business revenues decreased by 14% year-over-year, primarily due to lower demand in heavy and medium-duty truck market in North America. EBIT of 10.3% of sales declined from 12% a year ago as strong operational performance and benefits from restructuring, material cost-reduction initiatives and a 90 basis point improvement in warranty costs were offset by the impacts of lower volumes. 
Second quarter results include a $39 million increase in our provision for a product campaign that we initially recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015. As we previously discussed, this provision is for a quality issue related to a third-party aftertreatment system that's impacting the performance of some of our engines in vehicles produced by one of our OEM customers. The increase in our provision reflects a more conservative approach to protecting vehicle owners with a higher proportion of vehicles now planned to have full replacement of aftertreatment system hardware than we had originally anticipated, resulting in higher estimated cost for the campaign. Discussions over how the cost of this campaign should be shared with our OEM customer are ongoing. 
Revenues in our Components segment decreased 8% from a year ago, with lower demand in North America more than offsetting growth in China. Sales in China increased by 17% due to a stronger demand in the truck market. EBIT of $190 million or 14.9% of sales declined from $223 million or 16% as the impact of lower volumes offset the benefit of material and other cost reductions. 
Earlier today, we announced the closure of a filtration manufacturing facility in Turkey as we continue to implement plans to improve our cost structure. Distribution revenues increased 3% compared to the second quarter of 2015. The positive impact of acquisitions made in the second half of 2015 more than offset the negative impact of currency and weaker sales to off-highway markets. EBIT for the quarter of 5.6% declined from 7.6% a year ago, due mainly to the negative impact of currency and weaker organic sales. 
Last quarter, we announced our plans to acquire the last remaining distributor joint venture in North America, and we currently expect to complete the acquisition in the fourth quarter of this year. 
Revenues for the Power Systems business declined by 16% year-over-year with lower sales in most regions due to weaker demand in power generation, commercial marine and oil and gas markets. EBIT declined from 11.6% to 9.8% a year ago as the impact of lower sales more than offset an 18% reduction in operating expenses. EBIT did improve from 5.7% in the first quarter due to good operating leverage on incremental sales and strong cost control. We continued to make progress with our plans to close 3 Power Systems manufacturing operations in India, Mexico and the U.K. Our actions in India and Mexico will be completed in the second half of 2016. In the U.K., we are on track to commence assembly of high-horsepower generator sets at our Daventry engine plant in the fourth quarter of this year, a key milestone in the first phase of our closure plan for our assembly operations in Kent. There will be both expenses and savings in the second half of 2016 associated with these actions that will improve our cost structure when it completes. 
Now I will comment on some of our key markets starting with North America. Our revenues in North America declined by 13% in the second quarter due to weaker demand in on-highway markets, especially heavy-duty truck. We shipped 16,000 engines to the North American heavy-duty truck market in the second quarter, a decrease of 43% from a year ago. We have lowered our projection for full year industry production to 200,000 units at the midpoint of our guidance, down from our prior forecast of 210,000 units as weak industry orders and high dealer inventories are likely to cause OEMs to lower their build rates in the second half of the year. Our market share through the end of June was 28.9%, and we expect our full year market share to be in the range of 27% to 30% for the year, unchanged from our projections 3 months ago. 
In the medium-duty truck market, we delivered almost 21,000 engines in the second quarter, down 20% from last year as our customers produced at a lower rate compared to the overall industry. Our market share through the end of May was almost 75%, slightly ahead of our full year forecast of 74%, which is unchanged from last quarter. We have lowered our forecast for full year industry production to 117,000 units, down 6% compared to both 2015 and our prior guidance for 2016 as the growth in new orders has leveled off in recent months and OEMs are trimming build rates. 
Our engine shipments to North American pickup truck customers increased by 18% in the second quarter. Shipments to Chrysler increased 4% to more than 33,000 units. Sales also increased in Nissan, following the launch of our 5-liter V8 engine in the fourth quarter last year. We currently expect our revenues in the pickup segment to increase by 12% in 2016, again, unchanged from our prior forecast. 
Our engine revenues from the North American construction market decreased by 30% compared to the second quarter last year. While housing and commercial construction activity remains positive, demand from rental companies for new equipment has declined due to weakness in the oil and gas market. 
Power Systems revenues declined 9% in North America in the second quarter due primarily to lower engine orders from oil and gas customers, which more than offset 4% growth in Power Generation. Our international revenues declined by 4% year-over-year, with weaker sales in Latin America and the Middle East. Second quarter revenues in China, including joint ventures, were $940 million, an increase of 3% with growth in on-highway revenues, partially offset by the depreciation of the renminbi against the U.S. dollar and weaker demand for Power Generation equipment and industrial engines. 
Industry demand for heavy and medium-duty trucks in China increased by 21% in the second quarter. Our market share in the second quarter was just under 15%, level with last year. Although demand from Foton for our heavy-duty ISG engine increased year-over-year, growth in shipments to our other primary partner, Dongfeng, did not keep pace with the market. One truck OEM, in particular, is being very aggressive on pricing this year and has increased its share at the expense of several OEMs, including Dongfeng. We now forecast full year industry sales to grow by 9% for the year, up from our prior forecast of a decline of 4% as industry sales were well ahead of our expectations in the first half of the year. 
Visibility to demand in the second half is limited, and we remain cautious until we see broader improvement in macroeconomic indicators. Shipments of our light-duty engines in China grew 14% in the second quarter compared to a 6% decline for the overall market as we increased penetration at Foton, displacing local competitor engines. Our share of the overall market was almost 7%, up more than 100 basis points year-over-year. We currently project industry sales to decline by 4% for the year, unchanged from 3 months ago. 
Industry sales of excavators in China decreased by 11% in the second quarter as sales moderated from inflated first quarter levels following the transition to Tier 3 emission standards that came into force in April. The overall numbers of excavators sold remains very low with no obvious catalyst for significant growth in this near term. 
Revenues for our Power Systems business in China declined by 25% in the second quarter, reflecting weak demand in mining, marine and power generation markets. Full year revenues in China across all segments, including joint ventures, are expected to grow 3% for the year, up from our prior forecast of flat due to stronger demand in the heavy and medium-duty truck market. 
Second quarter revenues in India, including joint ventures, were $423 million, up 9% year-over-year, primarily due to strong demand in the truck market, which more than offset the impact of a weaker rupee. Industry demand in the truck market increased 22% as the economy continued to improve. Our market share in the second quarter was 44%, up from 42% a year ago, and our penetration with Tata increased to 78% from 73% a year ago. We now expect industry truck production to increase 15% for the full year, up from our prior forecast of 10% growth. 
Power Systems revenues in India declined by 6% in the second quarter with a weak rupee offsetting volume growth. We currently project full year revenues across all segments, and including joint ventures, to increase 5% in India, up from our prior forecast of 1% -- up 1% due to a stronger truck demand. 
Second quarter revenues in Brazil were $80 million, down 27% from the second quarter last year as the economy remains in recession, and the real depreciated 14% against the U.S. dollar. Industry truck production fell 12% year-over-year, while our engine shipments declined 30%. Industry production for heavy commercial vehicles greater than 15 tons increased in the quarter, while medium and light vehicles, in which we have a higher market share, declined significantly. We project full year industry truck production to decline by 20%, unchanged from 3 months ago. 
Revenues for our Power Systems business in Brazil declined by 45% due to the continuing economic challenges in the region. Our sales in the Middle East also declined by more than 30% in the second quarter, primarily impacting our Power Systems business and reflecting a slowdown in infrastructure investments in the region. 
Clearly, we are facing challenging market conditions. However, in the face of a 43% decline in shipments to North American heavy-duty truck market and very weak conditions in most of our end markets, strong operational performance and execution of our cost-reduction initiatives enabled us to deliver EBIT above 13% of sales in the second quarter. 
Looking forward, we now expect company revenues to decrease between 8% and 10% for the year, lower than our prior guidance of 5% to 9% due to a lower outlook for truck production in North America and weaker demand in Power Generation and off-highway markets. Revenues in the third and fourth quarters of this year are projected to be lower than second quarter levels, and we continue to identify opportunities to further improve our productivity and lower our cost structure. 
We expect EBIT to be in the range of 11.6% to 12.2% for the year, unchanged from our prior forecast, reflecting full year decremental EBIT margin of 25%. In the first half of this year, we returned more than $1 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, and our Board of Directors recently increased quarterly dividend by more than 5%, all consistent with our plans to return 75% of operating cash to shareholders. 
Thank you for your interest today. And now, I'll turn it over to Pat, who will cover our second quarter results and full year guidance in more detail."

I would like to make clear to everyone that the results and the very good share reflect the recently reorganized business segments. A copy of the restated segment financial results for prior periods referred to in my comments can be found in our 8-K filed with the SEC and on our website. 
For the second quarter, revenues were $4.5 billion, a decrease of 10% from a year ago. Sales in North America, which represented 58% of our second quarter revenues, declined 13% from last year due primarily to lower demand in North American on-highway truck markets and continued weakness in industrial markets. 
International sales declined by 4% from a year ago due to weak demand for industrial engines and Power Generation equipment. While revenues grew in India and in China, this was more than offset by weaker demand in Latin America and in the Middle East. 
Gross margins were 26.4% of sales, a decline of 20 basis points from last year. The negative impact of lower volumes and unfavorable product mix were offset by material cost savings, benefits from restructuring actions and more warranty expense. 
Selling, admin and research and development expenses of $679 million or 15% of sales decreased by $24 million from a year ago, but increased as a percent of sales by 100 basis points as sales declined. Joint venture income of $88 million decreased by $6 million compared to last year, primarily due to the acquisition of North American distributors previously held as unconsolidated joint ventures. Other income and expenses, including interest income netted to an expense of $16 million in the quarter, including an increase in the provision for a quality issue related to a third-party aftertreatment system that Tom referred to earlier. 
Earnings before interest and tax were $591 million or 13.1% of sales for the quarter, which equates to a 27% decremental margin when compared to a record $721 million or 14.4% of sales that we reported last year. For the first 6 months of the year, decremental EBIT margins are 23%, slightly better than our target of 25%. 
Net earnings for the quarter were $406 million or $2.40 per diluted share compared with $2.62 from a year ago. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 25.7%, lower than a year ago due to the change in geographic mix of earnings. 
I will now highlight the performance of the individual operating segments during the second quarter. In the Engine segment, revenues were $2 billion, a decrease of 14% from last year. On-highway revenues declined by 15% due to reduction in heavy and medium-duty truck industry production in North America, partially offset by stronger sales to bus and pickup truck customers. Off-highway revenues declined by 9%, primarily due to a decline in the construction and marine markets. 
Segment EBIT was $206 million or 10.3% of sales compared to 12% last year. Material cost savings for warranty expense and the benefits from previous restructuring actions offset the negative impact of lower volumes and an unfavorable product mix. Included in the results for the second quarter in the Engine segment was a $39 million charge to increase our estimate for the loss contingency recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015. Excluding this additional provision, segment EBIT would have improved over last year, despite the 14% drop in sales. 
For the full year 2016, we expect Engine segment revenues to decline by 9% to 12%, primarily due to weaker truck demand in the truck market in North America. 2016 EBIT margins are expected to be in the range of 10% to 11% compared to 9.9% for the full year 2015, excluding restructuring and impairment charges. We expect that year-over-year improvement in EBIT percent is primarily due to the lower warranty cost, benefits from the restructuring actions and material cost-reduction initiatives. 
For the Distribution segment, second quarter revenues were $1.5 billion, which increased 3% compared to last year. Prior year acquisitions contributed 8% to the sales growth, partially offset by a 3% decline in organic sales and a 2% negative impact from currency. Engine and segment -- and service revenues declined in the quarter as demand for new engines and rebuilds remains weak in off-highway markets, especially in oil and gas and marine markets. 
EBIT margins for the quarter decreased from 7.6% to 5.6%, due primarily to the unfavorable impact of currency and lower organic sales. On our prior earnings call, we shared our plans to acquire the last remaining unconsolidated North American distributor. We currently expect to complete the acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
We are updating our full year revenue guidance now to be between down 1% and up 1%, incorporating the new acquisitions and reflecting continued weakness in off-highway markets, especially in North America, and weaker power generation sales in the Middle East. We expect full year EBIT margins to be in a range of 5.5% to 6.5% of sales. 
The Components segment recorded revenues of $1.3 billion, which declined 8% from a year ago. A 17% increase in revenue from China, along with increased revenue from Europe, helped to partially offset a 17% sales decline in North America. Segment EBIT was $190 million or 14.9% of sales compared to 16% of sales a year ago. Strong operating performance, material cost reductions and the benefits from restructuring actions helped to partially offset the impact from weaker sales in North America, lower pricing and the negative impact of currency. 
We currently expect full year revenue in 2016 to decline by 6% to 9%. EBIT guidance for the full year is unchanged from before and is expected to be in a range of 12.75% to 13.75% of sales. 
In the Power Systems segment, second quarter revenues were $921 million, down 16% from last year. Sales declined 20% in international markets, primarily due to lower demand for power generation equipment in Asia, in the Middle East and in Latin America. Sales in North America declined 9% compared to the same quarter last year, primarily due to lower oil and gas demand. EBIT margins were 9.8% of sales in the quarter, down from 11.6% last year, primarily due to the much lower demand across most of our markets. 
We currently expect full year revenues for the Power Systems segment to decline between 12% and 14%, with EBIT in a range of 7% to 8% of sales. Forecasted year-over-year volume declines, the negative impacts from our competitive pricing environment in international markets and additional expenses related to new cost-reduction actions in 2016 will more than offset the benefits of restructuring and material cost reductions. 
We now project the total company revenues to be down between 8% and 10% in 2016, which is lower than our prior guidance of down 5% to 9% due to a weaker outlook in North America and a softer demand in power generation markets. Declining production in the North American truck markets and weak demand globally for off-highway and power generation equipment will drive the majority of reduction in revenue for the full year. 
We expect EBIT margins of between 11.6% to 12.2% of sales, unchanged from our prior guidance. Cost-reduction initiatives across the company will mitigate the impact of weaker revenues. Joint venture income is still expected to be flat compared to 2015, and we now expect our effective tax rate to be 27% for the year. 
Turning to cash flow. Cash generated from operating activities was $471 million in the second quarter, better than the same quarter last year by $75 million, primarily due to lower working capital. For the first 6 months of the year, cash from operations is $734 million compared to $569 million at the same point last year. We anticipate operating cash flow performance in 2016 will be within our long-term guidance range of 10% to 15% of sales. 
Capital expenditures were $189 million for the first 6 months of the year and are expected to be in the range of $600 million to $650 million for the full year. And year-to-date, we returned more than $1 billion to shareholders, which includes the repurchase of 6.7 million shares. And as Tom said, recently, our Board of Directors authorized an increase in our quarterly dividend of 5% to $1.025 per share, consistent with our plans to return 75% of full year operating cash flow to shareholders in this year. 
Now let me turn it back over to Mark."

As we've discussed before, our view of Power Generation business continues to be bullish long term, but what we've noticed is 3 things. First, that we've set our overall view about growth in emerging markets to -- we've moderated those over prior views. I think, that's not  a surprise, everyone's probably done that. And then, secondly, the time it's going to take to recover looks like it's going to be longer, and that's year-by-year, we've been pushing that out, unfortunately, which is one of the reasons we're in a bit of a catch-up mode in Power Generation, but we basically said we need to act now because the recovery of the markets doesn't seem imminent. And I think, the third thing that we talked about before is that one of the things that our company feels strongly about is when we have downturns, we want to use those as opportunities to improve the efficiency and productivity of our operations. So we think, by combining our generator set assembly, for example, with our high-horsepower engines, that we'll be able to restore the same capacity, if not more, but reduce costs and reduce inefficiencies related to the supply chain. So we're going to put the entire capacity of that assembly line in the Daventry plant. We're going to save shipping, we're going to save test time, we're going to save logistics coming into the plant. So there's a whole bunch of opportunities, and we just couldn't make those changes when the market was strong, we just -- you can't reduce capacity for long enough to actually consolidate plants. So again, this is not the only one like that, but many of the operations changes that we're taking now are opportunities that we can take advantage of because markets are slower. So we can manage the inventory and things and the demand much better. And then, our hope is as markets improve, we're then able to supply even greater capacity but at much lower cost and a better efficiency. That's what we're aiming for through this effort."

Pat will then take you through more details of both our second quarter financial performance and our forecast for the year. 
Revenues for the second quarter were $4.5 billion, a decrease of 10% compared to the second quarter of 2015. Second quarter EBIT was $591 million or 13.1% of sales compared to $721 million or 14.4% in the same quarter last year. 
We made strong progress in our cost-reduction initiatives in the second quarter as benefits from restructuring actions, material cost-reduction initiatives and improvements in product quality helped to mitigate the impact of weak demand in a number of important markets. 
Our decremental EBIT margin was 27% for the second quarter and 23% for the first half of 2016 compared to our full year guidance of 25%. Engine business revenues decreased by 14% year-over-year, primarily due to lower demand in heavy and medium-duty truck market in North America. EBIT of 10.3% of sales declined from 12% a year ago as strong operational performance and benefits from restructuring, material cost-reduction initiatives and a 90 basis point improvement in warranty costs were offset by the impact of lower volumes. 
Second quarter results include a $39 million increase in our provision for a product campaign that we initially recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015. As we previously discussed, this provision is for a quality issue related to a third-party aftertreatment system that's impacting the performance of some of our engines in vehicles produced by one of our OEM customers. The increase in our provision reflects a more conservative approach to protecting vehicle owners with a higher proportion of vehicles now planned to have full replacement of aftertreatment system hardware than we had originally anticipated, resulting in a higher estimated cost for the campaign. Discussions over how the cost of this campaign should be shared with our OEM customer are ongoing. 
Revenues in our Components segment decreased 8% from a year ago, with lower demand in North America more than offsetting growth in China. Sales in China increased by 17% due to a stronger demand in the truck market. EBIT of $190 million or 14.9% of sales declined from $223 million or 16% as the impact of lower volumes offset the benefit of material and other cost reductions. 
Earlier today, we announced the closure of a filtration manufacturing facility in Turkey as we continue to implement plans to improve our cost structure. Distribution revenues increased 3% compared to the second quarter of 2015. The positive impact of acquisitions made in the second half of 2015 more than offset the negative impact of currency and weaker sales to off-highway markets. EBIT for the quarter of 5.6% declined from 7.6% a year ago, due mainly to the negative impact of currency and weaker organic sales. 
Last quarter, we announced our plans to acquire the last remaining distributor joint venture in North America, and we currently expect to complete the acquisition in the fourth quarter of this year. 
Revenues for the Power Systems business declined by 16% year-over-year, with lower sales in most regions due to weaker demand in power generation, commercial marine and oil and gas markets. EBIT declined from 11.6% to 9.8% a year ago as the impact of lower sales more than offset an 18% reduction in operating expenses. EBIT did improve from 5.7% in the first quarter due to good operating leverage on incremental sales and strong cost control. We continued to make progress with our plans to close 3 Power Systems manufacturing operations in India, Mexico and the U.K. Our actions in India and Mexico will be completed in the second half of 2016. In the U.K., we are on track to commence assembly of high-horsepower generator sets at our Daventry engine plant in the fourth quarter of this year, a key milestone in the first phase of our closure plan for our assembly operations in Kent. There will be both expenses and savings in the second half of 2016 associated with these actions that will improve our cost structure when it completes. 
Now I will comment on some of our key markets starting with North America. Our revenues in North America declined by 13% in the second quarter due to weaker demand in on-highway markets, especially heavy-duty truck. We shipped 16,000 engines to the North American heavy-duty truck market in the second quarter, a decrease of 43% from a year ago. We have lowered our projection for full year industry production to 200,000 units at the midpoint of our guidance, down from our prior forecast of 210,000 units as weak industry orders and high dealer inventories are likely to cause OEMs to lower their build rates in the second half of the year. Our market share through the end of June was 28.9%, and we expect our full year market share to be in the range of 27% to 30% for the year, unchanged from our projections 3 months ago. 
In the medium-duty truck market, we delivered almost 21,000 engines in the second quarter, down 20% from last year as our customers produced at a lower rate compared to the overall industry. Our market share through the end of May was almost 75%, slightly ahead of our full year forecast of 74%, which is unchanged from last quarter. We have lowered our forecast for full year industry production to 117,000 units, down 6% compared to both 2015 and our prior guidance for 2016, as the growth in new orders has leveled off in recent months and OEMs are trimming build rates. 
Our engine shipments to North American pickup truck customers increased by 18% in the second quarter. Shipments to Chrysler increased 4% to more than 33,000 units. Sales also increased in Nissan, following the launch of our 5-liter V8 engine in the fourth quarter last year. We currently expect our revenues in the pickup segment to increase by 12% in 2016, again, unchanged from our prior forecast. 
Our engine revenues from the North American construction market decreased by 30% compared to the second quarter last year. While housing and commercial construction activity remains positive, demand from rental companies for new equipment has declined due to weakness in the oil and gas market. 
Power Systems revenues declined 9% in North America in the second quarter due primarily to lower engine orders from oil and gas customers, which more than offset 4% growth in Power Generation. Our international revenues declined by 4% year-over-year, with weaker sales in Latin America and the Middle East. Second quarter revenues in China, including joint ventures, were $940 million, an increase of 3% with growth in on-highway revenues partially offset by the depreciation of the renminbi against the U.S. dollar and weaker demand for Power Generation equipment and industrial engines. 
Industry demand for heavy and medium-duty trucks in China increased by 21% in the second quarter. Our market share in the second quarter was just under 15%, level with last year. Although demand from Foton for our heavy-duty ISG engine increased year-over-year, growth in shipments to our other primary partner, Dongfeng, did not keep pace with the market. One truck OEM, in particular, is being very aggressive on pricing this year and has increased its share at the expense of several OEMs, including Dongfeng. We now forecast full year industry sales to grow by 9% for the year, up from our prior forecast of a decline of 4%, as industry sales were well ahead of our expectations in the first half of the year. 
Visibility to demand in the second half is limited, and we remain cautious until we see broader improvement in macroeconomic indicators. Shipments of our light-duty engines in China grew 14% in the second quarter compared to a 6% decline for the overall market as we increased penetration at Foton, displacing local competitor engines. Our share of the overall market was almost 7%, up more than 100 basis points year-over-year. We currently project industry sales to decline by 4% for the year, unchanged from 3 months ago. 
Industry sales of excavators in China decreased by 11% in the second quarter as sales moderated from inflated first quarter levels following the transition to Tier 3 emission standards that came into force in April. The overall numbers of excavators sold remains very low with no obvious catalyst for significant growth in this near term. 
Revenues for our Power Systems business in China declined by 25% in the second quarter, reflecting weak demand in mining, marine and power generation markets. Full year revenues in China across all segments, including joint ventures, are expected to grow 3% for the year, up from our prior forecast of flat, due to stronger demand in the heavy and medium-duty truck market. 
Second quarter revenues in India, including joint ventures, were $423 million, up 9% year-over-year, primarily due to strong demand in the truck market, which more than offset the impact of a weaker rupee. Industry demand in the truck market increased 22% as the economy continued to improve. Our market share in the second quarter was 44%, up from 42% a year ago, and our penetration with Tata increased to 78% from 73% a year ago. We now expect industry truck production to increase 15% for the full year, up from our prior forecast of 10% growth. 
Power Systems revenues in India declined by 6% in the second quarter with a weak rupee offsetting volume growth. We currently project full year revenues across all segments, and including joint ventures, to increase 5% in India, up from our prior forecast of 1% -- up 1% due to a stronger truck demand. 
Second quarter revenues in Brazil were $80 million, down 27% from the second quarter last year as the economy remains in recession, and the real depreciated 14% against the U.S. dollar. Industry truck production fell 12% year-over-year, while our engine shipments declined 30%. Industry production for heavy commercial vehicles greater than 15 tons increased in the quarter, while medium and light vehicles, in which we have a higher market share, declined significantly. We project full year industry truck production to decline by 20%, unchanged from 3 months ago. 
Revenues for our Power Systems business in Brazil declined by 45% due to the continuing economic challenges in the region. Our sales in the Middle East also declined by more than 30% in the second quarter, primarily impacting our Power Systems business and reflecting a slowdown in infrastructure investments in the region. 
Clearly, we are facing challenging market conditions. However, in the face of a 43% decline in shipments to North American heavy-duty truck market and very weak conditions in most of our end markets, strong operational performance and execution of our cost-reduction initiatives enabled us to deliver EBIT above 13% of sales in the second quarter. 
Looking forward, we now expect company revenues to decrease between 8% and 10% for the year, lower than our prior guidance of 5% to 9% due to a lower outlook for truck production in North America and weaker demand in Power Generation and off-highway markets. Revenues in the third and fourth quarters of this year are projected to be lower than second quarter levels, and we continue to identify opportunities to further improve our productivity and lower our cost structure. 
We expect EBIT to be in the range of 11.6% to 12.2% for the year, unchanged from our prior forecast, reflecting full year decremental EBIT margin of 25%. In the first half of this year, we returned more than $1 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, and our Board of Directors recently increased quarterly dividend by more than 5%, all consistent with our plans to return 75% of operating cash to shareholders. 
Thank you for your interest today. And now, I'll turn it over to Pat, who will cover our second quarter results and full year guidance in more detail."

I would like to make clear to everyone that the results and the very good share reflect the recently reorganized business segments.

I would like to make clear to everyone that the results and the very good share reflect the recently reorganized business segments. A copy of the restated segment financial results for prior periods referred to in my comments can be found in our 8-K filed with the SEC and on our website. 
For the second quarter, revenues were $4.5 billion, a decrease of 10% from a year ago. Sales in North America, which represented 58% of our second quarter revenues, declined 13% from last year due primarily to lower demand in North American on-highway truck markets and continued weakness in industrial markets. 
International sales declined by 4% from a year ago due to weak demand for industrial engines and Power Generation equipment. While revenues grew in India and in China, this was more than offset by weaker demand in Latin America and in the Middle East. 
Gross margins were 26.4% of sales, a decline of 20 basis points from last year. The negative impact of lower volumes and unfavorable product mix were offset by material cost savings, benefits from restructuring actions and more warranty expense. 
Selling, admin and research and development expenses of $679 million or 15% of sales decreased by $24 million from a year ago, but increased as a percent of sales by 100 basis points as sales declined. Joint venture income of $88 million decreased by $6 million compared to last year, primarily due to the acquisition of North American distributors previously held as unconsolidated joint ventures. Other income and expenses, including interest income netted to an expense of $16 million in the quarter, including an increase in the provision for a quality issue related to a third-party aftertreatment system that Tom referred to earlier. 
Earnings before interest and tax were $591 million or 13.1% of sales for the quarter, which equates to a 27% decremental margin when compared to a record $721 million or 14.4% of sales that we reported last year. For the first 6 months of the year, decremental EBIT margins are 23%, slightly better than our target of 25%. 
Net earnings for the quarter were $406 million or $2.40 per diluted share compared with $2.62 from a year ago. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 25.7%, lower than a year ago due to the change in the geographic mix of earnings. 
I will now highlight the performance of the individual operating segments during the second quarter. In the Engine segment, revenues were $2 billion, a decrease of 14% from last year. On-highway revenues declined by 15% due to reduction in heavy and medium-duty truck industry production in North America, partially offset by stronger sales to bus and pickup truck customers. Off-highway revenues declined by 9%, primarily due to a decline in the construction and marine markets. 
Segment EBIT was $206 million or 10.3% of sales compared to 12% last year. Material cost savings for warranty expense and the benefits from previous restructuring actions offset the negative impact of lower volumes and an unfavorable product mix. Included in the results for the second quarter in the Engine segment was a $39 million charge to increase our estimate for the loss contingency recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015. Excluding this additional provision, segment EBIT would have improved over last year, despite the 14% drop in sales. 
For the full year 2016, we expect Engine segment revenues to decline by 9% to 12%, primarily due to weaker truck demand in the truck markets in North America. 2016 EBIT margins are expected to be in the range of 10% to 11% compared to 9.9% for the full year 2015, excluding restructuring and impairment charges. We expect that year-over-year improvement in EBIT percent is primarily due to lower warranty cost, benefits from the restructuring actions and material cost-reduction initiatives. 
For the Distribution segment, second quarter revenues were $1.5 billion, which increased 3% compared to last year. Prior year acquisitions contributed 8% to the sales growth, partially offset by a 3% decline in organic sales and a 2% negative impact from currency. Engine and segment -- and service revenues declined in the quarter as demand for new engines and rebuilds remains weak in off-highway markets, especially in oil and gas and marine markets. 
EBIT margins for the quarter decreased from 7.6% to 5.6%, due primarily to the unfavorable impact of currency and lower organic sales. On our prior earnings call, we shared our plans to acquire the last remaining unconsolidated North American distributor. We currently expect to complete the acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
We are updating our full year revenue guidance now to be between down 1% and up 1%, incorporating the new acquisitions and reflecting continued weakness in off-highway markets, especially in North America, and weaker power generation sales in the Middle East. We expect full year EBIT margins to be in the range of 5.5% to 6.5% of sales. 
The Components segment recorded revenues of $1.3 billion, which declined 8% from a year ago. A 17% increase in revenue from China, along with increased revenue from Europe, helped to partially offset a 17% sales decline in North America. Segment EBIT was $190 million or 14.9% of sales compared to 16% of sales a year ago. Strong operating performance, material cost reductions and the benefits from restructuring actions helped to partially offset the impact from weaker sales in North America, lower pricing and the negative impact of currency. 
We currently expect full year revenue in 2016 to decline by 6% to 9%. EBIT guidance for the full year is unchanged from before and is expected to be in the range of 12.75% to 13.75% of sales. 
In the Power Systems segment, second quarter revenues were $921 million, down 16% from last year. Sales declined 20% in international markets, primarily due to lower demand for power generation equipment in Asia, in the Middle East and in Latin America. Sales in North America declined 9% compared to the same quarter last year, primarily due to lower oil and gas demand. EBIT margins were 9.8% of sales in the quarter, down from 11.6% last year, primarily due to the much lower demand across most of our markets. 
We currently expect full year revenues for the Power Systems segment to decline between 12% and 14%, with EBIT in a range of 7% to 8% of sales. Forecasted year-over-year volume declines, the negative impacts from a competitive pricing environment in international markets and additional expenses related to new cost-reduction actions in 2016 will more than offset the benefits of restructuring and material cost reductions. 
We are now projecting total company revenues to be down between 8% and 10% in 2016, which is lower than our prior guidance of down 5% to 9% due to a weaker outlook in North America and a softer demand in power generation markets. Declining production in the North American truck markets, and weak demand globally for off-highway and power generation equipment, will drive the majority of reduction in revenue for the full year. 
We expect EBIT margins of between 11.6% to 12.2% of sales, unchanged from our prior guidance. Cost-reduction initiatives across the company will mitigate the impact of weaker revenues. Joint venture income is still expected to be flat compared to 2015, and we now expect our effective tax rate to be 27% for the year. 
Turning to cash flow. Cash generated from operating activities was $471 million in the second quarter, better than the same quarter last year by $75 million, primarily due to lower working capital. For the first 6 months of the year, cash from operations is $734 million compared to $569 million at the same point last year. We anticipate operating cash flow performance in 2016 will be within a long-term guidance range of 10% to 15% of sales. 
Capital expenditures were $189 million for the first 6 months of the year and are expected to be in the range of $600 million to $650 million for the full year. And year-to-date, we've returned more than $1 billion to shareholders, which includes the repurchase of 6.7 million shares, and, as Tom said, recently our Board of Directors authorized an increase in our quarterly dividend of 5% to $1.025 per share, consistent with our plans to return 75% of full year operating cash flow to shareholders in this year. 
Now let me turn it back over to Mark."

As we've discussed before, our view of Power Generation business continues to be bullish long term, but what we've noticed is 3 things. First, that we've set our overall view about growth in emerging markets to -- we've moderated those over prior views. I think that's not  a surprise, everyone's probably done that. And then, secondly, the time it's going to take to recover looks like it's going to be longer, and that's year-by-year, we've been pushing that out, unfortunately, which is one of the reasons we're in a bit of a catch-up mode in Power Generation, but we basically said we need to act now because the recovery of the markets doesn't seem imminent. And I think the third thing that we talked about before is that one of the things that our company feels strongly about is when we have downturns, we want to use those as opportunities to improve the efficiency and productivity of our operations. So we think, by combining our generator set assembly, for example, with our high-horsepower engines, that we'll be able to restore the same capacity, if not more, but reduce costs and reduce inefficiencies related to the supply chain. So we're going to put the entire capacity of that assembly line in the Daventry plant. We're going to save shipping, we're going to save test time, we're going to save logistics coming into the plant. So there's a whole bunch of opportunities, and we just couldn't make those changes when the market was strong, we just -- you can't reduce capacity for long enough to actually consolidate plants. So again, this is not the only one like that, but many of the operations changes that we're taking now are opportunities that we can take advantage of because markets are slower, so we can manage the inventory and things and the demand much better. And then, our hope is as markets improve we're then able to supply even greater capacity but at much lower cost and a better efficiency. That's what we're aiming for through this effort."

So that's going to continue, I think, regardless of what's happening to the markets next year. Clearly, we'd like to see some recovery, and most markets have been weaker for a while now, but if they don't recover, we'll continue to pursue cost improvement in those areas in particular, material costs and warranty. Even though it's still just over 2% of sales, we can do the math and figure out that's $350 million still. So there's still a lot of money for us to go after there."

Thirdly, we've got the opportunity for the 95, where we launched -- engines are more expensive, and as we build volume, that'll get better. So there's tailwinds as well as headwinds, and I would just reemphasize what Pat said is that every single quarter, every single year, we're looking for new opportunities to drive cost-reduction and improvement. And again, we haven't run out of ideas yet, and hopefully, as long as this management team is here, we will not run out of ideas, or probably it's time for a new management team because that's what we think our job is."

I'll start out with a summary of our second quarter results and provide an update on our outlook for the full year.

I'll start out with a summary of our second quarter results and provide an update on our outlook for the full year. Pat will then take you through more details of both our second quarter financial performance and our forecast for the year. 
Revenues for the second quarter were $4.5 billion, a decrease of 10% compared to the second quarter of 2015. Second quarter EBIT was $591 million or 13.1% of sales compared to $721 million or 14.4% in the same quarter last year. 
We made strong progress in our cost-reduction initiatives in the second quarter as benefits from restructuring actions, material cost-reduction initiatives and improvements in product quality helped to mitigate the impact of weak demand in a number of important markets. 
Our decremental EBIT margin was 27% for the second quarter and 23% for the first half of 2016 compared to our full year guidance of 25%. Engine business revenues decreased by 14% year-over-year, primarily due to lower demand in heavy and medium-duty truck market in North America. EBIT of 10.3% of sales declined from 12% a year ago as strong operational performance and benefits from restructuring, material cost-reduction initiatives and a 90 basis point improvement in warranty costs were offset by the impact of lower volumes. 
Second quarter results include a $39 million increase in our provision for a product campaign that we initially recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015. As we previously discussed, this provision is for a quality issue related to a third-party aftertreatment system that's impacting the performance of some of our engines in vehicles produced by one of our OEM customers. The increase in our provision reflects a more conservative approach to protecting vehicle owners with a higher proportion of vehicles now planned to have full replacement of aftertreatment system hardware than we had originally anticipated, resulting in a higher estimated cost for the campaign. Discussions over how the cost of this campaign should be shared with our OEM customer are ongoing. 
Revenues in our Components segment decreased 8% from a year ago, with lower demand in North America more than offsetting growth in China. Sales in China increased by 17% due to a stronger demand in the truck market. EBIT of $190 million or 14.9% of sales declined from $223 million or 16% as the impact of lower volumes offset the benefit of material and other cost reductions. 
Earlier today, we announced the closure of a filtration manufacturing facility in Turkey as we continue to implement plans to improve our cost structure. Distribution revenues increased 3% compared to the second quarter of 2015. The positive impact of acquisitions made in the second half of 2015 more than offset the negative impact of currency and weaker sales to off-highway markets. EBIT for the quarter of 5.6% declined from 7.6% a year ago, due mainly to the negative impact of currency and weaker organic sales. 
Last quarter, we announced our plans to acquire the last remaining distributor joint venture in North America, and we currently expect to complete the acquisition in the fourth quarter of this year. 
Revenues for the Power Systems business declined by 16% year-over-year, with lower sales in most regions due to weaker demand in power generation, commercial marine and oil and gas markets. EBIT declined from 11.6% to 9.8% a year ago as the impact of lower sales more than offset an 18% reduction in operating expenses. EBIT did improve from 5.7% in the first quarter due to good operating leverage on incremental sales and strong cost control. We continued to make progress with our plans to close 3 Power Systems manufacturing operations in India, Mexico and the U.K. Our actions in India and Mexico will be completed in the second half of 2016. In the U.K., we are on track to commence assembly of high-horsepower generator sets at our Daventry engine plant in the fourth quarter of this year, a key milestone in the first phase of our closure plan for our assembly operations in Kent. There will be both expenses and savings in the second half of 2016 associated with these actions that will improve our cost structure when it completes. 
Now I will comment on some of our key markets starting with North America. Our revenues in North America declined by 13% in the second quarter due to weaker demand in on-highway markets, especially heavy-duty truck. We shipped 16,000 engines to the North American heavy-duty truck market in the second quarter, a decrease of 43% from a year ago. We have lowered our projection for full year industry production to 200,000 units at the midpoint of our guidance, down from our prior forecast of 210,000 units as weak industry orders and high dealer inventories are likely to cause OEMs to lower their build rates in the second half of the year. Our market share through the end of June was 28.9%, and we expect our full year market share to be in the range of 27% to 30% for the year, unchanged from our projections 3 months ago. 
In the medium-duty truck market, we delivered almost 21,000 engines in the second quarter, down 20% from last year as our customers produced at a lower rate compared to the overall industry. Our market share through the end of May was almost 75%, slightly ahead of our full year forecast of 74%, which is unchanged from last quarter. We have lowered our forecast for full year industry production to 117,000 units, down 6% compared to both 2015 and our prior guidance for 2016, as the growth in new orders has leveled off in recent months and OEMs are trimming build rates. 
Our engine shipments to North American pickup truck customers increased by 18% in the second quarter. Shipments to Chrysler increased 4% to more than 33,000 units. Sales also increased in Nissan, following the launch of our 5-liter V8 engine in the fourth quarter last year. We currently expect our revenues in the pickup segment to increase by 12% in 2016, again, unchanged from our prior forecast. 
Our engine revenues from the North American construction market decreased by 30% compared to the second quarter last year. While housing and commercial construction activity remains positive, demand from rental companies for new equipment has declined due to weakness in the oil and gas market. 
Power Systems revenues declined 9% in North America in the second quarter due primarily to lower engine orders from oil and gas customers, which more than offset 4% growth in Power Generation. Our international revenues declined by 4% year-over-year, with weaker sales in Latin America and the Middle East. Second quarter revenues in China, including joint ventures, were $940 million, an increase of 3% with growth in on-highway revenues partially offset by the depreciation of the renminbi against the U.S. dollar and weaker demand for Power Generation equipment and industrial engines. 
Industry demand for heavy and medium-duty trucks in China increased by 21% in the second quarter. Our market share in the second quarter was just under 15%, level with last year. Although demand from Foton for our heavy-duty ISG engine increased year-over-year, growth in shipments to our other primary partner, Dongfeng, did not keep pace with the market. One truck OEM, in particular, is being very aggressive on pricing this year and has increased its share at the expense of several OEMs, including Dongfeng. We now forecast full year industry sales to grow by 9% for the year, up from our prior forecast of a decline of 4%, as industry sales were well ahead of our expectations in the first half of the year. 
Visibility to demand in the second half is limited, and we remain cautious until we see broader improvement in macroeconomic indicators. Shipments of our light-duty engines in China grew 14% in the second quarter compared to a 6% decline for the overall market as we increased penetration at Foton, displacing local competitor engines. Our share of the overall market was almost 7%, up more than 100 basis points year-over-year. We currently project industry sales to decline by 4% for the year, unchanged from 3 months ago. 
Industry sales of excavators in China decreased by 11% in the second quarter as sales moderated from inflated first quarter levels following the transition to Tier 3 emission standards that came into force in April. The overall numbers of excavators sold remains very low with no obvious catalyst for significant growth in this near term. 
Revenues for our Power Systems business in China declined by 25% in the second quarter, reflecting weak demand in mining, marine and power generation markets. Full year revenues in China across all segments, including joint ventures, are expected to grow 3% for the year, up from our prior forecast of flat, due to stronger demand in the heavy and medium-duty truck market. 
Second quarter revenues in India, including joint ventures, were $423 million, up 9% year-over-year, primarily due to strong demand in the truck market, which more than offset the impact of a weaker rupee. Industry demand in the truck market increased 22% as the economy continued to improve. Our market share in the second quarter was 44%, up from 42% a year ago, and our penetration with Tata increased to 78% from 73% a year ago. We now expect industry truck production to increase 15% for the full year, up from our prior forecast of 10% growth. 
Power Systems revenues in India declined by 6% in the second quarter with a weak rupee offsetting volume growth. We currently project full year revenues across all segments, and including joint ventures, to increase 5% in India, up from our prior forecast of 1% -- up 1% due to a stronger truck demand. 
Second quarter revenues in Brazil were $80 million, down 27% from the second quarter last year as the economy remains in recession, and the real depreciated 14% against the U.S. dollar. Industry truck production fell 12% year-over-year, while our engine shipments declined 30%. Industry production for heavy commercial vehicles greater than 15 tons increased in the quarter, while medium and light vehicles, in which we have a higher market share, declined significantly. We project full year industry truck production to decline by 20%, unchanged from 3 months ago. 
Revenues for our Power Systems business in Brazil declined by 45% due to the continuing economic challenges in the region. Our sales in the Middle East also declined by more than 30% in the second quarter, primarily impacting our Power Systems business and reflecting a slowdown in infrastructure investments in the region. 
Clearly, we are facing challenging market conditions. However, in the face of a 43% decline in shipments to North American heavy-duty truck market and very weak conditions in most of our end markets, strong operational performance and execution of our cost-reduction initiatives enabled us to deliver EBIT above 13% of sales in the second quarter. 
Looking forward, we now expect company revenues to decrease between 8% and 10% for the year, lower than our prior guidance of 5% to 9% due to a lower outlook for truck production in North America and weaker demand in Power Generation and off-highway markets. Revenues in the third and fourth quarters of this year are projected to be lower than second quarter levels, and we continue to identify opportunities to further improve our productivity and lower our cost structure. 
We expect EBIT to be in the range of 11.6% to 12.2% for the year, unchanged from our prior forecast, reflecting full year decremental EBIT margin of 25%. In the first half of this year, we returned more than $1 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, and our Board of Directors recently increased quarterly dividend by more than 5%, all consistent with our plans to return 75% of operating cash to shareholders. 
Thank you for your interest today. And now, I'll turn it over to Pat, who will cover our second quarter results and full year guidance in more detail."

I would like to make clear to everyone that the results and the very good share reflect the recently reorganized business segments.

I would like to make clear to everyone that the results and the very good share reflect the recently reorganized business segments. A copy of the restated segment financial results for prior periods referred to in my comments can be found in our 8-K filed with the SEC and on our website. 
For the second quarter, revenues were $4.5 billion, a decrease of 10% from a year ago. Sales in North America, which represented 58% of our second quarter revenues, declined 13% from last year due primarily to lower demand in North American on-highway truck markets and continued weakness in industrial markets. 
International sales declined by 4% from a year ago due to weak demand for industrial engines and Power Generation equipment. While revenues grew in India and in China, this was more than offset by weaker demand in Latin America and in the Middle East. 
Gross margins were 26.4% of sales, a decline of 20 basis points from last year. The negative impact of lower volumes and unfavorable product mix were offset by material cost savings, benefits from restructuring actions and more warranty expense. 
Selling, admin and research and development expenses of $679 million or 15% of sales decreased by $24 million from a year ago, but increased as a percent of sales by 100 basis points as sales declined. Joint venture income of $88 million decreased by $6 million compared to last year, primarily due to the acquisition of North American distributors previously held as unconsolidated joint ventures. Other income and expenses, including interest income netted to an expense of $16 million in the quarter, including an increase in the provision for a quality issue related to a third-party aftertreatment system that Tom referred to earlier. 
Earnings before interest and tax were $591 million or 13.1% of sales for the quarter, which equates to a 27% decremental margin when compared to a record $721 million or 14.4% of sales that we reported last year. For the first 6 months of the year, decremental EBIT margins are 23%, slightly better than our target of 25%. 
Net earnings for the quarter were $406 million or $2.40 per diluted share compared with $2.62 from a year ago. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 25.7%, lower than a year ago due to the change in the geographic mix of earnings. 
I will now highlight the performance of the individual operating segments during the second quarter. In the Engine segment, revenues were $2 billion, a decrease of 14% from last year. On-highway revenues declined by 15% due to reduction in heavy and medium-duty truck industry production in North America, partially offset by stronger sales to bus and pickup truck customers. Off-highway revenues declined by 9%, primarily due to a decline in the construction and marine markets. 
Segment EBIT was $206 million or 10.3% of sales compared to 12% last year. Material cost savings for warranty expense and the benefits from previous restructuring actions offset the negative impact of lower volumes and an unfavorable product mix. Included in the results for the second quarter in the Engine segment was a $39 million charge to increase our estimate for the loss contingency recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015. Excluding this additional provision, segment EBIT would have improved over last year, despite the 14% drop in sales. 
For the full year 2016, we expect Engine segment revenues to decline by 9% to 12%, primarily due to weaker truck demand in the truck markets in North America. 2016 EBIT margins are expected to be in the range of 10% to 11% compared to 9.9% for the full year 2015, excluding restructuring and impairment charges. We expect that year-over-year improvement in EBIT percent is primarily due to lower warranty cost, benefits from the restructuring actions and material cost-reduction initiatives. 
For the Distribution segment, second quarter revenues were $1.5 billion, which increased 3% compared to last year. Prior year acquisitions contributed 8% to the sales growth, partially offset by a 3% decline in organic sales and a 2% negative impact from currency. Engine and segment -- and service revenues declined in the quarter as demand for new engines and rebuilds remains weak in off-highway markets, especially in oil and gas and marine markets. 
EBIT margins for the quarter decreased from 7.6% to 5.6%, due primarily to the unfavorable impact of currency and lower organic sales. On our prior earnings call, we shared our plans to acquire the last remaining unconsolidated North American distributor. We currently expect to complete the acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
We are updating our full year revenue guidance now to be between down 1% and up 1%, incorporating the new acquisitions and reflecting continued weakness in off-highway markets, especially in North America, and weaker power generation sales in the Middle East. We expect full year EBIT margins to be in the range of 5.5% to 6.5% of sales. 
The Components segment recorded revenues of $1.3 billion, which declined 8% from a year ago. A 17% increase in revenue from China, along with increased revenue from Europe, helped to partially offset a 17% sales decline in North America. Segment EBIT was $190 million or 14.9% of sales compared to 16% of sales a year ago. Strong operating performance, material cost reductions and the benefits from restructuring actions helped to partially offset the impact from weaker sales in North America, lower pricing and the negative impact of currency. 
We currently expect full year revenue in 2016 to decline by 6% to 9%. EBIT guidance for the full year is unchanged from before and is expected to be in the range of 12.75% to 13.75% of sales. 
In the Power Systems segment, second quarter revenues were $921 million, down 16% from last year. Sales declined 20% in international markets, primarily due to lower demand for power generation equipment in Asia, in the Middle East and in Latin America. Sales in North America declined 9% compared to the same quarter last year, primarily due to lower oil and gas demand. EBIT margins were 9.8% of sales in the quarter, down from 11.6% last year, primarily due to the much lower demand across most of our markets. 
We currently expect full year revenues for the Power Systems segment to decline between 12% and 14%, with EBIT in a range of 7% to 8% of sales. Forecasted year-over-year volume declines, the negative impacts from a competitive pricing environment in international markets and additional expenses related to new cost-reduction actions in 2016 will more than offset the benefits of restructuring and material cost reductions. 
We are now projecting total company revenues to be down between 8% and 10% in 2016, which is lower than our prior guidance of down 5% to 9% due to a weaker outlook in North America and a softer demand in power generation markets. Declining production in the North American truck markets, and weak demand globally for off-highway and power generation equipment, will drive the majority of reduction in revenue for the full year. 
We expect EBIT margins of between 11.6% to 12.2% of sales, unchanged from our prior guidance. Cost-reduction initiatives across the company will mitigate the impact of weaker revenues. Joint venture income is still expected to be flat compared to 2015, and we now expect our effective tax rate to be 27% for the year. 
Turning to cash flow. Cash generated from operating activities was $471 million in the second quarter, better than the same quarter last year by $75 million, primarily due to lower working capital. For the first 6 months of the year, cash from operations is $734 million compared to $569 million at the same point last year. We anticipate operating cash flow performance in 2016 will be within a long-term guidance range of 10% to 15% of sales. 
Capital expenditures were $189 million for the first 6 months of the year and are expected to be in the range of $600 million to $650 million for the full year. And year-to-date, we've returned more than $1 billion to shareholders, which includes the repurchase of 6.7 million shares, and, as Tom said, recently our Board of Directors authorized an increase in our quarterly dividend of 5% to $1.025 per share, consistent with our plans to return 75% of full year operating cash flow to shareholders in this year. 
Now let me turn it back over to Mark."

As we've discussed before, our view of Power Generation business continues to be bullish long term, but what we've noticed is 3 things. First, that we've set our overall view about growth in emerging markets to -- we've moderated those over prior views. I think that's not  a surprise, everyone's probably done that. And then, secondly, the time it's going to take to recover looks like it's going to be longer, and that's year-by-year, we've been pushing that out, unfortunately, which is one of the reasons we're in a bit of a catch-up mode in Power Generation, but we basically said we need to act now because the recovery of the markets doesn't seem imminent. And I think the third thing that we talked about before is that one of the things that our company feels strongly about is when we have downturns, we want to use those as opportunities to improve the efficiency and productivity of our operations. So we think, by combining our generator set assembly, for example, with our high-horsepower engines, that we'll be able to restore the same capacity, if not more, but reduce costs and reduce inefficiencies related to the supply chain. So we're going to put the entire capacity of that assembly line in the Daventry plant. We're going to save shipping, we're going to save test time, we're going to save logistics coming into the plant. So there's a whole bunch of opportunities, and we just couldn't make those changes when the market was strong, we just -- you can't reduce capacity for long enough to actually consolidate plants. So again, this is not the only one like that, but many of the operations changes that we're taking now are opportunities that we can take advantage of because markets are slower, so we can manage the inventory and things and the demand much better. And then, our hope is as markets improve we're then able to supply even greater capacity but at much lower cost and a better efficiency. That's what we're aiming for through this effort."

The challenge we've had is the Indian rupee just keeps falling against the dollar, so every incremental dollar we make, we give X percent back in currency losses, but still, I mean, the joint venture is benefiting from a stronger market. That's straightforward. In China, because we have this situation where we're not -- we're keeping good share, we're doing well with our customers, but our customer, Dongfeng, is not holding share in the market relative to another competitor. That's kind of offsetting some of our -- the benefit of the market, and that's what we're highlighting there. So that's -- as Mark said, that's just some of the dynamics in the market. We'd of course love our customer, Dongfeng, to win, and our intent is to help find ways to help them win. But right now, that's what happened in the first half. It just kind of offset part of what we saw with the strong market in China. We don't think that's a long-term trend.

I will start with a summary of our third quarter results and provide an update on our outlook for the full year. Pat will then take you through more details of both our third quarter financial performance and our forecast for the year.
Revenues for the third quarter were $4.2 billion, a decrease of 9% compared to the third quarter of 2015. Third quarter EBIT was $398 million or 9.5% of sales compared to $577 million or 12.5% in the same quarter last year. 
Our results this quarter include a $99 million increase in accrual for a loss contingency. As we have disclosed in prior quarters, the loss contingency relates to the cost of the campaign to remedy quality issues with aftertreatment systems sourced by one of our OEM customers from a third party and paired with our engines in the OEM vehicles. The combination of the Cummins engine with a third-party aftertreatment system is unique to this particular OEM.
We increased our accrual in the third quarter to reflect recent testing results that indicate that similar quality issues are impacting a second population of vehicles manufactured by the same OEM. We have accrued the expected cost of the campaign, but final resolution of cost sharing with our OEM customer has not been finalized. All parties are committed to supporting the vehicle owners, and the agreed plant to replace the aftertreatment system is currently being executed. 
Excluding the loss contingency, we delivered decremental EBIT margins of 23% in the third quarter, better than our target of 25%, reflecting strong operational performance in the face of very weak markets. Benefits from the restructuring actions we initiated in the fourth quarter of 2015, strong execution of material initiatives and productivity gains all helped to mitigate the impact of lower volumes in the third quarter.
Engine business revenues decreased by 12% year-over-year, primarily due to the lower industry production of heavy- and medium-duty trucks in North America. Earnings before interest and tax was 4.8% of sales, down from 10.3% a year ago. Excluding the loss contingency, EBIT was 10.1% compared to 10.3% a year ago. 
Restructuring benefits, material cost reduction and lower warranty costs all contributed to the strong operating results. 
Revenues in our Components segment decreased 8% from a year ago, with lower demand in North America more than offsetting growth in China. Sales in China increased by 37% as demand for our products continues to outpace end market growth. Despite the lower sales, EBIT percent improved from 12.6% to 12.9% as strong execution of our cost-reduction programs more than offset the impact of weaker volumes.
Distribution revenues decreased 3% compared to the third quarter of 2015. The positive impact of acquisitions made in the second half of 2015 were more than offset by the negative impact of currency and weaker sales to the off-highway market. The Distribution business' EBIT for the quarter was 6.4%, down from 7.9% a year ago as results last year benefiting from gains on the acquisition of 3 distributor joint ventures. The positive impact of operational improvement and increased pricing were offset by a negative impact of currency.
Revenues for the Power Systems business declined by 13% year-over-year, with lower sales in most regions due to weaker demand in Power Generation, commercial marine and oil and gas markets. EBIT declined from 7.5% to 6.9%, with decremental EBIT margin just 12%, due in part to a 15% reduction in operating expenses in the business.
Now I'll comment on some of our key markets, starting with North America. Our revenues in North America declined by 13% in the third quarter due to weaker demand in on-highway market especially heavy-duty trucks. We shipped 16,400 engines to the North America heavy-duty market in the third quarter, a decrease of 33% from a year ago. Our market share improved from the second quarter of this year and stands at 31% year-to-date. We are forecasting full year industry production to be 200,000 units and our market share to be in the range of 27% to 30%, unchanged from our projections 3 months ago.
Frost and Sullivan recognized Cummins as a leading supplier of heavy-duty engines to the U.S. heavy-duty truck market, reflecting the results of its extensive survey of both truck fleets and owner operators.
In the medium-duty truck market, we delivered approximately 18,000 engines in the third quarter, down 20% from last year. Our market share through the end of August was 73%, within the range of our full-year guidance of between 72% to 75%. Industry production dipped sharply in the third quarter and is not expected to improve in the fourth quarter. And as a result, we have lowered our full year forecast of market size to 108,000 units from 117,000 units 3 months ago.
Our engine shipments to North American pickup truck customers increased by 2% in the third quarter. Shipments to Chrysler declined by 11% due to planned production changes at Chrysler plants but was more than offset by shipments of our V8 engine to Nissan, which we launched in the fourth quarter of last year. We currently expect our revenues in the pickup segment to increase by 10% in 2016, down a little from our prior forecast of 12% growth.
Our Engine revenues in North America construction market decreased by 21% compared to the third quarter of last year. While housing and commercial construction activity remains positive, weaker demand in the oil and gas market has led to an excess supply of used equipment. 
Power Systems revenues declined 8% in North America in the third quarter due to primarily to lower engine orders from oil and gas and mining customers.
Our international revenues declined by 3% year-over-year, driven by lower sales in the Middle East and Africa, which more than offset growth in China. Weak commodity prices and slowing economic activity negatively impact the demand for Power Generation equipment in the Middle East and Africa.
Third quarter revenues in China, including joint ventures, were $826 million, an increase of 6% due to growth in on-highway and construction revenues. Industry demand for heavy- and medium-duty trucks in China increased by 30% in the third quarter.
Our market share in the third quarter was 16.5%, up from the second quarter but down from 17.9% a year ago.
Some OEMs have been aggressively discounting trucks this year to gain share in the near term while our partner, Dongfeng, has experienced decline in market share. We expect our full year Engine market share to be 16% compared to 16.4% in 2015.
We now project full year industry sales to increase 16% to 870,000 units this year, up from our prior forecast of 820,000 units or 9% growth.
Shipment of our light-duty engines from China grew 23% in the third quarter compared to a 3% increase for the overall market as we increased penetration at Foton, displacing local competitor engine. Our share of the overall market was up -- was 7.7%, up 120 basis points year-over-year. We currently project industry sales to decline by 4% for the year, unchanged from 3 months ago. Industry sales of excavators in China decreased -- increased, excuse me, by 43% in the third quarter, and our volumes more than doubled off a very small base due to stronger investment in real estate, driving uptick in equipment demand. While this was a nice increase, construction equipment market in China are still very weak in historical terms.
Revenues for our Power Systems business in China declined by 11% in the third quarter, reflecting weak demand in Marine, mining and power generation markets. Full year revenues in China across all segments, including joint ventures, are expected to grow 4% for the year, up from our prior forecast of 3% due to stronger demand in the heavy- and medium-duty truck market. Third quarter revenues in India, including joint ventures, were $376 million and flat year-over-year, with lower on-highway volumes offsetting growth in Power Generation construction and aftermarket revenues. Industry truck production dropped by 17% compared to a year ago, after a very strong first half of the year.
Truck OEMs lowered build rates reduce inventories as sales slowed in the third quarter. For the full year, we now forecast industry truck production to be 340,000 units, up 6% year-over-year but down from our prior forecast of 370,000 units. We currently project our market share to be 41%, up from 40% in 2015.
We currently project full year revenues across all segments in India and including joint ventures to increase 5%, consistent with our prior forecast. Strong demand in construction and improving demand in Power Generation are expected to offset the weaker outlook for trucks.
Third quarter revenues in Brazil were $85 million, up 9% from the third quarter last year, reflecting a modest improvement in sales to on-highway markets. Our shipments of engines to truck customers increased 5% while overall industry truck production declined by 14% [ph] year-over-year. We project full year industry truck production to decline by 20%, unchanged from 3 months ago.
Our sales in the Middle East declined by 12% in the third quarter, primarily impacting our Power Systems business and reflecting weakness in infrastructure investment in the region.
As a result of the slowed pace of growth in the global economy, we continue to face persistently weak demand in a number of our largest markets. Our restructuring and other cost-reduction initiatives are helping to maintain EBIT margins well above trough levels from 3 [ph] prior cycles. In addition to reducing cost and improving productivity, we've also continued to invest in our business to improve our competitive position throughout this protracted downturn. 
In the fourth quarter, we will acquire our last remaining distributor joint venture in North America, completing the strategic initiative that we announced in 2013 and allowing us to improve the consistency and quality of our service and support to our customers wherever they operate.
We've also continued to invest in new products. For example, we're growing sales and market share with our new QSK95 engine even in extremely challenging markets. We currently expect our full year sales to decline by 9%, consistent with our prior guidance. EBIT percent is now expected to be 11.3%, down from our prior guidance of 11.6% to 12.2%, largely as a result of the increased accrual from the loss contingency in the Engine business. Our EBIT expectation for the Components, Distribution and Power System businesses are all unchanged from 3 months ago. We remain on track to deliver our goal of 25% decremental EBIT margin for the whole year of 2016.
So far this year, we have returned $1.3 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, consistent with our plan to return 75% of operating cash flow to shareholders. 
Thank you for your interest today, and now turn it over to Pat, who will cover third quarter results and full year guidance in more detail."

International sales declined by 3% from a year ago as increased sales in China helped to offset weaker demand in both the Middle East and in Africa.
Despite the 9% decline in revenues, gross margins of 25.8% of sales were only down 30 basis points from last year with material cost savings, productivity improvements and the benefits of the restructuring actions helping offset the negative impact from lower volumes and an unfavorable product mix.
Selling, admin and research and development costs of $670 million or 16% of sales decreased by $57 million year-over-year, mainly due to restructuring actions executed in the fourth quarter of 2015 and lower spending for research and development projects but did increase as a percent of sales by 30 [ph] basis points.
Joint venture income of $74 million decreased $4 million compared to a year ago, primarily due to lower earnings in Power Systems, joint ventures and the acquisition of North American distributors previously held as unconsolidated joint ventures.
Earnings before interest and tax were $398 million or 9.5% of sales for the quarter compared to 12.5% a year ago. Included in the quarter was an additional $99 million charge related to the previously disclosed loss contingency, as Tom just discussed. Excluding this charge, our decremental EBIT margin was 23% compared to the same quarter last year, slightly better than the 25% that we previously committed to.
We are benefiting from a lower cost structure due to the actions taken take in fourth quarter of 2015 and strong execution on the cost-reduction programs and productivity improvements. Net earnings for the quarter were $289 million or $1.72 per diluted share with the increased accrual from the loss contingency net of compensation reducing diluted earnings per share by $0.30.
Net income in the third quarter of 2015 was $380 million or $2.14 per diluted share. Effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.5%, lower than a year ago primarily due to changes in the geographical mix of pretax income. I will now highlight the performance of the individual operating segments during the third quarter and provide updated guidance for the full year.
In the Engine segment, revenues were $1.9 billion, a decrease of 12% from last year. On-highway revenues declined 13% [ph] due to lower levels of heavy- and medium-duty truck production in North America. Off-highway revenues declined 6% due to continued weak global demand. Segment EBIT was $89 million or 4.8% of sales, which included the $99 million charge to increase our estimate for the loss contingency previously disclosed. Excluding this additional provision, the Engine segment EBIT was 10.1% of sales compared to 10.3% in the third quarter of last year.
Material cost savings, warranty and benefits and previous restructuring actions partially offset the negative impact of lower volumes and an unfavorable product mix.
For full year 2016, we now expect Engine segment revenues to be down 11% from 2015 levels, primarily due to weaker truck production in North America compared to our guidance 3 months ago for sales to decline between 9% and 12%. EBIT margins for 2016 are now expected to be 8.75% when taking into account the $99 million loss contingency charge [indiscernible] prior guidance of 10% to 11%.
For Distribution segment, third quarter revenues were $1.5 billion, down 3% compared to last year. The decrease was driven by a 5% decline in organic sales and a 1% unfavorable impact from a stronger U.S. dollar, which were partially offset by a 3% increase in revenue from acquisition made a year ago. The EBIT margin for the quarter was $96 million or 6.4% of sales, a decrease from 7.9% a year ago, mainly due to the fair market value gains recorded on distributor acquisition in the third quarter of 2015 and from the impact of negative foreign currency movements.
At the beginning of October, we completed the acquisition of the last remaining unconsolidated North American distributor pick, bringing the acquisition to 13, since we announced the plan in September of 2013.
We now expect full year revenue to decline 1% compared to last year as additional revenue from acquisition will help to offset weak demand for industrial engines and power generation equipment as well as the headwinds from foreign currency movements. We expect full year EBIT margins to be 6% at the midpoint of our previous guidance range.
For the Components segment, revenues were $1.1 billion, a decline of 8% from a year ago. Sales in North America declined 16% as industry production in on-highway markets decline. International sales increased 7%, with a 37% increase in sales in China more than offsetting weaker revenues in Europe.
Despite the lower sales, gross margins improved by 80 basis points as material cost reductions and benefits from restructuring more than offset the negative impact of weaker volumes. Segment EBIT was $148 million or 12.9% of sales compared to 12.6% of sales a year ago.
We expect full year revenue in 2016 to decline by 8%, and EBIT to be 13.25%, consistent with the midpoint of our previous guidance. 
In the Power System segment, third quarter revenues were $856 million, down 13% from a year ago. Power Generation equipment sales declined 12% due to lower demand especially in the Middle East and in Asia. Sales to industrial high-horsepower engine markets declined by 15% as weak demand continues in oil and gas, marine and Mining markets.
EBIT margins were 6.9% in the quarter, down from 7.5% last year, which equates to a decremental EBIT margin of 12%. Material cost reductions, lower costs following the 2015 restructuring actions and the benefits from a weaker British pound helped offset the impact from lower volumes and joint venture earnings. We now expect full year revenues for the Power System segment to decline by 14% compared to our previous guidance of down 12% to 14% and full year EBIT to be 7.5% of sales at the midpoint of our prior guidance.
We are now projecting total company revenues to be down 9% in 2016, consistent with our prior guidance of down 8% to 10% as we face a 31% decline in industry production of heavy-duty trucks in North America and very weak global demand for industrial engines and Power Generation equipment.
We expect EBIT margins to be 11.3% of sales this year, including the charges related to the loss contingency incurred during the year, representing full year decremental EBIT margins of 25%.
We now expect the full year effective tax rate to be 25.5% and to deliver earnings per share of approximately $8 per diluted share this year.
Turning to cash flow. Cash generated from operating activities in the quarter was $576 million, $14 million higher than last year. For the first 9 months of the year, operating cash flow is $1.3 billion, up from $1.1 billion for the same period in 2015. 
Working capital levels of $482 million were 11% lower than this time last year. And we anticipate operating cash flow in 2016 will be around $2 billion, similar to 2015 levels despite a 9% drop in revenues.
Capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $550 million to $600 million in 2016, and we still plan to return 75% of operating cash flow to shareholders this year through a combination of dividends and share repurchases, having returned $1.3 billion year-to-date. And as you know, we increased the dividend by 5% during the third quarter. And year-to-date, have repurchased 7 million shares. 
Now I'll turn it back over to Mark."

So as you alluded to, it's a unique situation our engine with third-party aftertreatment. So the only one we have kind of in the company. What we did here in this quarter was we increased the accrual for a second population of vehicles. And so there -- as we did some additional testing, we now found that this second population is going to need to have a recall also. So that was the increase that you saw in Q3. So now we have -- the population is set. We estimated the cost of those accruals -- of those recalls, and that's what's reflected in our numbers. What we have not concluded is the commercial negotiations with the OEM customer. And so while we don't expect the final outcome to be much materially higher, in fact, could be lower. As far as your ongoing kind of what was implied in there is there more to come, I guess, is maybe what you were also asking. What we have is there are 3 populations, and we have accrued for 2 of those. The third population we have not accrued for, and it's a different cycle that's involved in this third population. It has a different emission standard that's, in fact, higher than this. And third, we have concluded our emissions test, and all emission tests to date have passed. And so that third population is similar in size to the other 2 that we have taken an accrual on. And of course, we're adjusting all the agreements going forward so for the ongoing issue. And I guess lastly, and implied but the fix has been put in place for sometime. So the production -- the products being shipped today do not have these issues. We're talking about a fixed amount that, unfortunately, we had to come back to a couple of times. I guess one last thing, just to maybe close this out is -- in fact, the product that we're talking about is doing terrific. And we're actually gaining sales, gaining share. Out at the plant, the producers of engine yesterday we're in process of taking up production at the end of the year to meet increased demand. So it's an unfortunate situation, it's disappointing, it's complex, it's unique, but at this point, we've accrued for kind of all the known issues and that will kind of move in the commercial negotiations to try to finish that one up to come."

And while we may see some bottoming, we don't have an instigator for significant growth directly in front of us. So our view is given that we've been in this for a couple of years now, the right posture for the company to take is to assume relatively weak markets, set our cost structure accordingly, find opportunities for cost savings, productivity gains and then continue to invest in those opportunities where we think markets could improve and we'll be able to gain share and gain business equity. So for example in China, you've seen us have a pretty aggressive posture on new product launch and on share gain. And so if and when China starts to improve next year, if it did, we will be positioned well to take advantage of it. Of course in Brazil, we love to hear it. It's a very, very weak market. We have very strong position in Brazil. We're ready to ramp up when the market's ready. Again whether it's going to ramp up in 2017, I just don't know.

But I will say that we are capacity wise, new product wise, market leadership wise, if markets go up, we will benefit more than anybody. We are positioned incredibly well for that, but we are also prepared if it doesn't turn out to do better than anybody else. And that's really as a management team all we could do is be ready for both because we just don't know whether it's our turn around and went. But as you know, our order lead time is very short.

As you've heard me say about that in the past, I think that while we've done a really good job on reducing costs in light of our segments, I do believe over the last several years we have chased the PowerGen market down as opposed to getting in front of it. And I'm disappointed in that for that reason, but I believe that we made a step early this year that is really helping us get ahead of that and find new ways to establish productivity and further reduce costs. And that was by combining our large Engine business with our gen set business. What that's brought to us is a new opportunity for both how we do production, how we consolidate production and therefore take steps out of production, whether it's supply chain, whether its inventory, which again means we end up holding less stuff, we end up holding less stuff that we don't -- we can't sell, et cetera. And then also, our new product development process, we're able to streamline that to make sure that we're ready with the products that we launch the engine producers that wanted the genset ones [ph], and we don't produce stuff that we don't need, we don't generate new products we're not going to use. So I feel like both of those -- both in terms of efficiency, cost and asset utilization, will continue to improve. We got one of our best leaders leading the group. So I think over the next year or 2, not only do I feel like we're starting to reach the bottom in some of the markets, I feel that we've got some renewed opportunities for cost reduction to further improve margins in that area. Now again, I thought that before so it's really great to talk about we got to do is deliver. No one here is confused about that."

It does seem like we've been in the down cycle for a while, to your point and frankly, longer than we have seen in the past, which is frustrating. So obviously, we're in the discussion earlier from David, we'd like to see some of the things turn back. We just haven't seen yet signs that they're turning back. And of course, Power Generation reflects a couple of things. One, in emerging markets, it reflects infrastructure building and general economic growth, where margin start get under threat and things like that. And then it reflects non-res capital spending in some of the more mature markets where we're selling standby. And again, while nonres capital spending isn't a disaster in the U.S. and our business isn't a disaster, both those statistics across the world are [indiscernible]. So our view is where we start to see turn around PowerGen is what we start to see infrastructure spending starting to come back in some of these emerging markets across the world and then we see nonres capital spending coming back more aggressively in some of the more advanced countries. And we just -- right now, that's not just obvious when that happens. So as we were talking about, we're prepared to be at levels like we are now, a little better, little worse. And we're finding ways to get more money out of our business at those levels. We're completely ready for when it turns around to gain a lot of growth but also gain profitability improvements.

And we're in that -- that's the mode we're in right now. I don't have quite the miles that I need to make a trade out in the trucks and engines are really good out there. So you can stretch a little more out of it. And lead time was really low. So I need one, I can get it quickly. As we look at it, I see fundamental business is not bad, and so that we're maybe moving towards where retail orders are getting close to trough. I still think though from a production standpoint, there's a step down still in there, which is what we've assumed. If you run our numbers, we've said steps down in Q4 and quite frankly, I think will continue into Q1 on the production side. And so retail orders getting close to trough, production there's always a bit of lag there and we've seen -- and again that's what we've seen in other cycles, especially towards year-end.

Not just from discounting but they did take some old products and finally launched some new products. So by the way, never going to stop.

Pat will then take you through more details of both our third quarter financial performance and our forecast for the year.
Revenues for the third quarter were $4.2 billion, a decrease of 9% compared to the third quarter of 2015. Third quarter EBIT was $398 million or 9.5% of sales compared to $577 million or 12.5% in the same quarter last year. 
Our results this quarter include a $99 million increase in accrual for a loss contingency. As we have disclosed in prior quarters, the loss contingency relates to the cost of the campaign to remedy quality issues with aftertreatment systems sourced by one of our OEM customers from a third party and paired with our engines in the OEM vehicles. The combination of a Cummins Engine with a third-party aftertreatment system is unique to this particular OEM.
We increased our accrual in the third quarter to reflect recent testing results after indicate that similar quality issues are impacting a second population of vehicles manufactured by the same OEM. We have accrued the expected cost of the campaign, but final resolution of cost sharing with our OEM customer has not been finalized. All parties are committed to supporting the vehicle owners, and the agreed plant to replace the aftertreatment systems is currently being executed. 
Excluding the loss contingency, we delivered decremental EBIT margins of 23% in the third quarter, better than our target of 25%, reflecting strong operational performance in the face of very weak markets. Benefits from the restructuring actions we initiated in the fourth quarter of 2015, strong execution on material cost-reduction initiatives and productivity gains all helped to mitigate the impact of lower volumes in the third quarter.
Engine business revenues decreased by 12% year-over-year, primarily due to lower industry production of heavy- and medium-duty trucks in North America. Earnings before interest and tax was 4.8% of sales, down from 10.3% a year ago. Excluding the loss contingency, EBIT was 10.1% compared to 10.3% a year ago.  Restructuring benefits, material cost reduction and lower warranty costs all contributed to the strong operating results. 
Revenues in our Components segment decreased 8% from a year ago, with lower demand in North America more than offsetting growth in China. Sales in China increased by 37% as demand for our products continues to outpace end-market growth. Despite the lower sales, EBIT percent improved from 12.6% to 12.9% as strong execution of our cost-reduction programs more than offset the impact of weaker volumes.
Distribution revenues decreased 3% compared to the third quarter of 2015. The positive impact of acquisitions made in the second half of 2015 were more than offset by the negative impact of currency and weaker sales to off-highway markets. The Distribution business' EBIT for the quarter was 6.4%, down from 7.9% a year ago as results last year benefiting from gains on the acquisition of 3 distributor joint ventures. The positive impact of operational improvement and increased pricing were offset by the negative impact of currency.
Revenues for the Power Systems business declined by 13% year-over-year, with lower sales in most regions due to weaker demand in Power Generation, commercial marine and oil and gas markets. EBIT declined from 7.5% to 6.9%, with decremental EBIT margin just 12%, due in part to a 15% reduction in operating expenses in the business.
Now I'll comment on some of our key markets, starting with North America. Our revenues in North America declined by 13% in the third quarter due to weaker demand in on-highway markets especially heavy-duty trucks. We shipped 16,400 engines to the North American heavy-duty market in the third quarter, a decrease of 33% from a year ago. Our market share improved from the second quarter of this year and stands at 31% year-to-date. We are forecasting full year industry production to be 200,000 units and our market share to be in the range of 27% to 30%, unchanged from our projections 3 months ago.
Frost and Sullivan recently recognized Cummins as the leading supplier of heavy-duty engines to the U.S. heavy-duty truck market, reflecting the results of its extensive survey of both truck fleets and of owner operators.
In the medium-duty truck market, we delivered approximately 18,000 engines in the third quarter, down 20% from last year. Our market share through the end of August was 73%, within the range of our full-year guidance of between 72% to 75%. Industry production dipped sharply in the third quarter and is not expected to improve in the fourth quarter. And as a result, we have lowered our full year forecast of market size to 108,000 units from 117,000 units 3 months ago.
Our engine shipments to North American pickup truck customers increased by 2% in the third quarter. Shipments to Chrysler declined by 11% due to planned production changes at Chrysler plants, but were more than offset by shipments of our V8 engine to Nissan, which we launched in the fourth quarter of last year. We currently expect our revenues in the pickup segment to increase by 10% in 2016, down a little from our prior forecast of 12% growth.
Our Engine revenues in North American construction market decreased by 21% compared to the third quarter of last year. While housing and commercial construction activity remains positive, weaker demand in the oil and gas market has led to an excess supply of used equipment. 
Power Systems revenues declined 8% in North America in the third quarter due primarily to lower engine orders from oil and gas and mining customers.
Our international revenues declined by 3% year-over-year, driven by lower sales in the Middle East and Africa, which more than offset growth in China. Weak commodity prices and slowing economic activity negatively impacted demand for Power Generation equipment in the Middle East and Africa.
Third quarter revenues in China, including joint ventures, were $826 million, an increase of 6% due to growth in on-highway and construction revenues. Industry demand for heavy- and medium-duty trucks in China increased by 30% in the third quarter. Our market share in the third quarter was 16.5%, up from the second quarter but down from 17.9% a year ago.
Some OEMs have been aggressively discounting trucks this year to gain share in the near term while our partner, Dongfeng, has experienced a decline in the market share. We expect our full year Engine's market share to be 16% compared to 16.4% in 2015.
We now project full year industry sales to increase 16% to 870,000 units this year, up from our prior forecast of 820,000 units or 9% growth.
Shipment of our light-duty engines in China grew 23% in the third quarter compared to a 3% increase for the overall market as we increased penetration at Foton, displacing local competitor engines. Our share of the overall market was 7.7%, up 120 basis points year-over-year. We currently project industry sales to decline by 4% for the year, unchanged from 3 months ago. Industry sales of excavators in China increased by 43% in the third quarter, and our volumes more than doubled off a very small base due to stronger investment in real estate, driving uptick in equipment demand. While this was a nice increase, construction equipment markets in China are still very weak in historical terms.
Revenues for our Power Systems business in China declined by 11% in the third quarter, reflecting weak demand in Marine, mining and power generation markets. Full year revenues in China across all segments, including joint ventures, are expected to grow 4% for the year, up from our prior forecast of 3% due to stronger demand in the heavy- and medium-duty truck market. Third quarter revenues in India, including joint ventures, were $376 million and flat year-over-year, with lower on-highway volumes offsetting growth in Power Generation, construction and aftermarket revenues. Industry truck production dropped by 17% compared to a year ago, after a very strong first half of the year.
Truck OEMs lowered build rates to reduce inventories as sales slowed in the third quarter. For the full year, we now forecast industry truck production to be 340,000 units, up 6% year-over-year, but down from our prior forecast of 370,000 units. We currently project our market share to be 41%, up from 40% in 2015.
We currently project full year revenues across all segments in India and including joint ventures to increase 5%, consistent with our prior forecast. Strong demand in construction and improving demand in Power Generation are expected to offset the weaker outlook for trucks.
Third quarter revenues in Brazil were $85 million, up 9% from the third quarter last year, reflecting a modest improvement in sales to on-highway markets. Our shipments of engines to truck customers increased 5% while overall industry truck production declined by 14% year-over-year. We project full year industry truck production to decline by 20%, unchanged from 3 months ago.
Our sales in the Middle East declined by 12% in the third quarter, primarily impacting our Power Systems business and reflecting weakness in infrastructure investment in the region.
As a result of the slowed pace of growth in the global economy, we continue to face persistently weak demand in a number of our largest markets. Our restructuring and other cost-reduction initiatives are helping to maintain EBIT margins well above trough levels from pre -- prior cycles. In addition to reducing costs and improving productivity, we've also continued to invest in our business to improve our competitive position throughout this protracted downturn. 
In the fourth quarter, we will acquire our last remaining distributor joint venture in North America, completing the strategic initiative that we announced in 2013 and allowing us to improve the consistency and quality of our service and support to our customers wherever they operate.
We've also continued to invest in new products. For example, we're growing sales and market share with our new QSK95 engine even in extremely challenging markets. We currently expect our full year sales to decline by 9%, consistent with our prior guidance. EBIT percent is now expected to be 11.3%, down from our prior guidance of 11.6% to 12.2%, largely as a result of the increased accrual from the loss contingency in the Engine business. Our EBIT expectations for the Components, Distribution and Power Systems businesses are all unchanged from 3 months ago. We remain on track to deliver our goal of 25% decremental EBIT margin for the whole year of 2016.
So far this year, we have returned $1.3 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, consistent with our plan to return 75% of operating cash flow to shareholders. 
Thank you for your interest today. And now I'll turn it over to Pat, who will cover our third quarter results and full year guidance in more detail."

Third quarter revenues were $4.2 billion, a decrease of 9% from a year ago.
Sales in North America, which represented 59% of our third quarter revenues, declined 13% from last year due primarily to lower demand in heavy- and medium-duty truck markets and declines in power generation and industrial engine sales.
International sales declined by 3% from a year ago as increased sales in China helped to offset weaker demand in both the Middle East and in Africa.
Despite the 9% decline in revenues, gross margins of 25.8% of sales were only down 30 basis points from last year with material cost savings, productivity improvements and the benefits from the restructuring actions helping offset the negative impact from lowered volumes and an unfavorable product mix.
Selling, admin and research and development costs of $670 million or 16% of sales decreased by $57 million year-over-year, mainly due to restructuring actions executed in the fourth quarter of 2015 and lower spending for research and development projects, but did increase as a percent of sales by 30 basis points.
Joint venture income of $74 million decreased $4 million compared to a year ago, primarily due to lower earnings in Power Systems, joint ventures and the acquisition of North American distributors previously held as unconsolidated joint ventures.
Earnings before interest and tax were $398 million or 9.5% of sales for the quarter compared to 12.5% a year ago. Included in the quarter was an additional $99 million charge related to the previously disclosed loss contingency, as Tom just discussed. Excluding this charge, our decremental EBIT margin was 23% compared to the same quarter last year, slightly better than the 25% that we previously committed to.
We are benefiting from a lower cost structure due to the actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2015 and strong execution on material cost-reduction programs and productivity improvements. Net earnings for the quarter were $289 million or $1.72 per diluted share with the increased accrual for the loss contingency net of compensation reducing diluted earnings per share by $0.30.
Net income in the third quarter of 2015 was $380 million or $2.14 per diluted share. Effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.5%, lower than a year ago primarily due to changes in the geographical mix of pretax income. I will now highlight the performance of the individual operating segments during the third quarter and provide updated guidance for the full year.
In the Engine segment, revenues were $1.9 billion, a decrease of 12% from last year. On-highway, revenues declined 13% due to lower levels of heavy- and medium-duty truck production in North America. Off-highway revenues declined 6% due to continued weak global demand. Segment EBIT was $89 million or 4.8% of sales, which included the $99 million charge to increase our estimate for the loss contingency previously disclosed. Excluding this additional provision, the Engine segment EBIT was 10.1% of sales compared to 10.3% in the third quarter of last year.
Material cost savings, warranty expense and benefits from previous restructuring actions partially offset the negative impact of lower volumes and an unfavorable product mix.
For full year 2016, we now expect Engine segment revenues to be down 11% from 2015 levels, primarily due to weaker truck production in North America compared to our guidance 3 months ago for sales to decline between 9% and 12%. EBIT margins for 2016 are now expected to be 8.75% when taking into account the $99 million loss contingency charge than from a prior guidance of 10% to 11%.
For Distribution segment, third quarter revenues were $1.5 billion, down 3% compared to last year. The decrease was driven by a 5% decline in organic sales and a 1% unfavorable impact from a stronger U.S. dollar, which were partially offset by a 3% increase in revenue from acquisitions made a year ago. The EBIT margin for the quarter was $96 million or 6.4% of sales, a decrease from 7.9% a year ago, mainly due to the fair market value gains recorded on distributor acquisition in the third quarter of 2015 and from the impact of negative foreign currency movements.
At the beginning of October, we completed the acquisition of the last remaining unconsolidated North American distributor, bringing the total acquisitions to 13, since we announced the plan in September of 2013.
We now expect full year revenue to decline 1% compared to last year as additional revenue from acquisition will help to offset weak demand for industrial engines and power generation equipment as well as the headwinds from foreign currency movements. We expect full year EBIT margins to be 6% at the midpoint of our previous guidance range.
For the Components segment, revenues were $1.1 billion, a decline of 8% from a year ago. Sales in North America declined 16% as industry production in on-highway markets declined. International sales increased 7%, with a 37% increase in sales in China, more than offsetting weaker revenues in Europe.
Despite the lower sales, gross margins improved by 80 basis points as material cost reductions and benefits from restructuring more than offset the negative impact of weaker volumes. Segment EBIT was $148 million or 12.9% of sales compared to 12.6% of sales a year ago.
We expect full year revenue in 2016 to decline by 8% and EBIT to be 13.25%, consistent with the midpoint of our previous guidance. 
In the Power Systems segment, third quarter revenues were $856 million, down 13% from a year ago. Power Generation equipment sales declined 12% due to lower demand especially in the Middle East and in Asia. Sales to industrial high-horsepower engine markets declined by 15% as weak demand continues in oil and gas, marine and mining markets.
EBIT margins were 6.9% in the quarter, down from 7.5% last year, which equates to a decremental EBIT margin of 12%. Material cost reductions, lower costs following the 2015 restructuring actions and the benefits from a weaker British pound helped offset the impact from lower volumes and joint venture earnings. We now expect full year revenues for the Power Systems segment to decline by 14% compared to our previous guidance of down 12% to 14% and full year EBIT to be 7.5% of sales at the midpoint of our prior guidance.
We are now projecting total company revenues to be down 9% in 2016, consistent with our prior guidance of down 8% to 10% as we face a 31% decline in industry production of heavy-duty trucks in North America and very weak global demand for industrial engines and Power Generation equipment.
We expect EBIT margins to be 11.3% of sales this year, including the charges related to the loss contingency incurred during the year, representing full year decremental EBIT margins of 25%. We now expect a full year effective tax rate to be 25.5% and to deliver earnings per share of approximately $8 per diluted share this year.
Turning to cash flow. Cash generated from operating activities in the quarter was $576 million, $14 million higher than last year. For the first 9 months of the year, operating cash flow is $1.3 billion, up from $1.1 billion for the same period in 2015. 
Working capital levels of $482 million or 11% lower than this time last year. And we anticipate operating cash flow in 2016 will be around $2 billion, similar to 2015 levels despite a 9% drop in revenues.
Capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $550 million to $600 million in 2016, and we still plan to return 75% of operating cash flow to shareholders this year through a combination of dividends and share repurchases, having returned $1.3 billion year-to-date. And as you know, we increased the dividend by 5% during the third quarter, and year-to-date, have repurchased 7 million shares.

So as you alluded to, it's a unique situation where we've got engine with the third-party aftertreatment, so it's the only one we have kind of in the company. What we did here in this quarter was we increased the accrual for a second population of vehicles. And so there -- as we did some additional testing, we now found that this second population is going to need to have a recall also. So that was the increase that you saw in Q3. So now we have -- the population is set. We estimated the cost of those accruals -- of those recalls and that's what's reflected in our numbers. What we have not concluded is the commercial negotiations with the OEM customer. And so while we don't expect the final outcome to be materially higher effect, it could be lower. As far as your ongoing kind of what was implied in there is the more to come, I guess, is maybe what you were also asking. What we have is there, there are 3 populations, and we have accrued for 2 of those. The third population we have not accrued for, and it's a different duty cycle that's involved in this third population. It has a different emission standard that's, in fact, higher than this. And third, we have concluded our emissions test, and all emission tests, to date, have passed. And so the third population is similar in size to the other 2 that we have taken an accrual on. And of course, we're adjusting all the agreements going forward so for the ongoing issue. And I guess lastly, maybe it's implied, but the fix has been put in place for some time. So the production -- the products being shipped today does not have this issue. We're talking about as a fixed amount that, unfortunately, we had to come back to a couple of times. I guess one last thing, just to maybe close this out is, in fact, the product that we're talking about is doing terrific. And we are actually gaining sales, gaining share out at the plant the producers of engine yesterday. We're in the process of taking up production at the end of the year to meet increased demand. So it's an unfortunate situation, it's disappointing, it's complex, it's unique, but at this point, we've accrued for kind of all the known issues and then we'll kind of move into the commercial negotiations to try to finish that one up to come."

So we will be targeting the gain share in different markets where we think that opportunity exists, and we will be investing to do so.

And while we may see some bottoming, we don't have an instigator for a significant growth directly in front of us. So our view is given that we've been in this for a couple of years now, the right posture for the company to take is to assume relatively weak markets, set our cost structure accordingly, find opportunities for cost savings, productivity gains and then continue to invest in those opportunities where we think markets could improve, and we'll be able to gain share and gain business accordingly. So for example, in China, you've seen us have a pretty aggressive posture on new product launch and on share gain. And so if and when China starts to improve next year, if it did, we would be positioned well to take advantage of it. Of course, in Brazil, we'd love to hear it. It's a very, very weak market.

I mean, as you've heard me special explanation about that in the past that I think while we've done a really good job on reducing costs in a lot of our segments I do believe over the last several years, we have chased the PowerGen market down as opposed to getting in front of it. And I'm disappointed in that for that reason, but I believe that we made a step early this year that is really helping us get ahead of that and find new ways to establish productivity and further reduce costs and that was by combining our large Engine business with our gen set business. What that's brought to us there's some new opportunities for both how we do production, how we consolidate production, and therefore, take steps out of production, reduce supply chain, reduce inventory, which, again, means, as markets vary, we end up holding less stuff, we end up holding less stuff that we don't -- we can't sell, et cetera. And then also, our new product development process, we're able to streamline that to make sure that we're ready with the products that we want because engine produces the one that the gen set wants, and we don't produce stuff that we don't need, we don't generate new products that we're not going to use. So I feel like both of those -- both in terms of efficiency, cost and asset utilization, will continue to improve. We got one of our best leaders leading the group. So I think over the next year or 2, not only do I feel like we're starting to reach bottoms in some of the markets. I feel like we've got some renewed opportunities for cost reduction to further improve margins in that area. Now again, I thought that before, so it's really great to talk about what we got to do is deliver. No one here is confused about that."

I think, Richard has already shared this one, but has it only been 5 years because it feels like a decade. It does seem like we've been in the down cycle for a while, to your point, and frankly longer than we have seen in the past, which is frustrating. So obviously, we're kind of did a discussion earlier from David, we'd like to see some of the things turn back. We just haven't seen yet signs that they're turning back. And of course, Power Generation reflects a couple of things. One, in emerging markets, it reflects infrastructure building and general economic growth, where reserve margins start to get under threat and things like that. And then it reflects nonres capital spending in some of the more mature markets where we're selling standby. And again, while nonres capital spending isn't a disaster in the U.S. and our business isn't a disaster, both of those statistics probably across the world are still [indiscernible]. So our view is that where we start to see turn around in PowerGen is when we start to see infrastructure spending starting to come back in some of these emerging markets across the world and then we see nonres capital spending coming back more aggressively in some of the more advanced countries. And we just -- right now, that's just not obvious one that happens. So as we are talking about, we're prepared to be at levels like we are now a little better or little worse. And we're finding ways to get more money out of our business at those levels. We are completely ready for when it turns around to gain a lot of to gain growth but also gain profitability improvements. So there's no question about that. But right now, I would just say we are approaching it conservatively. We'll see what happens. And Rich, I'll let you talk about some of the other large engine markets."

There's no sign of a pickup out there right now. I think you have a situation is for many, many months we're still producing more than orders that are coming in, and that hasn't changed because the backlog is down at 85,000, which is kind of the forward order board. And we're hearing from lots and lots of fleets that while business is [indiscernible] they're a little nervous on business, they're delaying purchases. So how do I stretch assets out a little bit? And we're in that -- that's the mode we're in right now. I don't have quite the miles that I need to make a trade out in the trucks and engines are really good out there. So you can stretch a little more out of it. And the lead time is really low. So if I need one, I can get it quickly. As we look at it, I see that fundamental business is not bad, and so that we're maybe moving towards where retail orders are getting close to trough. I still think though from a production standpoint, there's a step down still in there, which is what we've assumed. If you run our numbers that says, we had steps down in Q4, and quite frankly, I think would continue into Q1 on the production side. And so retail orders getting close to trough. Production, there is always a bit of a lag there. And that's what we've seen -- again, that's what we've seen in other cycles, especially towards year-end. The folks take a bit of a shut down as they end the year and they start the year up. We're planning for that kind of step down in production. Now whether it actually happens or not or when it happens, what quarter, but that's how we're thinking about it kind of right now."

I will start with a summary of our third quarter results and provide an update on our outlook for the full year. Pat will then take you through more details of both our third quarter financial performance and our forecast for the year.
Revenues for the third quarter were $4.2 billion, a decrease of 9% compared to the third quarter of 2015. Third quarter EBIT was $398 million or 9.5% of sales compared to $577 million or 12.5% in the same quarter last year. 
Our results this quarter include a $99 million increase in accrual for a loss contingency. As we have disclosed in prior quarters, the loss contingency relates to the cost of the campaign to remedy quality issues with aftertreatment systems sourced by one of our OEM customers from a third party and paired with our engines in the OEM vehicles. The combination of a Cummins Engine with a third-party aftertreatment system is unique to this particular OEM.
We increased our accrual in the third quarter to reflect recent testing results that indicate that similar quality issues are impacting a second population of vehicles manufactured by the same OEM. We have accrued the expected cost of the campaign, but final resolution of cost sharing with our OEM customer has not been finalized. All parties are committed to supporting the vehicle owners, and the agreed plan to replace the aftertreatment systems is currently being executed. 
Excluding the loss contingency, we delivered decremental EBIT margins of 23% in the third quarter, better than our target of 25%, reflecting strong operational performance in the face of very weak markets. Benefits from the restructuring actions we initiated in the fourth quarter of 2015, strong execution on material cost-reduction initiatives and productivity gains all helped to mitigate the impact of lower volumes in the third quarter.
Engine business revenues decreased by 12% year-over-year, primarily due to lower industry production of heavy- and medium-duty trucks in North America. Earnings before interest and tax was 4.8% of sales, down from 10.3% a year ago. Excluding the loss contingency, EBIT was 10.1% compared to 10.3% a year ago. Restructuring benefits, material cost reduction and lower warranty costs all contributed to the strong operating results. 
Revenues in our Components segment decreased 8% from a year ago, with lower demand in North America more than offsetting growth in China. Sales in China increased by 37% as demand for our products continues to outpace end-market growth. Despite the lower sales, EBIT percent improved from 12.6% to 12.9% as strong execution of our cost-reduction programs more than offset the impact of weaker volumes.
Distribution revenues decreased 3% compared to the third quarter of 2015. The positive impact of acquisitions made in the second half of 2015 were more than offset by the negative impact of currency and weaker sales to off-highway markets. The Distribution business' EBIT for the quarter was 6.4%, down from 7.9% a year ago with results last year benefiting from gains on the acquisition of 3 distributor joint ventures. The positive impact of operational improvement and increased pricing were offset by the negative impact of currency.
Revenues for the Power Systems business declined by 13% year-over-year, with lower sales in most regions due to weaker demand in Power Generation, commercial marine and oil and gas markets. EBIT declined from 7.5% to 6.9%, with decremental EBIT margin just 12%, due in part to a 15% reduction in operating expenses in the business.
Now I'll comment on some of our key markets, starting with North America. Our revenues in North America declined by 13% in the third quarter due to weaker demand in on-highway markets especially heavy-duty trucks. We shipped 16,400 engines to the North American heavy-duty market in the third quarter, a decrease of 33% from a year ago. Our market share improved from the second quarter of this year and stands at 31% year-to-date. We are forecasting full year industry production to be 200,000 units and our market share to be in the range of 27% to 30%, unchanged from our projections 3 months ago.
Frost & Sullivan recently recognized Cummins as the leading supplier of heavy-duty engines to the U.S. heavy-duty truck market, reflecting the results of its extensive survey of both truck fleets and of owner operators.
In the medium-duty truck market, we delivered approximately 18,000 engines in the third quarter, down 20% from last year. Our market share through the end of August was 73%, within the range of our full-year guidance of between 72% to 75%. Industry production dipped sharply in the third quarter and is not expected to improve in the fourth quarter. And as a result, we have lowered our full year forecast of market size to 108,000 units from 117,000 units 3 months ago.
Our engine shipments to North American pickup truck customers increased by 2% in the third quarter. Shipments to Chrysler declined by 11% due to planned production changes at Chrysler plants, but were more than offset by shipments of our V8 engine to Nissan, which we launched in the fourth quarter of last year. We currently expect our revenues in the pickup segment to increase by 10% in 2016, down a little from our prior forecast of 12% growth.
Our Engine revenues in North American construction market decreased by 21% compared to the third quarter of last year. While housing and commercial construction activity remains positive, weaker demand in the oil and gas market has led to an excess supply of used equipment. 
Power Systems revenues declined 8% in North America in the third quarter due primarily to lower engine orders from oil and gas and mining customers.
Our international revenues declined by 3% year-over-year, driven by lower sales in the Middle East and Africa, which more than offset growth in China. Weak commodity prices and slowing economic activity negatively impacted demand for Power Generation equipment in the Middle East and Africa.
Third quarter revenues in China, including joint ventures, were $826 million, an increase of 6% due to growth in on-highway and construction revenues. Industry demand for heavy- and medium-duty trucks in China increased by 30% in the third quarter. Our market share in the third quarter was 16.5%, up from the second quarter but down from 17.9% a year ago.
Some OEMs have been aggressively discounting trucks this year to gain share in the near term while our partner, Dongfeng, has experienced a decline in the market share. We expect our full year Engines market share to be 16% compared to 16.4% in 2015.
We now project full year industry sales to increase 16% to 870,000 units this year, up from our prior forecast of 820,000 units or 9% growth.
Shipment of our light-duty engines in China grew 23% in the third quarter compared to a 3% increase for the overall market as we increased penetration at Foton, displacing local competitor engines. Our share of the overall market was 7.7%, up 120 basis points year-over-year. We currently project industry sales to decline by 4% for the year, unchanged from 3 months ago. Industry sales of excavators in China increased by 43% in the third quarter, and our volumes more than doubled off a very small base due to stronger investment in real estate, driving uptick in equipment demand. While this was a nice increase, construction equipment markets in China are still very weak in historical terms.
Revenues for our Power Systems business in China declined by 11% in the third quarter, reflecting weak demand in Marine, mining and power generation markets. Full year revenues in China across all segments, including joint ventures, are expected to grow 4% for the year, up from our prior forecast of 3% due to stronger demand in the heavy- and medium-duty truck market. Third quarter revenues in India, including joint ventures, were $376 million and flat year-over-year, with lower on-highway volumes offsetting growth in Power Generation, construction and aftermarket revenues. Industry truck production dropped by 17% compared to a year ago, after a very strong first half of the year.
Truck OEMs lowered build rates to reduce inventories as sales slowed in the third quarter. For the full year, we now forecast industry truck production to be 340,000 units, up 6% year-over-year, but down from our prior forecast of 370,000 units. We currently project our market share to be 41%, up from 40% in 2015.
We currently project full year revenues across all segments in India and including joint ventures to increase 5%, consistent with our prior forecast. Strong demand in construction and improving demand in Power Generation are expected to offset the weaker outlook for trucks.
Third quarter revenues in Brazil were $85 million, up 9% from the third quarter last year, reflecting a modest improvement in sales to on-highway markets. Our shipments of engines to truck customers increased 5% while overall industry truck production declined by 14% year-over-year. We project full year industry truck production to decline by 20%, unchanged from 3 months ago.
Our sales in the Middle East declined by 12% in the third quarter, primarily impacting our Power Systems business and reflecting weakness in infrastructure investment in the region.
As a result of the slowed pace of growth in the global economy, we continue to face persistently weak demand in a number of our largest markets. Our restructuring and other cost-reduction initiatives are helping to maintain EBIT margins well above trough levels from pre -- prior cycles. In addition to reducing costs and improving productivity, we've also continued to invest in our business to improve our competitive position throughout this protracted downturn. 
In the fourth quarter, we will acquire our last remaining distributor joint venture in North America, completing the strategic initiative that we announced in 2013 and allowing us to improve the consistency and quality of our service and support to our customers wherever they operate.
We've also continued to invest in new products. For example, we're growing sales and market share with our new QSK95 engine even in extremely challenging markets. We currently expect our full year sales to decline by 9%, consistent with our prior guidance. EBIT percent is now expected to be 11.3%, down from our prior guidance of 11.6% to 12.2%, largely as a result of the increased accrual from the loss contingency in the Engine business. Our EBIT expectations for the Components, Distribution and Power Systems businesses are all unchanged from 3 months ago. We remain on track to deliver our goal of 25% decremental EBIT margin for the full year of 2016.
So far this year, we have returned $1.3 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, consistent with our plan to return 75% of operating cash flow to shareholders. 
Thank you for your interest today. And now I'll turn it over to Pat, who will cover our third quarter results and full year guidance in more detail."

Third quarter revenues were $4.2 billion, a decrease of 9% from a year ago.Sales in North America, which represented 59% of our third quarter revenues, declined 13% from last year due primarily to lower demand",1312,"Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Third quarter revenues were $4.2 billion, a decrease of 9% from a year ago.
Sales in North America, which represented 59% of our third quarter revenues, declined 13% from last year due primarily to lower demand in heavy- and medium-duty truck markets and declines in power generation and industrial engine sales.
International sales declined by 3% from a year ago as increased sales in China helped to offset weaker demand in both the Middle East and in Africa.
Despite the 9% decline in revenues, gross margins of 25.8% of sales were only down 30 basis points from last year with material cost savings, productivity improvements and the benefits from the restructuring actions helping offset the negative impact from lower volumes and an unfavorable product mix.
Selling, admin and research and development costs of $670 million or 16% of sales decreased by $57 million year-over-year, mainly due to restructuring actions executed in the fourth quarter of 2015 and lower spending for research and development projects, but did increase as a percent of sales by 30 basis points.
Joint venture income of $74 million decreased $4 million compared to a year ago, primarily due to lower earnings in Power Systems, joint ventures and the acquisition of North American distributors previously held as unconsolidated joint ventures.
Earnings before interest and tax were $398 million or 9.5% of sales for the quarter compared to 12.5% a year ago. Included in the quarter was an additional $99 million charge related to the previously disclosed loss contingency, as Tom just discussed. Excluding this charge, our decremental EBIT margin was 23% compared to the same quarter last year, slightly better than the 25% that we previously committed to.
We are benefiting from a lower cost structure due to the actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2015 and strong execution on material cost-reduction programs and productivity improvements. Net earnings for the quarter were $289 million or $1.72 per diluted share with the increased accrual for the loss contingency net of compensation reducing diluted earnings per share by $0.30.
Net income in the third quarter of 2015 was $380 million or $2.14 per diluted share. Effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.5%, lower than a year ago primarily due to changes in the geographical mix of pretax income. 
I will now highlight the performance of the individual operating segments during the third quarter and provide updated guidance for the full year.
In the Engine segment, revenues were $1.9 billion, a decrease of 12% from last year. On-highway, revenues declined 13% due to lower levels of heavy- and medium-duty truck production in North America. Off-highway revenues declined 6% due to continued weak global demand. Segment EBIT was $89 million or 4.8% of sales, which included the $99 million charge to increase our estimate for the loss contingency previously disclosed. Excluding this additional provision, the Engine segment EBIT was 10.1% of sales compared to 10.3% in the third quarter of last year.
Material cost savings, lower warranty expense and benefits from previous restructuring actions partially offset the negative impact of lower volumes and an unfavorable product mix.
For full year 2016, we now expect Engine segment revenues to be down 11% from 2015 levels, primarily due to weaker truck production in North America compared to our guidance 3 months ago for sales to decline between 9% and 12%. EBIT margins for 2016 are now expected to be 8.75% when taking into account the $99 million loss contingency charge, down from our prior guidance of 10% to 11%.
For the Distribution segment, third quarter revenues were $1.5 billion, down 3% compared to last year. The decrease was driven by a 5% decline in organic sales and a 1% unfavorable impact from a stronger U.S. dollar, which were partially offset by a 3% increase in revenue from acquisitions made a year ago. The EBIT margin for the quarter was $96 million or 6.4% of sales, a decrease from 7.9% a year ago, mainly due to the fair market value gains recorded on distributor acquisition in the third quarter of 2015 and from the impact of negative foreign currency movements.
At the beginning of October, we completed the acquisition of the last remaining unconsolidated North American distributor, bringing the total acquisitions to 13, since we announced the plan in September of 2013.
We now expect full year revenue to decline 1% compared to last year as additional revenue from acquisition will help to offset weak demand for industrial engines and power generation equipment as well as the headwinds from foreign currency movements. We expect full year EBIT margins to be 6% at the midpoint of our previous guidance range.
For the Components segment, revenues were $1.1 billion, a decline of 8% from a year ago. Sales in North America declined 16% as industry production in on-highway markets declined. International sales increased 7%, with a 37% increase in sales in China, more than offsetting weaker revenues in Europe.
Despite the lower sales, gross margins improved by 80 basis points as material cost reductions and benefits from restructuring more than offset the negative impact of weaker volumes. Segment EBIT was $148 million or 12.9% of sales compared to 12.6% of sales a year ago.
We expect full year revenue in 2016 to decline by 8% and EBIT to be 13.25%, consistent with the midpoint of our previous guidance. 
In the Power Systems segment, third quarter revenues were $856 million, down 13% from a year ago. Power Generation equipment sales declined 12% due to lower demand especially in the Middle East and in Asia. Sales to industrial high-horsepower engine markets declined by 15% as weak demand continues in oil and gas, marine and mining markets.
EBIT margins were 6.9% in the quarter, down from 7.5% last year, which equates to a decremental EBIT margin of 12%. Material cost reductions, lower costs following the 2015 restructuring actions and the benefits from a weaker British pound helped offset the impact from lower volumes and joint venture earnings. We now expect full year revenues for the Power Systems segment to decline by 14% compared to our previous guidance of down 12% to 14% and full year EBIT to be 7.5% of sales at the midpoint of our prior guidance.
We are now projecting total company revenues to be down 9% in 2016, consistent with our prior guidance of down 8% to 10% as we face a 31% decline in industry production of heavy-duty trucks in North America and very weak global demand for industrial engines and Power Generation equipment.
We expect EBIT margins to be 11.3% of sales this year, including the charges related to the loss contingency incurred during the year, representing full year decremental EBIT margins of 25%. We now expect our full year effective tax rate to be 25.5% and to deliver earnings per share of approximately $8 per diluted share this year.
Turning to cash flow. Cash generated from operating activities in the quarter was $576 million, $14 million higher than last year. For the first 9 months of the year, operating cash flow is $1.3 billion, up from $1.1 billion for the same period in 2015. 
Working capital levels of $482 million were 11% lower than this time last year. And we anticipate operating cash flow in 2016 will be around $2 billion, similar to 2015 levels despite a 9% drop in revenues.
Capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $550 million to $600 million in 2016, and we still plan to return 75% of operating cash flow to shareholders this year through a combination of dividends and share repurchases, having returned $1.3 billion year-to-date. And as you know, we increased the dividend by 5% during the third quarter, and year-to-date, have repurchased 7 million shares. 
Now let me turn it back over to Mark."

So as you alluded to, it's a unique situation where we've got engine with the third-party aftertreatment, so it's the only one we have kind of in the company. What we did here in this quarter was we increased the accrual for a second population of vehicles. And so there -- as we did some additional testing, we now found that this second population is going to need to have a recall also. So that was the increase that you saw in Q3. So now we have -- the population is set. We estimated the cost of those accruals -- of those recalls and that's what's reflected in our numbers. What we have not concluded is the commercial negotiations with the OEM customer. And so while we don't expect the final outcome to be materially higher, in fact, it could be lower. As far as your ongoing kind of what we've implied in there, is there more to come, I guess, is maybe what you were also asking. What we have is there, there are 3 populations, and we have accrued for 2 of those. The third population we have not accrued for, and it's a different duty cycle that's involved in this third population. It has a different emission standard that's, in fact, higher than this. And third, we have concluded our emissions test, and all emission tests, to date, have passed. And so the third population is similar in size to the other 2 that we have taken an accrual on. And of course, we're adjusting all the agreements going forward so for the ongoing issue. And I guess lastly, maybe it's implied, but the fix has been put in place for some time. So the production -- the products being shipped today does not have this issue. What we're talking about is a fixed amount that, unfortunately, we've had to come back to a couple of times. And I guess one last thing, just to maybe close this out is, in fact, the product that we're talking about is doing terrific. And we are actually gaining sales, gaining share out at the plant the producers of engine yesterday. We're in the process of taking up production at the end of the year to meet increased demand. So it's an unfortunate situation, it's disappointing, it's complex, it's unique, but at this point, we've accrued for kind of all the known issues and then we'll kind of move into the commercial negotiations to try to finish that one up to come."

Yes, we will be targeting market share, and you probably know some of the places we're doing that, our very large engine, for example. We talked about that earlier, we're gaining share. We are expanding share in China that's both with the components and engines. We've had several new launches there that are going well. So we will be targeting the gain share in different markets where we think that opportunity exists, and we will be investing to do so.

And while we may see some bottoming, we don't have an instigator for a significant growth directly in front of us. So our view is given that we've been in this for a couple of years now, the right posture for the company to take is to assume relatively weak markets, set our cost structure accordingly, find opportunities for cost savings, productivity gains and then continue to invest in those opportunities where we think markets could improve, and we'll be able to gain share and gain business accordingly. So for example, in China, you've seen us have a pretty aggressive posture on new product launch and on share gain. And so if and when China starts to improve next year, if it did, we would be positioned well to take advantage of it. Of course, in Brazil, we'd love to hear it. It's a very, very weak market. We have very strong position in Brazil, where we're ready to ramp up when the market's ready. Again, whether it's going to ramp up in 2017, I just don't know.

I mean, as you've heard me express frustration about that in the past that I think while we've done a really good job on reducing costs in a lot of our segments I do believe over the last several years, we have chased the PowerGen market down as opposed to getting in front of it. And I'm disappointed in that for that reason, but I believe that we made a step early this year that is really helping us get ahead of that and find new ways to establish productivity and further reduce costs and that was by combining our large Engine business with our gen set business. What that's brought to us there's some new opportunities for both how we do production, how we consolidate production, and therefore, take steps out of production, reduce supply chain, reduce inventory, which, again, means, as markets vary, we end up holding less stuff, we end up holding less stuff that we don't -- we can't sell, et cetera. And then also, our new product development process, we're able to streamline that to make sure that we're ready with the products that we want because engine produces the one that the gen set wants, and we don't produce stuff that we don't need, we don't generate new products that we're not going to use. So I feel like both of those -- both in terms of efficiency, cost and asset utilization, will continue to improve. We got one of our best leaders leading the group. So I think over the next year or 2, not only do I feel like we're starting to reach the bottom in some of the markets, I feel like we've got some renewed opportunities for cost reduction to further improve margins in that area. Now again, I thought that before, so it's really great to talk about what we got to do is deliver. No one here is confused about that."

It does seem like we've been in the down cycle for a while, to your point, and frankly longer than we have seen in the past, which is frustrating. So obviously, we're kind of did a discussion earlier from David, we'd like to see some of the things turn back. We just haven't seen yet signs that they're turning back. And of course, Power Generation reflects a couple of things. One, in emerging markets, it reflects infrastructure building and general economic growth, where reserve margins start to get under threat and things like that. And then it reflects nonres capital spending in some of the more mature markets where we're selling standby. And again, while nonres capital spending isn't a disaster in the U.S. and our business isn't a disaster, both of those statistics broadly across the world are still tightening. So our view is that where we start to see turn around in PowerGen is when we start to see infrastructure spending starting to come back in some of these emerging markets across the world and then we see nonres capital spending coming back more aggressively in some of the more advanced countries. And we just -- right now, that's just not obvious one that happens. So as we are talking about, we're prepared to be at levels like we are now a little better or little worse. And we're finding ways to get more money out of our business at those levels.

There's no sign of a pickup out there right now. I think you have a situation is for many, many months we're still producing more than orders than are coming in, and that hasn't changed because the backlog is down at 85,000, which is kind of the forward order board. And we're hearing from lots and lots of fleets that while business is rolling out [ph] they're a little nervous on business, they're delaying purchases. So how do I stretch assets out a little bit? And we're in that -- that's the mode we're in right now. I don't have quite the miles that I need to make a trade out in the trucks and engines are really good out there. So you can stretch a little more out of it. And the lead time is really low. So if I need one, I can get it quickly. As we look at it, I see that fundamental business is not bad, and so that we're maybe moving towards where retail orders are getting close to trough. I still think though from a production standpoint, there's a step down still in there, which is what we've assumed. If you run our numbers that says, we had steps down in Q4, and quite frankly, I think would continue into Q1 on the production side. And so retail orders getting close to trough. Production, there is always a bit of a lag there. And that's what we've seen -- again, that's what we've seen in other cycles, especially towards year-end. The folks take a bit of a shut down as they end the year and they start the year up. We're planning for that kind of step down in production. Now whether it actually happens or not or when it happens, what quarter, but that's how we're thinking about it kind of right now."

Pat will then take you through more details of both our third quarter financial performance and our forecast for the year.
Revenues for the third quarter were $4.2 billion, a decrease of 9% compared to the third quarter of 2015. Third quarter EBIT was $398 million or 9.5% of sales compared to $577 million or 12.5% in the same quarter last year. 
Our results this quarter include a $99 million increase in accrual for a loss contingency. As we have disclosed in prior quarters, the loss contingency relates to the cost of the campaign to remedy quality issues with aftertreatment systems sourced by one of our OEM customers from a third party and paired with our engines in the OEM vehicles. The combination of a Cummins Engine with a third-party aftertreatment system is unique to this particular OEM.
We increased our accrual in the third quarter to reflect recent testing results that indicate that similar quality issues are impacting a second population of vehicles manufactured by the same OEM. We have accrued the expected cost of the campaign, but final resolution of cost sharing with our OEM customer has not been finalized. All parties are committed to supporting the vehicle owners, and the agreed plan to replace the aftertreatment systems is currently being executed. 
Excluding the loss contingency, we delivered decremental EBIT margins of 23% in the third quarter, better than our target of 25%, reflecting strong operational performance in the face of very weak markets. Benefits from the restructuring actions we initiated in the fourth quarter of 2015, strong execution on material cost-reduction initiatives and productivity gains all helped to mitigate the impact of lower volumes in the third quarter.
Engine business revenues decreased by 12% year-over-year, primarily due to lower industry production of heavy- and medium-duty trucks in North America. Earnings before interest and tax was 4.8% of sales, down from 10.3% a year ago. Excluding the loss contingency, EBIT was 10.1% compared to 10.3% a year ago. Restructuring benefits, material cost reduction and lower warranty costs all contributed to the strong operating results. 
Revenues in our Components segment decreased 8% from a year ago, with lower demand in North America more than offsetting growth in China. Sales in China increased by 37% as demand for our products continues to outpace end-market growth. Despite the lower sales, EBIT percent improved from 12.6% to 12.9% as strong execution of our cost-reduction programs more than offset the impact of weaker volumes.
Distribution revenues decreased 3% compared to the third quarter of 2015. The positive impact of acquisitions made in the second half of 2015 were more than offset by the negative impact of currency and weaker sales to off-highway markets. The Distribution business' EBIT for the quarter was 6.4%, down from 7.9% a year ago with results last year benefiting from gains on the acquisition of 3 distributor joint ventures. The positive impact of operational improvement and increased pricing were offset by the negative impact of currency.
Revenues for the Power Systems business declined by 13% year-over-year, with lower sales in most regions due to weaker demand in Power Generation, commercial marine and oil and gas markets. EBIT declined from 7.5% to 6.9%, with decremental EBIT margin just 12%, due in part to a 15% reduction in operating expenses in the business.
Now I'll comment on some of our key markets, starting with North America. Our revenues in North America declined by 13% in the third quarter due to weaker demand in on-highway markets especially heavy-duty trucks. We shipped 16,400 engines to the North American heavy-duty market in the third quarter, a decrease of 33% from a year ago. Our market share improved from the second quarter of this year and stands at 31% year-to-date. We are forecasting full year industry production to be 200,000 units and our market share to be in the range of 27% to 30%, unchanged from our projections 3 months ago.
Frost & Sullivan recently recognized Cummins as the leading supplier of heavy-duty engines to the U.S. heavy-duty truck market, reflecting the results of its extensive survey of both truck fleets and of owner operators.
In the medium-duty truck market, we delivered approximately 18,000 engines in the third quarter, down 20% from last year. Our market share through the end of August was 73%, within the range of our full-year guidance of between 72% to 75%. Industry production dipped sharply in the third quarter and is not expected to improve in the fourth quarter. And as a result, we have lowered our full year forecast of market size to 108,000 units from 117,000 units 3 months ago.
Our engine shipments to North American pickup truck customers increased by 2% in the third quarter. Shipments to Chrysler declined by 11% due to planned production changes at Chrysler plants, but were more than offset by shipments of our V8 engine to Nissan, which we launched in the fourth quarter of last year. We currently expect our revenues in the pickup segment to increase by 10% in 2016, down a little from our prior forecast of 12% growth.
Our Engine revenues in North American construction market decreased by 21% compared to the third quarter of last year. While housing and commercial construction activity remains positive, weaker demand in the oil and gas market has led to an excess supply of used equipment. 
Power Systems revenues declined 8% in North America in the third quarter due primarily to lower engine orders from oil and gas and mining customers.
Our international revenues declined by 3% year-over-year, driven by lower sales in the Middle East and Africa, which more than offset growth in China. Weak commodity prices and slowing economic activity negatively impacted demand for Power Generation equipment in the Middle East and Africa.
Third quarter revenues in China, including joint ventures, were $826 million, an increase of 6% due to growth in on-highway and construction revenues. Industry demand for heavy- and medium-duty trucks in China increased by 30% in the third quarter. Our market share in the third quarter was 16.5%, up from the second quarter but down from 17.9% a year ago.
Some OEMs have been aggressively discounting trucks this year to gain share in the near term while our partner, Dongfeng, has experienced a decline in the market share. We expect our full year Engines market share to be 16% compared to 16.4% in 2015.
We now project full year industry sales to increase 16% to 870,000 units this year, up from our prior forecast of 820,000 units or 9% growth.
Shipment of our light-duty engines in China grew 23% in the third quarter compared to a 3% increase for the overall market as we increased penetration at Foton, displacing local competitor engines. Our share of the overall market was 7.7%, up 120 basis points year-over-year. We currently project industry sales to decline by 4% for the year, unchanged from 3 months ago. Industry sales of excavators in China increased by 43% in the third quarter, and our volumes more than doubled off a very small base due to stronger investment in real estate, driving uptick in equipment demand. While this was a nice increase, construction equipment markets in China are still very weak in historical terms.
Revenues for our Power Systems business in China declined by 11% in the third quarter, reflecting weak demand in Marine, mining and power generation markets. Full year revenues in China across all segments, including joint ventures, are expected to grow 4% for the year, up from our prior forecast of 3% due to stronger demand in the heavy- and medium-duty truck market. Third quarter revenues in India, including joint ventures, were $376 million and flat year-over-year, with lower on-highway volumes offsetting growth in Power Generation, construction and aftermarket revenues. Industry truck production dropped by 17% compared to a year ago, after a very strong first half of the year.
Truck OEMs lowered build rates to reduce inventories as sales slowed in the third quarter. For the full year, we now forecast industry truck production to be 340,000 units, up 6% year-over-year, but down from our prior forecast of 370,000 units. We currently project our market share to be 41%, up from 40% in 2015.
We currently project full year revenues across all segments in India and including joint ventures to increase 5%, consistent with our prior forecast. Strong demand in construction and improving demand in Power Generation are expected to offset the weaker outlook for trucks.
Third quarter revenues in Brazil were $85 million, up 9% from the third quarter last year, reflecting a modest improvement in sales to on-highway markets. Our shipments of engines to truck customers increased 5% while overall industry truck production declined by 14% year-over-year. We project full year industry truck production to decline by 20%, unchanged from 3 months ago.
Our sales in the Middle East declined by 12% in the third quarter, primarily impacting our Power Systems business and reflecting weakness in infrastructure investment in the region.
As a result of the slowed pace of growth in the global economy, we continue to face persistently weak demand in a number of our largest markets. Our restructuring and other cost-reduction initiatives are helping to maintain EBIT margins well above trough levels from pre -- prior cycles. In addition to reducing costs and improving productivity, we've also continued to invest in our business to improve our competitive position throughout this protracted downturn. 
In the fourth quarter, we will acquire our last remaining distributor joint venture in North America, completing the strategic initiative that we announced in 2013 and allowing us to improve the consistency and quality of our service and support to our customers wherever they operate.
We've also continued to invest in new products. For example, we're growing sales and market share with our new QSK95 engine even in extremely challenging markets. We currently expect our full year sales to decline by 9%, consistent with our prior guidance. EBIT percent is now expected to be 11.3%, down from our prior guidance of 11.6% to 12.2%, largely as a result of the increased accrual from the loss contingency in the Engine business. Our EBIT expectations for the Components, Distribution and Power Systems businesses are all unchanged from 3 months ago. We remain on track to deliver our goal of 25% decremental EBIT margin for the full year of 2016.
So far this year, we have returned $1.3 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, consistent with our plan to return 75% of operating cash flow to shareholders. 
Thank you for your interest today. And now I'll turn it over to Pat, who will cover our third quarter results and full year guidance in more detail."

Third quarter revenues were $4.2 billion, a decrease of 9% from a year ago.Sales in North America, which represented 59% of our third quarter revenues, declined 13% from last year due primarily to lower demand",1312,"Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Third quarter revenues were $4.2 billion, a decrease of 9% from a year ago.
Sales in North America, which represented 59% of our third quarter revenues, declined 13% from last year due primarily to lower demand in heavy- and medium-duty truck markets and declines in power generation and industrial engine sales.
International sales declined by 3% from a year ago as increased sales in China helped to offset weaker demand in both the Middle East and in Africa.
Despite the 9% decline in revenues, gross margins of 25.8% of sales were only down 30 basis points from last year with material cost savings, productivity improvements and the benefits from the restructuring actions helping offset the negative impact from lower volumes and an unfavorable product mix.
Selling, admin and research and development costs of $670 million or 16% of sales decreased by $57 million year-over-year, mainly due to restructuring actions executed in the fourth quarter of 2015 and lower spending for research and development projects, but did increase as a percent of sales by 30 basis points.
Joint venture income of $74 million decreased $4 million compared to a year ago, primarily due to lower earnings in Power Systems, joint ventures and the acquisition of North American distributors previously held as unconsolidated joint ventures.
Earnings before interest and tax were $398 million or 9.5% of sales for the quarter compared to 12.5% a year ago. Included in the quarter was an additional $99 million charge related to the previously disclosed loss contingency, as Tom just discussed. Excluding this charge, our decremental EBIT margin was 23% compared to the same quarter last year, slightly better than the 25% that we previously committed to.
We are benefiting from a lower cost structure due to the actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2015 and strong execution on material cost-reduction programs and productivity improvements. Net earnings for the quarter were $289 million or $1.72 per diluted share with the increased accrual for the loss contingency net of compensation reducing diluted earnings per share by $0.30.
Net income in the third quarter of 2015 was $380 million or $2.14 per diluted share. Effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.5%, lower than a year ago primarily due to changes in the geographical mix of pretax income. 
I will now highlight the performance of the individual operating segments during the third quarter and provide updated guidance for the full year.
In the Engine segment, revenues were $1.9 billion, a decrease of 12% from last year. On-highway, revenues declined 13% due to lower levels of heavy- and medium-duty truck production in North America. Off-highway revenues declined 6% due to continued weak global demand. Segment EBIT was $89 million or 4.8% of sales, which included the $99 million charge to increase our estimate for the loss contingency previously disclosed. Excluding this additional provision, the Engine segment EBIT was 10.1% of sales compared to 10.3% in the third quarter of last year.
Material cost savings, lower warranty expense and benefits from previous restructuring actions partially offset the negative impact of lower volumes and an unfavorable product mix.
For full year 2016, we now expect Engine segment revenues to be down 11% from 2015 levels, primarily due to weaker truck production in North America compared to our guidance 3 months ago for sales to decline between 9% and 12%. EBIT margins for 2016 are now expected to be 8.75% when taking into account the $99 million loss contingency charge, down from our prior guidance of 10% to 11%.
For the Distribution segment, third quarter revenues were $1.5 billion, down 3% compared to last year. The decrease was driven by a 5% decline in organic sales and a 1% unfavorable impact from a stronger U.S. dollar, which were partially offset by a 3% increase in revenue from acquisitions made a year ago. The EBIT margin for the quarter was $96 million or 6.4% of sales, a decrease from 7.9% a year ago, mainly due to the fair market value gains recorded on distributor acquisition in the third quarter of 2015 and from the impact of negative foreign currency movements.
At the beginning of October, we completed the acquisition of the last remaining unconsolidated North American distributor, bringing the total acquisitions to 13, since we announced the plan in September of 2013.
We now expect full year revenue to decline 1% compared to last year as additional revenue from acquisition will help to offset weak demand for industrial engines and power generation equipment as well as the headwinds from foreign currency movements. We expect full year EBIT margins to be 6% at the midpoint of our previous guidance range.
For the Components segment, revenues were $1.1 billion, a decline of 8% from a year ago. Sales in North America declined 16% as industry production in on-highway markets declined. International sales increased 7%, with a 37% increase in sales in China, more than offsetting weaker revenues in Europe.
Despite the lower sales, gross margins improved by 80 basis points as material cost reductions and benefits from restructuring more than offset the negative impact of weaker volumes. Segment EBIT was $148 million or 12.9% of sales compared to 12.6% of sales a year ago.
We expect full year revenue in 2016 to decline by 8% and EBIT to be 13.25%, consistent with the midpoint of our previous guidance. 
In the Power Systems segment, third quarter revenues were $856 million, down 13% from a year ago. Power Generation equipment sales declined 12% due to lower demand especially in the Middle East and in Asia. Sales to industrial high-horsepower engine markets declined by 15% as weak demand continues in oil and gas, marine and mining markets.
EBIT margins were 6.9% in the quarter, down from 7.5% last year, which equates to a decremental EBIT margin of 12%. Material cost reductions, lower costs following the 2015 restructuring actions and the benefits from a weaker British pound helped offset the impact from lower volumes and joint venture earnings. We now expect full year revenues for the Power Systems segment to decline by 14% compared to our previous guidance of down 12% to 14% and full year EBIT to be 7.5% of sales at the midpoint of our prior guidance.
We are now projecting total company revenues to be down 9% in 2016, consistent with our prior guidance of down 8% to 10% as we face a 31% decline in industry production of heavy-duty trucks in North America and very weak global demand for industrial engines and Power Generation equipment.
We expect EBIT margins to be 11.3% of sales this year, including the charges related to the loss contingency incurred during the year, representing full year decremental EBIT margins of 25%. We now expect our full year effective tax rate to be 25.5% and to deliver earnings per share of approximately $8 per diluted share this year.
Turning to cash flow. Cash generated from operating activities in the quarter was $576 million, $14 million higher than last year. For the first 9 months of the year, operating cash flow is $1.3 billion, up from $1.1 billion for the same period in 2015. 
Working capital levels of $482 million were 11% lower than this time last year. And we anticipate operating cash flow in 2016 will be around $2 billion, similar to 2015 levels despite a 9% drop in revenues.
Capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $550 million to $600 million in 2016, and we still plan to return 75% of operating cash flow to shareholders this year through a combination of dividends and share repurchases, having returned $1.3 billion year-to-date. And as you know, we increased the dividend by 5% during the third quarter, and year-to-date, have repurchased 7 million shares. 
Now let me turn it back over to Mark."

So as you alluded to, it's a unique situation where we've got engine with the third-party aftertreatment, so it's the only one we have kind of in the company. What we did here in this quarter was we increased the accrual for a second population of vehicles. And so there -- as we did some additional testing, we now found that this second population is going to need to have a recall also. So that was the increase that you saw in Q3. So now we have -- the population is set. We estimated the cost of those accruals -- of those recalls and that's what's reflected in our numbers. What we have not concluded is the commercial negotiations with the OEM customer. And so while we don't expect the final outcome to be materially higher, in fact, it could be lower. As far as your ongoing kind of what we've implied in there, is there more to come, I guess, is maybe what you were also asking. What we have is there, there are 3 populations, and we have accrued for 2 of those. The third population we have not accrued for, and it's a different duty cycle that's involved in this third population. It has a different emission standard that's, in fact, higher than this. And third, we have concluded our emissions test, and all emission tests, to date, have passed. And so the third population is similar in size to the other 2 that we have taken an accrual on. And of course, we're adjusting all the agreements going forward so for the ongoing issue. And I guess lastly, maybe it's implied, but the fix has been put in place for some time. So the production -- the products being shipped today does not have this issue. What we're talking about is a fixed amount that, unfortunately, we've had to come back to a couple of times. And I guess one last thing, just to maybe close this out is, in fact, the product that we're talking about is doing terrific. And we are actually gaining sales, gaining share out at the plant the producers of engine yesterday. We're in the process of taking up production at the end of the year to meet increased demand. So it's an unfortunate situation, it's disappointing, it's complex, it's unique, but at this point, we've accrued for kind of all the known issues and then we'll kind of move into the commercial negotiations to try to finish that one up to come."

So we will be targeting the gain share in different markets where we think that opportunity exists, and we will be investing to do so.

But yes, things are -- the thing I would say that's probably important for shareholders, is we haven't changed our focus areas. We remain focused on the areas I discussed with you. We are continued to progress in those. We remain focused on how to expand our businesses and areas that we think we have the capabilities that will make the returns, meet our targets and that we can invest a sum that we think we can earn a return on. So that same conservatism about how to invest, how to make sure there were things that we belong in, that's stayed the same, which, as you'd guess, takes a little bit more to find the right thing but we feel optimistic. And I'll just say for myself that I'm very committed to the areas that we set out and doing in the way we set out in our strategy session with investors."

We've seen decent recovery in the Chinese truck market this year. I just mean to say that, broadly speaking, our view is that markets are, across Cummins markets broadly, that they continue to be weak. And while we may see some bottoming, we don't have an instigator for a significant growth directly in front of us. So our view is given that we've been in this for a couple of years now, the right posture for the company to take is to assume relatively weak markets, set our cost structure accordingly, find opportunities for cost savings, productivity gains and then continue to invest in those opportunities where we think markets could improve, and we'll be able to gain share and gain business accordingly. So for example, in China, you've seen us have a pretty aggressive posture on new product launch and on share gain. And so if and when China starts to improve next year, if it did, we would be positioned well to take advantage of it. Of course, in Brazil, we'd love to hear it. It's a very, very weak market. We have very strong position in Brazil, where we're ready to ramp up when the market's ready. Again, whether it's going to ramp up in 2017, I just don't know. So again, we were still doing work on it, Dave, so we'll have a much better view in a couple of months about -- if you see some of those markets actually starting to turn back, we'll definitely forecast those. I just -- I kind of wanted to give you a sense of how we're approaching our planning rather than specifics on in just one emerging market or another."

I mean, as you've heard me express frustration about that in the past that I think while we've done a really good job on reducing costs in a lot of our segments I do believe over the last several years, we have chased the PowerGen market down as opposed to getting in front of it. And I'm disappointed in that for that reason, but I believe that we made a step early this year that is really helping us get ahead of that and find new ways to establish productivity and further reduce costs and that was by combining our large Engine business with our gen set business. What that's brought to us there's some new opportunities for both how we do production, how we consolidate production, and therefore, take steps out of production, reduce supply chain, reduce inventory, which, again, means, as markets vary, we end up holding less stuff, we end up holding less stuff that we don't -- we can't sell, et cetera. And then also, our new product development process, we're able to streamline that to make sure that we're ready with the products that we want because engine produces the one that the gen set wants, and we don't produce stuff that we don't need, we don't generate new products that we're not going to use. So I feel like both of those -- both in terms of efficiency, cost and asset utilization, will continue to improve. We got one of our best leaders leading the group. So I think over the next year or 2, not only do I feel like we're starting to reach the bottom in some of the markets, I feel like we've got some renewed opportunities for cost reduction to further improve margins in that area. Now again, I thought that before, so it's really great to talk about what we got to do is deliver. No one here is confused about that."

It does seem like we've been in the down cycle for a while, to your point, and frankly longer than we have seen in the past, which is frustrating. So obviously, we're kind of did a discussion earlier from David, we'd like to see some of the things turn back. We just haven't seen yet signs that they're turning back. And of course, Power Generation reflects a couple of things. One, in emerging markets, it reflects infrastructure building and general economic growth, where reserve margins start to get under threat and things like that. And then it reflects nonres capital spending in some of the more mature markets where we're selling standby. And again, while nonres capital spending isn't a disaster in the U.S. and our business isn't a disaster, both of those statistics broadly across the world are still tightening. So our view is that where we start to see turn around in PowerGen is when we start to see infrastructure spending starting to come back in some of these emerging markets across the world and then we see nonres capital spending coming back more aggressively in some of the more advanced countries. And we just -- right now, that's just not obvious one that happens. So as we are talking about, we're prepared to be at levels like we are now a little better or little worse. And we're finding ways to get more money out of our business at those levels. We are completely ready for when it turns around to gain a lot of to gain growth but also gain profitability improvements. So there's no question about that.

And we're hearing from lots and lots of fleets that while business is rolling out [ph] they're a little nervous on business, they're delaying purchases. So how do I stretch assets out a little bit? And we're in that -- that's the mode we're in right now. I don't have quite the miles that I need to make a trade out in the trucks and engines are really good out there. So you can stretch a little more out of it. And the lead time is really low. So if I need one, I can get it quickly. As we look at it, I see that fundamental business is not bad, and so that we're maybe moving towards where retail orders are getting close to trough. I still think though from a production standpoint, there's a step down still in there, which is what we've assumed. If you run our numbers that says, we had steps down in Q4, and quite frankly, I think would continue into Q1 on the production side. And so retail orders getting close to trough. Production, there is always a bit of a lag there. And that's what we've seen -- again, that's what we've seen in other cycles, especially towards year-end. The folks take a bit of a shut down as they end the year and they start the year up. We're planning for that kind of step down in production.

It depends what else we got going. I mean, I think Rich sort of painted our business model pretty closely, which is that in the Components business, we're constantly trying to find ways to do the same things for less money or do more for the same money, and without it -- that's essentially what new products mean. And without it, we don't get to be the supplier. And then what we have to do is come up with new things or new capabilities, new features, new something in order to make sure that we have revenue growth. And we've been able to do that for the last 15 years in the Components business by finding new markets to go to, new products to add, new systems to go. So if everything was status quo, it would have an impact on our revenues. Of course, everything isn't status quo. For example, we just grew our business in China by 37%. So this is the kind of thing we're trying to do is to offset sales -- revenue declines driven by cost savings, which don't necessarily translate into margin dollar declines, but they do mean sales go down into other things that we can do for those customers to drive sales up."

I think, we were close to 35% in Q3. Having said that, we're gaining share in the market in a lot of places. With virtually every mixed fleet customer I've talked to, so using multiple engines, they're increasing their share with Cummins now, which we couldn't say 2 years ago. So I think there's some base improvement going on. So I think the big step up we saw in Q3 was more of production cycles changing in which OEs are taken down weeks versus expanding production."

In fact, despite all the predictions, we're just as strong as we've ever been with them. And so I feel really good about our position. I also feel really good about those OEMs. Those 2 OEMs are building quality products, meeting new emissions targets, and I believe that they will restore share they're losing. It's just -- during this last year, they -- Dongfeng in particular, has lost a little bit of share while some of the others have gained some through some improvement in their products, too, not just only discounting, but they did take some old products and finally launched some new products. So that is -- it's share things done. By the way, Weichai never stopped its journey, so that's never going to stop.
