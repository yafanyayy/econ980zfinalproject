On the call today is Maryann Mannen, our Chief Financial Officer; and Doug Pferdehirt, our President and Chief Operating Officer, who is joining us from another location. I'll focus my comments today on 2015 performance and our market outlook for the current year. Maryann will provide specifics on our quarterly and full year financial performance as well as our financial outlook for 2016. We'll then open up the call for your questions.
In 2015, global upstream spending declined approximately 25% as a result of falling commodity prices. North America markets were impacted greater than most, experiencing the steepest activity decline seen in nearly 3 decades. Clearly, this was a very challenging year for the energy industry.
FMC Technologies entered the downturn with solid operational momentum, and we responded early with aggressive restructuring actions across all of our businesses. This wasn't just a reaction to declining activity levels, it was a fundamental change in the way we manage our business, aimed at providing meaningful and sustainable cost savings. Our efforts focused on driving better execution, product and process standardization, innovative technology and integrated business models. These are important steps that we believe will put the company in an even stronger competitive position.
In 2015, we were able to deliver on several key metrics. In Subsea Technologies, margins increased for our fourth consecutive year. For the full year, excluding all restructuring charges, we achieved Subsea margins of 15.1%. The strong results were driven by the strength of our backlog and the continued trend of solid execution.
We also finished the year with $3.1 billion of inbound orders in our Subsea technology segment, achieving our full year target of at least $3 billion. For the quarter, our Subsea inbound orders totaled $490 million, which included the recently announced award for the Woodside Greater Western Flank Phase 2 project on the Northwest shelf of Australia. This was an important award from a long-standing alliance partner with deliveries expected to extend through 2018.
As we look forward, operators are now not only challenged to improve project economics, but the sharp decline in oil prices is limiting their capital spending plans. Customer priorities continue to evolve, but the message is clear. Operators are determined to live within their cash flows, putting the burden of balancing budgets on capital spending.
Although it's unlikely that today's commodity prices reflect the assumptions used for long-term project economics, royal oil prices do impact current cash flow. The increasing level of commodity price volatility creates even more uncertainty around these cash flows. And even though project economics are improving, the pace of large-scale developments will be driven by operator cash flow, and this is different than past cycles. But even in this more challenging environment, we have been successful in working with our customers to bring down costs and make projects economic. Our initiatives are working. The award for the Woodside Greater Western Flank Phase 2 project is a great example of this success. With this project, we adopted the same standard that had been used on a previous development and significantly reduced the project management and engineering hours. We also used existing tools to install and test the equipment. By using standard FMC specifications, we were able to reduce the inspection points by more than 50%. And finally, we leaned out the documentation process for additional savings. Much of this success came from the operator's willingness to accept a vendor-based approach versus the traditional client-specific requirements. 
As we think about our Subsea order potential for 2016, I want to talk about the major components that make up our Subsea inbound: services, small projects and large projects. Broadly speaking, we expect Subsea service orders to remain fairly resilient with only modest declines driven by the level of installation work. We expect a somewhat lower level of order activity for smaller projects in 2016. These projects are not immune to spending reductions, but they typically have lower cash outlays and can provide operators with a relatively quick payback. Now forecasting order levels for larger projects is a challenge in the current environment. There are a number of large projects that we're tracking, and we do see the potential for some of these projects to be awarded in the current year. However, we don't foresee any $0.5 billion to $1 billion megaprojects being awarded this year, and that will make it difficult for us to match the level of Subsea orders that we received in 2015.
Despite the Subsea order uncertainty, we as a company remain focused on our initiatives to improve deepwater project economics. We also believe that we can do even more with our integrated business models, and that's what we're doing with our Forsys Subsea joint venture with Technip. Earlier this week, the joint venture announced the award of another integrated FEED contract, this one from Statoil for the development of their tray sac  field. We are encouraged by Statoil's willingness to adopt a different business model. The Forsys Subsea approach is gaining traction and tray sac is an important example of that progress.
Our Subsea business cost structure, we believe, has the potential for significant savings. Specifically we're focused on optimizing our global manufacturing operations, standardizing our processes and product offerings and further integrating our global supply chain. These actions will provide sustainable structural benefits that will ensure that we retain, if not improve, our cost advantage. At the same time, we will preserve our core engineering and project management capabilities. Further, we will continue to invest in new technologies and expand our customer relationships. Collectively, these actions will strengthen our Subsea business and ensure that we're prepared for an eventual market recovery.
Let me now turn to our Surface Technologies segment. Revenues for the quarter were down 12% sequentially. However, once we adjust for all charges, we closed out the quarter with an adjusted margin just above 10% despite the severe activity declines posted throughout North America in 2015. Activity levels for our international surface wellhead business held up sequentially, but we're seeing the impact of pricing pressure as a result of the deteriorating global market. We expect activity levels outside of North America to remain resilient in 2016. We moved aggressively to streamline our North America business, and our actions have been focused on more than just responding to the lower activity levels. We're approaching this market in a fundamentally different way. We restructured our management organization, consolidated our service lines and integrated our products and service offering. These actions will create greater efficiencies and drive better operational performance, and they'll further improve our position in the North America onshore market. This approach has been a key driver in expanding our customer base and resulting in new contract awards. 
Let me end with 2 main points. First, deepwater operators were behaving differently in this current cycle. Cash flow and uncertainty are affecting near-term decisions. But we are making an impact on deepwater project economics. We're driving cost lower and reducing operator risk through product standardization, new technologies and new business models. The Woodside Greater Western Flank and Statoil tray sac projects are 2 tangible examples of our success. Second, we are intensely focused on what we can control, taking aggressive actions across the entire company. Most importantly, our restructuring activities go beyond workforce and facility reductions. We're using the downturn as a catalyst to fundamentally change the way we manage our organization so that we can sustainably deliver our products and services in an effective and cost-efficient manner regardless of the market conditions. Maryann will now take you through the financial details in the quarter and for the full year and provide a more detailed explanation of our 2016 expectations."
972117,314774890,934409,"FMC Technologies, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 17, 2016",2016-02-17,"Earnings Calls","FMC Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, John. Our fourth quarter diluted earnings per share were $0.46 when excluding certain charges of $73 million or $0.22 per diluted share incurred in the quarter. As we indicated last quarter, we took further restructuring actions in the fourth quar",1885,"Thanks, John. Our fourth quarter diluted earnings per share were $0.46 when excluding certain charges of $73 million or $0.22 per diluted share incurred in the quarter. As we indicated last quarter, we took further restructuring actions in the fourth quarter. Included in our reported results are pretax charges of $31 million for restructuring actions or $0.10 per diluted share. Also included in the quarterly results are pretax inventory adjustments of $42 million due to the prolonged lower activity levels in North America. 
The inventory write-downs include a $36 million charge in our surface technology segment. The remaining $6 million was recorded in our Energy Infrastructure segment. These inventory adjustments reduced our reported earnings by $0.12 per diluted share. We have provided a schedule in our press release issued last evening to show the quarterly and full year impact of these costs incurred. 
Looking at the full year, we undertook a significant amount of restructuring in response to the decline in market activity in North America as well as the forecast reductions for 2016 in our Subsea business. The combined charges in 2015 for restructuring and other severance as well as impairments totaled $132 million before tax. In the surface technology segment, we incurred $74 million of charges for restructuring our facilities, impairment of assets and headcount reductions. We expect these actions to have benefit in 2016 as we operate on a lower cost base and in a lower rig count environment. In our Subsea technology segment, we incurred $50 million of charges, primarily for headcount reduction taken in the second half of the year. Activity levels remain strong in this segment through the first 3 quarters of 2015. Energy Infrastructure incurred $8 million for restructuring. This occurred mainly in the measurement solutions business where the low North American activity levels reduced market opportunities. Collectively, these actions will further strengthen our operating performance as we manage through the soft market conditions we expect will continue throughout 2016 both in North America as well as in our Subsea business. When adjusting for our restructuring and impairment costs including inventory write-downs of $49 million, full year EPS was $2.27 for 2015. 
Moving to our operating segments. Subsea Technologies revenue in the quarter was $1 billion. Quarter-over-quarter revenue comparisons were negatively impacted by $134 million of foreign currency translations. Lower subsea services activity, primarily intervention services as well as lower project activity, contributed to the quarter-over-quarter results. Subsea Technologies operating profit was $132 million in the quarter, excluding restructuring and other severance and impairment charges of $25 million. Quarter-over-quarter profit comparisons were negatively impacted by $15 million of foreign currency translations due to the strong U.S. dollar. Operating margins in the quarter were 12.9% excluding restructuring and other severance and impairment charges. Excluding all charges and the impact of foreign currency translation, operating profit was down approximately 29% quarter-over-quarter. The decline was driven primarily by the lower revenue, reduced well intervention activities in the North Sea and higher research and development expense due to the timing of expenditures. We experienced headwinds from the strengthening U.S. dollar throughout the year.
For the full year, Subsea revenue included $540 million of unfavorable impact and operating profit included $77 million of unfavorable impact due to the strong U.S. dollar. Full year Subsea margins excluding restructuring and impairment charges were 15.1%, consistent with our estimates throughout the year as our project execution continue to support solid operating margins. We began significant headcount reductions in the second half of 2015 as project volumes began to weaken. We expect to take further actions in the first quarter of this year. These actions and continued strong operational performance will support us as our Subsea volumes decline from 2015 levels. Segment backlog exiting this quarter was $3.8 billion. This compares to prior year backlog of $5.8 billion. Some of this backlog has a longer delivery horizon and will be recognized over the next 3 years. 
Moving to our Surface Technologies results. Surface Technologies reporting an operating loss for the fourth quarter of $7 million, including restructuring and other severance impairment charges of $3 million. When excluding the severance, restructuring and impairment charges as well as the inventory adjustments, we posted operating profit of $32 million and an operating margin of 10.1% in the quarter. As was mentioned earlier, we had significant inventory adjustments that impacted our Surface Technologies segment. During the quarter, we took a write-down of $36 million for inventory. Most of the write-down was related to our North American businesses where sharp activity declined, drove significant reduction to future demand estimates for the region. However, the underlying results represent the continued decline in activity in our North America business. Operational profit performance was supported by the benefit of the restructuring efforts made throughout the year. In some international regions though, activity levels have proven to be more resilient. However, as we noted last quarter, our operating results now reflect pricing challenges across all major geographies, including our surface wellhead business outside North America. 
We have taken significant restructuring actions in our Surface Technologies business. These actions focus both on reducing our operating cost structure in North America and restructuring the business model to deliver an integrated product offering intended to bring greater value to our customers. On a full year basis, our operating margins were 11.8% when excluding restructuring, impairment and inventory charges, reflecting the benefit of restructuring activities taken earlier in the year. While we expect the weak activity levels in North America to persist throughout 2016, these actions will further improve our operating competitiveness through our significant workforce reductions and implementation of our integrated product offering. Segment backlog stands at $433 million. This continues to predominantly be reflective of our surface wellhead business outside of North America. 
Moving to Energy Infrastructure. Revenue for the fourth quarter was $96 million. The segment reported operating losses of $3 million, including $4 million or restructuring and other severance charges. Additionally, we incurred charges of $6 million in the quarter for the write-down of inventory of our measurement solution business due to lack of demand from weak activity. Segment results continue to be negatively impacted by the sharp activity decline in the North America market.
Let's turn to the corporate items. Corporate expense in the quarter was $15 million. Other revenue and expense net reflects expense of $23 million. The majority of expense relates to foreign currency losses, primarily associated with the currency devaluation of the Angolan kwanza. Our fourth quarter tax rate was negative 8.7%, due in part to a favorable shift in geographic earnings mix and the reinstatement of a research and development tax credit enacted in late December. Our full year tax rate was 21.4% due in part to the lower mix of earnings subject to U.S. tax. Capital spending this quarter was $40 million. This brings our spending in 2015 to $251 million. We generated solid cash flow from operations of $932 million. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had net debt of $240 million. It is comprised of $960 million of cash and $1.2 billion of debt. We averaged 230 million diluted shares outstanding in the quarter. We repurchased 1.3 million shares of stock during the fourth quarter at an average cost of $31.23 per share. For the full year, we repurchased a total of 5.3 million shares for a total cost of $190.4 million.
Let me next discuss our outlook for 2016. We expect Energy Infrastructure revenue to be down by approximately 5% year-over-year. Revenue will continue to be negatively impacted by the weak North American market in our measurement solutions business. Therefore, we do not expect a recovery in this business this year. However, we do expect the benefits from prior year restructuring to favorably impact segment profitability in 2016. We expect full year margins in the high single digits. Given the recent rig count decline, Surface Technologies revenue is now expected to be down 15% to 20% from 2015 due to uncertain North American market activity. We are not assuming a recovery from current rig count levels. Full year operating margins are targeted at high single digits, excluding any restructuring charges that may be necessary. While we will benefit from the restructuring actions taken in 2015 and those forthcoming in 2016, pricing pressure in both our North American international business provides significant headwinds at these activity levels. Subsea revenue for the full year in 2016 should be approximately $3.6 billion. We expect revenue from our Subsea backlog of approximately $2.2 billion. For our subsea services business, we expect revenues of approximately $1.3 billion, down modestly from 2015. Startups of certain services are expected in April of this year with lower utilization expected than prior years. Given the lower visibility for inbound, as John has discussed, we are assuming a minimal amount of revenue from current year inbound. This would, therefore, be a source of upside to our 2016 revenues if inbound were stronger. We continue to expect Subsea margins in the range of 11% to 13%, excluding any restructuring charges that are likely in 2016. Further cost reductions will help offset the expected revenue decline. When combined with continued strong execution on our backlog, we see the potential to deliver margins above the midpoint of the guidance range. I'll now provide you with guidance on our corporate items. 
In 2016, we expect corporate expense to be approximately $15 million to $16 [ph] million per quarter. We expect other revenue and expense to be an expense of approximately $13 million to $14 million per quarter with a potential for further foreign currency fluctuation. We expect our 2016 full year tax rate to be between 23% and 25%. Our earnings subject to U.S. income tax are expected to be lower in 2016. We expect capital spending for the year of approximately $180 million. This represents a 28% reduction from 2015. This spending does not include any contingent capital that may be needed to respond to contract award. We do anticipate further restructuring will be necessary as the market activity provides better clarity on the impact in future periods. We will continue to provide guidance as we estimate the cost of benefits of these actions. 
Let me now close with the following comments. Given the latest move down in the U.S. rig count, our Surface Technologies segment performance has become more difficult to forecast. We're responding with additional headcount reduction as well as further facility consolidations and closures, our efforts in the last year to provide an integrated service offering should support our growth in this market recovers. In Subsea, we have a solid backlog to deliver the 2016 estimates provided albeit lower than in previous years. Our headcount reduction should partially offset the revenue decline forecast in 2016, and our project execution should allow us to deliver solid operating performance supporting operating margin guidance. As 2016 Subsea inbound develops, we are prepared to take further actions where needed. We are working to optimize our global footprint to deliver sustainable, superior performance now and when the deepwater and North American markets recover. While managing the company through extreme market uncertainty, we remain focused on preserving and further developing our technical capabilities and customer relationships and maintaining our market leadership. Operator, you may now open up the call for questions."

Revenue declined in 2016, more so than we saw 4 months ago. And despite as Maryann mentioned, our efforts to restructure and reduced cost that's going to put some margin pressure.

We're acting -- when you think about it, Subsea revenues in 2015, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, are only down 5%, yet we have been taking restructuring actions well in advance of that activity downturn.

In today's environment, it's so hard to predict when that is because I said in my prepared remarks, this cycle is so different. In the past, capital budgets may be reduced and fixed emphasis is improving our project economics once the're improved at the hurdle rates had a pretty good chance of that project going forward that's all changed now. Even though project economics of an improved -- I was in Norway last week, and Statoil has made remarkable progress in part to reduced breakeven of major projects from $70 a barrel to $40 a barrel, and there's a lot more that we can do. But even when you improve project economics, it doesn't mean the project will go ahead because the restrictions on cash flow, which is driven by the current oil price. But you're right. At some point, as we continue to improve project economics and cash flow hopefully will start to improve that the operators will realize the importance of green lighting some of these projects and taking the steps to develop these deepwater fields for the purpose of replacing production in future years. I think that we'll have to look at the cycle differently, and we have to take into account the importance of cash flow as they approve those projects."

Our run rate even in the fourth quarter generally supported, so we're looking at subsea services for 2016 inbounds somewhere 1 2, 1 3, 1 4 range. So there'd be some slight headwinds but generally we believe for it to be resilient. The smaller projects, as we learned last year, are pretty lumpy. We had a really low level in the first quarter, fairly low level in the fourth quarter but strong small project inbound in the second and third quarter. Last year was just under about $0.5 billion. Obviously, with the downturn in the industry, some of those are going to come under pressure. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we'll be somewhere close to that because those projects, the capital requirements are a bit less. They have shorter paybacks. They're in the Gulf of Mexico where we have -- typically where we have a stronger position, so we think the smaller projects will be somewhere in that range may be a little bit less it's the large projects that make up the difference and those are where a lot of the uncertainty in the industry are today, and that was really the basis of my remarks. Absent a significant number of large projects being awarded in 2016, we can't hit or match the same Subsea inbound number that we had in 2016. So it depend. We expect the couple of those to be awarded and are well positioned and that will be on top of the service and small project inbound orders that we're projecting for 2016."

We shouldn't expect this cycle to be any different. I think what we're trying to articulate is to improve project economics requires not incremental reductions in cost but significant and sustainable reductions in cost, which is what we are focused on because the challenge for the entire industry when oil prices were much differently than they are today was to improve economics. We know that improving execution on these major projects is critical to improving project economics. We know the industry has not adopted low-cost standards, which now we see as an opportunity to push even harder, and we see examples as I related on the Greater Western Flank for more standardization. We also believe that technology can contribute significantly to reducing cost, and we're investing in that. And then finally, these new business models, which I think is represented again by the tray sac award and the willingness of a very progressive and successful company like Statoil willing to consider and adopt an entirely different business model for the purpose of a step change in project cost. Despite all that, we know that there'll still be some pricing pressure that will find its way of margins. Every cycle has been that way. We want to mitigate that by improving our cost position, and we think we can do that. Now where that settles out, we're going to have to see. But I think it's just go by past cycles, there's been pressure on margins as a result of pricing, and we should assume that's going to be the case again."

So our inbound and our revenue are typically very closely matched. We got a pretty small amount in backlog. And then the last would be our ability to recognize revenue from current inbound. We call that book and turn. So for 2016, what I have said is we're expecting very little to be able to book and turn to be able to achieve our 2016 inbound just simply because of the variability that's happening on that inbound number as John mentioned. To the extent that, that develops greater or more rapidly, then that could be an upside for us for 2016."

My other question had to do with these very considerable cost savings, restructuring steps you're taking that in response to the downturn, especially in Subsea.

Now to put a margin percent on that, I think as Doug pointed out, is still early days. But we want to point out that a lot of the steps that we're taking are not just in response to lower activity that they are in fact sustainable. Where does that come from? Over the course of the last 3 or 4 years, we've made significant progress in globalizing our manufacturing organization, creating global standards. Today, we make a Subsea Christmas tree in many locations, but we make it the exact same way. That didn't exist 5 and 10 years ago. So we're in a position now where through standard practices and process, we can level low throughout the world. We can reduce our facilities yet still keep our footprint, yet still keep our ability to execute at a high level. So that's an important example of how are permanently reducing our cost. We've been able to delayer our organization quite frankly where there because of our struggles with execution because of the rapid growth. Now that we have a more normal or expect a more normal growth cycle, and our execution has improved, we don't need the same level of structure so as a result, we're confident that we can essentially lean out our organization in a way that is sustainable and permanent. Now we haven't put a number on it because we want to be we wanted to be honest, Robin you want to see it before we start putting a number on it, but we're very encouraged by the subsequent taking and the impacts will having a long-term cost structure of our company even in the market recovery."

We were able to reduce our cost at the Subsea equipment by something close to 40% for Johan Castberg. Statoil has put a target out there for further double-digit reductions in costs. So I think the point we would want to make is that fairly quickly now, the economics are improving because of the step change in cost of these projects. And Statoil, I think, is a good example of not only the progress they made for Johan Sverdrup, but the target they put in place for further reductions I think when you get down to those levels what Statoil did on Sverdrup and what they plan to do in Castberg, significant number of deepwater projects become economic and breakeven."

On the call today is Maryann Mannen, our Chief Financial Officer; and Doug Pferdehirt, our President and Chief Operating Officer, who is joining us from another location. I'll focus my comments today on 2015 performance and our market outlook for the current year. Maryann will provide specifics on our quarterly and full year financial performance as well as our financial outlook for 2016. We'll then open up the call for your questions.
In 2015, global upstream spending declined approximately 25% as a result of falling commodity prices. North America markets were impacted greater than most, experiencing the steepest activity decline seen in nearly 3 decades. Clearly, this was a very challenging year for the energy industry.
FMC Technologies entered the downturn with solid operational momentum, and we responded early with aggressive restructuring actions across all of our businesses. This wasn't just a reaction to declining activity levels. It was a fundamental change in the way we manage our business, aimed at providing meaningful and sustainable cost savings. Our efforts focused on driving better execution, product and process standardization, innovative technology and integrated business models. These are important steps that we believe will put the company in an even stronger competitive position.
In 2015, we were able to deliver on several key metrics. In Subsea Technologies, margins increased for a fourth consecutive year. For the full year, excluding all restructuring charges, we achieved Subsea margins of 15.1%. The strong results were driven by the strength of our backlog and the continued trend of solid execution.
We also finished the year with $3.1 billion of inbound orders in our Subsea Technology segment, achieving our full year target of at least $3 billion. For the quarter, our Subsea inbound orders totaled $490 million, which included the recently announced award for the Woodside Greater Western Flank Phase 2 project on the North West Shelf of Australia. This was an important award from a long-standing alliance partner with deliveries expected to extend through 2018.
As we look forward, operators are now not only challenged to improve project economics, but the sharp decline in oil prices is limiting their capital spending plans. Customer priorities continue to evolve, but the message is clear. Operators are determined to live within their cash flows, putting the burden of balancing budgets on capital spending.
Although it's unlikely that today's commodity prices reflect the assumptions used for long-term project economics, oil prices do impact current cash flow. The increasing level of commodity price volatility creates even more uncertainty around these cash flows. And even though project economics are improving, the pace of large-scale developments will be driven by operator cash flow, and this is different than past cycles.
But even in this more challenging environment, we have been successful in working with our customers to bring down costs and make projects economic. Our initiatives are working. The award for the Woodside Greater Western Flank Phase 2 project is a great example of this success. With this project, we adopted the same standard that had been used on a previous development and significantly reduced the project management and engineering hours. We also used existing tools to install and test the equipment. By using standard FMC specifications, we were able to reduce inspection points by more than 50%. And finally, we leaned out the documentation process for additional savings. Much of this success came from the operator's willingness to accept a vendor-based approach versus the traditional client-specific requirements.
As we think about our Subsea order potential for 2016, I want to talk about the major components that make up our Subsea inbound: Services, small projects and large projects. Broadly speaking, we expect Subsea service orders to remain fairly resilient with only modest declines driven by the level of installation work. We expect a somewhat lower level of order activity for smaller projects in 2016. These projects are not immune to spending reductions, but they typically have lower cash outlays and can provide operators with a relatively quick payback.
Now forecasting order levels for larger projects is a challenge in the current environment. There are a number of large projects that we're tracking, and we do see the potential for some of these projects to be awarded in the current year. However, we don't foresee any $0.5 billion to $1 billion megaprojects being awarded this year, and that will make it difficult for us to match the level of Subsea orders that we received in 2015.
Despite the Subsea order uncertainty, we as a company remain focused on our initiatives to improve deepwater project economics. We also believe that we can do even more with our integrated business models, and that's what we're doing with our Forsys Subsea joint venture with Technip. Earlier this week, the joint venture announced the award of another integrated FEED contract, this one from Statoil for the development of their Trestakk field. We're encouraged by Statoil's willingness to adopt a different business model. The Forsys Subsea approach is gaining traction and Trestakk is an important example of that progress.
Our Subsea business cost structure, we believe, has the potential for significant savings. Specifically we're focused on optimizing our global manufacturing operations, standardizing our processes and product offerings and further integrating our global supply chain. These actions will provide sustainable structural benefits that will ensure that we retain, if not improve, our cost advantage.
At the same time, we'll preserve our core engineering and project management capabilities. Further, we will continue to invest in new technologies and expand our customer relationships. Collectively, these actions will strengthen our Subsea business and ensure that we're prepared for an eventual market recovery.
Let me now turn to our Surface Technologies segment. Revenues for the quarter were down 12% sequentially. However, once we adjust for all charges, we closed out the quarter with an adjusted margin just above 10% despite the severe activity declines posted throughout North America in 2015. Activity levels for our international surface wellhead business held up sequentially, but we're seeing the impact of pricing pressure as a result of the deteriorating global market.
We expect activity levels outside of North America to remain resilient in 2016. We moved aggressively to streamline our North America business, and our actions have been focused on more than just responding to the lower activity levels. We're approaching this market in a fundamentally different way. We restructured our management organization, consolidated our service lines and integrated our products and service offering. These actions will create greater efficiencies and drive better operational performance, and they'll further improve our position in the North America onshore market. This approach has been a key driver in expanding our customer base and resulting in new contract awards.
Let me end with 2 main points. First, deepwater operators are behaving differently in this current cycle. Cash flow and uncertainty are affecting near-term decisions. But we are making an impact on deepwater project economics. We're driving cost lower and reducing operator risk through product standardization, new technologies and new business models. The Woodside Greater Western Flank and Statoil Trestakk projects are 2 tangible examples of our success.
Second, we are intensely focused on what we can control, taking aggressive actions across the entire company. Most importantly, our restructuring activities go beyond workforce and facility reductions. We're using the downturn as a catalyst to fundamentally change the way we manage our organization so that we can sustainably deliver our products and services in an effective and cost-efficient manner regardless of the market conditions.
Maryann will now take you through the financial details in the quarter and for the full year and provide a more detailed explanation of our 2016 expectations."
972117,314774890,934657,"FMC Technologies, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 17, 2016",2016-02-17,"Earnings Calls","FMC Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, John. Our fourth quarter diluted earnings per share were $0.46 when excluding certain charges of $73 million or $0.22 per diluted share incurred in the quarter. As we indicated last quarter, we took further restructuring actions in the fourth quar",1890,"Thanks, John. Our fourth quarter diluted earnings per share were $0.46 when excluding certain charges of $73 million or $0.22 per diluted share incurred in the quarter. As we indicated last quarter, we took further restructuring actions in the fourth quarter. Included in our reported results are pretax charges of $31 million for restructuring actions or $0.10 per diluted share. Also included in the quarterly results are pretax inventory adjustments of $42 million due to the prolonged lower activity levels in North America.
The inventory write-downs include a $36 million charge in our Surface Technologies segment. The remaining $6 million was recorded in our Energy Infrastructure segment. These inventory adjustments reduced our reported earnings by $0.12 per diluted share. We have provided a schedule in our press release issued last evening to show the quarterly and full year impact of these costs incurred.
Looking at the full year, we undertook a significant amount of restructuring in response to the decline in market activity in North America as well as the forecast reductions for 2016 in our Subsea business. The combined charges in 2015 for restructuring and other severance as well as impairments totaled $132 million before tax.
In the Surface Technologies segment, we incurred $74 million of charges for restructuring our facilities, impairment of assets and headcount reductions. We expect these actions to have benefit in 2016 as we operate on a lower cost base and in a lower rig count environment. In our Subsea Technologies segment, we incurred $50 million of charges, primarily for headcount reduction taken in the second half of the year. Activity levels remained strong in this segment through the first 3 quarters of 2015. Energy Infrastructure incurred $8 million for restructuring. This occurred mainly in the measurement solutions business where the low North American activity levels reduced market opportunities.
Collectively, these actions will further strengthen our operating performance as we manage through the soft market conditions we expect will continue throughout 2016 both in North America as well as in our Subsea business. When adjusting for our restructuring and impairment costs, including inventory write-downs of $49 million, full year EPS was $2.27 for 2015.
Moving to our operating segments. Subsea Technologies revenue in the quarter was $1 billion. Quarter-over-quarter revenue comparisons were negatively impacted by $134 million of foreign currency translations. Lower subsea services activity, primarily intervention services as well as lower project activity, contributed to the quarter-over-quarter results. Subsea Technologies operating profit was $132 million in the quarter, excluding restructuring and other severance and impairment charges of $25 million.
Quarter-over-quarter profit comparisons were negatively impacted by $15 million of foreign currency translations due to the strong U.S. dollar. Operating margins in the quarter were 12.9%, excluding restructuring and other severance and impairment charges. Excluding all charges and the impact of foreign currency translation, operating profit was down approximately 29% quarter-over-quarter. The decline was driven primarily by the lower revenues, reduced well intervention activities in the North Sea and higher research and development expense due to the timing of expenditures. We experienced headwinds from the strengthening U.S. dollar throughout the year.
For the full year, Subsea revenue included $540 million of unfavorable impact, and operating profit included $77 million of unfavorable impact due to the strong U.S. dollar. Full year Subsea margins, excluding restructuring and impairment charges, were 15.1%, consistent with our estimates throughout the year as our project execution continued to support solid operating margins. We began significant headcount reductions in the second half of 2015 as project volumes began to weaken.
We expect to take further actions in the first quarter of this year. These actions and continued strong operational performance will support us as our Subsea volumes declined from 2015 levels. Segment backlog exiting this quarter was $3.8 billion. This compares to prior year backlog of $5.8 billion. Some of this backlog has a longer delivery horizon and will be recognized over the next 3 years.
Moving to our Surface Technologies results. Surface Technologies reported an operating loss for the fourth quarter of $7 million, including restructuring and other severance impairment charges of $3 million. When excluding the severance, restructuring and impairment charges as well as the inventory adjustments, we posted operating profit of $32 million and an operating margin of 10.1% in the quarter.
As was mentioned earlier, we had significant inventory adjustments that impacted our Surface Technologies segment. During the quarter, we took a write-down of $36 million for inventory. Most of the write-down was related to our North American businesses where sharp activity declines drove significant reductions to future demand estimates for the region. However, the underlying results represent the continued decline in activity in our North America business.
Operational profit performance was supported by the benefit of the restructuring efforts made throughout the year. In some international regions though, activity levels have proven to be more resilient. However, as we noted last quarter, our operating results now reflect pricing challenges across all major geographies, including our surface wellhead business outside North America.
We have taken significant restructuring actions in our Surface Technologies business. These actions focused both on reducing our operating cost structure in North America and restructuring the business model to deliver an integrated product offering intended to bring greater value to our customers. On a full year basis, our operating margins were 11.8% when excluding restructuring, impairment and inventory charges, reflecting the benefit of restructuring activities taken earlier in the year.
While we expect the weak activity levels in North America to persist throughout 2016, these actions will further improve our operating competitiveness through our significant workforce reductions and implementation of our integrated product offering. Segment backlog stands at $433 million. This continues to predominantly be reflective of our surface wellhead business outside of North America.
Moving to Energy Infrastructure. Revenue for the fourth quarter was $96 million. The segment reported operating losses of $3 million, including $4 million of restructuring and other severance charges. Additionally, we incurred charges of $6 million in the quarter for the write-down of inventory of our measurement solutions business due to lack of demand from weak activity. Segment results continued to be negatively impacted by the sharp activity decline in the North America market.
Let's turn to the corporate items. Corporate expense in the quarter was $15 million. Other revenue and expense net reflects expense of $23 million. The majority of expense relates to foreign currency losses primarily associated with the currency devaluation of the Angolan kwanza. Our fourth quarter tax rate was negative 8.7%, due in part to a favorable shift in geographic earnings mix and the reinstatement of a research and development tax credit enacted in late December. Our full year tax rate was 21.4% due in part to the lower mix of earnings subject to U.S. tax.
Capital spending this quarter was $40 million. This brings our spending in 2015 to $251 million. We generated solid cash flow from operations of $932 million. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had net debt of $240 million. It is comprised of $960 million of cash and $1.2 billion of debt.
We averaged 230 million diluted shares outstanding in the quarter. We repurchased 1.3 million shares of stock during the fourth quarter at an average cost of $31.23 per share. For the full year, we repurchased a total of 5.3 million shares for a total cost of $190.4 million.
Let me next discuss our outlook for 2016. We expect Energy Infrastructure revenue to be down by approximately 5% year-over-year. Revenues will continue to be negatively impacted by the weak North American market in our measurement solutions business. Therefore, we do not expect a recovery in this business this year. However, we do expect the benefits from prior year restructuring to favorably impact segment profitability in 2016. We expect full year margins in the high single digits.
Given the recent rig count decline, Surface Technologies revenue is now expected to be down 15% to 20% from 2015 due to uncertain North American market activity. We are not assuming a recovery from current rig count levels. Full year operating margins are targeted at high single digits, excluding any restructuring charges that may be necessary. While we will benefit from the restructuring actions taken in 2015 and those forthcoming in 2016, pricing pressure in both our North America and international business provides significant headwinds at these activity levels.
Subsea revenue for the full year in 2016 should be approximately $3.6 billion. We expect revenue from our Subsea backlog of approximately $2.2 billion. For our subsea services business, we expect revenues of approximately $1.3 billion, down modestly from 2015. Startups of certain services are expected in April of this year with lower utilization expected than prior years.
Given the lower visibility for inbound, as John has discussed, we are assuming a minimal amount of revenue from current year inbound. This would, therefore, be a source of upside to our 2016 revenues if inbound were stronger. We continue to expect Subsea margins in the range of 11% to 13%, excluding any restructuring charges that are likely in 2016. Further cost reductions will help offset the expected revenue decline. When combined with continued strong execution on our backlog, we see the potential to deliver margins above the midpoint of the guidance range.
I'll now provide you with guidance on our corporate items. In 2016, we expect corporate expense to be approximately $15 million to $16 million per quarter. We expect other revenue and expense to be an expense of approximately $13 million to $14 million per quarter with the potential for further foreign currency fluctuations. We expect our 2016 full year tax rate to be between 23% and 25%. Our earnings subject to U.S. income tax are expected to be lower in 2016.
We expect capital spending for the year of approximately $180 million. This represents a 28% reduction from 2015. This spending does not include any contingent capital that may be needed to respond to a contract award. We do anticipate further restructuring will be necessary as the market activity provides better clarity on the impact on future periods. We will continue to provide guidance as we estimate the cost and benefits of these actions.
Let me now close with the following comments. Given the latest move down in the U.S. rig count, our Surface Technologies segment performance has become more difficult to forecast. We are responding with additional headcount reduction as well as further facility consolidations and closures. Our efforts in the last year to provide an integrated service offering should support our growth when this market recovers.
In Subsea, we have a solid backlog to deliver the 2016 estimates provided albeit lower than in previous years. Our headcount reduction should partially offset the revenue decline forecast in 2016, and our project execution should allow us to deliver solid operating performance, supporting operating margin guidance.
As 2016 Subsea inbound develops, we are prepared to take further actions where needed. We are working to optimize our global footprint to deliver sustainable, superior performance now and when the deepwater and North America markets recover. While managing the company through extreme market uncertainty present certain challenges, we remain focused on preserving and further developing our technical capabilities and customer relationships and maintaining our market leadership.

We believe that, that margin range, 11% to 13%, is still valid, but the bias towards the high end is not. Why? Because over the last 4 months, we've seen a deterioration in, obviously, in oil prices and the market. It's going to, to some degree, affect revenues. Revenue declined in 2016 more so than we saw 4 months ago. And despite, as Maryann mentioned, our efforts to restructure and reduce cost, that's going to put some margin pressure. Further, as you know, the whole industry has faced -- has been faced over the last couple of months of even more intense pricing pressure, and so the combination of those 2 things take us off that earlier comment about being on the high end of that 11% to 13% range."

Add to that the cost reduction that we've been implementing really ahead of the downturn. I think that's kind of important. When you think about prior downturns, we had that big Subsea backlog, we may have been a little delayed in taking action. That's not the case this time. We're acting -- when you think about it, Subsea revenues in 2015, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, are only down 5%, yet we have been taking restructuring actions well in advance of that activity downturn. So I think the cost reduction actions that we've taken quickly and aggressively, the quality of our margins and backlog for Subsea and our good work in holding up the subsea services activity is what's contributing to what you're referred to, I think, as robust margins."

In the past, capital budgets, although maybe reduced, were fixed. The emphasis was always on improving project economics. Once they are improved, met the hurdle rates, they had a pretty good chance of that project going forward. That's all changed now. Even though project economics have been improved -- I was in Norway last week, and Statoil has made remarkable progress, in part through some of our help to reduce their breakeven on major projects from $70 a barrel to $40 a barrel, and there's a lot more that we can do. But even when you improve project economics, it doesn't mean a project will go ahead because of the restrictions on cash flow, which is driven by the current oil price. But you're right. At some point, as we continue to improve project economics and cash flow hopefully will start to improve, that the operators will realize the importance of greenlighting some of these projects and taking the steps to develop these deepwater fields for the purpose of replacing production in future years. I think that we'll have to look at the cycle differently, and we have to take into account the importance of cash flow as they approve those projects."

We had a really low level in the first quarter, fairly low level in the fourth quarter, but strong small project inbound in the second and third quarter. Last year was just under about $0.5 billion. Obviously, with the downturn in the industry, some of those are going to come under pressure. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we'll be somewhere -- hopefully, we'll be somewhere close to that because those projects, their -- the capital requirements are a bit less. They have shorter paybacks. They're in the Gulf of Mexico where we have a -- typically where we have a stronger position. So we think the smaller projects will be somewhere in that range, maybe a little bit less. It's the large projects that make up the difference, and those are where a lot of the uncertainty in the industry are today. And that was really the basis of my remarks. We -- absent a significant number of large projects being awarded in 2016, we can't hit or match the same Subsea inbound number that we had in 2015.

Can you help us think about the margin opportunity for FMC for some of these new orders relative to maybe where your backlog is. I understand obviously that [indiscernible] on pricing, but it seems like you're using less engineering hours.

We shouldn't expect this cycle to be any different. I think what we're trying to articulate is to improve project economics requires not incremental reductions in cost but significant and sustainable reductions in cost, which is what we are focused on because we -- it's a challenge for the entire industry, even when oil prices were much differently than they are today, was to improve economics. We know that improving execution on these major projects is critical to improving project economics. We know the industry has not adopted low-cost standards, which now we see as an opportunity to push even harder, and we see examples as I related on the Greater Western Flank for more standardization. We also believe that technology can contribute significantly to reducing cost and we're investing in that. And then finally, these new business models, which I think is represented again by the Trestakk award and the willingness of a very progressive and successful company like Statoil, willing to consider and adopt an entirely different business model for the purpose of a step change in project cost. Despite all that, we know that there will still be some pricing pressure that will find its way on margins. Every cycle has been that way. We want to mitigate that by improving our cost position, and we think we can do that. Now where that settles out, we're going to have to see. But I think if you just go by past cycles, there's been pressure on the margins as a result of pricing, and we should assume that's going to be the case again."

Now to put a margin percent on that, I think what's -- as Doug pointed out, it's still early days. But we want to point out that a lot of the steps that we're taking are not just in response to lower activity that they are in fact sustainable. Where does that come from? Over the course of the last 3 or 4 years, we've made significant progress in globalizing our manufacturing organization, creating global standards. Today, we make a Subsea Christmas tree in many locations, but we make it the exact same way. That didn't exist 5 and 10 years ago. So we're in a position now where, through standard practices and process, we can level low throughout the world, we can reduce our facilities, yet still keep our footprint, yet still keep our ability to execute at a high level. So that's an important example of how we're permanently reducing our cost. We have been able to delayer our organization. A lot of layers in our organization, quite frankly, where there -- because of our struggles with execution, because of the rapid growth. Now that we have a more normal -- or expect a more normal growth cycle and our execution has improved, we don't need the same level of structure. So as a result, we're confident that we can essentially lean out our organization in a way that is sustainable and permanent. Now we haven't put a number on it because we want to be -- but we want to -- to be honestly honest, Robin, we want to see it before we start putting a number on it. But we're very, very encouraged by the subs we're taking and the impact it will having on the long-term cost structure of our company, even in a market recovery."

We were able to reduce our cost at the Subsea equipment by something close to 40% for Johan Castberg. Statoil has put a target out there for further double-digit reductions in cost.

On the call today is Maryann Mannen, our Chief Financial Officer; and Doug Pferdehirt, our President and Chief Operating Officer, who is joining us from another location. I'll focus my comments today on 2015 performance and our market outlook for the current year. Maryann will provide specifics on our quarterly and full year financial performance as well as our financial outlook for 2016. We'll then open up the call for your questions.
In 2015, global upstream spending declined approximately 25% as a result of falling commodity prices. North America markets were impacted greater than most, experiencing the steepest activity decline seen in nearly 3 decades. Clearly, this was a very challenging year for the energy industry.
FMC Technologies entered the downturn with solid operational momentum, and we responded early with aggressive restructuring actions across all of our businesses. This wasn't just a reaction to declining activity levels. It was a fundamental change in the way we manage our business, aimed at providing meaningful and sustainable cost savings. Our efforts focused on driving better execution, product and process standardization, innovative technology and integrated business models. These are important steps that we believe will put the company in an even stronger competitive position.
In 2015, we were able to deliver on several key metrics. In Subsea Technologies, margins increased for a fourth consecutive year. For the full year, excluding all restructuring charges, we achieved Subsea margins of 15.1%. The strong results were driven by the strength of our backlog and the continued trend of solid execution.
We also finished the year with $3.1 billion of inbound orders in our Subsea Technologies segment, achieving our full year target of at least $3 billion. For the quarter, our Subsea inbound orders totaled $490 million, which included the recently announced award for the Woodside Greater Western Flank Phase 2 project on the North West Shelf of Australia. This was an important award from a long-standing alliance partner, with deliveries expected to extend through 2018.
As we look forward, operators are now not only challenged to improve project economics, but the sharp decline in oil prices is limiting their capital spending plans. Customer priorities continue to evolve, but the message is clear. Operators are determined to live within their cash flows, putting the burden of balancing budgets on capital spending.
Although it's unlikely that today's commodity prices reflect the assumptions used for long-term project economics, oil prices do impact current cash flow. The increasing level of commodity price volatility creates even more uncertainty around these cash flows. And even though project economics are improving, the pace of large-scale developments will be driven by operator cash flow, and this is different than past cycles.
But even in this more challenging environment, we have been successful in working with our customers to bring down costs and make projects economic. Our initiatives are working. The award for the Woodside Greater Western Flank Phase 2 project is a great example of this success. With this project, we adopted the same standard that had been used on a previous development and significantly reduced the project management and engineering hours. We also used existing tools to install and test the equipment. By using standard FMC specifications, we were able to reduce inspection points by more than 50%. And finally, we leaned out the documentation process for additional savings. Much of this success came from the operator's willingness to accept a vendor-based approach versus the traditional client-specific requirements.
As we think about our Subsea order potential for 2016, I want to talk about the major components that make up our Subsea inbound: Services, small projects and large projects. Broadly speaking, we expect Subsea service orders to remain fairly resilient, with only modest declines driven by the level of installation work. We expect a somewhat lower level of order activity for smaller projects in 2016. These projects are not immune to spending reductions, but they typically have lower cash outlays and can provide operators with a relatively quick payback.
Now forecasting order levels for larger projects is a challenge in the current environment. There are a number of large projects that we're tracking, and we do see the potential for some of these projects to be awarded in the current year. However, we don't foresee any $0.5 billion to $1 billion megaprojects being awarded this year, and that will make it difficult for us to match the level of Subsea orders that we received in 2015.
Despite the Subsea order uncertainty, we as a company remain focused on our initiatives to improve deepwater project economics. We also believe that we can do even more with our integrated business models, and that's what we're doing with our Forsys Subsea joint venture with Technip. Earlier this week, the joint venture announced the award of another integrated FEED contract, this one from Statoil for the development of their Trestakk field. We're encouraged by Statoil's willingness to adopt a different business model. The Forsys Subsea approach is gaining traction and Trestakk is an important example of that progress.
Our Subsea business cost structure, we believe, has the potential for significant savings. Specifically we're focused on optimizing our global manufacturing operations, standardizing our processes and product offerings and further integrating our global supply chain. These actions will provide sustainable structural benefits that will ensure that we retain, if not improve, our cost advantage.
At the same time, we'll preserve our core engineering and project management capabilities. Further, we will continue to invest in new technologies and expand our customer relationships. Collectively, these actions will strengthen our Subsea business and ensure that we're prepared for an eventual market recovery.
Let me now turn to our Surface Technologies segment. Revenues for the quarter were down 12% sequentially. However, once we adjust for all charges, we closed out the quarter with an adjusted margin just above 10% despite the severe activity declines posted throughout North America in 2015. Activity levels for our international surface wellhead business held up sequentially, but we're seeing the impact of pricing pressure as a result of the deteriorating global market.
We expect activity levels outside of North America to remain resilient in 2016. We moved aggressively to streamline our North America business, and our actions have been focused on more than just responding to the lower activity levels. We're approaching this market in a fundamentally different way. We restructured our management organization, consolidated our service lines and integrated our products and service offering. These actions will create greater efficiencies and drive better operational performance, and they'll further improve our position in the North America onshore market. This approach has been a key driver in expanding our customer base and resulting in new contract awards.
Let me end with 2 main points. First, deepwater operators are behaving differently in this current cycle. Cash flow and uncertainty are affecting near-term decisions. But we are making an impact on deepwater project economics. We're driving cost lower and reducing operator risk through product standardization, new technologies and new business models. The Woodside Greater Western Flank and Statoil Trestakk projects are 2 tangible examples of our success.
Second, we are intensely focused on what we can control, taking aggressive actions across the entire company. Most importantly, our restructuring activities go beyond workforce and facility reductions. We're using the downturn as a catalyst to fundamentally change the way we manage our organization so that we can sustainably deliver our products and services in an effective and cost-efficient manner regardless of the market conditions.
Maryann will now take you through the financial details in the quarter and for the full year and provide a more detailed explanation of our 2016 expectations."
972117,314774890,934811,"FMC Technologies, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 17, 2016",2016-02-17,"Earnings Calls","FMC Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, John. Our fourth quarter diluted earnings per share were $0.46 when excluding certain charges of $73 million or $0.22 per diluted share incurred in the quarter. As we indicated last quarter, we took further restructuring actions in the fourth quar",1888,"Thanks, John. Our fourth quarter diluted earnings per share were $0.46 when excluding certain charges of $73 million or $0.22 per diluted share incurred in the quarter. As we indicated last quarter, we took further restructuring actions in the fourth quarter. Included in our reported results are pretax charges of $31 million for restructuring actions or $0.10 per diluted share. Also included in the quarterly results are pretax inventory adjustments of $42 million due to the prolonged lower activity levels in North America.
The inventory write-downs include a $36 million charge in our Surface Technologies segment. The remaining $6 million was recorded in our Energy Infrastructure segment. These inventory adjustments reduced our reported earnings by $0.12 per diluted share. We have provided a schedule in our press release issued last evening to show the quarterly and full year impact of these costs incurred.
Looking at the full year, we undertook a significant amount of restructuring in response to the decline in market activity in North America as well as the forecast reductions for 2016 in our Subsea business. The combined charges in 2015 for restructuring and other severance as well as impairments totaled $132 million before tax.
In the Surface Technologies segment, we incurred $74 million of charges for restructuring our facilities, impairment of assets and headcount reductions. We expect these actions to have benefit in 2016 as we operate on a lower cost base and in a lower rig count environment. In our Subsea Technologies segment, we incurred $50 million of charges, primarily for headcount reduction taken in the second half of the year. Activity levels remained strong in this segment through the first 3 quarters of 2015. Energy Infrastructure incurred $8 million for restructuring. This occurred mainly in the measurement solutions business where the low North American activity levels reduced market opportunities.
Collectively, these actions will further strengthen our operating performance as we manage through the soft market conditions we expect will continue throughout 2016 both in North America as well as in our Subsea business. When adjusting for all restructuring and impairment costs, including inventory write-downs of $49 million, full year EPS was $2.27 for 2015.
Moving to our operating segments. Subsea Technologies revenue in the quarter was $1 billion. Quarter-over-quarter revenue comparisons were negatively impacted by $134 million of foreign currency translations. Lower subsea services activity, primarily intervention services as well as lower project activity, contributed to the quarter-over-quarter results. Subsea Technologies operating profit was $132 million in the quarter, excluding restructuring and other severance and impairment charges of $25 million.
Quarter-over-quarter profit comparisons were negatively impacted by $15 million of foreign currency translation due to the strong U.S. dollar. Operating margins in the quarter were 12.9%, excluding restructuring and other severance and impairment charges. Excluding all charges and the impact of foreign currency translation, operating profit was down approximately 29% quarter-over-quarter. The decline was driven primarily by the lower revenues, reduced well intervention activities in the North Sea and higher research and development expense due to the timing of expenditures. We experienced headwinds from the strengthening U.S. dollar throughout the year.
For the full year, Subsea revenue included $540 million of unfavorable impact, and operating profit included $77 million of unfavorable impact due to the strong U.S. dollar. Full year Subsea margins, excluding restructuring and impairment charges, were 15.1%, consistent with our estimates throughout the year as our project execution continued to support solid operating margins. We began significant headcount reductions in the second half of 2015 as project volumes began to weaken.
We expect to take further actions in the first quarter of this year. These actions and continued strong operational performance will support us as our Subsea volumes decline from 2015 levels. Segment backlog exiting this quarter was $3.8 billion. This compares to prior year backlog of $5.8 billion. Some of this backlog has a longer delivery horizon and will be recognized over the next 3 years.
Moving to our Surface Technologies results. Surface Technologies reported an operating loss for the fourth quarter of $7 million, including restructuring and other severance impairment charges of $3 million. When excluding the severance, restructuring and impairment charges as well as the inventory adjustments, we posted operating profit of $32 million and an operating margin of 10.1% in the quarter.
As was mentioned earlier, we had significant inventory adjustments that impacted our Surface Technologies segment. During the quarter, we took a write-down of $36 million for inventory. Most of the write-down was related to our North American businesses where sharp activity declines drove significant reduction to future demand estimates for the region. However, the underlying results represent the continued decline in activity in our North America business.
Operational profit performance was supported by the benefit of the restructuring efforts made throughout the year. In some international regions, though, activity levels have proven to be more resilient. However, as we noted last quarter, our operating results now reflect pricing challenges across all major geographies, including our surface wellhead business outside North America.
We have taken significant restructuring actions in our Surface Technologies business. These actions focused both on reducing our operating cost structure in North America and restructuring the business model to deliver an integrated product offering intended to bring greater value to our customers. On a full year basis, our operating margins were 11.8% when excluding restructuring, impairment and inventory charges, reflecting the benefit of restructuring activities taken earlier in the year.
While we expect the weak activity levels in North America to persist throughout 2016, these actions will further improve our operating competitiveness through our significant workforce reductions and implementation of our integrated product offering. Segment backlog stands at $433 million. This continues to predominantly be reflective of our surface wellhead business outside of North America.
Moving to Energy Infrastructure. Revenue for the fourth quarter was $96 million. The segment reported operating losses of $3 million, including $4 million of restructuring and other severance charges. Additionally, we incurred charges of $6 million in the quarter for the write-down of inventory of our measurement solutions business due to lack of demand from weak activity. Segment results continued to be negatively impacted by the sharp activity decline in the North America market.
Let's turn to corporate items. Corporate expense in the quarter was $15 million. Other revenue and expense net reflects expense of $23 million. The majority of expense relates to foreign currency losses primarily associated with the currency devaluation of the Angolan kwanza. Our fourth quarter tax rate was negative 8.7%, due in part to a favorable shift in geographic earnings mix and the reinstatement of a research and development tax credit enacted in late December. Our full year tax rate was 21.4% due in part to the lower mix of earnings subject to U.S. tax.
Capital spending this quarter was $40 million. This brings our spending in 2015 to $251 million. We generated solid cash flow from operations of $932 million. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had net debt of $240 million. It is comprised of $916 million of cash and $1.2 billion of debt.
We averaged 230 million diluted shares outstanding in the quarter. We repurchased 1.3 million shares of stock during the fourth quarter at an average cost of $31.23 per share. For the full year, we repurchased a total of 5.3 million shares for a total cost of $190.4 million.
Let me next discuss our outlook for 2016. We expect Energy Infrastructure revenue to be down by approximately 5% year-over-year. Revenues will continue to be negatively impacted by the weak North American market in our measurement solutions business. Therefore, we do not expect a recovery in this business this year. However, we do expect the benefits from prior year restructuring to favorably impact segment profitability in 2016. We expect full year margins in the high single digits.
Given the recent rig count decline, Surface Technologies revenue is now expected to be down 15% to 20% from 2015 due to uncertain North American market activity. We are not assuming a recovery from current rig count levels. Full year operating margins are targeted at high single digits, excluding any restructuring charges that may be necessary. While we will benefit from the restructuring actions taken in 2015 and those forthcoming in 2016, pricing pressure in both our North America and international business provides significant headwinds at these activity levels.
Subsea revenue for the full year in 2016 should be approximately $3.6 billion. We expect revenue from our Subsea backlog of approximately $2.2 billion. For our subsea services business, we expect revenues of approximately $1.3 billion, down modestly from 2015. Startups of certain services are expected in April of this year with lower utilization expected than prior years.
Given the lower visibility for inbound, as John has discussed, we are assuming a minimal amount of revenue from current year inbound. This would, therefore, be a source of upside to our 2016 revenues if inbound were stronger. We continue to expect Subsea margins in the range of 11% to 13%, excluding any restructuring charges that are likely in 2016. Further cost reductions will help offset the expected revenue decline. When combined with continued strong execution on our backlog, we see the potential to deliver margins above the midpoint of the guidance range.
I'll now provide you with guidance on our corporate items. In 2016, we expect corporate expense to be approximately $15 million to $16 million per quarter. We expect other revenue and expense to be an expense of approximately $13 million to $14 million per quarter with the potential for further foreign currency fluctuations. We expect our 2016 full year tax rate to be between 23% and 25%. Our earnings subject to U.S. income tax are expected to be lower in 2016.
We expect capital spending for the year of approximately $180 million. This represents a 28% reduction from 2015. This spending does not include any contingent capital that may be needed to respond to a contract award. We do anticipate further restructuring will be necessary as market activity provides better clarity on the impact on future periods. We will continue to provide guidance as we estimate the cost and benefits of these actions.
Let me now close with the following comments. Given the latest move down in the U.S. rig count, our Surface Technologies segment performance has become more difficult to forecast. We are responding with additional headcount reduction as well as further facility consolidations and closures. Our efforts in the last year to provide an integrated service offering should support our growth when this market recovers.
In Subsea, we have a solid backlog to deliver the 2016 estimates provided, albeit lower than in previous years. Our headcount reduction should partially offset the revenue decline forecast in 2016, and our project execution should allow us to deliver solid operating performance, supporting operating margin guidance.
As 2016 Subsea inbound develops, we are prepared to take further actions where needed. We are working to optimize our global footprint to deliver sustainable, superior performance now and when the deepwater and North America markets recover. While managing the company through extreme market uncertainty presents certain challenges, we remain focused on preserving and further developing our technical capabilities and customer relationships and maintaining our market leadership.

We believe that, that margin range, 11% to 13%, is still valid, but the bias towards the high end is not. Why? Because over the last 4 months, we've seen a deterioration in, obviously, in oil prices and the market. It's going to, to some degree, affect revenues. Revenue declined in 2016 more so than we saw 4 months ago. And despite, as Maryann mentioned, our efforts to restructure and reduce cost, that's going to put some margin pressure. Further, as you know, the whole industry has faced -- has been faced over the last couple of months of even more intense pricing pressure, and so the combination of those 2 things take us off that earlier comment about being on the high end of that 11% to 13% range."

Add to that the cost reduction that we've been implementing really ahead of the downturn. I think that's kind of important. When you think about prior downturns, we had that big Subsea backlog, we may have been a little delayed in taking action. That's not the case this time. We're acting -- when you think about it, Subsea revenues in 2015, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, are only down 5%, yet we have been taking restructuring actions well in advance of that activity downturn. So I think the cost reduction actions that we've taken quickly and aggressively, the quality of our margins and backlog for Subsea and our good work in holding up the subsea services activity is what's contributing to what you refer to, I think, as robust margins."

In the past, capital budgets, although maybe reduced, were fixed. The emphasis was always on improving project economics. Once they were improved, met their hurdle rates, you had a pretty good chance of that project going forward. That's all changed now. Even though project economics have been improved -- I was in Norway last week, and Statoil has made remarkable progress, in part through some of our help to reduce their breakeven on major projects from $70 a barrel to $40 a barrel, and there's a lot more that we can do. But even when you improve project economics, it doesn't mean a project will go ahead because of the restrictions on cash flow, which is driven by the current oil price. But you're right. At some point, as we continue to improve project economics and cash flow hopefully will start to improve, that the operators will realize the importance of greenlighting some of these projects and taking the steps to develop these deepwater fields for the purpose of replacing production in future years. I think that we have to look at this cycle differently, and we have to take into account the importance of cash flow as they approve those projects."

Our run rate, even in the fourth quarter, generally supported that. So we're looking at subsea services for 2016 inbound somewhere at $1.2 billion, $1.3 billion, $1.4 billion range. There'd be some slight headwinds, but generally, we believe that, as I said in my prepared remarks, for it to be resilient. The smaller projects, as we learned last year, are pretty lumpy. We had a really low level in the first quarter, fairly low level in the fourth quarter, but strong small project inbound in the second and third quarter. Last year, it was just under about $0.5 billion. Obviously, with the downturn in the industry, some of those are going to come under pressure. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we'll be somewhere -- hopefully, we'll be somewhere close to that, because those projects, their -- the capital requirements are a bit less. They have shorter paybacks. They're in the Gulf of Mexico, where we have a -- typically, where we have a stronger position. So we think the smaller projects will be somewhere in that range, maybe a little bit less. It's the large projects that make up the difference, and those are where a lot of the uncertainty in the industry are today. And that was really the basis of my remarks. We, absent a significant number of large projects being awarded in 2016, we can't hit or match the same Subsea inbound number that we had in 2015. So it depend -- we expect a couple of those to be awarded and we're well positioned, and that will be on top of the service and small project inbound orders that we're projecting for 2016."

But one of the things that makes it different in this cycle versus past cycles, even our alliance partners are uncertain about which projects are actually going to go forward and which ones aren't because they're unsure of their cash flow requirements, which are the cash flow generated, because that's changing constantly as oil prices change. So I would say, even though we have more visibility with alliance partners than non-alliance partners, even in that context, there's been more uncertainty and moving around and reprioritization of projects than what I've seen historically.

We shouldn't expect this cycle to be any different. I think what we're trying to articulate is to improve project economics requires not incremental reductions in cost but significant and sustainable reductions in cost, which is what we are focused on because we -- it's a challenge for the entire industry, even when oil prices were much differently than they are today, was to improve economics. We know that improving execution on these major projects is critical to improving project economics. We know the industry has not adopted low-cost standards, which now we see as an opportunity to push even harder, and we see examples, as I related on the Greater Western Flank, for more standardization. We also believe that technology can contribute significantly to reducing cost and we're investing in that. And then finally, these new business models, which I think is represented again by the Trestakk award and the willingness of a very progressive and successful company like Statoil, willing to consider and adopt an entirely different business model for the purpose of a step change in project cost. Despite all that, we know that there will still be some pricing pressure that will find its way on margins. Every cycle has been that way. We want to mitigate that by improving our cost position, and we think we can do that. Now where that settles out, we're going to have to see. But I think if you just go by past cycles, there's been pressure on the margins as a result of pricing, and we should assume that's going to be the case again."

Now to put a margin percent on that, I think what's -- as Doug pointed out, it's still early days. But we want to point out that a lot of the steps that we're taking are not just in response to lower activity, that they are in fact sustainable. Where does that come from? Over the course of the last 3 or 4 years, we've made significant progress in globalizing our manufacturing organization, creating global standards. Today, we make a Subsea Christmas tree in many locations, but we make it the exact same way. That didn't exist 5 and 10 years ago. So we're in a position now where, through standard practices and processes, we can level load throughout the world, we can reduce our facilities, yet still keep -- and our footprint, yet still keep our ability to execute at a high level. So that's an important example of how we're permanently reducing our cost. We have been able to delayer our organization. A lot of layers in our organization, quite frankly, were there because of our struggles with execution, because of the rapid growth. Now that we have a more normal -- or expect a more normal growth cycle and our execution has improved, we don't need the same level of structure. So as a result, we're confident that we can essentially lean out our organization in a way that is sustainable and permanent. Now we haven't put a number on it because we want to be -- but we want to be -- to be honestly -- honest, Robin, we want to see it before we start putting a number on it. But we're very, very encouraged by the steps we're taking and the impact it will have on the long-term cost structure of our company, even in a market recovery."

They -- in their capital markets presentation last week, they show where they have a $70 -- the breakeven has been reduced, as you alluded to, to $70 to $40 on Johan Sverdup, which we were successful on working with Statoil on. We were able to reduce our cost of the Subsea equipment by something close to 40% for Johan Castberg. Statoil has put a target out there for further double-digit reductions in cost. So I think the point we would want to make is that fairly quickly now, the economics are improving because of the step change in cost on these projects. And Statoil, I think, is a good example of not only the progress they made with Johan Sverdrup, but the target they put in place for further reductions. So I think when you get down to those levels, that -- what Statoil did on Sverdrup and what they plan to do on Castberg, a fairly significant number of deepwater projects become economic and breakeven."

On the call today is Maryann Mannen, our Chief Financial Officer; and Doug Pferdehirt, our President and Chief Operating Officer, who is joining us from another location. I'll focus my comments today on 2015 performance and our market outlook for the current year. Maryann will provide specifics on our quarterly and full year financial performance as well as our financial outlook for 2016. We'll then open up the call for your questions.
In 2015, global upstream spending declined approximately 25% as a result of falling commodity prices. North America markets were impacted greater than most, experiencing the steepest activity decline seen in nearly 3 decades. Clearly, this was a very challenging year for the energy industry.
FMC Technologies entered the downturn with solid operational momentum, and we responded early with aggressive restructuring actions across all of our businesses. This wasn't just a reaction to declining activity levels. It was a fundamental change in the way we manage our business, aimed at providing meaningful and sustainable cost savings. Our efforts focused on driving better execution, product and process standardization, innovative technology and integrated business models. These are important steps that we believe will put the company in an even stronger competitive position.
In 2015, we were able to deliver on several key metrics. In Subsea Technologies, margins increased for a fourth consecutive year. For the full year, excluding all restructuring charges, we achieved Subsea margins of 15.1%. The strong results were driven by the strength of our backlog and the continued trend of solid execution.
We also finished the year with $3.1 billion of inbound orders in our Subsea Technologies segment, achieving our full year target of at least $3 billion. For the quarter, our Subsea inbound orders totaled $490 million, which included the recently announced award for the Woodside Greater Western Flank Phase 2 project on the North West Shelf of Australia. This was an important award from a long-standing alliance partner, with deliveries expected to extend through 2018.
As we look forward, operators are now not only challenged to improve project economics, but the sharp decline in oil prices is limiting their capital spending plans. Customer priorities continue to evolve, but the message is clear. Operators are determined to live within their cash flows, putting the burden of balancing budgets on capital spending.
Although it's unlikely that today's commodity prices reflect the assumptions used for long-term project economics, oil prices do impact current cash flow. The increasing level of commodity price volatility creates even more uncertainty around these cash flows. And even though project economics are improving, the pace of large-scale developments will be driven by operator cash flow, and this is different than past cycles.
But even in this more challenging environment, we have been successful in working with our customers to bring down costs and make projects economic. Our initiatives are working. The award for the Woodside Greater Western Flank Phase 2 project is a great example of this success. With this project, we adopted the same standard that had been used on a previous development and significantly reduced the project management and engineering hours. We also used existing tools to install and test the equipment. By using standard FMC specifications, we were able to reduce inspection points by more than 50%. And finally, we leaned out the documentation process for additional savings. Much of this success came from the operator's willingness to accept a vendor-based approach versus the traditional client-specific requirements.
As we think about our Subsea order potential for 2016, I want to talk about the major components that make up our Subsea inbound: Services, small projects and large projects. Broadly speaking, we expect Subsea service orders to remain fairly resilient, with only modest declines driven by the level of installation work. We expect a somewhat lower level of order activity for smaller projects in 2016. These projects are not immune to spending reductions, but they typically have lower cash outlays and can provide operators with a relatively quick payback.
Now forecasting order levels for larger projects is a challenge in the current environment. There are a number of large projects that we're tracking, and we do see the potential for some of these projects to be awarded in the current year. However, we don't foresee any $0.5 billion to $1 billion megaprojects being awarded this year, and that will make it difficult for us to match the level of Subsea orders that we received in 2015.
Despite the Subsea order uncertainty, we as a company remain focused on our initiatives to improve deepwater project economics. We also believe that we can do even more with our integrated business models, and that's what we're doing with our Forsys Subsea joint venture with Technip. Earlier this week, the joint venture announced the award of another integrated FEED contract, this one from Statoil for the development of their Trestakk field. We're encouraged by Statoil's willingness to adopt a different business model. The Forsys Subsea approach is gaining traction and Trestakk is an important example of that progress.
Our Subsea business cost structure, we believe, has the potential for significant savings. Specifically we're focused on optimizing our global manufacturing operations, standardizing our processes and product offerings and further integrating our global supply chain. These actions will provide sustainable structural benefits that will ensure that we retain, if not improve, our cost advantage.
At the same time, we'll preserve our core engineering and project management capabilities. Further, we will continue to invest in new technologies and expand our customer relationships. Collectively, these actions will strengthen our Subsea business and ensure that we're prepared for an eventual market recovery.
Let me now turn to our Surface Technologies segment. Revenues for the quarter were down 12% sequentially. However, once we adjust for all charges, we closed out the quarter with an adjusted margin just above 10% despite the severe activity declines posted throughout North America in 2015. Activity levels for our international surface wellhead business held up sequentially, but we're seeing the impact of pricing pressure as a result of the deteriorating global market.
We expect activity levels outside of North America to remain resilient in 2016. We moved aggressively to streamline our North America business, and our actions have been focused on more than just responding to the lower activity levels. We're approaching this market in a fundamentally different way. We restructured our management organization, consolidated our service lines and integrated our products and service offering. These actions will create greater efficiencies and drive better operational performance, and they'll further improve our position in the North America onshore market. This approach has been a key driver in expanding our customer base and resulting in new contract awards.
Let me end with 2 main points. First, deepwater operators are behaving differently in this current cycle. Cash flow and uncertainty are affecting near-term decisions. But we are making an impact on deepwater project economics. We're driving cost lower and reducing operator risk through product standardization, new technologies and new business models. The Woodside Greater Western Flank and Statoil Trestakk projects are 2 tangible examples of our success.
Second, we are intensely focused on what we can control, taking aggressive actions across the entire company. Most importantly, our restructuring activities go beyond workforce and facility reductions. We're using the downturn as a catalyst to fundamentally change the way we manage our organization so that we can sustainably deliver our products and services in an effective and cost-efficient manner regardless of the market conditions.
Maryann will now take you through the financial details in the quarter and for the full year and provide a more detailed explanation of our 2016 expectations."

Our fourth quarter diluted earnings per share were $0.46 when excluding certain charges of $73 million or $0.22 per diluted share incurred in the quarter. As we indicated last quarter, we took further restructuring actions in the fourth quar",1888,"Thanks, John. Our fourth quarter diluted earnings per share were $0.46 when excluding certain charges of $73 million or $0.22 per diluted share incurred in the quarter. As we indicated last quarter, we took further restructuring actions in the fourth quarter. Included in our reported results are pretax charges of $31 million for restructuring actions or $0.10 per diluted share. Also included in the quarterly results are pretax inventory adjustments of $42 million due to the prolonged lower activity levels in North America.
The inventory write-downs include a $36 million charge in our Surface Technologies segment. The remaining $6 million was recorded in our Energy Infrastructure segment. These inventory adjustments reduced our reported earnings by $0.12 per diluted share. We have provided a schedule in our press release issued last evening to show the quarterly and full year impact of these costs incurred.
Looking at the full year, we undertook a significant amount of restructuring in response to the decline in market activity in North America as well as the forecast reductions for 2016 in our Subsea business. The combined charges in 2015 for restructuring and other severance as well as impairments totaled $132 million before tax.
In the Surface Technologies segment, we incurred $74 million of charges for restructuring our facilities, impairment of assets and headcount reductions. We expect these actions to have benefit in 2016 as we operate on a lower cost base and in a lower rig count environment. In our Subsea Technologies segment, we incurred $50 million of charges, primarily for headcount reduction taken in the second half of the year. Activity levels remained strong in this segment through the first 3 quarters of 2015. Energy Infrastructure incurred $8 million for restructuring. This occurred mainly in the measurement solutions business where the low North American activity levels reduced market opportunities.
Collectively, these actions will further strengthen our operating performance as we manage through the soft market conditions we expect will continue throughout 2016 both in North America as well as in our Subsea business. When adjusting for all restructuring and impairment costs, including inventory write-downs of $49 million, full year EPS was $2.27 for 2015.
Moving to our operating segments. Subsea Technologies revenue in the quarter was $1 billion. Quarter-over-quarter revenue comparisons were negatively impacted by $134 million of foreign currency translations. Lower subsea services activity, primarily intervention services as well as lower project activity, contributed to the quarter-over-quarter results. Subsea Technologies operating profit was $132 million in the quarter, excluding restructuring and other severance and impairment charges of $25 million.
Quarter-over-quarter profit comparisons were negatively impacted by $15 million of foreign currency translation due to the strong U.S. dollar. Operating margins in the quarter were 12.9%, excluding restructuring and other severance and impairment charges. Excluding all charges and the impact of foreign currency translation, operating profit was down approximately 29% quarter-over-quarter. The decline was driven primarily by the lower revenues, reduced well intervention activities in the North Sea and higher research and development expense due to the timing of expenditures. We experienced headwinds from the strengthening U.S. dollar throughout the year.
For the full year, Subsea revenue included $540 million of unfavorable impact, and operating profit included $77 million of unfavorable impact due to the strong U.S. dollar. Full year Subsea margins, excluding restructuring and impairment charges, were 15.1%, consistent with our estimates throughout the year as our project execution continued to support solid operating margins. We began significant headcount reductions in the second half of 2015 as project volumes began to weaken.
We expect to take further actions in the first quarter of this year. These actions and continued strong operational performance will support us as our Subsea volumes decline from 2015 levels. Segment backlog exiting this quarter was $3.8 billion. This compares to prior year backlog of $5.8 billion. Some of this backlog has a longer delivery horizon and will be recognized over the next 3 years.
Moving to our Surface Technologies results. Surface Technologies reported an operating loss for the fourth quarter of $7 million, including restructuring and other severance impairment charges of $3 million. When excluding the severance, restructuring and impairment charges as well as the inventory adjustments, we posted operating profit of $32 million and an operating margin of 10.1% in the quarter.
As was mentioned earlier, we had significant inventory adjustments that impacted our Surface Technologies segment. During the quarter, we took a write-down of $36 million for inventory. Most of the write-down was related to our North American businesses where sharp activity declines drove significant reduction to future demand estimates for the region. However, the underlying results represent the continued decline in activity in our North America business.
Operational profit performance was supported by the benefit of the restructuring efforts made throughout the year. In some international regions, though, activity levels have proven to be more resilient. However, as we noted last quarter, our operating results now reflect pricing challenges across all major geographies, including our surface wellhead business outside North America.
We have taken significant restructuring actions in our Surface Technologies business. These actions focused both on reducing our operating cost structure in North America and restructuring the business model to deliver an integrated product offering intended to bring greater value to our customers. On a full year basis, our operating margins were 11.8% when excluding restructuring, impairment and inventory charges, reflecting the benefit of restructuring activities taken earlier in the year.
While we expect the weak activity levels in North America to persist throughout 2016, these actions will further improve our operating competitiveness through our significant workforce reductions and implementation of our integrated product offering. Segment backlog stands at $433 million. This continues to predominantly be reflective of our surface wellhead business outside of North America.
Moving to Energy Infrastructure. Revenue for the fourth quarter was $96 million. The segment reported operating losses of $3 million, including $4 million of restructuring and other severance charges. Additionally, we incurred charges of $6 million in the quarter for the write-down of inventory of our measurement solutions business due to lack of demand from weak activity. Segment results continued to be negatively impacted by the sharp activity decline in the North America market.
Let's turn to corporate items. Corporate expense in the quarter was $15 million. Other revenue and expense net reflects expense of $23 million. The majority of expense relates to foreign currency losses primarily associated with the currency devaluation of the Angolan kwanza. Our fourth quarter tax rate was negative 8.7%, due in part to a favorable shift in geographic earnings mix and the reinstatement of a research and development tax credit enacted in late December. Our full year tax rate was 21.4% due in part to the lower mix of earnings subject to U.S. tax.
Capital spending this quarter was $40 million. This brings our spending in 2015 to $251 million. We generated solid cash flow from operations of $932 million. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had net debt of $240 million. It is comprised of $916 million of cash and $1.2 billion of debt.
We averaged 230 million diluted shares outstanding in the quarter. We repurchased 1.3 million shares of stock during the fourth quarter at an average cost of $31.23 per share. For the full year, we repurchased a total of 5.3 million shares for a total cost of $190.4 million.
Let me next discuss our outlook for 2016. We expect Energy Infrastructure revenue to be down by approximately 5% year-over-year. Revenues will continue to be negatively impacted by the weak North American market in our measurement solutions business. Therefore, we do not expect a recovery in this business this year. However, we do expect the benefits from prior year restructuring to favorably impact segment profitability in 2016. We expect full year margins in the high single digits.
Given the recent rig count decline, Surface Technologies revenue is now expected to be down 15% to 20% from 2015 due to uncertain North American market activity. We are not assuming a recovery from current rig count levels. Full year operating margins are targeted at high single digits, excluding any restructuring charges that may be necessary. While we will benefit from the restructuring actions taken in 2015 and those forthcoming in 2016, pricing pressure in both our North America and international business provides significant headwinds at these activity levels.
Subsea revenue for the full year in 2016 should be approximately $3.6 billion. We expect revenue from our Subsea backlog of approximately $2.2 billion. For our subsea services business, we expect revenues of approximately $1.3 billion, down modestly from 2015. Startups of certain services are expected in April of this year with lower utilization expected than prior years.
Given the lower visibility for inbound, as John has discussed, we are assuming a minimal amount of revenue from current year inbound. This would, therefore, be a source of upside to our 2016 revenues if inbound were stronger. We continue to expect Subsea margins in the range of 11% to 13%, excluding any restructuring charges that are likely in 2016. Further cost reductions will help offset the expected revenue decline. When combined with continued strong execution on our backlog, we see the potential to deliver margins above the midpoint of the guidance range.
I'll now provide you with guidance on our corporate items. In 2016, we expect corporate expense to be approximately $15 million to $16 million per quarter. We expect other revenue and expense to be an expense of approximately $13 million to $14 million per quarter with the potential for further foreign currency fluctuations. We expect our 2016 full year tax rate to be between 23% and 25%. Our earnings subject to U.S. income tax are expected to be lower in 2016.
We expect capital spending for the year of approximately $180 million. This represents a 28% reduction from 2015. This spending does not include any contingent capital that may be needed to respond to a contract award. We do anticipate further restructuring will be necessary as market activity provides better clarity on the impact on future periods. We will continue to provide guidance as we estimate the cost and benefits of these actions.
Let me now close with the following comments. Given the latest move down in the U.S. rig count, our Surface Technologies segment performance has become more difficult to forecast. We are responding with additional headcount reduction as well as further facility consolidations and closures. Our efforts in the last year to provide an integrated service offering should support our growth when this market recovers.
In Subsea, we have a solid backlog to deliver the 2016 estimates provided, albeit lower than in previous years. Our headcount reduction should partially offset the revenue decline forecast in 2016, and our project execution should allow us to deliver solid operating performance, supporting operating margin guidance.
As 2016 Subsea inbound develops, we are prepared to take further actions where needed. We are working to optimize our global footprint to deliver sustainable, superior performance now and when the deepwater and North America markets recover. While managing the company through extreme market uncertainty presents certain challenges, we remain focused on preserving and further developing our technical capabilities and customer relationships and maintaining our market leadership.

We believe that, that margin range, 11% to 13%, is still valid, but the bias towards the high end is not. Why? Because over the last 4 months, we've seen a deterioration in, obviously, in oil prices and the market. It's going to, to some degree, affect revenues. Revenue declined in 2016 more so than we saw 4 months ago. And despite, as Maryann mentioned, our efforts to restructure and reduce cost, that's going to put some margin pressure. Further, as you know, the whole industry has faced -- has been faced over the last couple of months of even more intense pricing pressure, and so the combination of those 2 things take us off that earlier comment about being on the high end of that 11% to 13% range."

Add to that the cost reduction that we've been implementing really ahead of the downturn. I think that's kind of important. When you think about prior downturns, we had that big Subsea backlog, we may have been a little delayed in taking action. That's not the case this time. We're acting -- when you think about it, Subsea revenues in 2015, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, are only down 5%, yet we have been taking restructuring actions well in advance of that activity downturn. So I think the cost reduction actions that we've taken quickly and aggressively, the quality of our margins and backlog for Subsea and our good work in holding up the subsea services activity is what's contributing to what you refer to, I think, as robust margins."

In the past, capital budgets, although maybe reduced, were fixed. The emphasis was always on improving project economics. Once they were improved, met their hurdle rates, you had a pretty good chance of that project going forward. That's all changed now. Even though project economics have been improved -- I was in Norway last week, and Statoil has made remarkable progress, in part through some of our help to reduce their breakeven on major projects from $70 a barrel to $40 a barrel, and there's a lot more that we can do. But even when you improve project economics, it doesn't mean a project will go ahead because of the restrictions on cash flow, which is driven by the current oil price. But you're right. At some point, as we continue to improve project economics and cash flow hopefully will start to improve, that the operators will realize the importance of greenlighting some of these projects and taking the steps to develop these deepwater fields for the purpose of replacing production in future years. I think that we have to look at this cycle differently, and we have to take into account the importance of cash flow as they approve those projects."

We had a really low level in the first quarter, fairly low level in the fourth quarter, but strong small project inbound in the second and third quarter. Last year, it was just under about $0.5 billion. Obviously, with the downturn in the industry, some of those are going to come under pressure. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we'll be somewhere -- hopefully, we'll be somewhere close to that, because those projects, their -- the capital requirements are a bit less. They have shorter paybacks. They're in the Gulf of Mexico, where we have a -- typically, where we have a stronger position. So we think the smaller projects will be somewhere in that range, maybe a little bit less. It's the large projects that make up the difference, and those are where a lot of the uncertainty in the industry are today. And that was really the basis of my remarks. We, absent a significant number of large projects being awarded in 2016, we can't hit or match the same Subsea inbound number that we had in 2015.

We shouldn't expect this cycle to be any different. I think what we're trying to articulate is to improve project economics requires not incremental reductions in cost but significant and sustainable reductions in cost, which is what we are focused on because we -- it's a challenge for the entire industry, even when oil prices were much differently than they are today, was to improve economics. We know that improving execution on these major projects is critical to improving project economics. We know the industry has not adopted low-cost standards, which now we see as an opportunity to push even harder, and we see examples, as I related on the Greater Western Flank, for more standardization. We also believe that technology can contribute significantly to reducing cost and we're investing in that. And then finally, these new business models, which I think is represented again by the Trestakk award and the willingness of a very progressive and successful company like Statoil, willing to consider and adopt an entirely different business model for the purpose of a step change in project cost. Despite all that, we know that there will still be some pricing pressure that will find its way on margins. Every cycle has been that way. We want to mitigate that by improving our cost position, and we think we can do that. Now where that settles out, we're going to have to see. But I think if you just go by past cycles, there's been pressure on the margins as a result of pricing, and we should assume that's going to be the case again."

But we want to point out that a lot of the steps that we're taking are not just in response to lower activity, that they are in fact sustainable. Where does that come from? Over the course of the last 3 or 4 years, we've made significant progress in globalizing our manufacturing organization, creating global standards. Today, we make a Subsea Christmas tree in many locations, but we make it the exact same way. That didn't exist 5 and 10 years ago. So we're in a position now where, through standard practices and processes, we can level load throughout the world, we can reduce our facilities, yet still keep -- and our footprint, yet still keep our ability to execute at a high level. So that's an important example of how we're permanently reducing our cost. We have been able to delayer our organization. A lot of layers in our organization, quite frankly, were there because of our struggles with execution, because of the rapid growth. Now that we have a more normal -- or expect a more normal growth cycle and our execution has improved, we don't need the same level of structure. So as a result, we're confident that we can essentially lean out our organization in a way that is sustainable and permanent. Now we haven't put a number on it because we want to be -- but we want to be -- to be honestly -- honest, Robin, we want to see it before we start putting a number on it.

Welcome to our first quarter 2016 earnings conference call. With me today are Maryann Mannen, our Chief Financial Officer; and Doug Pferdehirt, our President and Chief Operating Officer. I'll begin my comments today with highlights from the",1310,"Good morning. Welcome to our first quarter 2016 earnings conference call. With me today are Maryann Mannen, our Chief Financial Officer; and Doug Pferdehirt, our President and Chief Operating Officer. I'll begin my comments today with highlights from the quarter as well as provide some remarks on the deepwater market and our Subsea order outlook.
Maryann will provide specifics on our finance performance and update our financial outlook for 2016. We will then open up the call for questions.
Our first quarter results reflect both the challenge of our current market and our continued success in execution performance. For the first time in nearly 3 decades, FMC spending to settle began for second consecutive year. The North America land markets were impacted almost immediately and activity continued to decline into the first quarter.
Deepwater revenue as been supported by project backlog, but low orders are now beginning to impact our Subsea business. Despite the market challenges, we've made considerable progress in addressing the things that we control. We're driving operational success by improving execution and taking aggressive restructuring actions that permanently lower our costs.
The improvements are up most evident in our Subsea Technologies segment. We posted another solid performance this quarter, reporting margins of 13.1% when excluding charges. These are strong results of our business as revenues fell 25% over the last 12 months. Very good execution, restructuring savings were key drivers to deliver these solid margins. 
In our Surface Technologies segment we faced a much more difficult challenge. The average U.S. recount continue to decline in the quarter falling 23% sequentially. This hit our North America business much harder than we expected. We don't believe the current level -- low level of activity is sustainable. The timing and pace of recovery in North America landmark is, however, remains uncertain.
Compared to North America, our international surface business has been more resilient. And our results came in largely as expected. We continue to benefit from our geographic mix of business with relative strength coming from the Middle East and North African market where rig counts have held up and better than most other parts of the world.
Across all of our businesses, we will continue to take further restructuring actions to go beyond workforce and facility reductions. We are committed to delivering a global footprint that is more efficient and scalable and it can provide sustainable savings well into any market recovery.
I will pause my remarks on the quarterly results with the comment on the balance sheet. We continue to stay focused on preserving our financial strength and liquidity in these uncertain times. We generated cash flow from operations of $109 million in the quarter and we reduced our net debt to $209 million. 
Turning to the deepwater outlook. The industry significant reduction in capital spending will ultimately lead to a decline in global production that will drive oil prices higher. With oil higher oil prices, the combination of operators improved cash flows and a greater confidence in the market will move spending higher.
Shell investment will come first given the smaller commitment and faster payback, but will take more than Shell to fill the supply gap. There will be a need for both conventional and deepwater production to meet global demand.
But for deepwater to be a credible source of future supply, project economics must improve. For many operators, some of their best prospects can be found offshore, but they've been a challenged by poor returns. For the these returns to improve, the industry must realize significant and sustainable reductions in the cost of deepwater development. As we've seen the industry has demonstrated significant efficiency improvements and cost reductions in onshore and conventional shale. We believe that a similar transformation can occur in deepwater. But unlike shale, where most of the big savings and efficiencies have been achieved, we're still in the early innings for deepwater.
We're confident the industry can deliver these savings because of the rapid progress we're seeing on multiple fronts. First, operators themselves are changing their approach to deepwater development. For instance, the final design for BPs Mad Dog Phase II project will be substantially different than originally proposed. Significant savings will be realized by more closely matching infrastructure spend to the pace of field development.
And will not project-specific, Statoil highlighted their success and reducing project breakevens from $70 a barrel to $41 per barrel, with expectations to push that number even lower.
Achieving this level of savings required more than overhead and vendor price reductions. It required fundamental changes in their development approach. Two significant components of deepwater development costs are drilling and topside facilities. Together, these 2 can be as much as 2/3 of the cost of deepwater project. The cost of drilling has been particular impacted by the historic high level of day rates that will provide substantial savings as legacy contracts expire in the future. There are also many ways to reduce the cost of topside facilities. While we yet to see much of these savings so far, we think many of them will be sustainable.
In addition to these savings, our company is focused on reducing the cost of scope of our scope of supply. We know that we can severely reduce the cost of Subsea production equipment and installation through beater execution, product standardization, innovative technology and a new integrated business models. We're especially encouraged by the industry's early adoption of a differentiated business model that integrates the scope of both the subsea production system and the cope to our Forsys Subsea joint venture an alliance with Technip.
While we're confident improved evidence will lead to future deepwater development, the Subsea outlook in the near-term is being impacted by a aggressive cutbacks in spending from major projects. In the first quarter, our total Subsea orders of $346 million were driven largely by subsea services. This order level highlights the relative stability of our service business and supports our view that full year service orders should approximate $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion for the year. Our confidence in these service revenues is driven by our visibility around installation activity and our maintenance and repair work. Much of this work is funded by operating budgets, not capital budgets. These expenditures maximize production uptime and improve operator cash flows.
Small orders for subsea equipment were light in the quarter, but these orders are typically lumpy and never spread evenly throughout the year. We only expect to see a modest decline in small orders for the full year. These orders are typically tied the smaller projects that have lower capital costs and offer higher returns and accelerated cash paybacks. Over the next 24 months, we see the potential for nearly 20 large projects to move forward. Some large projects are considered strategic and could be awarded this year. But there is likelihood that even these projects could be pushed into 2017. And we still do not expect any projects in excess of $500 million to be sanctioned before the end of the year.
The full recovery of deepwater will come when cash flows move higher, project economics improve and operators gain confidence in the business outlook. In the meantime, subsea order activity will reflect subsea services small projects associated with tiebacks and opportunities and some large strategic projects.
Clearly, there are significant challenges our industry faces today. But at FMC Technologies, we remain focused on the things that we can control. We will continue to improve project execution to protect our margins and competitiveness. We will take further restructuring actions that both to the declining market and sustainably lower our costs. We'll remain focused on improving project economics through standardization, technology and integrated business models. And finally, we will preserve our unique customer partnerships to secure awards in this highly competitive market.
I'll now turn the call over to Marianne."

Included in our reported results, are pretax impairment and other charges of $36 million were $0.10 per dilute",1365,"Thanks, John. Our first quarter diluted earnings per share were $0.22, when excluding certain charges of $48 million or $0.13 per diluted share. Included in our reported results, are pretax impairment and other charges of $36 million were $0.10 per diluted share. Restructuring and other severance charges of $12 million or $0.03 per diluted share.
The impairment charges were related to our North American business in our Surface Technologies segment. Further reduction and market activity have impacted our outlook for revenue and profitability of certain assets requiring a reduction in their carrying value.
We have provided a schedule in our press release, issued last evening to show the quarterly impact of all these costs incurred. We continue to take action to restructure our organization, both in response to reduce North American land activity as well as the outlook we have provided for lower revenues for our subsea business in 2016.
Our subsea technology segment delivered solid results in the quarter. Subsea Technologies revenues in the quarter was $864 million. Quarter-over-quarter revenue comparisons were negatively impacted by lower project activity as well as $57 million of foreign currency translation.
Subsea Technologies operating profit was $113 million in the quarter, with a margin of 13.1%, excluding restructuring and other severance and impairment and other charges of $4 million. Operating margins decreased 155 basis points quarter-over-quarter, when excluding charges for both periods, as revenues were down approximately 25%.
While down from the prior year quarter, solid operating margins were the results of strong project execution as well as the benefits of restructuring activity. Segment backlog, exiting this quarter, was $3.4 billion, which compares to a prior year backlog of $4.8 billion.
Moving to of our Surface Technologies results. Surface Technologies revenues for the quarter were $266 million, down 41% from the prior year quarter. The revenue decline was driven by the steep contraction in our North American business, somewhat mitigated by more moderate the decline in our international business. Geographic mix continues to provide some offset to the weak domestic market as rig declines have been more muted in international market, particularly in the Middle East.
Surface Technologies operating profit for the fourth quarter was $13 million, when excluding impairment and restructuring and other charges of $42 million. Margins in the quarter were 5%, when excluding these charges. We have taken significant restructuring actions in our Surface Technologies segment. These actions were based in part on a planning forecast for 2016, that assumed U.S. rig count would decline to a approximately 500 working rigs during the first quarter and then maintain that level for the remainder of the year. The actual rig count declined proved to be even more severe than we anticipated, declining 36% from year end levels, just 450 at quarter end. The rig count has since declined to 431 rigs as of the end of last week.
While we have made good progress in adjusting to the lower activity levels in North America, the severity of the recount decline will require us to take further action. However, these actions will be balanced against our need to preserve operational capabilities that can respond to the market recovery.
Segment results reflect this challenging market, but excluding charges, we remain profitable doing part to the benefits of our significant restructuring actions to date, as well as the relative strength of our international business. Segment backlog, exiting the quarter, stands at $429 million, this is predominantly related to our wellhead business outside of North America, which continues to show resilience.
Moving to our Energy Infrastructure results. Revenue for the quarter was $84 million, down 17% from the prior year quarter. We reported a minor loss in the period when excluding charges. The segment continues to be negatively impacted by lower oil prices. Our measurements solutions business has been most affected due to the contraction in energy-related infrastructure spend in our North American market.
Overall, we recorded $10 million of restructuring cost in our segment operating results during the first quarter. We expect to incur additional restructuring cost of approximately $25 million to $30 million in total over the coming quarters as further actions are taken primarily in our subsea's technology segment. These headcount reductions and other restructuring actions will be more significant than previous as our subsea activity levels are reduced.
Let's turn to the corporate items. Corporate expense in the quarter was $14.3 million. We now expect to spend approximately $14 million to $15 million per quarter through the remainder of 2016. Other revenue and expense net reflects expense of $30 million.
Our first quarter expense is typically higher than the remaining three quarters of the year due to the amortization period for certain equity compensation awards made in the period. Results were also impacted by foreign exchange losses. In the quarter, we experienced further impact from the ongoing and Nigerian For the remaining quarters of 2016, we still expect that other revenue and expense will be an expense of a approximately $13 million to $14 million Pecora. This quarterly estimate remains subject to foreign currency fluctuation.
Our first quarter tax rate was 23.4%, which reflects the lower percentage of overall earnings subject to U.S. tax. We now anticipate our 2016 tax rate to be between 21% to 23% for the full year, given a mix of earnings. Capital spending this quarter was $35 million, primarily directed towards Subsea Technologies. We now expect capital spending in 2016 to be approximately $150 million. The spending does not include any contingent capital that may be needed to respond to a contract award.
We generated cash flow from operations of $109 million in the period. At the end of the first quarter, we had net debt of $210 million. It is comprised of $1 billion of cash and $1.2 billion of debt.
Net debt has been reduced by more than $1.2 billion from its peak in the first quarter of 2013, due largely to the strong operating cash flows of the country. We averaged 229 million diluted shares outstanding in the quarter. We repurchased 1.1 million shares of stock during the first quarter at an average cost of $25.58 per share.
Looking forward, we continue to expect full year subsea revenues to approach $3.6 billion, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, driven by a approximately $2.2 billion of backlog conversion and $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion of subsea service revenue. We remain confident in full year subsea margins in the range of 11% to 13% excluding charges as we continue to execute well on our backlog and realize further benefits from our restructuring actions.
Surface Technologies revenue is now likely to be down a approximately 25% to 30% versus 2015. North America activity has fallen more than expected and we're now basing are forecast on the assumption that the U.S. rig count remains near current levels through the end of the year.
We now expect operating margins in the low to mid-single digits for the full year, excluding charges. Energy Infrastructure revenue is now likely to be down 5% to 10% year-over-year as market activity continues to be negatively impacted by our may measurement solutions business. We now expect that operating margin should approximate low to mid-single digits for the year, excluding restructuring charges.
The first quarter results reflect the operational improvement we've made in our subsea business, as well as the challenges our Surface and Energy Infrastructure business face adjusting to the rapid pace of activity decline in North America. We have responded aggressively to the lower activity experienced in these markets. And as we indicated in our guidance, we are accelerating the pace of restructuring in the next few quarters in our Subsea Technologies segment. As John earlier discuss, this is not only at current production, but also structural changes to the global management of our operations.
We will continue to conservatively manage our balance sheet through these period of uncertainty. Our net debt was further reduced in the quarter, our liquidity remains robust. We lowered our guidance for capital expenditures in 2016 and we maintained flexibility to continue share repurchase as we have done consistently for many years.

And all these things help mitigate the effects of a lot of pricing pressure on service. I think I mentioned this and Maryann, in previous calls, we expect some margin erosion and services as a result of this downturn. But we also believe, that we can push back on a lot of it to the efficiency improvements we're making. So I would say, a modest margin pressure is a result of the downturn, but we've got cost partially offset that."

It doesn't require us to get us a significant amount of inbound this year. So most of that margin, as it relates to the project, is already our backlog. And then, secondarily, John just addressed the question with respect to services. So assuming services hold up as we see, we feel very confident in our ability to execute 2016. As I also mentioned, over the next several quarters, remember our subsea service activity and our subsea project activity is being very strong. We have one of the strongest years in 2015 and we're still executing fairly large number of projects in 2015. As we get closer to the end of '16, of course, we begin to see those activity level tail off. So we are forecasting, as I mentioned in my comments, a relatively significant amount of reductions coming in the next three quarters to address that tailing off. Given our estimates for inbound, and given that benefit from those restructuring, again, we feel pretty confident in our ability to maintain double-digit margin going into 2017. A little bit difficult for me to give you an exact quarter-over-quarter as you can imagine, the timing and a mix of projects as they come through, will certainly impact that. But that's really the rationale for why we feel comfortable in the 11% to 13% this year and our ability to maintain double-digit going into '17."

So actually the money we spent had less to do with light and more to do with other service-related assets. But service is a critical part of our strategy. And it does require real assets that rent to the customer. That's what that was about. When it comes to leaning out the organization, it's less about machine tools and that sort of thing. Those investments where all made several years ago when we were growing. This is about a manufacturing strategy that allows us to standard Let me just give you 1 example, Jim. We manufacture subsea equipment in multiple regions to be close to our customers. That's strategy has served us well. But, we manufacture that equipment. The same equipment different in each geographic region. Today, we have 1 process, 1 assembly project, 1 machining process, and we do it in all the locations. And that's the kind of leaning out or savings that we are envisioning as opposed to big capital investments in machine tools. Quite frankly, because of the growth that we saw 3 years ago, the machine tools that we invested in then are state-of-the-art. So what I will talk about in terms of leaning out, is manufacturing processes, taking advantage of standardization, taking advantage of global practices, and really, leveraging our a good execution. Using for 8 quarters now, where we've had solid execution. You have seen in that margin. What changes is, that we are delivering on time. We don't need to build safety nets and other structure to overcome core execution yet. And we're just leveraging that and that's what's allowing us to lean out the organization and streamline the process."

So it just depends on which portion of the business. But in speaking particularly to the North America market, there is the portion of our business that's more tied to the pressure pumping industry and then there is our integrated offerings. So let me first talk about the pressure pumping industry. Clearly, as capacity comes backs in the market, it will require new equipment or new flowline equipment to be associated with that equipment. We talk about cannibalization in the industry. There is different type of cannibalization. Some, if you will, more severe than other. But in all cases, that treating out is not necessarily associated with the horsepower our with the unit. It's used as kit. And we are the largest provider of that. And we're the largest provider of inspection and repair services for that treating So we have a good idea and a very good understanding of the state of that equipment and the capacity that's in the market today. So we are confident that it does not require a significant pickup for us to be begin to see those orders flow more aggressively as that equipment will be needed to put that horsepower back into service. On our integrated offering, yes, increased activity, we'll certainly, benefit from that. But we're benefiting from the fact that we're changing our operating model and we're changing the commercial model by putting together the most offering on service to be able to help our customers most efficiently go from the last frac stage to selling of their commodity, if you will, to the point-of-sale.

And we have activity actually beyond that. So let me just talk in general about the activity that we have experienced and where we are in terms of the conversion of those projects. As we talked about when we first announced some of the original integrated FEED studies, some of them all the way back at the concept stage. And we said, though studies would take 9 to 12 months to complete, typically another 6 months plus or minus for the project to be sanctioned. So you are looking at anywhere from about 15- to 18-month cycle between the conception integrated FEED, all the way through the conversion the integrated EPCI or to the execution phase. On other projects, where we start pre-FEED or FEED, that cycle time is reduced by 3 to 6 months. We remain confident in the conversion of a project, and we had said in 2016, now for budgetary reasons, that may fall into the first quarter of 2017.

When will that confidence show up? That's a little hard to predict. But your question is, where it show up first? As a laid out, even in the so-called services small projects you would think would move first because of the capital commitment is less and returns are generally better. Then you will see projects that are more strategic. There is another reason why that project needs to move forward. Maybe it's lease term. Maybe it's a national oil company that is important to that oil company to move out of the front. So you want to see large projects move for some other strategic reason. And then finally, it will go operator by operator. Where operators have a large portfolio of undeveloped deepwater discoveries. And when they look at their total portfolio and their need to raise production, and they will do that all in with the improving economics. Those are the project that will bubble up at the top. Now what will the price be, the breakeven price? Well, I alluded that -- shared that in my remarks. We're seeing substantial reductions in breakeven.

So we certainly see that as a positive weak signal when our customers are back to looking at not just cost as you always have, but looking at cost and delivery schedule because they are planning out there production and wanting to be able to back -- come back from when the need the production and when they need to place orders to be able to move these largest projects forward."

We have a backlog of equipment we're delivering. It has to be installed. Even some of what we've delivered, is in our customer inventory. It is yet to be installed. That's a fairly significant bucket, if you will, is services of new equipment. We're also seeing installation of refurbished equipment, which is another segment that is continuing to grow. That make sense. Operators that have got equipment. They would rather, in today's environment, would rather refurbish it rather than by buy equipment. Again, almost always goes back to the original equipment manufacturer and we're seeing our refurbished equipment, both the manufacturer, but it counts as service revenue and the installation of it, starting to grow. And then the third bucket, which we also expect to grow, is in maintaining production. So this is an existing production system that may need some maintenance, need to change other choker or control system. Operators in today's environment, they're not will spend that capital on new production. They are going to want to spend their operating expense or capital on maintaining the production they have. And so we expect that segment of the services market to grow, and again, typically you would call out the original equipment manufacturer to those installation services. And then finally, we have part of our service part of service growth strategy. First quarter, that revenue was balance fairly light. They are almost nonexistent. That comes back now, and subsequent quarters this year. So those are the primary buckets of subsea service, some of which we, you can see by my nature of my comments, we expect them to be fairly resilient. And in some cases, maybe a little bit of growth offsetting whatever reduction there might be in installation."

Welcome to our first quarter 2016 earnings conference call. With me today are Maryann Mannen, our Chief Financial Officer; and Doug Pferdehirt, our President and Chief Operating Officer. I'll begin my comments today with highlights from the",1313,"Good morning. Welcome to our first quarter 2016 earnings conference call. With me today are Maryann Mannen, our Chief Financial Officer; and Doug Pferdehirt, our President and Chief Operating Officer. I'll begin my comments today with highlights from the quarter as well as provide some remarks on the deepwater market and our subsea order outlook. Maryann will provide specifics on our finance performance and update our financial outlook for 2016. We'll then open up the call for questions.
Our first quarter results reflect both the challenge of our current market and our continued success in execution performance. For the first time in nearly 3 decades, E&P spending is set to decline for a second consecutive year. The North America land markets were impacted almost immediately and activity continued to decline into the first quarter.
Deepwater revenue has been supported by project backlog, but low orders are now beginning to impact our Subsea business. Despite the market challenges, we've made considerable progress in addressing the things that we control. We're driving operational success by improving execution and taking aggressive restructuring actions that permanently lower our costs. 
The improvements are most evident in our Subsea Technologies segment. We posted another solid performance this quarter, reporting margins of 13.1% when excluding charges. These are strong results for a business whose revenues fell 25% over the last 12 months. Very good execution and restructuring savings were key drivers to deliver these solid margins. 
In our Surface Technologies segment we faced a much more difficult challenge. The average U.S. rig count continued to decline in the quarter falling 23% sequentially. This hit our North America business much harder than we expected. We don't believe the current level -- low level of activity is sustainable. The timing and pace of recovery in North America land markets, however, remains uncertain.
Compared to North America, our international surface business has been more resilient and our results came in largely as expected. We continue to benefit from our geographic mix of business with relative strength coming from the Middle East and North African markets, where rig counts have held up and better than most other parts of the world.  Across all of our businesses, we will continue to take further restructuring actions that go beyond workforce and facility reductions. We're committed to delivering a global footprint that is more efficient and scalable and it can provide sustainable savings well into any market recovery.
I'll close my remarks on the quarterly results with a comment on the balance sheet. We continue to stay focused on preserving our financial strength and liquidity in these uncertain times. We generated cash flow from operations of $109 million in the quarter and we reduced our net debt to $209 million. 
Turning to the deepwater outlook. The industry significant reduction in capital spending will ultimately lead to a decline in global production that will drive oil prices higher. With higher oil prices, the combination of operators improved cash flows and greater confidence in the market will move spending higher. Shale investment will come first given the smaller commitment and faster payback, but will take more than shale to fill the supply gap. There will be a need for both conventional and deepwater production to meet global demand.
But for deepwater to be a credible source of future supply, project economics must improve. For many operators, some of their best prospects can be found offshore, but they've been a challenged by poor returns. For these returns to improve, the industry must realize significant and sustainable reductions in the cost of deepwater development. As we've all seen the industry has demonstrated significant efficiency improvements and cost reductions in onshore and conventional shale. We believe that a similar transformation can occur in deepwater. But unlike shale, where most of the big savings and efficiencies have been achieved, we're still on the early innings for deepwater.
We're confident the industry can deliver these savings because of the rapid progress we're seeing on multiple fronts. First, operators themselves are changing their approach to deepwater development. For instance, the final design for BP's Mad Dog Phase 2 project will be substantially different than originally proposed. Significant savings will be realized by more closely matching infrastructure spend to the pace of field development. And while not project-specific, Statoil highlighted their success in reducing project breakevens from $70 a barrel to $41 per barrel, with the expectations to push that number even lower.  Achieving this level of savings required more than overhead and vendor price reductions. It required fundamental changes in their development approach. 
Two significant components of deepwater development costs are drilling and topside facilities. Together, these 2 can be as much as 2/3 of the cost of a deepwater project. The cost of drilling has been particular impacted by the historic high level of day rates that will provide substantial savings as legacy contracts expire in the future. There are also many ways to reduce the cost of topside facilities. While we've yet to see much of these savings, so far, we think many of them will be sustainable.
In addition to these savings, our company is focused on reducing the cost of scope of our scope of supply. We know that we can significantly reduce the cost of subsea production equipment and installation through better execution, product standardization, innovative technology and new integrated business models. We're especially encouraged by the industry's early adoption of a differentiated business model that integrates the scope of both the subsea production system and the SURF scope to our Forsys Subsea joint venture and our alliance with Technip.
While we're confident improved returns will lead to future deepwater development, the subsea outlook in the near-term is being impacted by aggressive cutbacks in spending for major projects. In the first quarter, our total subsea orders of $346 million were driven largely by subsea services. This order level highlights the relative stability of our service business and supports our view that full year service orders should approximate $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion for the year. Our confidence in these service revenues is driven by our visibility around installation activity and our maintenance and repair work. Much of this work is funded by operating budgets, not capital budgets. These expenditures maximize production uptime and improve operator cash flows.
Small orders for subsea equipment were light in the quarter, but these orders are typically lumpy and never spread evenly throughout the year. We only expect to see a modest decline in small orders for the full year. These orders are typically tied to smaller projects that have lower capital costs and offer higher returns and accelerated cash paybacks. 
Over the next 24 months, we see the potential for nearly 20 large projects to move forward. Some large projects are considered strategic and could be awarded this year. But there is a likelihood that even these projects could be pushed into 2017. And we still do not expect any projects in excess of $500 million to be sanctioned before the end of the year.
The full recovery of deepwater will come when cash flows move higher, project economics improve and operators gain confidence in the business outlook. In the meantime, subsea order activity will reflect subsea service resilience, small projects associated with tiebacks and brownfield opportunities and some large strategic projects.
Clearly, there are significant challenges our industry faces today, but at FMC Technologies we remain focused on the things that we can control. We will continue to improve project execution to protect our margins and competitiveness. We will take further restructuring actions that both respond to the declining market and sustainably lower our costs. We'll remain focused on improving project economics through standardization, technology and integrated business models. And finally, we'll preserve our unique customer partnerships to secure awards in this highly competitive market.
I'll now turn the call over to Maryann."

Our first quarter diluted earnings per share were $0.22 when excluding certain charges of $48 million or $0.13 per diluted share. Included in our reported results, are pretax impairment and other charges of $36 million or $0.10 per diluted s",1365,"Thanks, John. Our first quarter diluted earnings per share were $0.22 when excluding certain charges of $48 million or $0.13 per diluted share. Included in our reported results, are pretax impairment and other charges of $36 million or $0.10 per diluted share. Restructuring and other severance charges of $12 million or $0.03 per diluted share. The impairment charges were related to our North American business in our Surface Technologies segment. Further reductions in market activity have impacted our outlook for revenue and profitability of certain assets requiring a reduction in their carrying value.
We have provided a schedule in our press release, issued last evening, to show the quarterly impact of all these costs incurred. We continue to take action to restructure our organization, both in response to reduced North American land activity as well as the outlook we have provided for lower revenues for our subsea business in 2016.
Our Subsea Technologies segment delivered solid results in the quarter. Subsea Technologies revenues in the quarter was $864 million. Quarter-over-quarter revenue comparisons were negatively impacted by lower project activity as well as $57 million of foreign currency translation. Subsea Technologies operating profit was $113 million in the quarter, with a margin of 13.1%, excluding restructuring and other severance and impairment and other charges of $4 million. Operating margins decreased 155 basis points quarter-over-quarter when excluding charges for both periods, as revenues were down approximately 25%. While down from the prior year quarter, solid operating margins were the results of strong project execution as well as the benefits of restructuring activity. Segment backlog exiting this quarter was $3.4 billion, which compares to a prior year backlog of $4.8 billion.
Moving to our Surface Technologies results. Surface Technologies revenues for the quarter were $266 million, down 41% from the prior year quarter. The revenue decline was driven by the steep contraction in our North American business, somewhat mitigated by more moderate declines in our international business. Geographic mix continues to provide some offset to the weak domestic market as rig declines have been more muted in international market, particularly in the Middle East. Surface Technologies operating profit for the first quarter was $13 million, when excluding impairment and restructuring and other charges of $42 million. Margins in the quarter were 5%, when excluding these charges. 
We have taken significant restructuring actions in our Surface Technologies segment. These actions were based in part on a planning forecast for 2016 that assumed U.S. rig count would decline to approximately 500 working rigs during the first quarter and then maintain that level for the remainder of the year. The actual rig count decline proved to be even more severe than we anticipated, declining 36% from year-end levels, just 450 rigs at quarter end. The rig count has since declined to 431 rigs as of the end of last week. While we have made good progress in adjusting to the lower activity levels in North America, the severity of the rig count decline will require us to take further actions. However, these actions will be balanced against our need to preserve operational capabilities that can respond to the market recovery.
Segment results reflect this challenging market, but excluding charges, we remain profitable do in part to the benefits of our significant restructuring actions to date as well as the relative strength of our international business. Segment backlog exiting the quarter stands at $429 million, this is predominantly related to our wellhead business outside of North America which continues to show resilience.
Moving to our Energy Infrastructure results. Revenue for the quarter was $84 million, down 17% from the prior year quarter. We reported a minor loss in the period when excluding charges. The segment continues to be negatively impacted by low oil prices. Our measurements solutions business has been most affected due to the contraction in energy-related infrastructure spend in our North American market. Overall, we recorded $10 million of restructuring cost in our segment operating results during the first quarter. 
We expect to incur additional restructuring cost of approximately $25 million to $30 million in total over the coming quarters as further actions are taken primarily in our Subsea Technologies segment. These headcount reductions and other restructuring actions will be more significant than previous as our subsea activity levels are reduced.
Let's turn to the corporate items. Corporate expense in the quarter was $14.3 million. We now expect to spend approximately $14 million to $15 million per quarter through the remainder of 2016. Other revenue and expense net reflects expense of $30 million. Our first quarter expense is typically higher than the remaining 3 quarters of the year due to the amortization period for certain equity compensation awards made in the period. Results were also impacted by foreign exchange losses. In the quarter, we experienced further impact from the ongoing Kwanzaa and Nigerian naira. For the remaining quarters of 2016, we still expect that other revenue and expense will be an expense of approximately $13 million to $14 million per quarter. This quarterly estimate remains subject to foreign currency fluctuation.
Our first quarter tax rate was 23.4%, which reflects the lower percentage of overall earnings, subject to U.S. tax. We now anticipate our 2016 tax rate to be between 21% and 23% for the full year given a mix of earnings. Capital spending this quarter was $35 million, primarily directed towards Subsea Technologies. We now expect capital spending in 2016 to be approximately $150 million. The spending does not include any contingent capital that may be needed to respond to a contract award.
We generated cash flow from operations of $109 million in the period. At the end of the first quarter, we had net debt of $210 million. It is comprised of $1 billion of cash and $1.2 billion of debt. Net debt has been reduced by more than $1.2 billion from its peak in the first quarter of 2013 due largely to the strong operating cash flows of the company. We averaged 229 million diluted shares outstanding in the quarter. We repurchased 1.1 million shares of stock during the first quarter at an average cost of $25.58 per share.
Looking forward, we continue to expect full year subsea revenues to approach $3.6 billion excluding the impact of foreign exchange, driven by approximately $2.2 billion of backlog conversion and $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion of subsea service revenues. We remain confident in full year subsea margins in a range of 11% to 13% excluding charges as we continue to execute well on our backlog and realize further benefits from our restructuring actions.
Surface Technologies revenue is now likely to be down approximately 25% to 30% versus 2015. North America activity has fallen more than expected and we are now basing our forecast on the assumption that the U.S. rig count remains near current levels through the end of the year. We now expect operating margins in the low to mid-single digits for the full year, excluding charges. 
Energy Infrastructure revenue is now likely to be down 5% to 10% year-over-year as market activity continues to be negatively impacted by our measurement solutions business. We now expect that operating margin should approximate low to mid-single digits for the year, excluding restructuring charges.
The first quarter results reflect the operational improvement we have made in our Subsea business, as well as the challenges our Surface and Energy Infrastructure business face, adjusting to the rapid pace of activity decline in North America. We have responded aggressively to the lower activity experienced in these markets. And as we indicated in our guidance, we are accelerating the pace of restructuring in the next few quarters in our Subsea Technologies segment. 
As John earlier discussed, this is not only headcount reductions, but also structural changes to the global management of our operations. We will continue to conservatively manage our balance sheet through this period of uncertainty. Our net debt was further reduced in the quarter. Our liquidity remains robust. We lowered our guidance for capital expenditures in 2016 and we maintained the flexibility to continue share repurchase as we have done consistently for many years.
Operator, you may now open up the call for questions."

So we're in a position now where a lot of the restructuring is about delayering, it's about leaning out the organization. Again, something we can now do because of our execution improvements.

It doesn't require us to get a significant amount of inbound this year, so most of that margin as it relates to the project is already our backlog. And then secondarily, John, just to address the question with respect to services. So assuming services hold up as we see, we feel very confident in our ability to execute 2016. As I also mentioned, over the next several quarters, remember our subsea service activity and our subsea project activity has been being very strong. We had one of the strongest years in 2015 and we're still executing a fairly large number of projects in 2016. As we get closer to the end of '16, of course, we begin to see those activity levels tail off. So we are forecasting, as I mentioned in my comments, a relatively significant amount of reductions coming in the next 3 quarters to address that tailing off. Given our estimates for inbound, and given that benefit from those restructuring, again, we feel pretty confident in our ability to maintain double-digit margin going into 2017. A little bit difficult for me to give you an exact quarter-by-quarter, as you can imagine the timing and a mix of projects as they come through, will certainly impact that. But that's really the rationale for why we feel comfortable in the 11% to 13% this year and our ability to maintain double-digit going into '17."

Well, it could be that, it could be other -- there's lots of tooling that's involved in service beyond Light Well Intervention. So actually the money that we spent had less to do with Light Well Intervention and more to do with other service-related instillation assets. But service is a critical part of our strategy and it does require -- you need real assets that you then lease and rent to the customer. That's what that was about. When it comes to leaning out the organization, it's less about machine tools and that sort of thing. Those investments were all made several years ago when we were growing. This is about a manufacturing strategy that allows us through standard manufacturing. Let me just give you one example, Jim. We manufacture subsea equipment in multiple regions to be close to our customers and that strategy has served us well. But we manufacture that equipment, the same equipment different in each geographic region. Today, we have identified one manufacturing process, one assembly project, one machining process, and we do it in all the locations. And that's the kind of leaning out or savings that we're envisioning as opposed to big capital investments in machine tools. Quite frankly, because of the growth that we saw 3 years ago, the machine tools that we invested in then are state-of-the-art. So what we're talking about in terms of leaning out is manufacturing processes, taking advantage of standardization, taking advantage of global practices and really leveraging our good execution. You've seen for 8 quarters now where we've had solid execution. You've seen that in the margin. What [indiscernible] that we're delivering on time, we don't need to build safety nets and other structure to overcome core execution and we're just leveraging that and that's what's allowing us to lean out the organization and streamline the manufacturing process."

But in speaking particularly to the North America market, there is the portion of our business that's more tied to the pressure pumping industry and then there's our integrated offering. So let me first talk about the pressure pumping industry. Clearly, as capacity comes back into the market, it will require new treating iron equipment or new flowline equipment to be associated with that equipment. We talked about cannibalization in the industry. There is different types of cannibalization. Some, if you will, more severe than other. But in all cases, that treating iron is not necessarily associated with the horsepower or with the unit, it's used as a kit. And we are the largest provider of that and we are the largest provider of inspection and repair services for that treating iron. So we have a good idea and a very good understanding of the state of that equipment and the capacity that's in the market today. So we are confident that it does not require a significant pickup for us to be beginning to see those orders flow more aggressively as that equipment will be needed to put that horsepower back into service. On our integrated offering, yes, increased activity, we will certainly benefit from that. But we're benefiting from the fact that we're changing our operating model and we're changing the commercial model by putting together the most holistic offering on surface to be able to help our customers most efficiently go from the last frac stage to selling of their commodity, or if you will, to the point of sale.

So let me just talk in general about the activity that we have experienced and where we are in terms of the conversion of those projects. As we talked about when we first announced some of the original integrated FEED studies, some of them were all the way back at the concept stage. And we said, those studies would take 9 to 12 months to complete, typically another 6 months plus or minus for the project to be sanctioned. So you are looking at anywhere from about a 15- to an 18-month cycle between the conceptual integrated FEED, all the way through the conversion to an integrated EPCI or to the execution phase. On other projects, where we start pre-FEED or FEED, that cycle time is reduced by 3 to 6 months. We remain confident in the conversion of a project. And we had said in 2016, now for budgetary reasons, that may fall into the first quarter of 2017.

Much like others have integrated the subsurface, no one has been able to integrate the surface or had the breadth of products and services to be able to integrate the surface as we're now offering today.

As I outlined in my prepared remarks, the sequence is going to go improved oil price, better cash flow, confidence in the market. At the same time, we're seeing the project economics dramatically are improved as a result of the fundamental changes the industry is going through to make significant cost changes. When will that confidence show up? That's a little hard to predict. But your question is, where will it show up first? Well, as a laid out, even in the so-called trough, service is resilient, small projects you would think would move first because of the capital commitment is less and returns are generally better. Then you're going to see projects, Darren, that are more strategic. There's another reason why that project needs to move forward. Maybe it's lease terms. Maybe it's a national oil company that is -- it's important to that national oil company to move out in the front. So you're going to see large projects move for some other strategic reason. And then finally, it will go operator by operator where operators have a large portfolio of undeveloped deepwater discoveries. And when they look at their total portfolio and their need to raise production, and they will do that all in concert with the improving economics, those are the projects that will bubble up to the top. Now what will the price be, the breakeven price? Well, I alluded that -- or well, share that in my remarks. We're seeing substantial reductions in breakeven. I cited the Statoil number from $70 a barrel to $40 a barrel and they think they continue to cut that even further. Deepwater breakevens across the portfolio, it's a whole range of breakevens and so I don't think there's one particular magic number. But the sequence of which projects will go first, I think the smaller projects first, then the strategic ones, and then it will depend on the portfolio of that particular operator which projects go. Doug? I'll ask Doug to make some additional comments."

And one that I'd allude to is, up until this point, we have had -- we're in discussions on all of these major projects as you would expect us to be working with our partners and with our clients to find ways to substantially reduce cost and reduce the breakeven levels, as John described. Over the past year, that conversation has been singularly focused on cost. More recently, that conversation is shifted from cost to schedule and delivery. So we certainly see that as a positive weak signal where our customers are back to looking at not just cost, as you always have, but looking at cost and delivery schedule because they're planning out their production and wanting to be able to back -- come back from when they need the production to when they need to place the orders to be able to move some of these larger projects forward."

So the bucket start with installation services where the original equipment manufacturer, our equipment gets installed by FMC Technologies. We have a backlog of equipment we're delivering, it has to be installed. Even some of what we've delivered, is in our customer's inventory, it is yet to be installed. So that's a fairly significant bucket, if you will, is installation services of new equipment. We're also seeing installation of refurbished equipment which is another segment that is continuing to grow that makes sense. Operators that have got equipment they would rather, in today's environment, would rather refurbish it rather than by buy equipment. Again, that almost always goes back to the original equipment manufacturer and we're seeing our refurbished equipment, both the manufacturer but which counts as service revenue and the installation of it, starting to grow. And then the third bucket which we also expect to grow, is in maintaining production. So this is an existing production system that maybe need some maintenance, need to change out a choker or control system. Operators in today's environment, if they're not will spend that capital on new production, they're going to want to spend their operating expense or capital on maintaining the production they have. And so we expect that segment of the services market to grow and again, typically you would call out the original equipment manufacturer to do those installation services. And then finally, we have our Light Well Intervention services as part of service growth strategy. First quarter, that revenue was -- and inbound was fairly light or almost not existent. That comes back now in subsequent quarters this year. So those are the primary buckets of subsea service, some of which we -- you can see by the nature of my comments, we expect them to be fairly resilient. And in some cases, maybe a little bit of growth offsetting whatever reduction there might be in installation."

Welcome to our first quarter 2016 earnings conference call. With me today are Maryann Mannen, our Chief Financial Officer; and Doug Pferdehirt, our President and Chief Operating Officer. I'll begin my comments today with highlights from the",1312,"Good morning. Welcome to our first quarter 2016 earnings conference call. With me today are Maryann Mannen, our Chief Financial Officer; and Doug Pferdehirt, our President and Chief Operating Officer. I'll begin my comments today with highlights from the quarter as well as provide some remarks on the deepwater market and our subsea order outlook. Maryann will provide specifics on our finance performance and update our financial outlook for 2016. We'll then open up the call for questions.
Our first quarter results reflect both the challenge of our current market and our continued success in execution performance. For the first time in nearly 3 decades, E&P spending is set to decline for a second consecutive year. The North America land markets were impacted almost immediately and activity continued to decline into the first quarter.
Deepwater revenue has been supported by project backlog, but low orders are now beginning to impact our Subsea business. Despite the market challenges, we've made considerable progress in addressing the things that we control. We're driving operational success by improving execution and taking aggressive restructuring actions that permanently lower our costs. 
The improvements are most evident in our Subsea Technologies segment. We posted another solid performance this quarter, reporting margins of 13.1% when excluding charges. These are strong results for a business whose revenues fell 25% over the last 12 months. Very good execution and restructuring savings were key drivers to deliver these solid margins. 
In our Surface Technologies segment we faced a much more difficult challenge. The average U.S. rig count continued to decline in the quarter falling 23% sequentially. This hit our North America business much harder than we expected. We don't believe the current level -- low level of activity is sustainable. The timing and pace of recovery in North America land markets, however, remains uncertain.
Compared to North America, our international surface business has been more resilient and our results came in largely as expected. We continue to benefit from our geographic mix of business with relative strength coming from the Middle East and North African markets, where rig counts have held up and better than most other parts of the world. Across all of our businesses, we will continue to take further restructuring actions that go beyond workforce and facility reductions. We're committed to delivering a global footprint that is more efficient and scalable and it can provide sustainable savings well into any market recovery.
I'll close my remarks on the quarterly results with a comment on the balance sheet. We continue to stay focused on preserving our financial strength and liquidity in these uncertain times. We generated cash flow from operations of $109 million in the quarter and we reduced our net debt to $209 million. 
Turning to the deepwater outlook. The industry significant reduction in capital spending will ultimately lead to a decline in global production that will drive oil prices higher. With higher oil prices, the combination of operators improved cash flows and greater confidence in the market will move spending higher. Shale investment will come first given the smaller commitment and faster payback, but will take more than shale to fill the supply gap. There will be a need for both conventional and deepwater production to meet global demand.
But for deepwater to be a credible source of future supply, project economics must improve. For many operators, some of their best prospects can be found offshore, but they've been a challenged by poor returns. For these returns to improve, the industry must realize significant and sustainable reductions in the cost of deepwater development. As we've all seen the industry has demonstrated significant efficiency improvements and cost reductions in onshore unconventional shale. We believe that a similar transformation can occur in deepwater. But unlike shale, where most of the big savings and efficiencies have been achieved, we're still on the early innings for deepwater.
We're confident the industry can deliver these savings because of the rapid progress we're seeing on multiple fronts. First, operators themselves are changing their approach to deepwater development. For instance, the final design for BP's Mad Dog Phase 2 project will be substantially different than originally proposed. Significant savings will be realized by more closely matching infrastructure spend to the pace of field development. And while not project-specific, Statoil highlighted their success in reducing project breakevens from $70 a barrel to $41 per barrel, with the expectations to push that number even lower. Achieving this level of savings required more than overhead and vendor price reductions. It required fundamental changes in their development approach. 
Two significant components of deepwater development costs are drilling and topside facilities. Together, these 2 can be as much as 2/3 of the cost of a deepwater project. The cost of drilling has been particular impacted by the historic high level of day rates that will provide substantial savings as legacy contracts expire in the future. There are also many ways to reduce the cost of topside facilities. While we've yet to see much of these savings, so far, we think many of them will be sustainable.
In addition to these savings, our company is focused on reducing the cost of scope of our scope of supply. We know that we can significantly reduce the cost of subsea production equipment and installation through better execution, product standardization, innovative technology and new integrated business models. We're especially encouraged by the industry's early adoption of a differentiated business model that integrates the scope of both the subsea production system and the SURF scope to our Forsys Subsea joint venture and our alliance with Technip.
While we're confident improved returns will lead to future deepwater development, the subsea outlook in the near-term is being impacted by aggressive cutbacks in spending for major projects. In the first quarter, our total subsea orders of $346 million were driven largely by subsea services. This order level highlights the relative stability of our service business and supports our view that full year service orders should approximate $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion for the year. Our confidence in these service revenues is driven by our visibility around installation activity and our maintenance and repair work. Much of this work is funded by operating budgets, not capital budgets. These expenditures maximize production uptime and improve operator cash flows.
Small orders for subsea equipment were light in the quarter, but these orders are typically lumpy and never spread evenly throughout the year. We only expect to see a modest decline in small orders for the full year. These orders are typically tied to smaller projects that have lower capital costs and offer higher returns and accelerated cash paybacks. 
Over the next 24 months, we see the potential for nearly 20 large projects to move forward. Some large projects are considered strategic and could be awarded this year. But there is a likelihood that even these projects could be pushed into 2017. And we still do not expect any projects in excess of $500 million to be sanctioned before the end of the year.
The full recovery of deepwater will come when cash flows move higher, project economics improve and operators gain confidence in the business outlook. In the meantime, subsea order activity will reflect subsea service resilience, small projects associated with tiebacks and brownfield opportunities and some large strategic projects.
Clearly, there are significant challenges our industry faces today, but at FMC Technologies we remain focused on the things that we can control. We will continue to improve project execution to protect our margins and competitiveness. We will take further restructuring actions that both respond to the declining market and sustainably lower our costs. We'll remain focused on improving project economics through standardization, technology and integrated business models. And finally, we'll preserve our unique customer partnerships to secure awards in this highly competitive market.
I'll now turn the call over to Maryann."

Our first quarter diluted earnings per share were $0.22 when excluding certain charges of $48 million or $0.13 per diluted share. Included in our reported results, are pretax impairment and other charges of $36 million or $0.10 per diluted share. Restructuring and other severance charges of $12 million or $0.03 per diluted share. The impairment charges were related to our North American business in our Surface Technologies segment. Further reductions in market activity have impacted our outlook for revenue and profitability of certain assets requiring a reduction in their carrying value.
We have provided a schedule in our press release, issued last evening, to show the quarterly impact of all these costs incurred. We continue to take action to restructure our organization, both in response to reduced North American land activity as well as the outlook we have provided for lower revenues for our subsea business in 2016.
Our Subsea Technologies segment delivered solid results in the quarter. Subsea Technologies revenues in the quarter was $864 million. Quarter-over-quarter revenue comparisons were negatively impacted by lower project activity as well as $57 million of foreign currency translation. Subsea Technologies operating profit was $113 million in the quarter, with a margin of 13.1%, excluding restructuring and other severance and impairment and other charges of $4 million. Operating margins decreased 155 basis points quarter-over-quarter when excluding charges for both periods, as revenues were down approximately 25%. While down from the prior year quarter, solid operating margins were the results of strong project execution as well as the benefits of restructuring activity. Segment backlog exiting this quarter was $3.4 billion, which compares to a prior year backlog of $4.8 billion.
Moving to our Surface Technologies results. Surface Technologies revenues for the quarter were $266 million, down 41% from the prior year quarter. The revenue decline was driven by the steep contraction in our North American business, somewhat mitigated by more moderate declines in our international business. Geographic mix continues to provide some offset to the weak domestic market as rig declines have been more muted in international market, particularly in the Middle East. Surface Technologies operating profit for the first quarter was $13 million, when excluding impairment and restructuring and other charges of $42 million. Margins in the quarter were 5%, when excluding these charges. 
We have taken significant restructuring actions in our Surface Technologies segment. These actions were based in part on a planning forecast for 2016 that assumed U.S. rig count would decline to approximately 500 working rigs during the first quarter and then maintain that level for the remainder of the year. The actual rig count decline proved to be even more severe than we anticipated, declining 36% from year-end levels, just 450 rigs at quarter end. The rig count has since declined to 431 rigs as of the end of last week. While we have made good progress in adjusting to the lower activity levels in North America, the severity of the rig count decline will require us to take further actions. However, these actions will be balanced against our need to preserve operational capabilities that can respond to the market recovery.
Segment results reflect this challenging market, but excluding charges, we remain profitable do in part to the benefits of our significant restructuring actions to date as well as the relative strength of our international business. Segment backlog exiting the quarter stands at $429 million, this is predominantly related to our wellhead business outside of North America which continues to show resilience.
Moving to our Energy Infrastructure results. Revenue for the quarter was $84 million, down 17% from the prior year quarter. We reported a minor loss in the period when excluding charges. The segment continues to be negatively impacted by low oil prices. Our measurements solutions business has been most affected due to the contraction in energy-related infrastructure spend in our North American market. Overall, we recorded $10 million of restructuring cost in our segment operating results during the first quarter. 
We expect to incur additional restructuring cost of approximately $25 million to $30 million in total over the coming quarters as further actions are taken primarily in our Subsea Technologies segment. These headcount reductions and other restructuring actions will be more significant than previous as our subsea activity levels are reduced.
Let's turn to the corporate items. Corporate expense in the quarter was $14.3 million. We now expect to spend approximately $14 million to $15 million per quarter through the remainder of 2016. Other revenue and expense net reflects expense of $30 million. Our first quarter expense is typically higher than the remaining 3 quarters of the year due to the amortization period for certain equity compensation awards made in the period. Results were also impacted by foreign exchange losses. In the quarter, we experienced further impact from the ongoing Kwanzaa and Nigerian naira. For the remaining quarters of 2016, we still expect that other revenue and expense will be an expense of approximately $13 million to $14 million per quarter. This quarterly estimate remains subject to foreign currency fluctuation.
Our first quarter tax rate was 23.4%, which reflects the lower percentage of overall earnings, subject to U.S. tax. We now anticipate our 2016 tax rate to be between 21% and 23% for the full year given a mix of earnings. Capital spending this quarter was $35 million, primarily directed towards Subsea Technologies. We now expect capital spending in 2016 to be approximately $150 million. The spending does not include any contingent capital that may be needed to respond to a contract award.
We generated cash flow from operations of $109 million in the period. At the end of the first quarter, we had net debt of $210 million. It is comprised of $1 billion of cash and $1.2 billion of debt. Net debt has been reduced by more than $1.2 billion from its peak in the first quarter of 2013 due largely to the strong operating cash flows of the company. We averaged 229 million diluted shares outstanding in the quarter. We repurchased 1.1 million shares of stock during the first quarter at an average cost of $25.58 per share.
Looking forward, we continue to expect full year subsea revenues to approach $3.6 billion excluding the impact of foreign exchange, driven by approximately $2.2 billion of backlog conversion and $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion of subsea service revenues. We remain confident in full year subsea margins in a range of 11% to 13% excluding charges as we continue to execute well on our backlog and realize further benefits from our restructuring actions.
Surface Technologies revenue is now likely to be down approximately 25% to 30% versus 2015. North America activity has fallen more than expected and we are now basing our forecast on the assumption that the U.S. rig count remains near current levels through the end of the year. We now expect operating margins in the low to mid-single digits for the full year, excluding charges. 
Energy Infrastructure revenue is now likely to be down 5% to 10% year-over-year as market activity continues to be negatively impacted by our measurement solutions business. We now expect that operating margin should approximate low to mid-single digits for the year, excluding restructuring charges.
The first quarter results reflect the operational improvement we have made in our Subsea business, as well as the challenges our Surface and Energy Infrastructure business face, adjusting to the rapid pace of activity decline in North America. We have responded aggressively to the lower activity experienced in these markets. And as we indicated in our guidance, we are accelerating the pace of restructuring in the next few quarters in our Subsea Technologies segment. 
As John earlier discussed, this is not only headcount reductions, but also structural changes to the global management of our operations. We will continue to conservatively manage our balance sheet through this period of uncertainty. Our net debt was further reduced in the quarter. Our liquidity remains robust. We lowered our guidance for capital expenditures in 2016 and we maintained the flexibility to continue share repurchase as we have done consistently for many years.

Obviously, we're doing some restructuring just to contract our capacity in light of the market.

When we're executing better, we don't need the same structure to maintain our -- to deal with our performance. So we're in a position now where a lot of the restructuring is about delayering, it's about leaning out the organization. Again, something we can now do because of our execution improvements. The other thing we're doing is we're doing more consolidation. Because of standardization, we can consolidate our manufacturing in fewer locations. Again, an example of restructuring that is sustainable cost reduction."

So yes, we are maintaining the 11% to 13% as we have -- I mentioned earlier. It doesn't require us to get a significant amount of inbound this year, so most of that margin as it relates to the project is already our backlog. And then secondarily, John, just to address the question with respect to services. So assuming services hold up as we see, we feel very confident in our ability to execute 2016. As I also mentioned, over the next several quarters, remember our subsea service activity and our subsea project activity has been being very strong. We had one of the strongest years in 2015 and we're still executing a fairly large number of projects in 2016. As we get closer to the end of '16, of course, we begin to see those activity levels tail off. So we are forecasting, as I mentioned in my comments, a relatively significant amount of reductions coming in the next 3 quarters to address that tailing off. Given our estimates for inbound, and given that benefit from those restructuring, again, we feel pretty confident in our ability to maintain double-digit margin going into 2017. A little bit difficult for me to give you an exact quarter-by-quarter, as you can imagine the timing and a mix of projects as they come through will certainly impact that. But that's really the rationale for why we feel comfortable in the 11% to 13% this year and our ability to maintain double-digit going into '17."

Well, it could be that, it could be other -- there's lots of tooling that's involved in service beyond Light Well Intervention. So actually the money that we spent had less to do with Light Well Intervention and more to do with other service-related instillation assets. But service is a critical part of our strategy and it does require -- you need real assets that you then lease and rent to the customer. That's what that was about. When it comes to leaning out the organization, it's less about machine tools and that sort of thing. Those investments were all made several years ago when we were growing. This is about a manufacturing strategy that allows us through standard manufacturing -- let me just give you one example, Jim. We manufacture subsea equipment in multiple regions to be close to our customers and that strategy has served us well. But we manufacture that equipment, the same equipment different in each geographic region. Today, we have identified one manufacturing process, one assembly project, one machining process, and we do it in all the locations. And that's the kind of leaning out or savings that we're envisioning as opposed to big capital investments in machine tools. Quite frankly, because of the growth that we saw 3 years ago, the machine tools that we invested in then are state-of-the-art. So what we're talking about in terms of leaning out is manufacturing processes, taking advantage of standardization, taking advantage of global practices and really leveraging our good execution. You've seen for 8 quarters now where we've had solid execution. You've seen that in the margin. What this means is that we're delivering on time, we don't need to build safety nets and other structure to overcome poor execution and we're just leveraging that and that's what's allowing us to lean out the organization and streamline the manufacturing process."

But in speaking particularly to the North America market, there is the portion of our business that's more tied to the pressure pumping industry and then there's our integrated offering. So let me first talk about the pressure pumping industry. Clearly, as capacity comes back into the market, it will require new treating iron equipment or new flowline equipment to be associated with that equipment. We talked about cannibalization in the industry. There is different types of cannibalization. Some, if you will, more severe than others. But in all cases, that treating iron is not necessarily associated with the horsepower or with the unit, it's used as a kit. And we are the largest provider of that and we are the largest provider of inspection and repair services for that treating iron. So we have a good idea and a very good understanding of the state of that equipment and the capacity that's in the market today. So we are confident that it does not require a significant pickup for us to be beginning to see those orders flow more aggressively as that equipment will be needed to put that horsepower back into service. On our integrated offering, yes, increased activity, we will certainly benefit from that. But we're benefiting from the fact that we're changing our operating model and we're changing the commercial model by putting together the most holistic offering on surface to be able to help our customers most efficiently go from the last frac stage to selling of their commodity, or if you will, to the point of sale. By being able to bring that together, we've actually been able to increase our market share even in this downmarket."

So actually, what we've publicly announced was 3 integrated FEED studies and we have activity, actually, beyond that. So let me just talk in general about the activity that we have experienced and where we are in terms of the conversion of those projects. As we talked about when we first announced some of the original integrated FEED studies, some of them were all the way back at the concept stage. And we said, those studies would take 9 to 12 months to complete, typically another 6 months plus or minus for the project to be sanctioned. So you are looking at anywhere from about a 15- to an 18-month cycle between the conceptual integrated FEED, all the way through the conversion to an integrated EPCI or to the execution phase. On other projects, where we start pre-FEED or FEED, that cycle time is reduced by 3 to 6 months. We remain confident in the conversion of a project. And we had said in 2016, now for budgetary reasons, that may fall into the first quarter of 2017. But we certainly remain confident in the conversion from the integrated FEED to the integrated EPCI as we're able to demonstrate to our customers the significant savings by moving towards an integrated offering from a standalone SPS and SURF offering."

As I outlined in my prepared remarks, the sequence is going to go improved oil price, better cash flow, confidence in the market. At the same time, we're seeing the project economics dramatically are improved as a result of the fundamental changes the industry is going through to make significant cost changes. When will that confidence show up? That's a little hard to predict. But your question is, where will it show up first? Well, as a laid out, even in the so-called trough, service is resilient, small projects you would think would move first because of the capital commitment is less and returns are generally better. Then you're going to see projects, Darren, that are more strategic. There's another reason why that project needs to move forward. Maybe it's lease terms. Maybe it's a national oil company that is -- it's important to that national oil company to move out in the front. So you're going to see large projects move for some other strategic reason. And then finally, it will go operator by operator where operators have a large portfolio of undeveloped deepwater discoveries. And when they look at their total portfolio and their need to raise production, and they will do that all in concert with the improving economics, those are the projects that will bubble up to the top. Now what will the price be, the breakeven price? Well, I alluded that -- or well, share that in my remarks. We're seeing substantial reductions in breakeven. I cited the Statoil number from $70 a barrel to $40 a barrel and they think they continue to cut that even further. Deepwater breakevens across the portfolio, it's a whole range of breakevens and so I don't think there's one particular magic number. But the sequence of which projects will go first, I think the smaller projects first, then the strategic ones, and then it will depend on the portfolio of that particular operator which projects go. Doug? I'll ask Doug to make some additional comments."

So we certainly see that as a positive weak [ph] signal where our customers are back to looking at not just cost, as they always have, but looking at cost and delivery schedule because they're planning out their production and wanting to be able to back -- come back from when they need the production to when they need to place the orders to be able to move some of these larger projects forward."

We're the original equipment manufacturer, our equipment gets installed by FMC Technologies. We have a backlog of equipment we're delivering, it has to be installed. Even some of what we've delivered, is in our customers' inventory, it is yet to be installed. So that's a fairly significant bucket, if you will, is installation services of new equipment. We're also seeing installation of refurbished equipment which is another segment that is continuing to grow that makes sense. Operators that have got equipment they would rather, in today's environment, would rather refurbish it rather than by buy equipment. Again, that almost always goes back to the original equipment manufacturer and we're seeing our refurbished equipment, both the manufacturer but which counts as service revenue and the installation of it, starting to grow. And then the third bucket which we also expect to grow, is in maintaining production. So this is an existing production system that maybe need some maintenance, need to change out a choke or control system. Operators in today's environment, if they're not will spend that capital on new production, they're going to want to spend their operating expense or capital on maintaining the production they have. And so we expect that segment of the services market to grow and again, typically you would call out the original equipment manufacturer to do those installation services. And then finally, we have our Light Well Intervention services as part of service growth strategy. First quarter, that revenue was -- in inbound was fairly light or almost nonexistent. That comes back now in subsequent quarters this year. So those are the primary buckets of subsea service, some of which we -- you can see by the nature of my comments, we expect them to be fairly resilient. And in some cases, maybe a little bit of growth offsetting whatever reduction there might be in installation."

With me today are Maryann Mannen, our Chief Financial Officer; and Doug Pferdehirt, our President and Chief Operating Officer. 
I'll begin my remarks today with highlights from the quarter and then provide comments on the industry and outlook for our markets. I'll also speak to our strategy for dealing with the downturn and how we're better positioned for a market recovery, including comments on our pending merger with Technip. Doug will then speak to the status of the Technip merger, and more importantly, he'll share our customer's rationed to the merger before providing an update on our Subsea business. Maryann will follow with specifics on our financial performance and an update to our financial outlook for 2016, and then we'll open up the call for questions.
Operating results in the quarter reflect both market conditions and our actions to address the cyclical downturn as the continued weekends experienced in our service business was partially offset by another strong quarter in our Subsea business. Subsea orders in the quarter were limited to subsea services inbound and small equipment orders as we continue to see the impact of reduced capital spending. While orders were soft, our Subsea Technologies segment delivered margins of 14.1% when excluding charges. These solid results reflect our continued focus on execution, as well as the realization of additional restructuring savings. We've increased confidence in our ability to deliver strong performance for the year. Surface Technologies reported a loss in the quarter as revenue declines continued to offset the savings from our significant restructuring actions. 
Segment results were most negatively impacted by North America, where sequential decline in the U.S. rig count, as well as the seasonal effects of the Canadian breakup, post further challenges in the period. Our international service business continues to outpace North America, supported in large part by relative strength in the Middle East. We made further adjustments to our surface business in the second quarter and will continue to take additional actions. Today, the business is operating on a much lower cost basis, and that will help us navigate through the cycle while maintaining the operational looks ability needed to respond in a market recovery.
Turning to the market outlook. The energy industry has experienced significant change over the last 2 years. The uncertainty around energy demand and supply has remained a constant theme throughout the period. Global events continue to challenge demand while OPEC uncertainty, shale production declines and unexpected supply disruptions cast out on the stability of supply. 
Although timing is always uncertain, we do know that the dramatic pullback in energy investment will impact global production. The implications are evident in the U.S. where crude production has now fallen nearly 8% from its peak. 
Despite this uncertainty, commodity prices have improved over the course of this year. Oil and gas prices are now up more than 70% from the low levels reached in the first quarter. While they remain far below the prior peak, higher prices should improve operating cash flows. Confidence in the sustainability of those cash flows remains a key factor to moving capital spending higher. 
As confidence improves, we anticipate spending will follow. So far, this confidence is yet to materialize and customer spending in the quarter remained very depressed. Both North America and international rig counts experienced new cyclical Lowe's, and we've seen no pickup in domestic land activity beyond the seasonal effects of Canada. Long cycle businesses have also been impacted. Capital budgets do a reset during recent commodity lows continue to drive near-term spending lower. New order activity is moving at a very slow pace as sanctioning of deepwater projects continues to be delayed. 
But current activity only reflects the view of the current market. Long-term outlook is much different as the current pace of activity is just simply not sustainable. Even if global demand stays flat, the lack of investment will create a production shortfall that will ultimately reverse the spending cycle. Prices will respond, cash flows will improve and this will boost operators confidence. Capital spending will follow. And in that environment, shale will go back to work first. Shale has the advantage of the smaller upfront capital commitment and offers a faster payback to the operator. This activity increase will benefit our surface business in North America. 
We're also confident that deepwater investment will soon follow. Deepwater remains a critical component of global production and it's a necessary source of future hydrocarbon supply. Many of our customers have repeatedly confirmed this view. And given the major role that Deepwater place in their reserve base, offshore productions will continue to be a critical source of their future oil and gas production.
But for Deepwater to remain a viable resource, the industry recognizes that significant and sustainable cost reductions must be achieved. The opportunity for such cost reduction is very real in the offshore markets. While the cost of a major Deepwater project components have come down, there is significantly more savings that can be achieved. 
Our customers are not only lowering their operating cost, they're also changing their approach to developing Deepwater, discovering new ways to lower development cost and to spread out over time the capital required to move these large projects forward. These changes, along with the cost reductions in subsea production systems, SURF components, drilling and completion services and topside facilities, will further improve the economics of Deepwater development. 
In FMC Technologies, we remain focused on what we can control. The aggressive actions we've taken to restructure our organization in response to the downturn lower activity levels continue to drive our service and manufacturing cost lower. But these actions go beyond the near-term savings. Importantly, these efforts are intended to further strengthen our company so that in the recovery, we will be in a position to provide alternative approaches that offer improved execution, product standardization, innovative technologies and integrated business models. With integration, being the best opportunity to meaningfully impact the cost of development both on and offshore.
The creation of forces subsea provided tangible evidence of the benefits of integration. Through the joint venture, we can deliver savings that go beyond those that either partner could deliver on their own. In the course of working with Technip, we've also identified new ideas and new technologies that can create additional savings that are even more impactful than we originally imagined.
Over time, it became obvious to us that we could do even more working together as one company. Let me conclude by saying the current downturn in our industry is one of the most severe we've experienced in decades. We acted quickly and took aggressive actions in response to the challenges of the downcycle. But unlike previous cycles, the industry we emerge from this downcycle changed, at this time, things will be different and companies that survived this cycle will be fundamentally changed as well. We are changing. Our actions have gone beyond the typical cycle response. We've significantly lowered our cost. We've embraced standardization. We've developed new technologies. And most importantly, we've created an integrated business model that will be implemented and executed by a single merged company.
I'm confident that we will not only survive the downturn, but that we will lead the industry and the changes the future demands. I'll now turn it over to Doug and will come back later with some final remarks."

The last few months certainly been exciting times for FMC Technologies. As John pointed out, we are making big changes, and none will have a greater impact on the future of our company than the proposed merger with Technip. Let me begin with an update on Forsys Subsea, and more specifically, some detail around the FEED activity that is currently underway. I will then talk about the client response to the merger and finally, concluded with an update on our subsea outlook. 
Within 7 months of establishing the alliance and joint venture with Technip, we announced the Forsys Subsea had been awarded 3 integrated FEED studies. This was a remarkable achievement given the industry backdrop and it certainly exceeded our own expectations. These first 3 FEED studies demonstrate that operators are willing to consider a different approach to Deepwater development, one that could provide them with savings of up to 30% on the combined SPS and SURF scope. Today, Forsys Subsea is actively working on more than 30 projects. This includes a combination of projects, some of which are integrated and others that are more conventional in nature.
Integrated FEED studies now represent over 1/3 of the total, demonstrating increased confidence in an integrated approach. Forsys Subsea is focusing on those opportunities that can provide meaningful savings to the operator and have the best chance of a direct integrated EPCI award. We have increased confidence that an integrated FEED study will result in a direct award later this year. Building on the success of Forsys Subsea, we announced our merger with Technip. Upon announcement, customer feedback was very positive as many customers express their full support of the merger. In those conversations, there was a shared view that business as usual is no longer a viable option and that our business combination has the potential to provide a significant and sustainable improvement to deepwater project economics.
Looking under the merger progress over the first 60 days, we signed the official Business Combination Agreement mid-June, following the conclusion of the works council consultation process in Europe. In addition, we received a successful early conclusion of the U.S. Antitrust Review from regulators. We anticipate that we will close the transaction in early 2017. Let me now turn back to our subsea operations and spend a few moments on our recent orders and current outlook.
In the second quarter, we reported total subsea orders of $334 million, much like the prior quarter, orders were driven primarily by subsea services. In the quarter, surface orders were softer than anticipated, being impacted by a reduction in drilling related activities and in certain circumstances, a deferral of production enhancement activities due to budgetary reasons. We now expect subsea service orders to come in towards the lower end of our prior guidance of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion in 2016.
Now looking to Subsea Projects. We continue to see industry potential for nearly 20 large projects to be awarded over the next 24 months. Of these, we continue to attract a few that are likely to be awarded over the coming quarters. Small equipment orders were soft in the quarter, but customer conversations are providing improved visibility that should drive smaller orders higher in the second half. These opportunities are typically focused on increasing production through tiebacks to existing host facilities.
In summary, we are tracking a few large projects that are likely to be awarded over the next 12 months. We anticipate an increase in small orders in the second half of the year driven by our alliance partners. And we expect the conversion of an integrated FEED to an integrated EPCI project later this year. 
I will now turn the call over to Maryann."

Our second quarter diluted earnings per share were $0.22 when excluding certain after-tax charges of $47 million or $0.21 per diluted share. Included in our reported results, our restructuring and other severance charges of $25 million, merger transaction cost of $18 million, impairment and other charges of $4 million, facility consolidation expenses of $6 million and currency devaluation losses of $13 million. 
We have provided a schedule in our press release issued last evening to show the quarterly impact to net income of all the costs incurred. Last quarter, I shared with you our intention to take further restructuring cost in the balance of 2016. The majority of those restructuring charges anticipated were associated with our Subsea business as activity levels were expected to decline in the coming quarters. 
In the second quarter, we took a total of $28 million of impairment restructuring and other severance charges or $0.09 per diluted share across all our businesses. Our Subsea Technologies segment continues to deliver solid operating results in the quarter. Revenues were $854 million in the period. Quarter-over-quarter revenue comparisons were negatively impacted by lower project activity, as well as $29 million of foreign currency translation.
Subsea Technologies operating profit was $120 million in the quarter with a margin of 14.1% excluding charges of $23 million. Operating margins declined 120 basis points when excluding charges for both periods, despite revenue being down approximately 31%. Decremental margins were just 18% quarter-over-quarter when excluding charges as our restructuring initiatives and product cost reductions improved our performance. Segment backlog exiting the quarter was $2.9 billion, which compares to prior year backlog of $4.7 billion.
Moving to our Surface Technologies result. Surface Technologies revenue for the quarter were $219 million, down 40% from the prior year quarter. The revenue decline was driven by the steep contraction in our North American business, somewhat mitigated by more moderate declines in our international business. Geographic mix continues to provide some offset to the weak domestic markets, as rig activity has been more resilient in some of the major international markets. Surface Technologies operating loss for the second quarter was $17 million when excluding charges of $5 million.
Segment backlog exiting the quarter stands at $357 million. This is predominantly related to our wellhead business outside of North America, which continues to outperform the domestic market. 
Moving to our Energy Infrastructure results. Revenue for the quarter was $85 million, down 17% from the prior year quarter, and our GN infrastructure operating profit for the quarter was $8 million. This segment continues to be negatively impacted by our measurement solutions business due to the decline in energy-related infrastructure spending in North America.
Let's turn to the corporate items. Corporate expense in the quarter was $13.1 million. We continue to expect spending of approximately $14 million to $15 million per quarter through the remainder of 2016. Other revenue and expense net reflects expenses of $57.2 million. There were several items in the quarter that drove this expense above our estimated spend. These items included the following: Business combination transaction cost of $18 million; foreign currency losses of $13 million, including $7.5 million related to the Nigerian currency devaluation and $6 million in transition costs related to facility consolidations. 
For the remaining quarters of 2016, we now expect that other revenue and expense will be an expense of approximately $30 million per quarter, which includes approximately $15 million per quarter of transaction and integration-related spending for the merger. The quarterly estimate remains subject to foreign currency fluctuation.
Our tax provision in the quarter of $7.4 million does reflect a lower mix of U.S. income, but also was affected by certain expenses for merger activity that do not receive tax benefit. We continue to anticipate our 2016 tax rate to be between 21% and 23% for the full year given our mix of earnings. The full year estimated result assumes a portion of the expenses for the merger do not receive a tax benefits. 
Capital spending this quarter was $32 million primarily directed towards Subsea Technologies. We now expect capital spending in 2016 to be approximately $130 million, down from our previous guidance of $150 million. At the end of the second quarter, we had net debt of $251 million. It is comprised of $1.1 billion of cash and $1.3 billion of debt. We repurchased 782,000 shares of stock during the quarter at an average cost of $28.45 per share. In accordance with the Business Combination Agreement, we had expenditures repurchase activity until the completion of the merger. We averaged 228 million diluted shares outstanding in the quarter.
Looking forward, as Doug mentioned in his earlier remarks, we now expect full year subsea service revenue to approach the low end of our previously guidance range of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion. Full year revenue for Subsea Technologies is expected to be between $3.3 billion to $3.4 billion, which includes the year-to-date impact of $86 million of headwinds from the strength of the U.S. dollar. We now expect full year margins in a range of 12% to 13%, excluding charges, as we continue to execute well in our backlog and realize further benefits from our restructuring actions. 
Surface Technologies revenue is now likely to be down approximately 30% to 35% versus 2015. North American activity has fallen more than what's previously expected as recount continue to slip beyond April levels. We do not expect much improved revenue activity in the balance of 2016. 
As we shared last quarter, we have made significant headcount reductions in this segment. However, we continue to balance further actions in response to activity levels in North America with the need to preserve our operational capabilities to respond to market recovery. We are, however, taking further steps in the operational footprint for the North American business. 
We now expect operating margins in the low single digits for the full year excluding charges. Energy Infrastructure guidance is unchanged. We continue to expect revenue to decline 5% to 10% year-over-year with operating margins that should approximate low- to mid-single digits, excluding restructuring charges. 
The second quarter reflects the operational improvements we have made in our Subsea business, as well as the challenges our surface business faced adjusting to the rapid pace of activity declines in North America. As we indicated in our guidance, we are accelerating the pace of restructuring in our surface -- in our Subsea Technologies segment. These are not only headcount reductions, but also structural changes to the global footprint and management of our subsea operations.
These early actions have benefited the first half results. Additional actions will be required to offset the revenue declines we anticipate in 2017. We now expect to incur additional restructuring and facility rationalization of approximately $20 million to $25 million in the second half of the year. 
So in summary, we remain confident in our ability to deliver low cost solutions across all our businesses. In Subsea Technologies, our execution and cost improvement will position us well for lower activities in 2017. In Surface Technologies, our restructuring and integrated business model should allow us to perform well in the anticipated market recovery. 
I will now turn the call back to John before we open up for your questions."

So you could therefore conclude that the projects that are most likely to move forward in the near term are some of those early studies that we were engaged in.

And even in the recovery that the returns on those projects will not meet their or their investors' expectations. The only way for that -- so we can't wait for a recovery to make these projects economic. And therefore, it just demands change. Every conversation that Doug and I have had with senior executives at the E&P companies, they almost always start out with how to change. One of the nice things about the merger and many of the things that we've been investing in, we've got a lot -- it's a long discussion about the kinds of changes that can take place in the industry. In many cases, we can deliver. The conversation then typically moves to how do we implement this. And we do have conversations about, well, the old procurement contracting models probably don't work. And I've been especially impressed with the operator's willingness and openness to change. I've never seen anything like it. And I think that's when Doug talks about the almost dozens of integrated projects that we're working on, it reflects that willingness to change by the operators. And I think that they very clearly understand that some of the sacred cows in their organizations, some of the procurement, philosophies that they've used for years are going to have to change. I think they've actually recognize that. Now the pace of which they're willing to make those changes, we have to see. It'll vary by operators. Some are much more progressive, others are not. But the universe agree with the need to change. and I think that they understand that, that means that some of their past philosophies are going to have to change as well.

Happy to do that, Ole. So on the subsea side, you're absolutely right. Given our continued first half of the year, solid execution, as well as the benefits that we're seeing from product cost reduction as well as all the headcount restructuring, we have reduced the lower end of the range. So taken up the margin performance to a range of 12% to 13%. From a top line perspective, as Doug mentioned, we're seeing a little bit of softness in subsea services. So we're likely to be closer to the bottom end of that range in about 1.3. So that softens the top line on subsea just a bit. In Surface Technologies, we've taken the higher end of the downside off of 2015 by about another 5%. Last quarter, I think what I shared with you is down 25% to 30%. We could be down as much as 35% in surface margins in that single-digit range, low single-digits versus a low to mid, and really no change in Energy Infrastructure. Costs associated with the integration are really where our OID is changing. Otherwise, that's solid and no change in corporate expense."

Customers are talking, our pressure pumping customers are calling and asking about some delivery schedules and things like that. So there are some short green shoots, if you will, in that business, but we have seen a show up in our inbound numbers yet and we would expect to in the coming quarters. But it will require some stabilization and recovery in the rig count. And as you know, it's not only rig count related, it's also the intensity related.

So what we're talking about right now is that we are seeing some deferrals of certain activities around production enhancement. So let me explain what that means for our business. So often, they were well born subsurface issues that occur in any producing well, onshore or offshore. That goes into a budgetary process. They wanted, receives approval. Depending on would be activities -- they're quite activity is if it cannot be done by a vessel, if it requires mechanical intervention into the subsurface, then that typically means a rig comes out. When the rig comes out, they remove our tree. When they remove our tree and they go about doing the work over on the rig with a subsurface, that tree is typically returned to us. We then go through a process of inspection, maintenance repair on that tree and then we reinstall that tree. So we're involved in the process of removing the tree inspecting and repeating the tree and then putting the tree back in place. There is a pretty healthy backlog of that activity, and we have a very long cycle visibility into when that's going to occur. What we saw happen this quarter is there were in certain circumstances, there were some situations where that wellbore intervention, that wellbore work, this is again heavy intervention. It may mean sidetracking a well or it may mean removing some damage equipment that's within the well. That our -- that, that has been postponed. And when that was postponed, that obviously affected our services business for the 3 areas that I described that we're involved in. That is a deferral. That is not a cancellation. That will reoccur. It's just it was being deferred out and in some cases, we could see that flipping out in the calendar year, which is why we gave the revised guidance. The business is still very robust. It is still very solid. And we continue to grow and expand and bring new offerings into subsea services. All that we're saying is we're seeing some of that activity shipped out. We're still within the range of our guidance. We were just pinpointing a little bit more within that range we were likely to end up for the calendar year."

With me today are Maryann Mannen, our Chief Financial Officer; and Doug Pferdehirt, our President and Chief Operating Officer. 
I'll begin my remarks today with highlights from the quarter and then provide comments on the industry and outlook for our markets. I'll also speak to our strategy for dealing with the downturn and how we're better positioned for a market recovery, including comments on our pending merger with Technip. Doug will then speak to the status of the Technip merger, and more importantly, he'll share our customers' reactions to the merger before providing an update on our Subsea business. Maryann will follow with specifics on our financial performance and an update to our financial outlook for 2016, and then we'll open up the call for questions.
Operating results in the quarter reflect both market conditions and our actions to address the cyclical downturn, as the continued weakness experienced in our Surface business was partially offset by another strong quarter in our Subsea business. 
Subsea orders in the quarter were limited to subsea services inbound and small equipment orders, as we continue to see the impact of reduced capital spending. While orders were soft, our Subsea Technologies segment delivered margins of 14.1% when excluding charges. These solid results reflect our continued focus on execution as well as the realization of additional restructuring savings. We've increased confidence in our ability to deliver strong performance for the year. 
Surface Technologies reported a loss in the quarter, as revenue declines continued to offset the savings from our significant restructuring actions. Segment results were most negatively impacted by North America, where sequential decline in the U.S. rig count as well as the seasonal effects of the Canadian breakup post further challenges in the period. 
Our international service business continues to outpace North America, supported in large part by relative strength in the Middle East. We made further adjustments to our surface business in the second quarter and will continue to take additional actions. Today, the business is operating on a much lower cost basis, and that will help us navigate through the cycle while maintaining the operational flexibility needed to respond in a market recovery.
Turning to the market outlook. The energy industry has experienced significant change over the last 2 years. The uncertainty around energy demand and supply has remained a constant theme throughout the period. Global events continue to challenge demand while OPEC uncertainty, shale production declines and unexpected supply disruptions casted out on the stability of supply. Although timing is always uncertain, we do know that the dramatic pullback in energy investment will impact global production. The implications are evident in the U.S., where crude production has now fallen nearly 8% from its peak. 
Despite this uncertainty, commodity prices have improved over the course of this year. Oil and gas prices are now up more than 70% from the low levels reached in the first quarter. While they remain far below the prior peak, higher prices should improve operator cash flows. Confidence in the sustainability of those cash flows remains a key factor to moving capital spending higher. As confidence improves, we anticipate spending will follow. 
So far, this confidence is yet to materialize, and customer spending in the quarter remained very depressed. Both North America and international rig counts experienced new cyclical lows, and we've seen no pickup in domestic land activity beyond the seasonal effects of Canada. Long cycle businesses have also been impacted. Capital budgets do a reset during recent commodity lows continue to drive near-term spending lower. New order activity is moving at a very slow pace as sanctioning of deepwater projects continues to be delayed. 
But current activity only reflects the view of the current market. Long-term outlook is much different, as the current pace of activity is just simply not sustainable. Even if global demand stays flat, the lack of investment will create a production shortfall that will ultimately reverse the spending cycle. Prices will respond, cash flows will improve and this will boost the operators' confidence. Capital spending will follow. And in that environment, shale will go back to work first. Shale has the advantage of smaller upfront capital commitment and offers a faster payback to the operator. This activity increase will benefit our surface business in North America. 
We're also confident that deepwater investment will soon follow. Deepwater remains a critical component of global production and it's a necessary source of future hydrocarbon supply. Many of our customers have repeatedly confirmed this view. And given the major role that deepwater place in their reserve base, offshore productions will continue to be a critical source of their future oil and gas production.
But for deepwater to remain a viable resource, the industry recognizes that significant and sustainable cost reductions must be achieved. The opportunity for such cost reduction is very real in the offshore market. While the cost of a major deepwater project components have come down, there is significantly more savings that can be achieved. 
Our customers are not only lowering their operating cost, they're also changing their approach to developing deepwater, discovering new ways to lower development cost and to spread out over time the capital required to move these large projects forward. These changes, along with the cost reductions in subsea production systems, SURF components, drilling and completion services and topside facilities, will further improve the economics of deepwater development. 
At FMC Technologies, we remain focused on what we can control. The aggressive actions we've taken to restructure our organization in response to the downturn lower activity levels continue to drive our service and manufacturing cost lower. But these actions go beyond the near-term savings. Importantly, these efforts are intended to further strengthen our company so that in the recovery, we will be in a position to provide alternative approaches that offer improved execution, product standardization, innovative technologies and integrated business models, with integration being the best opportunity to meaningfully impact the cost of development, both on and offshore.
The creation of Forsys Subsea provided tangible evidence of the benefits of integration. Through the joint venture, we can deliver savings that go beyond those that either partner could deliver on their own. In the course of working with Technip, we've also identified new ideas and new technologies that can create additional savings that are even more impactful than we originally imagined. Over time, it became obvious to us that we could do even more working together as one company. 
Let me conclude by saying the current downturn on our industry is one of the most severe we've experienced in decades. We acted quickly and took aggressive actions in response to the challenges of the downcycle. But unlike previous cycles, the industry will emerge from this downcycle changed. This time, things will be different, and companies that survived this cycle will be fundamentally changed as well. 
We are changing. Our actions have gone beyond the typical cycle response. We've significantly lowered our cost. We've embraced standardization. We've developed new technologies. And most importantly, we've created an integrated business model that will be implemented and executed by a single merged company. I'm confident that we will not only survive the downturn, but that we will lead the industry and the changes the future demands. 
I'll now turn it over to Doug and will come back later with some final remarks."

As John pointed out, we are making big changes, and none will have a greater impact on the future of our company than the proposed merger with Technip. Let me begin",621,"Thanks, John. The last few months have certainly been exciting times for FMC Technologies. As John pointed out, we are making big changes, and none will have a greater impact on the future of our company than the proposed merger with Technip. Let me begin with an update on Forsys Subsea, and more specifically, some detail around the FEED activity that is currently underway. I will then talk about the client response to the merger and finally conclude with an update on our subsea outlook. 
Within 7 months of establishing the alliance and joint venture with Technip, we announced the Forsys Subsea had been awarded 3 integrated FEED studies. This was a remarkable achievement given the industry backdrop, and it certainly exceeded our own expectations. These first 3 FEED studies demonstrate that operators are willing to consider a different approach to deepwater development, one that could provide them with savings of up to 30% on the combined SPS and SURF scope. Today, Forsys Subsea is actively working on more than 30 projects. This includes a combination of projects, some of which are integrated and others that are more conventional in nature. Integrated FEED studies now represent over 1/3 of the total, demonstrating increased confidence in an integrated approach. Forsys Subsea is focusing on those opportunities that can provide meaningful savings to the operator and have the best chance of a direct integrated EPCI award. We have increased confidence that an integrated FEED study will result in a direct award later this year. 
Building on the success of Forsys Subsea, we announced our merger with Technip. Upon announcement, customer feedback was very positive, as many customers express their full support of the merger. In those conversations, there was a shared view that business as usual is no longer a viable option, and that our business combination has the potential to provide a significant and sustainable improvement to deepwater project economics.
Looking at the merger progress over the first 60 days, we signed the official Business Combination Agreement mid-June, following the conclusion of the works council consultation process in Europe. In addition, we received a successful early conclusion of the U.S. Antitrust Review from regulators. We anticipate that we will close the transaction in early 2017. 
Let me now turn back to our subsea operations and spend a few moments on our recent orders and current outlook. In the second quarter, we reported total subsea orders of $334 million. Much like the prior quarter, orders were driven primarily by subsea services. In the quarter, service orders were softer than anticipated, being impacted by a reduction in drilling-related activities and in certain circumstances, a deferral of production enhancement activities due to budgetary reasons. We now expect subsea service orders to come in towards the lower end of our prior guidance of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion in 2016.
Now looking to Subsea Projects. We continue to see industry potential for nearly 20 large projects to be awarded over the next 24 months. Of these, we continue to attract a few that are likely to be awarded over the coming quarters. Small equipment orders were soft in the quarter, but customer conversations are providing improved visibility that should drive smaller orders higher in the second half. These opportunities are typically focused on increasing production through tiebacks to existing host facilities.
In summary, we are tracking a few large projects that are likely to be awarded over the next 12 months. We anticipate an increase in small orders in the second half of the year driven by our alliance partners. And we expect the conversion of an integrated FEED to an integrated EPCI project later this year. 
I will now turn the call over to Maryann."

Our second quarter diluted earnings per share were $0.22 when excluding certain after-tax charges of $47 million or $0.21 per diluted share.

Our second quarter diluted earnings per share were $0.22 when excluding certain after-tax charges of $47 million or $0.21 per diluted share. Included in our reported results, our restructuring and other severance charges of $25 million, merger transaction cost of $18 million, impairment and other charges of $4 million, facility consolidation expenses of $6 million and currency devaluation losses of $13 million. We have provided a schedule in our press release issued last evening to show the quarterly impact to net income of all the costs incurred. 
Last quarter, I shared with you our intention to take further restructuring cost in the balance of 2016. The majority of those restructuring charges anticipated were associated with our Subsea business as activity levels were expected to decline in the coming quarters. In the second quarter, we took a total of $28 million of impairment restructuring and other severance charges or $0.09 per diluted share across all our businesses. 
Our Subsea Technologies segment continues to deliver solid operating results in the quarter. Revenues were $854 million in the period. Quarter-over-quarter revenue comparisons were negatively impacted by lower project activity as well as $29 million of foreign currency translation. Subsea Technologies operating profit was $120 million in the quarter with a margin of 14.1% excluding charges of $23 million. Operating margins declined 120 basis points when excluding charges for both periods, despite revenue being down approximately 31%. Decremental margins were just 18% quarter-over-quarter when excluding charges, as our restructuring initiatives and product cost reductions improved our performance. Segment backlog exiting the quarter was $2.9 billion, which compares to prior year backlog of $4.7 billion.
Moving to our Surface Technologies results. Surface Technologies revenue for the quarter were $219 million, down 40% from the prior year quarter. The revenue decline was driven by the steep contraction in our North American business, somewhat mitigated by more moderate declines in our international business. Geographic mix continues to provide some offset to the weak domestic markets, as rig activity has been more resilient in some of the major international markets. Surface Technologies operating loss for the second quarter was $17 million when excluding charges of $5 million. Segment backlog exiting the quarter stands at $357 million. This is predominantly related to our wellhead business outside of North America, which continues to outperform the domestic market. 
Moving to our Energy Infrastructure results. Revenue for the quarter was $85 million, down 17% from the prior year quarter. Energy Infrastructure operating profit for the quarter was $8 million. The segment continues to be negatively impacted by our measurement solutions business due to the decline in energy-related infrastructure spending in North America.
Let's turn to the corporate items. Corporate expense in the quarter was $13.1 million. We continue to expect spending of approximately $14 million to $15 million per quarter through the remainder of 2016. Other revenue and expense net reflects expenses of $57.2 million. There were several items in the quarter that drove this expense above our estimated spend. These items included the following: Business combination transaction cost of $18 million; foreign currency losses of $13 million, including $7.5 million related to the Nigerian currency devaluation and $6 million in transition cost related to facility consolidations. 
For the remaining quarters of 2016, we now expect that other revenue and expense will be an expense of approximately $30 million per quarter, which includes approximately $15 million per quarter of transaction and integration-related spending for the merger. The quarterly estimate remains subject to foreign currency fluctuation.
Our tax provision in the quarter of $7.4 million does reflect a lower mix of U.S. income, but also was affected by certain expenses for merger activity that do not receive tax benefit. We continue to anticipate our 2016 tax rate to be between 21% and 23% for the full year given our mix of earnings. The full year estimated result assumes a portion of the expenses for the merger do not receive a tax benefit.
Capital spending this quarter was $32 million, primarily directed towards Subsea Technologies. We now expect capital spending in 2016 to be approximately $130 million, down from our previous guidance of $150 million. At the end of the second quarter, we had net debt of $251 million. It is comprised of $1.1 billion of cash and $1.3 billion of debt. We repurchased 782,000 shares of stock during the quarter at an average cost of $28.45 per share. In accordance with the Business Combination Agreement, we had suspended share repurchase activity until the completion of the merger. We averaged 228 million diluted shares outstanding in the quarter.
Looking forward, as Doug mentioned in his earlier remarks, we now expect full year subsea service revenue to approach the low end of our previously guidance range of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion. Full year revenue for Subsea Technologies is expected to be between $3.3 billion to $3.4 billion, which includes the year-to-date impact of $86 million of headwinds from the strength of the U.S. dollar. We now expect full year margins in a range of 12% to 13% excluding charges, as we continue to execute well on our backlog and realize further benefits from our restructuring actions. 
Surface Technologies revenue is now likely to be down approximately 30% to 35% versus 2015. North American activity has fallen more than what's previously expected, as recount continue to slip beyond April levels. We do not expect much improved revenue activity in the balance of 2016. As we shared last quarter, we have made significant headcount reductions in this segment. However, we continue to balance further actions in response to activity levels in North America with the need to preserve our operational capabilities to respond to market recovery. We are, however, taking further steps in the operational footprint for the North American business. We now expect operating margins in the low single digits for the full year excluding charges. 
Energy Infrastructure guidance is unchanged. We continue to expect revenue to decline 5% to 10% year-over-year with operating margins that should approximate low- to mid-single digits, excluding restructuring charges. 
The second quarter reflects the operational improvements we have made in our Subsea business as well as the challenges our surface business faced adjusting to the rapid pace of activity declines in North America. As we indicated in our guidance, we are accelerating the pace of restructuring in our surface -- excuse me, in our Subsea Technologies segment. These are not only headcount reductions, but also structural changes to the global footprint and management of our subsea operations.
These early actions have benefited the first half results. Additional actions will be required to offset the revenue declines we anticipate in 2017. We now expect to incur additional restructuring and facility rationalization of approximately $20 million to $25 million in the second half of the year. 
So in summary, we remain confident in our ability to deliver low cost solutions across all our businesses. In Subsea Technologies, our execution and cost improvement will position us well for lower activities in 2017. In Surface Technologies, our restructuring and integrated business model should allow us to perform well in the anticipated market recovery. 
I will now turn the call back to John before we open up for your questions."

But also we're talking about the structural footprint that we will be using on a go-forward basis. You may remember in the last quarter, I talked about really trying to change our operational footprint, so we can have increased capacity on a smaller footprint. So we are getting ourselves prepared for the volumes that we've anticipated for 2017.

The only way for that -- so we can't wait for recovery to make these projects economic. And therefore, it just demands change. Every conversation that Doug and I have had with senior executives at the E&P companies, they almost always start out with how to change. One of the nice things about the merger and many of the things that we've been investing in, we've got a lot -- it's a long discussion about the kinds of changes that can take place in the industry that, in many cases, we can deliver. The conversation then typically moves to how do we implement this. And we do have conversations about, well, the old procurement contracting models probably don't work. And I've been especially impressed with the operators' willingness and openness to change. I've never seen anything like it. And I think that's when Doug talks about the almost dozens of integrated projects that we're working on. It reflects that willingness to change by the operators. And I think they very clearly understand that some of the sacred cows in their organizations, some of the procurement philosophies that they've used for years are going to have to change. I think they absolutely recognize that. Now the pace of which they're willing to make those changes, we have to see. It'll vary by operators. Some are much more progressive, others are not. But they universally agree with the need to change. And I think that they understand that, that means some of their past philosophies are going to have to change as well.

Those 3 elements are really key because that's what's given our customers the confidence that this integrated offering is real. It can deliver the results.

From a topline perspective, as Doug mentioned, we're seeing a little bit of softness in subsea services. So we're likely to be closer to the bottom end of that range in at about 1.3, so that softens the top line on subsea just a bit. In Surface Technologies, we've taken the higher end of the downside off of 2015 by about another 5%. Last quarter, I think what I shared with you is down 25% to 30%. We could be down as much as 35% in surface margins in that single-digit range, low single-digits versus low to mid, and really no change in Energy Infrastructure.

As you know, we -- my initial guidance to you last quarter, we said we were basing that guidance on a flat rig count, right? And as you know, that rig count continue to slip. Also in the second quarter, we announced in Q1 our intention to sell our wireline business. And so we were clearly closing up and completing that sale in the second quarter. And then with respect to your questions around Q3 and Q4, yes, we certainly do expect margin improvement in 3 and 4. Obviously, we've gone through a lot of restructuring.

So what we're talking about right now is that we are seeing some deferrals of certain activities around production enhancement. So let me explain what that means for our business. So often, they were wellbore subsurface issues that occur in any producing well, onshore or offshore. That goes into a budgetary process. They want it, receives approval. They -- depending on what the activity is -- the required activity is, if it cannot be done by a vessel, if it requires mechanical intervention into the subsurface, then that typically means a rig comes out. When the rig comes out, they remove our tree. When they remove our tree and they go about doing the work over on the rig with a subsurface, that tree is typically returned to us. We then go through a process of inspection, maintenance repair on that tree and then we reinstall that tree. So we're involved in the process of removing the tree, inspecting and repairing the tree and then putting the tree back in place. There is a pretty healthy backlog of that activity, and we have a very long cycle visibility into when that's going to occur. What we saw happen this quarter is there were -- in certain circumstances, there were some situations where that wellbore intervention or that wellbore work, this is again heavy intervention. It may mean sidetracking a well or it may mean removing some damaged equipment that's within the well. That our -- that, that has been postponed. And when that was postponed, that obviously affected our services business for the 3 areas that I described that we're involved in. That is a deferral. That is not a cancellation. That will reoccur. It's just it was being deferred out. And in some cases, we could see that slipping out in the calendar year, which is why we gave the revised guidance. The business is still very robust. It is still very solid. And we continue to grow and expand and bring new offerings into subsea services. All that we're saying is we're seeing some of that activity shipped out. We're still within the range of our guidance. We were just pinpointing a little bit more within that range where we're likely to end up for the calendar year."

With me today are Maryann Mannen, our Chief Financial Officer; and Doug Pferdehirt, our President and Chief Operating Officer. 
I'll begin my remarks today with highlights from the quarter and then provide comments on the industry and outlook for our markets. I'll also speak to our strategy for dealing with the downturn and how we're better positioned for a market recovery, including comments on our pending merger with Technip. Doug will then speak to the status of the Technip merger, and more importantly, he'll share our customers' reactions to the merger before providing an update on our Subsea business. Maryann will follow with specifics on our financial performance and an update to our financial outlook for 2016, and then we'll open up the call for questions.
Operating results in the quarter reflect both market conditions and our actions to address the cyclical downturn, as the continued weakness experienced in our Surface business was partially offset by another strong quarter in our Subsea business. 
Subsea orders in the quarter were limited to subsea services inbound and small equipment orders, as we continue to see the impact of reduced capital spending. While orders were soft, our Subsea Technologies segment delivered margins of 14.1% when excluding charges. These solid results reflect our continued focus on execution as well as the realization of additional restructuring savings. We've increased confidence in our ability to deliver strong performance for the year. 
Surface Technologies reported a loss in the quarter, as revenue declines continued to offset the savings from our significant restructuring actions. Segment results were most negatively impacted by North America, where sequential decline in the U.S. rig count as well as the seasonal effects of the Canadian breakup posed further challenges in the period. 
Our international service business continues to outpace North America, supported in large part by relative strength in the Middle East. We made further adjustments to our Surface business in the second quarter and will continue to take additional actions. Today, the business is operating on a much lower cost basis, and that will help us navigate through the cycle while maintaining the operational flexibility needed to respond in a market recovery.
Turning to the market outlook. The energy industry has experienced significant change over the last 2 years. The uncertainty around energy demand and supply has remained a constant theme throughout the period. Global events continue to challenge demand while OPEC uncertainty, shale production declines and unexpected supply disruptions cast doubt on the stability of supply. Although timing is always uncertain, we do know that the dramatic pullback in energy investment will impact global production. The implications are evident in the U.S., where crude production has now fallen nearly 8% from its peak. 
Despite this uncertainty, commodity prices have improved over the course of this year. Oil and gas prices are now up more than 70% from the low levels reached in the first quarter. While they remain far below the prior peak, higher prices should improve operator cash flows. Confidence in the sustainability of those cash flows remains a key factor to moving capital spending higher. As confidence improves, we anticipate spending will follow. 
So far, this confidence is yet to materialize, and customer spending in the quarter remained very depressed. Both North America and international rig counts experienced new cyclical lows, and we've seen no pickup in domestic land activity beyond the seasonal effects of Canada. Long cycle businesses have also been impacted. Capital budgets through a reset during recent commodity lows continue to drive near-term spending lower. New order activity is moving at a very slow pace as sanctioning of deepwater projects continues to be delayed. 
But current activity only reflects the view of the current market. Long-term outlook is much different, as the current pace of activity is just simply not sustainable. Even if global demand stays flat, the lack of investment will create a production shortfall that will ultimately reverse the spending cycle. Prices will respond, cash flows will improve and this will boost the operators' confidence. Capital spending will follow. And in that environment, shale will go back to work first. Shale has the advantage of smaller upfront capital commitment and offers a faster payback to the operator. This activity increase will benefit our surface business in North America. 
We're also confident that deepwater investment will soon follow. Deepwater remains a critical component of global production and it's a necessary source of future hydrocarbon supply. Many of our customers have repeatedly confirmed this view. And given the major role that deepwater plays in their reserve base, offshore production will continue to be a critical source of their future oil and gas production.
But for deepwater to remain a viable resource, the industry recognizes that significant and sustainable cost reductions must be achieved. The opportunity for such cost reduction is very real in the offshore market. While the cost of the major deepwater project components have come down, there is significantly more savings that can be achieved. 
Our customers are not only lowering their operating cost, they're also changing their approach to developing deepwater, discovering new ways to lower development cost and to spread out over time the capital required to move these large projects forward. These changes, along with the cost reductions in subsea production systems, SURF components, drilling and completion services and topside facilities, will further improve the economics of deepwater development. 
At FMC Technologies, we remain focused on what we can control. The aggressive actions we've taken to restructure our organization in response to the downturn lower activity levels continue to drive our service and manufacturing costs lower. But these actions go beyond the near-term savings. Importantly, these efforts are intended to further strengthen our company so that in the recovery, we will be in a position to provide alternative approaches that offer improved execution, product standardization, innovative technologies and integrated business models, with integration being the best opportunity to meaningfully impact the cost of development, both on and offshore.
The creation of Forsys Subsea provided tangible evidence of the benefits of integration. Through the joint venture, we can deliver savings that go beyond those that either partner could deliver on their own. In the course of working with Technip, we've also identified new ideas and new technologies that can create additional savings that are even more impactful than we originally imagined. Over time, it became obvious to us that we could do even more working together as one company. 
Let me conclude by saying the current downturn in our industry is one of the most severe we've experienced in decades. We acted quickly and took aggressive actions in response to the challenges of the down cycle. But unlike previous cycles, the industry will emerge from this down cycle changed. This time, things will be different, and companies that survive this cycle will be fundamentally changed as well. 
We are changing. Our actions have gone beyond the typical cycle response. We've significantly lowered our cost. We've embraced standardization. We've developed new technologies. And most importantly, we've created an integrated business model that will be implemented and executed by a single merged company. I'm confident that we will not only survive the downturn, but that we will lead the industry in the changes the future demands. 
I'll now turn it over to Doug and will come back later with some final remarks."

The last few months have certainly been exciting times for FMC Technologies. As John pointed out, we are making big changes, and none will have a greater impact on the future of our company than the proposed merger with Technip. Let me begin with an update on Forsys Subsea, and more specifically, some detail around the FEED activity that is currently underway. I will then talk about the client response to the merger and finally conclude with an update on our subsea outlook. 
Within 7 months of establishing the alliance and joint venture with Technip, we announced that Forsys Subsea had been awarded 3 integrated FEED studies. This was a remarkable achievement given the industry backdrop, and it certainly exceeded our own expectations. These first 3 FEED studies demonstrate that operators are willing to consider a different approach to deepwater development, one that could provide them with savings of up to 30% on the combined SPS and SURF scope. Today, Forsys Subsea is actively working on more than 30 projects. This includes a combination of projects, some of which are integrated and others that are more conventional in nature. Integrated FEED studies now represent over 1/3 of the total, demonstrating increased confidence in an integrated approach. Forsys Subsea is focusing on those opportunities that can provide meaningful savings to the operator and have the best chance of a direct integrated EPCI award. We have increased confidence that an integrated FEED study will result in a direct award later this year. 
Building on the success of Forsys Subsea, we announced our merger with Technip. Upon announcement, customer feedback was very positive, as many customers expressed their full support of the merger. In those conversations, there was a shared view that business as usual is no longer a viable option, and that our business combination has the potential to provide a significant and sustainable improvement to deepwater project economics.
Looking at the merger progress over the first 60 days, we signed the official Business Combination Agreement mid-June, following the conclusion of the works council consultation process in Europe. In addition, we received a successful early conclusion of the U.S. Antitrust Review from regulators. We anticipate that we will close the transaction in early 2017. 
Let me now turn back to our subsea operations and spend a few moments on our recent orders and current outlook. In the second quarter, we reported total subsea orders of $334 million. Much like the prior quarter, orders were driven primarily by subsea services. In the quarter, service orders were softer than anticipated, being impacted by a reduction in drilling-related activities and in certain circumstances, a deferral of production enhancement activities due to budgetary reasons. We now expect subsea service orders to come in towards the lower end of our prior guidance of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion in 2016.
Now looking to Subsea Projects. We continue to see industry potential for nearly 20 large projects to be awarded over the next 24 months. Of these, we continue to track a few that are likely to be awarded over the coming quarters. Small equipment orders were soft in the quarter, but customer conversations are providing improved visibility that should drive smaller orders higher in the second half. These opportunities are typically focused on increasing production through tiebacks to existing host facilities.
In summary, we are tracking a few large projects that are likely to be awarded over the next 12 months. We anticipate an increase in small orders in the second half of the year driven by our alliance partners. And we expect the conversion of an integrated FEED to an integrated EPCI project later this year. 
I will now turn the call over to Maryann."

Our second quarter diluted earnings per share were $0.22 when excluding certain after-tax charges of $47 million or $0.21 per diluted share. Included in our reported results are restructuring and other severance charges of $25 million, merge",1208,"Thanks, Doug. Our second quarter diluted earnings per share were $0.22 when excluding certain after-tax charges of $47 million or $0.21 per diluted share. Included in our reported results are restructuring and other severance charges of $25 million, merger transaction costs of $18 million, impairment and other charges of $4 million, facility consolidation expenses of $6 million and currency devaluation losses of $13 million. We have provided a schedule in our press release issued last evening to show the quarterly impact to net income of all the costs incurred. 
Last quarter, I shared with you our intention to take further restructuring cost in the balance of 2016. The majority of those restructuring charges anticipated were associated with our Subsea business as activity levels were expected to decline in the coming quarters. In the second quarter, we took a total of $28 million of impairment restructuring and other severance charges or $0.09 per diluted share across all our businesses. 
Our Subsea Technologies segment continues to deliver solid operating results in the quarter. Revenues were $854 million in the period. Quarter-over-quarter revenue comparisons were negatively impacted by lower project activity as well as $29 million of foreign currency translation. Subsea Technologies operating profit was $120 million in the quarter with a margin of 14.1% excluding charges of $23 million. Operating margins declined 120 basis points when excluding charges for both periods, despite revenue being down approximately 31%. Decremental margins were just 18% quarter-over-quarter when excluding charges, as our restructuring initiatives and product cost reductions improve our performance. Segment backlog exiting the quarter was $2.9 billion, which compares to prior year backlog of $4.7 billion.
Moving to our Surface Technologies results. Surface Technologies revenue for the quarter were $219 million, down 40% from the prior year quarter. The revenue decline was driven by the steep contraction in our North American business, somewhat mitigated by more moderate declines in our international business. Geographic mix continues to provide some offset to the weak domestic markets, as rig activity has been more resilient in some of the major international markets. Surface Technologies operating loss for the second quarter was $17 million when excluding charges of $5 million. Segment backlog exiting the quarter stands at $357 million. This is predominantly related to our wellhead business outside of North America, which continues to outperform the domestic market. 
Moving to our Energy Infrastructure results. Revenue for the quarter was $85 million, down 17% from the prior year quarter. Energy Infrastructure operating profit for the quarter was $8 million. The segment continues to be negatively impacted by our measurement solutions business due to the decline in energy-related infrastructure spending in North America.
Let's turn to the corporate items. Corporate expense in the quarter was $13.1 million. We continue to expect spending of approximately $14 million to $15 million per quarter through the remainder of 2016. Other revenue and expense, net, reflects expenses of $57.2 million. There were several items in the quarter that drove this expense above our estimated spend. These items included the following: business combination transaction cost of $18 million; foreign currency losses of $13 million, including $7.5 million related to the Nigerian currency devaluation; and $6 million in transition cost related to facility consolidations. 
For the remaining quarters of 2016, we now expect that other revenue and expense will be an expense of approximately $30 million per quarter, which includes approximately $15 million per quarter of transaction and integration-related spending for the merger. The quarterly estimate remains subject to foreign currency fluctuation.
Our tax provision in the quarter of $7.4 million does reflect a lower mix of U.S. income, but also was affected by certain expenses for merger activity that do not receive tax benefit. We continue to anticipate our 2016 tax rate to be between 21% and 23% for the full year given our mix of earnings. The full year estimated result assumes a portion of the expenses for the merger do not receive a tax benefit.
Capital spending this quarter was $32 million, primarily directed towards Subsea Technologies. We now expect capital spending in 2016 to be approximately $130 million, down from our previous guidance of $150 million. At the end of the second quarter, we had net debt of $251 million. It is comprised of $1.1 billion of cash and $1.3 billion of debt. We repurchased 782,000 shares of stock during the quarter at an average cost of $28.45 per share. In accordance with the Business Combination Agreement, we have suspended share repurchase activity until the completion of the merger. We averaged 228 million diluted shares outstanding in the quarter.
Looking forward, as Doug mentioned in his earlier remarks, we now expect full year Subsea Service revenue to approach the low end of our previously guidance range of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion. Full year revenue for Subsea Technologies is expected to be between $3.3 billion to $3.4 billion, which includes the year-to-date impact of $86 million of headwind from the strength of the U.S. dollar. We now expect full year margins in a range of 12% to 13% excluding charges, as we continue to execute well on our backlog and realize further benefits from our restructuring actions. 
Surface Technologies revenue is now likely to be down approximately 30% to 35% versus 2015. North American activity has fallen more than was previously expected, as recount continued to slip beyond April levels. We do not expect much improved revenue activity in the balance of 2016. As we shared last quarter, we have made significant headcount reductions in this segment. However, we continue to balance further actions in response to activity levels in North America with the need to preserve our operational capabilities to respond to market recovery. We are, however, taking further steps in the operational footprint for the North American business. We now expect operating margins in the low single digits for the full year excluding charges. 
Energy Infrastructure guidance is unchanged. We continue to expect revenue to decline 5% to 10% year-over-year with operating margins that should approximate low- to mid-single digits, excluding restructuring charges. 
The second quarter reflects the operational improvements we have made in our Subsea business as well as the challenges our surface business faced adjusting to the rapid pace of activity declines in North America. As we indicated in our guidance, we are accelerating the pace of restructuring in our surface -- excuse me, in our Subsea Technologies segment. These are not only headcount reductions, but also structural changes to the global footprint and management of our subsea operations.
These early actions have benefited the first half results. Additional actions will be required to offset the revenue declines we anticipate in 2017. We now expect to incur additional restructuring and facility rationalization of approximately $20 million to $25 million in the second half of the year. 
So in summary, we remain confident in our ability to deliver low cost solutions across all our businesses. In Subsea Technologies, our execution and cost improvements will position us well for lower activities in 2017. In Surface Technologies, our restructuring and integrated business model should allow us to perform well in the anticipated market recovery. 
I will now turn the call back to John before we open up for your questions."

Then there's a 6-month evaluation process and sanctioning process. So it's anywhere from about 12 to 18 months. So you could therefore conclude that the projects that are most likely to move forward in the near term are some of those early studies that we were engaged in. And so these were really projects that were greenfield opportunities, smaller opportunities, tiebacks to existing host facilities that would be a scope that would be all inclusive of the water column."

And integrated projects are clearly capable of taking costs down a lot. But on the other hand, they're difficult to evaluate for oil companies that are set up along kind of the procurement model. And recently, we met with, actually, Statoil and a guy called Torgim Reitan [ph], who seemed to be now heading up a new division there in charge of how to evaluate integrated projects. So my question is are you seeing -- other oil companies, are you seeing any changes in your customer kind of middle management that makes you more confident that they'll be able to embrace this contracting model?"

The only way for that -- so we can't wait for a recovery to make these projects economic. And therefore, it just demands change. Every conversation that Doug and I have had with senior executives at the E&P companies, they almost always start out with how to change. One of the nice things about the merger and many of the things that we've been investing in, we've got a -- it's a long discussion about the kinds of changes that can take place in the industry that, in many cases, we can deliver. The conversation then, typically, moves to how do we implement this. And we do have conversations about, well, the old procurement contracting models probably don't work. And I've been especially impressed with the operators' willingness and openness to change. I've never seen anything like it. And I think that's when Doug talks about the almost dozens of integrated projects that we're working on. It reflects that willingness to change by the operators. And I think they very clearly understand that some of the sacred cows in their organizations, some of the procurement philosophies that they've used for years are going to have to change. I think they absolutely recognize that. Now the pace at which they're willing to make those changes, we have to see. It'll vary by operator. Some are much more progressive, others are not. But they universally agree with the need to change. And I think they understand that, that means some of their past philosophies are going to have to change as well. Doug, you want to add to that?"

Those 3 elements are really key because that's what's given our customers the confidence that this integrated offering is real. It can deliver the results. And that with the new -- with our announced merger with Technip, we've really removed some of the contracting challenges that existed in some of the early conversations by being able to have a very simple and straightforward contracting methodology as well. You mentioned Statoil. I would agree. I think they've demonstrated a willingness and an openness to look at new and different ideas.

Happy to do that, Ole. So on the Subsea side, you're absolutely right. Given our continued first half of the year solid execution as well as the benefits that we're seeing from product cost reduction as well as all the headcount restructuring, we have reduced the lower end of the range, so taken up the margin performance to a range of 12% to 13%. From a topline perspective, as Doug mentioned, we're seeing a little bit of softness in Subsea Services. So we're likely to be closer to the bottom end of that range at about 1.3, so that softens the top line on Subsea just a bit. In Surface Technologies, we've taken the higher end of the downside off of 2015 by about another 5%. Last quarter, I think what I shared with you was down 25% to 30%. We could be down as much as 35% in Surface margins in that single-digit range, low single-digits versus low to mid, and really no change in Energy Infrastructure. Costs associated with the integration are really where our OID is changing. Otherwise, that's solid and no change in corporate expense."

Our pressure pumping customers are calling and asking about some delivery schedules and things like that. So there are some short green shoots, if you will, in that business. But we have not seen it show up in our inbound numbers yet and we would expect to in the coming quarters. But it will require some stabilization and recovery in the rig count.

So what we're talking about right now is that we are seeing some deferrals of certain activities around production enhancement. So let me explain what that means for our business. So often, there are wellbore subsurface issues that occur in any producing well, onshore or offshore. That goes into a budgetary process. They -- once it receives approval they -- depending on what the activity is -- the required activity is, if it cannot be done by a vessel, if it requires mechanical intervention into the subsurface, then that typically means a rig comes out. When the rig comes out, they remove our tree. When they remove our tree and they go about doing the workover on the rig with a subsurface, that tree is typically returned to us. We then go through a process of inspection, maintenance repair on that tree and then we reinstall that tree. So we're involved in the process of removing the tree, inspecting and repairing the tree and then putting the tree back in place. There is a pretty healthy backlog of that activity, and we have a very long cycle visibility into when that's going to occur. What we saw happen this quarter is there were -- in certain circumstances, there were some situations where that wellbore intervention or that wellbore work -- this is, again, heavy intervention. It may mean sidetracking a well or it may mean removing some damaged equipment that's within the well. That our -- that, that has been postponed. And when that was postponed, that obviously affected our services business for the 3 areas that I described that we're involved in. That is a deferral. That is not a cancellation. That will reoccur. It's just it was being deferred out. And in some cases, we could see that slipping out of the calendar year, which is why we gave the revised guidance. The business is still very robust. It is still very solid. And we continue to grow and expand and bring new offerings into Subsea Services. All that we're saying is we're seeing some of that activity shift out. We're still within the range of our guidance. We were just pinpointing a little bit more within that range where we're likely to end up for the calendar year."

With me today are Maryann Mannen, our Chief Financial Officer; and Doug Pferdehirt, our President and Chief Operating Officer. 
I'll begin my remarks today with highlights from the quarter and then provide comments on the industry and outlook for our markets. I'll also speak to our strategy for dealing with the downturn and how we're better positioned for a market recovery, including comments on our pending merger with Technip. Doug will then speak to the status of the Technip merger, and more importantly, he'll share our customers' reactions to the merger before providing an update on our Subsea business. Maryann will follow with specifics on our financial performance and an update to our financial outlook for 2016, and then we'll open up the call for questions.
Operating results in the quarter reflect both market conditions and our actions to address the cyclical downturn, as the continued weakness experienced in our Surface business was partially offset by another strong quarter in our Subsea business. 
Subsea orders in the quarter were limited to subsea services inbound and small equipment orders, as we continue to see the impact of reduced capital spending. While orders were soft, our Subsea Technologies segment delivered margins of 14.1% when excluding charges. These solid results reflect our continued focus on execution as well as the realization of additional restructuring savings. We've increased confidence in our ability to deliver strong performance for the year. 
Surface Technologies reported a loss in the quarter, as revenue declines continued to offset the savings from our significant restructuring actions. Segment results were most negatively impacted by North America, where sequential decline in the U.S. rig count as well as the seasonal effects of the Canadian breakup posed further challenges in the period. 
Our international service business continues to outpace North America, supported in large part by relative strength in the Middle East. We made further adjustments to our Surface business in the second quarter and will continue to take additional actions. Today, the business is operating on a much lower cost basis, and that will help us navigate through the cycle while maintaining the operational flexibility needed to respond in a market recovery.
Turning to the market outlook. The energy industry has experienced significant change over the last 2 years. The uncertainty around energy demand and supply has remained a constant theme throughout the period. Global events continue to challenge demand while OPEC uncertainty, shale production declines and unexpected supply disruptions cast doubt on the stability of supply. Although timing is always uncertain, we do know that the dramatic pullback in energy investment will impact global production. The implications are evident in the U.S., where crude production has now fallen nearly 8% from its peak. 
Despite this uncertainty, commodity prices have improved over the course of this year. Oil and gas prices are now up more than 70% from the low levels reached in the first quarter. While they remain far below the prior peak, higher prices should improve operator cash flows. Confidence in the sustainability of those cash flows remains a key factor to moving capital spending higher. As confidence improves, we anticipate spending will follow. 
So far, this confidence is yet to materialize, and customer spending in the quarter remained very depressed. Both North America and international rig counts experienced new cyclical lows, and we've seen no pickup in domestic land activity beyond the seasonal effects of Canada. Long cycle businesses have also been impacted. Capital budgets through a reset during recent commodity lows continue to drive near-term spending lower. New order activity is moving at a very slow pace as sanctioning of deepwater projects continues to be delayed. 
But current activity only reflects the view of the current market. Long-term outlook is much different, as the current pace of activity is just simply not sustainable. Even if global demand stays flat, the lack of investment will create a production shortfall that will ultimately reverse the spending cycle. Prices will respond, cash flows will improve and this will boost the operators' confidence. Capital spending will follow. And in that environment, shale will go back to work first. Shale has the advantage of smaller upfront capital commitment and offers a faster payback to the operator. This activity increase will benefit our surface business in North America. 
We're also confident that deepwater investment will soon follow. Deepwater remains a critical component of global production and it's a necessary source of future hydrocarbon supply. Many of our customers have repeatedly confirmed this view. And given the major role that deepwater plays in their reserve base, offshore production will continue to be a critical source of their future oil and gas production.
But for deepwater to remain a viable resource, the industry recognizes that significant and sustainable cost reductions must be achieved. The opportunity for such cost reduction is very real in the offshore market. While the cost of the major deepwater project components have come down, there is significantly more savings that can be achieved. 
Our customers are not only lowering their operating cost, they're also changing their approach to developing deepwater, discovering new ways to lower development cost and to spread out over time the capital required to move these large projects forward. These changes, along with the cost reductions in subsea production systems, SURF components, drilling and completion services and topside facilities, will further improve the economics of deepwater development. 
At FMC Technologies, we remain focused on what we can control. The aggressive actions we've taken to restructure our organization in response to the downturn lower activity levels continue to drive our service and manufacturing costs lower. But these actions go beyond the near-term savings. Importantly, these efforts are intended to further strengthen our company so that in the recovery, we will be in a position to provide alternative approaches that offer improved execution, product standardization, innovative technologies and integrated business models, with integration being the best opportunity to meaningfully impact the cost of development, both on and offshore.
The creation of Forsys Subsea provided tangible evidence of the benefits of integration. Through the joint venture, we can deliver savings that go beyond those that either partner could deliver on their own. In the course of working with Technip, we've also identified new ideas and new technologies that can create additional savings that are even more impactful than we originally imagined. Over time, it became obvious to us that we could do even more working together as one company. 
Let me conclude by saying the current downturn in our industry is one of the most severe we've experienced in decades. We acted quickly and took aggressive actions in response to the challenges of the down cycle. But unlike previous cycles, the industry will emerge from this down cycle changed. This time, things will be different, and companies that survive this cycle will be fundamentally changed as well. 
We are changing. Our actions have gone beyond the typical cycle response. We've significantly lowered our cost. We've embraced standardization. We've developed new technologies. And most importantly, we've created an integrated business model that will be implemented and executed by a single merged company. I'm confident that we will not only survive the downturn, but that we will lead the industry in the changes the future demands. 
I'll now turn it over to Doug and will come back later with some final remarks."

The last few months have certainly been exciting times for FMC Technologies. As John pointed out, we are making big changes, and none will have a greater impact on the future of our company than the proposed merger with Technip. Let me begin with an update on Forsys Subsea, and more specifically, some detail around the FEED activity that is currently underway. I will then talk about the client response to the merger and finally conclude with an update on our subsea outlook. 
Within 7 months of establishing the alliance and joint venture with Technip, we announced that Forsys Subsea had been awarded 3 integrated FEED studies. This was a remarkable achievement given the industry backdrop, and it certainly exceeded our own expectations. These first 3 FEED studies demonstrate that operators are willing to consider a different approach to deepwater development, one that could provide them with savings of up to 30% on the combined SPS and SURF scope. Today, Forsys Subsea is actively working on more than 30 projects. This includes a combination of projects, some of which are integrated and others that are more conventional in nature. Integrated FEED studies now represent over 1/3 of the total, demonstrating increased confidence in an integrated approach. Forsys Subsea is focusing on those opportunities that can provide meaningful savings to the operator and have the best chance of a direct integrated EPCI award. We have increased confidence that an integrated FEED study will result in a direct award later this year. 
Building on the success of Forsys Subsea, we announced our merger with Technip. Upon announcement, customer feedback was very positive, as many customers expressed their full support of the merger. In those conversations, there was a shared view that business as usual is no longer a viable option, and that our business combination has the potential to provide a significant and sustainable improvement to deepwater project economics.
Looking at the merger progress over the first 60 days, we signed the official Business Combination Agreement mid-June, following the conclusion of the works council consultation process in Europe. In addition, we received a successful early conclusion of the U.S. Antitrust Review from regulators. We anticipate that we will close the transaction in early 2017. 
Let me now turn back to our subsea operations and spend a few moments on our recent orders and current outlook. In the second quarter, we reported total subsea orders of $334 million. Much like the prior quarter, orders were driven primarily by subsea services. In the quarter, service orders were softer than anticipated, being impacted by a reduction in drilling-related activities and in certain circumstances, a deferral of production enhancement activities due to budgetary reasons. We now expect subsea service orders to come in towards the lower end of our prior guidance of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion in 2016.
Now looking to Subsea Projects. We continue to see industry potential for nearly 20 large projects to be awarded over the next 24 months. Of these, we continue to track a few that are likely to be awarded over the coming quarters. Small equipment orders were soft in the quarter, but customer conversations are providing improved visibility that should drive smaller orders higher in the second half. These opportunities are typically focused on increasing production through tiebacks to existing host facilities.
In summary, we are tracking a few large projects that are likely to be awarded over the next 12 months. We anticipate an increase in small orders in the second half of the year driven by our alliance partners. And we expect the conversion of an integrated FEED to an integrated EPCI project later this year. 
I will now turn the call over to Maryann."
972117,332083813,1010264,"FMC Technologies, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2016",2016-07-21,"Earnings Calls","FMC Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Doug. Our second quarter diluted earnings per share were $0.22 when excluding certain after-tax charges of $47 million or $0.21 per diluted share. Included in our reported results are restructuring and other severance charges of $25 million, merge",1208,"Thanks, Doug. Our second quarter diluted earnings per share were $0.22 when excluding certain after-tax charges of $47 million or $0.21 per diluted share. Included in our reported results are restructuring and other severance charges of $25 million, merger transaction costs of $18 million, impairment and other charges of $4 million, facility consolidation expenses of $6 million and currency devaluation losses of $13 million. We have provided a schedule in our press release issued last evening to show the quarterly impact to net income of all the costs incurred. 
Last quarter, I shared with you our intention to take further restructuring cost in the balance of 2016. The majority of those restructuring charges anticipated were associated with our Subsea business as activity levels were expected to decline in the coming quarters. In the second quarter, we took a total of $28 million of impairment restructuring and other severance charges or $0.09 per diluted share across all our businesses. 
Our Subsea Technologies segment continues to deliver solid operating results in the quarter. Revenues were $854 million in the period. Quarter-over-quarter revenue comparisons were negatively impacted by lower project activity as well as $29 million of foreign currency translation. Subsea Technologies operating profit was $120 million in the quarter with a margin of 14.1% excluding charges of $23 million. Operating margins declined 120 basis points when excluding charges for both periods, despite revenue being down approximately 31%. Decremental margins were just 18% quarter-over-quarter when excluding charges, as our restructuring initiatives and product cost reductions improve our performance. Segment backlog exiting the quarter was $2.9 billion, which compares to prior year backlog of $4.7 billion.
Moving to our Surface Technologies results. Surface Technologies revenue for the quarter were $219 million, down 40% from the prior year quarter. The revenue decline was driven by the steep contraction in our North American business, somewhat mitigated by more moderate declines in our international business. Geographic mix continues to provide some offset to the weak domestic markets, as rig activity has been more resilient in some of the major international markets. Surface Technologies operating loss for the second quarter was $17 million when excluding charges of $5 million. Segment backlog exiting the quarter stands at $357 million. This is predominantly related to our wellhead business outside of North America, which continues to outperform the domestic market. 
Moving to our Energy Infrastructure results. Revenue for the quarter was $85 million, down 17% from the prior year quarter. Energy Infrastructure operating profit for the quarter was $8 million. The segment continues to be negatively impacted by our measurement solutions business due to the decline in energy-related infrastructure spending in North America.
Let's turn to the corporate items. Corporate expense in the quarter was $13.1 million. We continue to expect spending of approximately $14 million to $15 million per quarter through the remainder of 2016. Other revenue and expense, net, reflects expenses of $57.2 million. There were several items in the quarter that drove this expense above our estimated spend. These items included the following: business combination transaction cost of $18 million; foreign currency losses of $13 million, including $7.5 million related to the Nigerian currency devaluation; and $6 million in transition cost related to facility consolidations. 
For the remaining quarters of 2016, we now expect that other revenue and expense will be an expense of approximately $30 million per quarter, which includes approximately $15 million per quarter of transaction and integration-related spending for the merger. The quarterly estimate remains subject to foreign currency fluctuation.
Our tax provision in the quarter of $7.4 million does reflect a lower mix of U.S. income, but also was affected by certain expenses for merger activity that do not receive tax benefit. We continue to anticipate our 2016 tax rate to be between 21% and 23% for the full year given our mix of earnings. The full year estimated result assumes a portion of the expenses for the merger do not receive a tax benefit.
Capital spending this quarter was $32 million, primarily directed towards Subsea Technologies. We now expect capital spending in 2016 to be approximately $130 million, down from our previous guidance of $150 million. At the end of the second quarter, we had net debt of $251 million. It is comprised of $1.1 billion of cash and $1.3 billion of debt. We repurchased 782,000 shares of stock during the quarter at an average cost of $28.45 per share. In accordance with the Business Combination Agreement, we have suspended share repurchase activity until the completion of the merger. We averaged 228 million diluted shares outstanding in the quarter.
Looking forward, as Doug mentioned in his earlier remarks, we now expect full year Subsea Service revenue to approach the low end of our previously guidance range of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion. Full year revenue for Subsea Technologies is expected to be between $3.3 billion to $3.4 billion, which includes the year-to-date impact of $86 million of headwind from the strength of the U.S. dollar. We now expect full year margins in a range of 12% to 13% excluding charges, as we continue to execute well on our backlog and realize further benefits from our restructuring actions. 
Surface Technologies revenue is now likely to be down approximately 30% to 35% versus 2015. North American activity has fallen more than was previously expected, as recount continued to slip beyond April levels. We do not expect much improved revenue activity in the balance of 2016. As we shared last quarter, we have made significant headcount reductions in this segment. However, we continue to balance further actions in response to activity levels in North America with the need to preserve our operational capabilities to respond to market recovery. We are, however, taking further steps in the operational footprint for the North American business. We now expect operating margins in the low single digits for the full year excluding charges. 
Energy Infrastructure guidance is unchanged. We continue to expect revenue to decline 5% to 10% year-over-year with operating margins that should approximate low- to mid-single digits, excluding restructuring charges. 
The second quarter reflects the operational improvements we have made in our Subsea business as well as the challenges our surface business faced adjusting to the rapid pace of activity declines in North America. As we indicated in our guidance, we are accelerating the pace of restructuring in our surface -- excuse me, in our Subsea Technologies segment. These are not only headcount reductions, but also structural changes to the global footprint and management of our subsea operations.
These early actions have benefited the first half results. Additional actions will be required to offset the revenue declines we anticipate in 2017. We now expect to incur additional restructuring and facility rationalization of approximately $20 million to $25 million in the second half of the year. 
So in summary, we remain confident in our ability to deliver low cost solutions across all our businesses. In Subsea Technologies, our execution and cost improvements will position us well for lower activities in 2017. In Surface Technologies, our restructuring and integrated business model should allow us to perform well in the anticipated market recovery. 
I will now turn the call back to John before we open up for your questions."

In some cases, it also includes some topside engineering, which is also a capability that Technip has within their organization. So they differ in scope. They differ in size. They're really quite diverse in terms of customer type, in terms of geography. Quite a few are greenfield opportunities. There are some brownfield opportunities as well that will include subsea processing. But -- so in general, they're actually quite broad. Now what we're doing at the current time is we're prioritizing the projects that we're pursuing for the exact reason that you ask in your question, which is those that are most likely to convert to an integrated EPCI project.

Then there's a 6-month evaluation process and sanctioning process. So it's anywhere from about 12 to 18 months. So you could therefore conclude that the projects that are most likely to move forward in the near term are some of those early studies that we were engaged in. And so these were really projects that were greenfield opportunities, smaller opportunities, tiebacks to existing host facilities that would be a scope that would be all inclusive of the water column."

But also we're talking about the structural footprint that we will be using on a go-forward basis. You may remember in the last quarter, I talked about really trying to change our operational footprint, so we can have increased capacity on a smaller footprint. So we are getting ourselves prepared for the volumes that we've anticipated for 2017.

There are other examples not in -- related to that particular project. But there are other examples to where after we announced our intention to merge the 2 companies together, that both Thierry Pilenko, John and myself received phone calls from customers that very clearly articulated that where they in the past had struggled with the concept of placing such a large responsibility into a project-specific commercial vehicle, be it in unincorporated JV, an alliance or a consortium, that they now would be willing to move forward because they understood that they would have a much more simplified commercial vehicle in which to contract those projects.

The only way for that -- so we can't wait for a recovery to make these projects economic. And therefore, it just demands change. Every conversation that Doug and I have had with senior executives at the E&P companies, they almost always start out with how to change. One of the nice things about the merger and many of the things that we've been investing in, we've got a -- it's a long discussion about the kinds of changes that can take place in the industry that, in many cases, we can deliver. The conversation then, typically, moves to how do we implement this. And we do have conversations about, well, the old procurement contracting models probably don't work. And I've been especially impressed with the operators' willingness and openness to change. I've never seen anything like it. And I think that's when Doug talks about the almost dozens of integrated projects that we're working on. It reflects that willingness to change by the operators. And I think they very clearly understand that some of the sacred cows in their organizations, some of the procurement philosophies that they've used for years are going to have to change. I think they absolutely recognize that. Now the pace at which they're willing to make those changes, we have to see. It'll vary by operator. Some are much more progressive, others are not. But they universally agree with the need to change. And I think they understand that, that means some of their past philosophies are going to have to change as well. Doug, you want to add to that?"

Those 3 elements are really key because that's what's given our customers the confidence that this integrated offering is real. It can deliver the results.

From a topline perspective, as Doug mentioned, we're seeing a little bit of softness in Subsea Services. So we're likely to be closer to the bottom end of that range at about 1.3, so that softens the top line on Subsea just a bit. In Surface Technologies, we've taken the higher end of the downside off of 2015 by about another 5%. Last quarter, I think what I shared with you was down 25% to 30%. We could be down as much as 35% in Surface margins in that single-digit range, low single-digits versus low to mid, and really no change in Energy Infrastructure.

So we'll continue to maintain that flexibility in our commercial offering. But indeed, where we can engage early, where we can drive towards standardization, where we can introduce new technology and where we can use our integrated model, we have demonstrated and will continue to demonstrate that we can save considerable money for our customers in their project. And it's not only the upfront cost and the risk of the delivery, as you pointed out, but it's also over the life of the field. And it's our focus on serviceability and operability of our assets and our ability to be able to put the right intelligence into the entire subsea production system that will allow us to ensure that our customers have the most optimal uptime. We will work with them and with their reservoir group and with their subsurface provider of choice, if they want to look at further integration, including the subsurface. But we believe and we have demonstrated that the greatest value to our customers, tangible, real, is the integrated offering that we are -- we have put in place through the alliance and joint venture, and we will solidify through the merger between FMC Technologies and Technip."

So what we're talking about right now is that we are seeing some deferrals of certain activities around production enhancement. So let me explain what that means for our business. So often, there are wellbore subsurface issues that occur in any producing well, onshore or offshore. That goes into a budgetary process. They -- once it receives approval they -- depending on what the activity is -- the required activity is, if it cannot be done by a vessel, if it requires mechanical intervention into the subsurface, then that typically means a rig comes out. When the rig comes out, they remove our tree. When they remove our tree and they go about doing the workover on the rig with a subsurface, that tree is typically returned to us. We then go through a process of inspection, maintenance repair on that tree and then we reinstall that tree. So we're involved in the process of removing the tree, inspecting and repairing the tree and then putting the tree back in place. There is a pretty healthy backlog of that activity, and we have a very long cycle visibility into when that's going to occur. What we saw happen this quarter is there were -- in certain circumstances, there were some situations where that wellbore intervention or that wellbore work -- this is, again, heavy intervention. It may mean sidetracking a well or it may mean removing some damaged equipment that's within the well. That our -- that, that has been postponed. And when that was postponed, that obviously affected our services business for the 3 areas that I described that we're involved in. That is a deferral. That is not a cancellation. That will reoccur. It's just it was being deferred out. And in some cases, we could see that slipping out of the calendar year, which is why we gave the revised guidance. The business is still very robust. It is still very solid. And we continue to grow and expand and bring new offerings into Subsea Services. All that we're saying is we're seeing some of that activity shift out. We're still within the range of our guidance. We were just pinpointing a little bit more within that range where we're likely to end up for the calendar year."

Welcome to our third quarter 2016 earnings conference call. With me today is Maryann Mannen, our Chief Financial Officer.
I'll begin my remarks with a review of our operational results for the quarter, then comment on the market outlook and will conclude with the discussion of the company's current areas of focus. Maryann will follow with specifics on our financial performance and updates to our financial outlook for the remainder of 2016. We'll then open the call for questions.
Our operational performance in the quarter gives us confidence that the work we have been doing to reduce both our structural and product costs is paying off. Operating results in the quarter were highlighted by strong operational performance in our Subsea Technologies segment. Our Surface Technologies segment benefited from notable sequential improvement while only partially capturing the benefits of the additional actions we took in the quarter.
Subsea Technologies achieved operating margins of 15.7% when excluding charges. These strong results reflect further progression in the transformation of our operating model, supported by strong execution despite a 27% revenue decline from the prior year quarter. Importantly, these changes will provide sustainable benefit.
2017 will be a more challenging year for our operating results. Revenues will be down for a third consecutive year. Superior execution is a function of both people and process, and we are committed to protecting and maintaining the core competencies that we have developed to deliver these solid results. This will not only benefit our execution through the downturn, but it will ensure that we have the capacity and capabilities needed to respond to the market recovery. This strategic investment will protect our execution capabilities and ensure that we are ready to serve our partners as the market recovers.
Even with lower revenues and the strategic investment, we remain confident in our ability to meet our profitability targets in both 2016 and 2017, given the structural changes and operational momentum we have delivered thus far.
Surface Technologies' operating results were much improved over the second quarter despite only a modest increase in revenues. Although North America's not yet profitable, the previously executed restructuring actions favorably impacted the quarter.
Additionally, we took a series of targeted actions at our North American surface wellhead business to address the profitability of specific product lines in specific basins using the same disciplined approach that led to the sale of our wireline business in the second quarter. These businesses all had similar characteristics. The markets they serve are challenged with excess capacity that will spend little time in balance over the course of a market cycle. And the markets are highly fragmented with limited differentiation and are currently experiencing unsustainable returns.
Given this new market reality, we will no longer invest capital or deploy assets where we cannot earn a reasonable return. Instead, we will redeploy our assets to support clients and basins, which benefit most from our new integrated delivery model. This is how we create differentiation and add value. Our integrated model continues to penetrate the North American market and has been endorsed by leading operators. These actions demonstrate how we intend to manage our global operations. The potential revenue loss that results from these actions is not material to our North American operations. And further, they did not impact our fluid control business.
Turning to orders. Total company inbound orders for the quarter were $692 million, including $401 million in Subsea Technologies. Subsea orders showed improvement over the first half order run rate, driven by an increase in equipment orders, a trend we expect to continue in the fourth quarter.
Third quarter results included the previously announced award of a subsea multiphase boosting pump for ENI's Block 15/06 West Hub Development. This was the second such award over the last 12 months, clearly demonstrating our capabilities in this attractive growth segment.
From our perspective, operators remain focused on several key items. There is a need for greater confidence in commodity price resiliency, strengthening balance sheets and protecting dividends. And they remain focused on maintaining a disciplined approach towards the allocation of capital resources.
In the near term, we have further confidence small equipment orders will improve in the coming quarters. Activity remained centered around 2 key themes, subsea tiebacks and subsea boosting, as enablers to move incremental barrels through existing facilities in a timely and capital-efficient manner.
The slow pace of project sanctioning has put increased operator focus on production levels beyond 2017. Operators can leverage existing infrastructure with short-cycle subsea tiebacks, making smaller investments in fields that do not require an additional host facility. The use of standardized equipment for a fully integrated offering can provide further economic benefit by significantly accelerating time to first oil. Subsea processing offers similar advantages, allowing the operator to gain incremental production from legacy assets with only a modest capital spend.
The fundamental question facing the subsea market remains. What is required to unlock the investment decision for large project awards? Operators are looking for real structural change in project economics, and we are seeing this happen today across many deepwater cost inputs. Our customers are taking aggressive internal actions to lower their own costs, and we continue to improve project economics through standardization, technology innovation and integrated business models. These actions are generating significant, tangible savings that will move some larger projects forward, giving us greater confidence that 2016 will likely mark the trough in orders for the current cycle.
Our company continues to focus on those things we can control by becoming the best cost provider, developing differentiated technologies and delivering value to our customers. These are not just talking points. We are making it real today. It starts by reinventing products where we are looking to significantly reduce product complexity and focus more on product deliverability and installability.
We recently talked about one such case with our subsea manifold. A manifold is a primary component of the subsea development. Its function is simple: It aggregates the flow of multiple wells into a single flow line. But the industry has added significant complexity in both design and build, leading to excessive manufacturing costs, extended lead times and costly installation.
Our approach is different. By addressing complexity with new proprietary technology, we have created a unique product that is much simpler. We've reduced the park count by over 50%, much lighter, more than a 50% reduction in weight and can be installed much quicker, 50% faster than a conventional manifold.
Reinventing products is just the first step. Through our alliance and Forsys Subsea joint venture with Technip, we are integrating proprietary technologies from both companies to enable simplified build [ph] design and installation.
In our alliance, we are thinking about our products and technologies as part of a complete subsea production system, including trees, controls, manifolds and villa folds [ph], risers and flow lines, completely redesigned with less complexity, reduced hardware requirements that results in shorter delivery schedules, faster installation, lower execution risk and savings of 25% to 30% on a combined scope.
Working with Technip, we are creating a sustainable differentiation that will make us uniquely positioned in the marketplace.
Customer interest in the integrated model continues to grow. In early September, we indicated that our Forsys Subsea joint venture had been awarded 16 integrated FEED studies in the 14 months that it passed since the JV was formed, a strong endorsement of the integrated approach. Our proposed business combination with Technip further alleviates the concern of having multiple providers deliver a complex integrated EPCI project. The merged company will address this by providing a single contracting entity fully responsible for executing the integrated EPCI project. We are confident that our first integrated project award is imminent.
Finally, I want to comment on our planned merger with Technip. Integration planning is moving forward at a brisk pace. We have achieved major milestones and continue to be on track with the remaining legal and regulatory approvals, providing greater confidence for a first quarter 2017 close.
As the days go by, we are even more confident in the shared vision, culture and strategic alignment of our 2 companies. We look forward to unlocking the tremendous potential we see of the combined TechnipFMC.
I will now turn the call over to Maryann."

When",1273,"Thanks, Doug. Our third quarter diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.35 when excluding certain pretax charges of $43 million or $0.15 per diluted share.
In the quarter, we also reported an income tax benefit of $9.5 million. When compared to the midpoint of our full year tax rate guidance of 21% to 23% expense, quarterly results were favorably impacted by approximately $18 million or $0.08 per diluted share.
Included in our reported results were the following total pretax charges: restructuring and other severance charges of $28 million, of which $20 million was reported in the segment results; merger transaction and integration costs of $12 million; facility consolidation costs of $4 million; and impairment and other charges of $1 million.
When combined, these pretax charges totaling $43 million. We have provided a schedule in our press release issued last evening to show the quarterly impact of net income on all costs incurred.
Also in the quarter, we recorded a tax expense in discontinued operations of $14 million or $0.06 per diluted share following negotiations pertaining to an outstanding tax dispute in Algeria. This charge relates to a business that was sold in 2006, and we believe that we have fully reserved for any potential tax costs that may arise.
Moving to segment results. Subsea Technologies reported solid operating results in the quarter. Revenues were $798 million in the period. Quarter-over-quarter revenue comparisons were negatively impacted by lower project activity and lower service revenues. Subsea Technologies operating profit was $125 million in the quarter with a margin of 15.7%, excluding charges of $5 million.
Decremental margins were just 21% quarter-over-quarter when excluding charges as our restructuring initiative and product cost reductions substantially mitigated the 27% revenue decline.
Given the progress to date as well as the structural nature of the charges we are making to the business, we remain confident in our ability to meet our margin targets both in 2016 and 2017. For the current year, we now expect margins to exceed 13% when excluding charges.
Segment backlog exiting the quarter was $2.5 billion, which compares to prior year backlog of $4.3 billion.
Moving to our Surface Technologies results. Surface Technologies revenue for the quarter were $280 million, down 40% quarter-over-quarter. Revenues were lower in all major geographies, with North America accounting for a significant component of the decline. The U.S. rig count average fell 45% from the prior year quarter, a steeper decline than the 30% reduction reported for the worldwide rig count over the same period. Surface Technologies operating loss for the quarter was $5 million when excluding charges of $14 million.
We demonstrated good progress in reducing the losses reported in the second quarter. Operating results improved $12 million when excluding charges despite posting flat revenue on a sequential basis. The current quarter benefited from aggressive restructuring undertaken in the period, the strategic decision to reduce or curtail activity in certain unprofitable segments of the North American market as well as the absence of operating losses related to the wireline business sold in the second quarter.
Segment backlog exiting the quarter stands at $379 million. This is predominantly related to our wellhead business outside of North America.
Moving to our Energy Infrastructure results. Revenue for the quarter was $77 million, down 21% from the prior year quarter, primarily due to lower product sales in both our measurement solutions and loading systems businesses. Energy Infrastructure operating profit for the quarter was $4 million when excluding restructuring charges of $1 million.
Let's turn to the corporate items. Corporate expense in the quarter was $14 million, down slightly from the prior year quarter. We expect spending of approximately $14 million to $15 million in the quarter -- fourth quarter of 2016. Other revenue and expense net reflects an expense of $44 million.
Quarterly results were impacted by the following charges: merger transaction and integration of $12 million, restructuring and impairment charges of $8 million and $4 million related to facility consolidation costs.
For the fourth quarter of 2016, we expect that other revenue and expense will be an expense of approximately $30 million, which includes approximately $15 million of transaction and integration costs related to the merger. The quarterly estimate remains subject to foreign currency fluctuations.
We reported a tax benefit in the quarter of $9.5 million. The benefit reflects the quarterly impact from the change in the full year estimated earnings mix.
Our outlook for North America results has been reduced by a combination of lower operating results, restructuring charges and merger-related expenses. We now anticipate our 2016 tax rate to be between 12% and 15% for the full year given that mix of earnings.
Capital spending this quarter was $26 million, primarily directed toward Subsea Technologies. We now expect capital spending in 2016 to be approximately $120 million.
Depreciation and amortization this quarter was $57.3 million, a decrease of $3 million sequentially.
At the end of the third quarter, we had net debt of $190 million. It is comprised of $1.1 billion of cash and $1.3 billion of debt.
In accordance with the Business Combination Agreement related to the proposed merger with Technip, we have suspended share repurchase activity under our share repurchase program until the completion of the proposed merger. Accordingly, the company did not repurchase any stock in the quarter.
We remain at an average of 228 million diluted shares outstanding in the quarter.
Looking forward, full year revenue for Subsea Technologies is expected to approximate $3.3 billion, which includes the year-to-date impact of $73 million in headwind from the strength of the U.S. dollar.
With another quarter of solid execution, we now expect full year Subsea margins to exceed 13%, excluding charges. While we will continue to see further headcount reductions in the fourth quarter, charges related to these actions were reserved for in prior periods. We do not anticipate any material restructuring charges for Subsea in the fourth quarter.
Surface Technologies' year-over-year revenue is forecasted to be down, near the high end of our previously guided range of 30% to 35% versus 2015. We currently expect Surface Technologies to be modestly profitable in the fourth quarter, excluding charges.
In Energy Infrastructure, we now expect revenue in the fourth quarter to look much like Q3. We expect profitability to be down modestly in the quarter.
In closing, we showed good sequential improvements this quarter in both our Subsea and Surface segment. When excluding charges, we reported one of the highest operating margins we have ever reported in Subsea, leaving us well positioned to deliver double-digit margins in a more operationally challenged 2017.
Currently, we are assuming that 2017 inbound orders will exceed 2016. We see several large subsea projects that we believe are ready for award, although they are more likely to come in the latter part of next year. But should we face even greater challenges than anticipated, we have consistently demonstrated that we will take appropriate actions. Look to our surface business as an example, while after taking a series of significant restructuring actions over the past 2 years, we acted again in response to the more aggressive competitive behavior in the North American market.
We remain confident in our integrated surface business model for North America and believe we will be well positioned from both a market standpoint as well as a cost position to excel in the recovery.
These actions, which were taken across all of our business segments, should give you confidence that we remain committed to delivering both lower-cost solutions to our customers and strong financial return to our investors.

First of all, probably 3 key components that we're focused on for Subsea margins: project execution, cost reduction and product cost reduction. So to your first question, Q4, as you know, Q4 for Subsea traditionally is always a softer quarter for us. That really stems from the fact that subsea services is softer, and that's largely North Sea. We wouldn't expect that to look any different. Having said that, our project execution has been very strong. The cost reductions in terms of the headcount, we've been very aggressive, as you have seen throughout the last several quarters. And as I mentioned in my comments, we've got more to go, obviously, in the fourth quarter. And now we're beginning to see the benefit all of our own product cost reductions. So we certainly believe we will exceed 13% in Q4. Your second question was around 2017. We believe, obviously, we will take another step down in Subsea revenues. That's probably somewhere in the neighborhood of 15%. What we will have the benefit of going forward in '17, obviously, is the work that's left to be done on our manufacturing footprint. That is allowing us to lower the cost of the footprint while being able to remain -- to deliver on that throughput. We'll take any necessary actions that we need to in 2017. But as you heard Doug say, and I also, we believe that '16 is the trough. So we're expecting to see order intake in 2017, and we want to be sure that we've got the strategic assets that we need to be able to deliver that -- in that recovery. Having said that, we do remain committed to double-digit margins in 2017."

My view would be, though, [ph] that the book in turn coming from that in 2017 will be relatively low. So you still have a pretty good revenue mix here in terms of backlog -- margin and backlog and then just the service aftermarket revenue component being a much larger percentage of total revenue in '17, even though it's -- in aggregate, you're down subsea, you've got a better mix here. So it just seems like fair amount of margin resiliency still to come. Is that fair?"

Those margins should continue to be resilient. As you think about the turn from backlog, those margins, as you have seen, continue to be very solid margins from which we can execute from. And we would expect to turn a significant portion of that backlog, obviously, that which is not Petrobras.

So we're beyond the '16 now. I mean, it's really become a -- if you will, a way that we're doing business. So we continue to bring in the integrated FEED studies. Regarding the integrated, when do they convert and how quickly can they convert to a project, I think, is the question. So an integrated FEED study, depending upon the scope of the study, will typically run between 9 and 12 months. After that FEED study is completed, then the company goes through an investment decision. And that can typically take 3 to 6 months on average. So if we just take kind of an average between the 12 and the 18 months, that's kind of the range that we're looking at in terms of when we would expect to convert an integrated FEED award to an integrated EPCI execution project. So as I mentioned, we're confident that we will receive our first award very soon, and that would be a reflection of when we really started these integrated projects, which is now around that 18-month mark. So we're starting to see the flow of some of those projects move from the front-end engineering into an actual sanction project, and we expect one to occur very soon. Regarding 2017, we would expect additional projects. That's obviously a function of all the things I said earlier in terms of our customers' areas of focus and strengthening their balance sheets, protecting their dividends, but also looking for projects, real -- projects with real tangible savings that they can move forward.

So using trees as the indicator for the growth and the recovery of the market, given the fact that, as indicated, we believe that the early projects that will be sanctioned will be tieback projects to host facilities. So these are smaller tree count. But can't have a much larger SURF scope, by the way, in terms of umbilical prices and flow lines because there's typically a long-distance from the host facility. So the portion of the revenue that would go to the SURF contractor could be quite significant in those projects. But in terms of for an SPS contractor such as FMC Technologies, it's a smaller scope. When we look forward to the merged company of TechnipFMC, we really see that as an opportunity for us to create a significant a lot of volume by really driving sanitization, shortly times, to help our customers be able to bring those projects on very quickly.
So with that caveat, I think when we look at 2017, we expect the tree count to indeed increase. It could be in the range that you're indicating, and that certainly is in line with some of the other industry benchmarks that are available. I would tend to maybe be on a little bit at the lower end of that range from what we can see right now. But again, that will really be the result of 2 or 3 large major projects moving forward."

Although we have not seen any large capital orders start to flow through this system, although we are receiving tenders and that being asked for pricing and availability of equipment. And I think this is the result of some of our customers contemplating, bringing some of their current fleets back up to a level of readiness that they could be put into service based upon their own metrics for when they would want to bring that additional capacity into the market. So we are having those discussions. And we will be prepared to serve our customers when they're ready to move forward with that investment decision. So what we're seeing now is an increase, just level of total throughput. I think a lot of that is -- a lot of the fleets are going from operating daylight hours to operating 24 hours a day. That obviously will drive more consumable product sales, and we're seeing the benefit of that. But again, no major significant changes in terms of capital orders at this time.

It has resulted in market share increases. What we've realized now, looking back with this new view with the market, is that we want to basically concentrate our assets to where we can generate the highest return through this new integrated model, which is indeed creating value for our customers and for ourselves. But in order to be able to do that, we have to make some difficult decisions in terms of pulling back from certain markets and concentrating resources in other markets. And that's the decision that we made because some of those markets are just not suitable for the integrated approach. And because of that, continuing to offer discrete products into those marketplaces where there's ex-abundance of available assets today, we don't think is a very good or sustainable investment decision for our company.

So there -- we want to be able to make a subcomponent at one place around the world to service the world in a very cost-effective manner that we can get a lot of leverage, both in terms of volume leverage, but also in terms of cost leverage. And when we do that, we'll be able to further reduce our manufacturing footprint, which were up, which is underway today, without eliminating our ability to go back to those demonstrated levels of capacity that we've delivered in the past. And it sounds like a bit of a Herculean feat, but we demonstrated it now. And we've demonstrated it first with 2 of our products. So we went to a single, a single, if you will, a global organization providing those products for the world. And it's been very effective for our organization without reducing our capacity. So the trick here is we got it -- we need to lower our operating costs, but we need to maintain our capacity as we do expect to return to those levels of capacity in the coming years. And that's the activity that we've been going on. That's the retooling. That's the restructuring of our company, which is largely been completed and will be fully completed by the end of 2017."

Welcome to our third quarter 2016 earnings conference call. With me today is Maryann Mannen, our Chief Financial Officer.I'll begin my remarks with a review of our operational results for the quarter, then comment on the market outlook and",1375,"Good morning. Welcome to our third quarter 2016 earnings conference call. With me today is Maryann Mannen, our Chief Financial Officer.
I'll begin my remarks with a review of our operational results for the quarter, then comment on the market outlook and will conclude with the discussion of the company's current areas of focus. Maryann will follow with specifics on our financial performance and updates to our financial outlook for the remainder of 2016. We'll then open the call for questions.
Our operational performance in the quarter gives us confidence that the work we have been doing to reduce both our structural and product costs is paying off. Operating results in the quarter were highlighted by strong operational performance in our Subsea Technologies segment. Our Surface Technologies segment benefited from notable sequential improvement while only partially capturing the benefits of the additional actions we took in the quarter.
Subsea Technologies achieved operating margins of 15.7% when excluding charges. These strong results reflect further progression in the transformation of our operating model, supported by strong execution despite a 27% revenue decline from the prior year quarter. Importantly, these changes will provide sustainable benefit.
2017 will be a more challenging year for our operating results. Revenues will be down for a third consecutive year. Superior execution is a function of both people and process, and we are committed to protecting and maintaining the core competencies that we have developed to deliver these solid results. This will not only benefit our execution through the downturn, but it will ensure that we have the capacity and capabilities needed to respond to the market recovery. This strategic investment will protect our execution capabilities and ensure that we are ready to serve our partners as the market recovers.
Even with lower revenues and the strategic investment, we remain confident in our ability to meet our profitability targets in both 2016 and 2017, given the structural changes and operational momentum we have delivered thus far.
Surface Technologies' operating results were much improved over the second quarter despite only a modest increase in revenues. Although North America's not yet profitable, the previously executed restructuring actions favorably impacted the quarter.
Additionally, we took a series of targeted actions at our North American surface wellhead business to address the profitability of specific product lines in specific basins using the same disciplined approach that led to the sale of our wireline business in the second quarter. These businesses all had similar characteristics. The markets they serve are challenged with excess capacity that will spend little time in balance over the course of a market cycle. And the markets are highly fragmented with limited differentiation and are currently experiencing unsustainable returns.
Given this new market reality, we will no longer invest capital or deploy assets where we cannot earn a reasonable return. Instead, we will redeploy our assets to support clients and basins, which benefit most from our new integrated delivery model. This is how we create differentiation and add value. Our integrated model continues to penetrate the North American market and has been endorsed by leading operators. These actions demonstrate how we intend to manage our global operations. The potential revenue loss that results from these actions is not material to our North American operations. And further, they did not impact our fluid control business.
Turning to orders. Total company inbound orders for the quarter were $692 million, including $401 million in Subsea Technologies. Subsea orders showed improvement over the first half order run rate, driven by an increase in equipment orders, a trend we expect to continue in the fourth quarter.
Third quarter results included the previously announced award of a subsea multiphase boosting pump for ENI's Block 15/06 West Hub Development. This was the second such award over the last 12 months, clearly demonstrating our capabilities in this attractive growth segment.
From our perspective, operators remain focused on several key items. There is a need for greater confidence in commodity price resiliency, strengthening balance sheets and protecting dividends. And they remain focused on maintaining a disciplined approach towards the allocation of capital resources.
In the near term, we have further confidence small equipment orders will improve in the coming quarters. Activity remained centered around 2 key themes, subsea tiebacks and subsea boosting, as enablers to move incremental barrels through existing facilities in a timely and capital-efficient manner.
The slow pace of project sanctioning has put increased operator focus on production levels beyond 2017. Operators can leverage existing infrastructure with short-cycle subsea tiebacks, making smaller investments in fields that do not require an additional host facility. The use of standardized equipment for a fully integrated offering can provide further economic benefit by significantly accelerating time to first oil. Subsea processing offers similar advantages, allowing the operator to gain incremental production from legacy assets with only a modest capital spend.
The fundamental question facing the subsea market remains. What is required to unlock the investment decision for large project awards? Operators are looking for real structural change in project economics, and we are seeing this happen today across many deepwater cost inputs. Our customers are taking aggressive internal actions to lower their own costs, and we continue to improve project economics through standardization, technology innovation and integrated business models. These actions are generating significant, tangible savings that will move some larger projects forward, giving us greater confidence that 2016 will likely mark the trough in orders for the current cycle.
Our company continues to focus on those things we can control by becoming the best cost provider, developing differentiated technologies and delivering value to our customers. These are not just talking points. We are making it real today. It starts by reinventing products where we are looking to significantly reduce product complexity and focus more on product deliverability and installability.
We recently talked about one such case with our subsea manifold. A manifold is a primary component of the subsea development. Its function is simple: It aggregates the flow of multiple wells into a single flow line. But the industry has added significant complexity in both design and build, leading to excessive manufacturing costs, extended lead times and costly installation.
Our approach is different. By addressing complexity with new proprietary technology, we have created a unique product that is much simpler. We've reduced the park count by over 50%, much lighter, more than a 50% reduction in weight and can be installed much quicker, 50% faster than a conventional manifold.
Reinventing products is just the first step. Through our alliance and Forsys Subsea joint venture with Technip, we are integrating proprietary technologies from both companies to enable simplified build design and installation.
In our alliance, we are thinking about our products and technologies as part of a complete subsea production system, including trees, controls, manifolds, umbilicals, risers and flow lines, completely redesigned with less complexity, reduced hardware requirements that results in shorter delivery schedules, faster installation, lower execution risk and savings of 25% to 30% on a combined scope.
Working with Technip, we are creating a sustainable differentiation that will make us uniquely positioned in the marketplace.
Customer interest in the integrated model continues to grow. In early September, we indicated that our Forsys Subsea joint venture had been awarded 16 integrated FEED studies in the 14 months that it passed since the JV was formed, a strong endorsement of the integrated approach. Our proposed business combination with Technip further alleviates the concern of having multiple providers deliver a complex integrated EPCI project. The merged company will address this by providing a single contracting entity fully responsible for executing the integrated EPCI project. We are confident that our first integrated project award is imminent.
Finally, I want to comment on our planned merger with Technip. Integration planning is moving forward at a brisk pace. We have achieved major milestones and continue to be on track with the remaining legal and regulatory approvals, providing greater confidence for a first quarter 2017 close.
As the days go by, we are even more confident in the shared vision, culture and strategic alignment of our 2 companies. We look forward to unlocking the tremendous potential we see of the combined TechnipFMC.
I will now turn the call over to Maryann."

When",1273,"Thanks, Doug. Our third quarter diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.35 when excluding certain pretax charges of $43 million or $0.15 per diluted share.
In the quarter, we also reported an income tax benefit of $9.5 million. When compared to the midpoint of our full year tax rate guidance of 21% to 23% expense, quarterly results were favorably impacted by approximately $18 million or $0.08 per diluted share.
Included in our reported results were the following total pretax charges: restructuring and other severance charges of $28 million, of which $20 million was reported in the segment results; merger transaction and integration costs of $12 million; facility consolidation costs of $4 million; and impairment and other charges of $1 million.
When combined, these pretax charges totaling $43 million. We have provided a schedule in our press release issued last evening to show the quarterly impact of net income on all costs incurred.
Also in the quarter, we recorded a tax expense in discontinued operations of $14 million or $0.06 per diluted share following negotiations pertaining to an outstanding tax dispute in Algeria. This charge relates to a business that was sold in 2006, and we believe that we have fully reserved for any potential tax costs that may arise.
Moving to segment results. Subsea Technologies reported solid operating results in the quarter. Revenues were $798 million in the period. Quarter-over-quarter revenue comparisons were negatively impacted by lower project activity and lower service revenues. Subsea Technologies operating profit was $125 million in the quarter with a margin of 15.7%, excluding charges of $5 million.
Decremental margins were just 21% quarter-over-quarter when excluding charges as our restructuring initiative and product cost reductions substantially mitigated the 27% revenue decline.
Given the progress to date as well as the structural nature of the charges we are making to the business, we remain confident in our ability to meet our margin targets both in 2016 and 2017. For the current year, we now expect margins to exceed 13% when excluding charges.
Segment backlog exiting the quarter was $2.5 billion, which compares to prior year backlog of $4.3 billion.
Moving to our Surface Technologies results. Surface Technologies revenue for the quarter were $280 million, down 40% quarter-over-quarter. Revenues were lower in all major geographies, with North America accounting for a significant component of the decline. The U.S. rig count average fell 45% from the prior year quarter, a steeper decline than the 30% reduction reported for the worldwide rig count over the same period. Surface Technologies operating loss for the quarter was $5 million when excluding charges of $14 million.
We demonstrated good progress in reducing the losses reported in the second quarter. Operating results improved $12 million when excluding charges despite posting flat revenue on a sequential basis. The current quarter benefited from aggressive restructuring undertaken in the period, the strategic decision to reduce or curtail activity in certain unprofitable segments of the North American market as well as the absence of operating losses related to the wireline business sold in the second quarter.
Segment backlog exiting the quarter stands at $379 million. This is predominantly related to our wellhead business outside of North America.
Moving to our Energy Infrastructure results. Revenue for the quarter was $77 million, down 21% from the prior year quarter, primarily due to lower product sales in both our measurement solutions and loading systems businesses. Energy Infrastructure operating profit for the quarter was $4 million when excluding restructuring charges of $1 million.
Let's turn to the corporate items. Corporate expense in the quarter was $14 million, down slightly from the prior year quarter. We expect spending of approximately $14 million to $15 million in the quarter -- fourth quarter of 2016. Other revenue and expense net reflects an expense of $44 million.
Quarterly results were impacted by the following charges: merger transaction and integration of $12 million, restructuring and impairment charges of $8 million and $4 million related to facility consolidation costs.
For the fourth quarter of 2016, we expect that other revenue and expense will be an expense of approximately $30 million, which includes approximately $15 million of transaction and integration costs related to the merger. The quarterly estimate remains subject to foreign currency fluctuations.
We reported a tax benefit in the quarter of $9.5 million. The benefit reflects the quarterly impact from the change in the full year estimated earnings mix.
Our outlook for North America results has been reduced by a combination of lower operating results, restructuring charges and merger-related expenses. We now anticipate our 2016 tax rate to be between 12% and 15% for the full year given that mix of earnings.
Capital spending this quarter was $26 million, primarily directed toward Subsea Technologies. We now expect capital spending in 2016 to be approximately $120 million.
Depreciation and amortization this quarter was $57.3 million, a decrease of $3 million sequentially.
At the end of the third quarter, we had net debt of $190 million. It is comprised of $1.1 billion of cash and $1.3 billion of debt.
In accordance with the Business Combination Agreement related to the proposed merger with Technip, we have suspended share repurchase activity under our share repurchase program until the completion of the proposed merger. Accordingly, the company did not repurchase any stock in the quarter.
We remain at an average of 228 million diluted shares outstanding in the quarter.
Looking forward, full year revenue for Subsea Technologies is expected to approximate $3.3 billion, which includes the year-to-date impact of $73 million in headwind from the strength of the U.S. dollar.
With another quarter of solid execution, we now expect full year Subsea margins to exceed 13%, excluding charges. While we will continue to see further headcount reductions in the fourth quarter, charges related to these actions were reserved for in prior periods. We do not anticipate any material restructuring charges for Subsea in the fourth quarter.
Surface Technologies' year-over-year revenue is forecasted to be down, near the high end of our previously guided range of 30% to 35% versus 2015. We currently expect Surface Technologies to be modestly profitable in the fourth quarter, excluding charges.
In Energy Infrastructure, we now expect revenue in the fourth quarter to look much like Q3. We expect profitability to be down modestly in the quarter.
In closing, we showed good sequential improvements this quarter in both our Subsea and Surface segment. When excluding charges, we reported one of the highest operating margins we have ever reported in Subsea, leaving us well positioned to deliver double-digit margins in a more operationally challenged 2017.
Currently, we are assuming that 2017 inbound orders will exceed 2016. We see several large subsea projects that we believe are ready for award, although they are more likely to come in the latter part of next year. But should we face even greater challenges than anticipated, we have consistently demonstrated that we will take appropriate actions. Look to our surface business as an example, while after taking a series of significant restructuring actions over the past 2 years, we acted again in response to the more aggressive competitive behavior in the North American market.
We remain confident in our integrated surface business model for North America and believe we will be well positioned from both a market standpoint as well as a cost position to excel in the recovery.
These actions, which were taken across all of our business segments, should give you confidence that we remain committed to delivering both lower-cost solutions to our customers and strong financial return to our investors.

First of all, probably 3 key components that we're focused on for Subsea margins: project execution, cost reduction and product cost reduction. So to your first question, Q4, as you know, Q4 for Subsea traditionally is always a softer quarter for us. That really stems from the fact that subsea services is softer, and that's largely North Sea. We wouldn't expect that to look any different. Having said that, our project execution has been very strong. The cost reductions in terms of the headcount, we've been very aggressive, as you have seen throughout the last several quarters. And as I mentioned in my comments, we've got more to go, obviously, in the fourth quarter. And now we're beginning to see the benefit all of our own product cost reductions. So we certainly believe we will exceed 13% in Q4. Your second question was around 2017. We believe, obviously, we will take another step down in Subsea revenues. That's probably somewhere in the neighborhood of 15%. What we will have the benefit of going forward in '17, obviously, is the work that's left to be done on our manufacturing footprint. That is allowing us to lower the cost of the footprint while being able to remain -- to deliver on that throughput. We'll take any necessary actions that we need to in 2017. But as you heard Doug say, and I also, we believe that '16 is the trough. So we're expecting to see order intake in 2017, and we want to be sure that we've got the strategic assets that we need to be able to deliver that -- in that recovery.

So even -- and I agree with the comment on the orders better in Subsea '17 versus '16. And let's just say that's led by bigger projects here that arguably, given the competitive nature of that work perhaps, is at lower margin than what's currently embedded in backlog. My view would be, though, that the book in turn coming from that in 2017 will be relatively low. So you still have a pretty good revenue mix here in terms of backlog -- margin and backlog and then just the service aftermarket revenue component being a much larger percentage of total revenue in '17, even though it's -- in aggregate, you're down Subsea, you've got a better mix here. So it just seems like fair amount of margin resiliency still to come. Is that fair?"

So as we think about subsea service in 2017, our objective is to hold Subsea revenue levels in and about the same. So as a percent of the total, we would expect subsea services revenues to grow. Those margins should continue to be resilient. As you think about the turn from backlog, those margins, as you have seen, continue to be very solid margins from which we can execute from. And we would expect to turn a significant portion of that backlog, obviously, that which is not Petrobras. So yes, I think you make some very valid points in terms of the resiliency of Subsea margins going into 2017."

So we're beyond the '16 now. I mean, it's really become a -- if you will, a way that we're doing business. So we continue to bring in the integrated FEED studies. Regarding the integrated, when do they convert and how quickly can they convert to a project, I think, is the question. So an integrated FEED study, depending upon the scope of the study, will typically run between 9 and 12 months. After that FEED study is completed, then the company goes through an investment decision. And that can typically take 3 to 6 months on average. So if we just take kind of an average between the 12 and the 18 months, that's kind of the range that we're looking at in terms of when we would expect to convert an integrated FEED award to an integrated EPCI execution project. So as I mentioned, we're confident that we will receive our first award very soon, and that would be a reflection of when we really started these integrated projects, which is now around that 18-month mark. So we're starting to see the flow of some of those projects move from the front-end engineering into an actual sanction project, and we expect one to occur very soon. Regarding 2017, we would expect additional projects. That's obviously a function of all the things I said earlier in terms of our customers' areas of focus and strengthening their balance sheets, protecting their dividends, but also looking for projects, real -- projects with real tangible savings that they can move forward. So we would expect some additional projects to convert in 2017 as well."

So using trees as the indicator for the growth and the recovery of the market, given the fact that, as indicated, we believe that the early projects that will be sanctioned will be tieback projects to host facilities, so these are smaller tree count, but can't have a much larger SURF scope, by the way, in terms of umbilical risers and flow lines because there's typically a long distance from the host facility, so the portion of the revenue that would go to the SURF contractor could be quite significant in those projects. But in terms of -- for an SPS contractor such as FMC Technologies, it's a smaller scope. When we look forward to the merged company of TechnipFMC, we really see that as an opportunity for us to create a significant amount of value by really driving standardization, short lead times, to help our customers be able to bring those projects on very quickly. So with that caveat, I think when we look at 2017, we expect the tree count to indeed increase. It could be in the range that you're indicating, and that certainly is in line with some of the other industry benchmarks that are available. I would tend to maybe be on a little bit of the lower end of that range from what we can see right now, but again, that will really be the result of 2 or 3 large major projects moving forward."

But in order to be able to do that, we had to make some difficult decisions in terms of pulling back from certain markets and concentrating resources in other markets. And that's the decision that we made because some of those markets are just not suitable for the integrated approach. And because of that, continuing to offer discrete products into those marketplaces where there's an x abundance of available assets today, we don't think is a very good or sustainable investment decision for our company.

What we'll -- we've done by coming together is -- our intention to come together as a single entity is just remove some of the barriers that they have indicated to us over the course of having these discussions, one of which was, okay, we'll do an integrated FEED study through the joint venture, but we're not comfortable putting a large integrated EPCI project through a loosely-- a group of loosely affiliated companies, be it some sort of a project-specific commercial vehicle. We want to know that we're working with a single contracting entity and that we have confidence that, that company or that entity will be able to deliver such a project. So as a result of the announcement of our intent to merge back on the 19th of May, we've received significant positive feedback from our customers in terms of the fact that this further reduces any concern that they had about moving forward with this type of an integrated model.

It's something that's basically assembled. You have to do it at a large fabrication yard. It involves thousands and thousands of resources and is mostly subcontracted activity.

The challenges that we'll have coming forward there is just what is the pricing in that inbound. But all of the work that we are doing, you mentioned, and Doug was walking through kind of the manufacturing benefit, none of that really came through, so to speak, in our last couple of quarters. This is largely, as Doug said, solid execution. As we complete the manufacturing footprint and we get the product costs that we've been working on flowing through those projects, there's been a tremendous amount of product cost work, we would hope very much so that, that could be offsetting to '18.

And that was the key move from moving from a regional focus to moving to a global focus. We've gone one step further than that, which we're implementing now, which is even at the subcomponent level, not at the finished assembly level. So there -- we want to be able to make a subcomponent at one place around the world to service the world in a very cost-effective manner that we can get a lot of leverage, both in terms of volume leverage but also in terms of cost leverage. And when we do that, we'll be able to further reduce our manufacturing footprint, which were -- which is underway today, without eliminating our ability to go back to those demonstrated levels of capacity that we've delivered in the past. And it sounds like a bit of a Herculean feat, but we demonstrated it now. And we've demonstrated it first with 2 of our products. So we went to a single, single, if you will, a global organization providing those products for the world. And it's been very effective for our organization without reducing our capacity. So the trick here is we got it -- we need to lower our operating costs, but we need to maintain our capacity as we do expect to return to those levels of capacity in the coming years.

Welcome to our third quarter 2016 earnings conference call. With me today is Maryann Mannen, our Chief Financial Officer.I'll begin my remarks with a review of our operational results for the quarter, then comment on the market outlook and",1376,"Good morning. Welcome to our third quarter 2016 earnings conference call. With me today is Maryann Mannen, our Chief Financial Officer.
I'll begin my remarks with a review of our operational results for the quarter, then comment on the market outlook and will conclude with a discussion of the company's current areas of focus. Maryann will follow with specifics on our financial performance and updates to our financial outlook for the remainder of 2016. We'll then open the call for questions.
Our operational performance in the quarter gives us confidence that the work we have been doing to reduce both our structural and product costs is paying off. Operating results in the quarter were highlighted by strong operational performance in our Subsea Technologies segment. Our Surface Technologies segment benefited from notable sequential improvement while only partially capturing the benefits of the additional actions we took in the quarter.
Subsea Technologies achieved operating margins of 15.7% when excluding charges. These strong results reflect further progression in the transformation of our operating model, supported by strong execution despite a 27% revenue decline from the prior year quarter. Importantly, these changes will provide sustainable benefit.
2017 will be a more challenging year for our operating results. Revenues will be down for a third consecutive year. Superior execution is a function of both people and process, and we are committed to protecting and maintaining the core competencies that we have developed to deliver these solid results. This will not only benefit our execution through the downturn, but it will ensure that we have the capacity and capabilities needed to respond to the market recovery. This strategic investment will protect our execution capabilities and ensure that we are ready to serve our partners as the market recovers.
Even with lower revenues and this strategic investment, we remain confident in our ability to meet our profitability targets in both 2016 and 2017, given the structural changes and operational momentum we have delivered thus far.
Surface Technologies' operating results were much improved over the second quarter despite only a modest increase in revenues. Although North America is not yet profitable, the previously executed restructuring actions favorably impacted the quarter.
Additionally, we took a series of targeted actions in our North American surface wellhead business to address the profitability of specific product lines in specific basins using the same disciplined approach that led to the sale of our wireline business in the second quarter. These businesses all had similar characteristics. The markets they serve are challenged with excess capacity that will spend little time in balance over the course of a market cycle. And the markets are highly fragmented with limited differentiation and are currently experiencing unsustainable returns.
Given this new market reality, we will no longer invest capital or deploy assets where we cannot earn a reasonable return. Instead, we will redeploy our assets to support clients and basins, which benefit most from our new integrated delivery model. This is how we create differentiation and add value. Our integrated model continues to penetrate the North American market and has been endorsed by leading operators. These actions demonstrate how we intend to manage our global operations. The potential revenue loss that results from these actions is not material to our North American operations. And further, they did not impact our fluid control business.
Turning to orders. Total company inbound orders for the quarter were $692 million, including $401 million in Subsea Technologies. Subsea orders showed improvement over the first half order run rate, driven by an increase in equipment orders, a trend we expect to continue in the fourth quarter.
Third quarter results included the previously announced award of a subsea multiphase boosting pump for ENI's Block 15/06 West Hub Development. This was the second such award over the last 12 months, clearly demonstrating our capabilities in this attractive growth segment.
From our perspective, operators remain focused on several key items. There is a need for greater confidence in commodity price resiliency, strengthening balance sheets and protecting dividends. And they remain focused on maintaining a disciplined approach towards the allocation of capital resources.
In the nearer term, we have further confidence small equipment orders will improve in the coming quarters. Activity remained centered around 2 key themes, subsea tiebacks and subsea boosting, as enablers to move incremental barrels through existing facilities in a timely and capital-efficient manner.
The slow pace of project sanctioning has put increased operator focus on production levels beyond 2017. Operators can leverage existing infrastructure with short-cycle subsea tiebacks, making smaller investments in fields that do not require an additional host facility. The use of standardized equipment for a fully integrated offering can provide further economic benefit by significantly accelerating time to first oil. Subsea processing offers similar advantages, allowing the operator to gain incremental production from legacy assets with only a modest capital spend.
The fundamental question facing the subsea market remains. What is required to unlock the investment decision for large project awards? Operators are looking for real structural change in project economics, and we are seeing this happen today across many deepwater cost inputs. Our customers are taking aggressive internal actions to lower their own costs, and we continue to improve project economics through standardization, technology innovation and integrated business models. These actions are generating significant, tangible savings that will move some larger projects forward, giving us greater confidence that 2016 will likely mark the trough in orders for the current cycle.
Our company continues to focus on those things we can control by becoming the best cost provider, developing differentiated technologies and delivering value to our customers. These are not just talking points. We are making it real today. It starts by reinventing products where we are looking to significantly reduce product complexity and focus more on product deliverability and installability.
We recently talked about one such case with our subsea manifold. A manifold is a primary component of a subsea development. Its function is simple: It aggregates the flow of multiple wells into a single flow line. But the industry has added significant complexity in both design and build, leading to excessive manufacturing costs, extended lead times and costly installation.
Our approach is different. By addressing complexity with new proprietary technology, we have created a unique product that is much simpler. We've reduced the part count by over 50%, much lighter, more than a 50% reduction in weight and can be installed much quicker, 50% faster than a conventional manifold.
Reinventing products is just the first step. Through our alliance in Forsys Subsea joint venture with Technip, we are integrating proprietary technologies from both companies to enable simplified field design and installation.
In our alliance, we are thinking about our products and technologies as part of a complete subsea production system, including trees, controls, manifolds, umbilicals, risers and flow lines, completely redesigned with less complexity, reduced hardware requirements that results in shorter delivery schedules, faster installation, lower execution risk and savings of 25% to 30% on a combined scope.
Working with Technip, we are creating a sustainable differentiation that will make us uniquely positioned in the marketplace.
Customer interest in the integrated model continues to grow. In early September, we indicated that our Forsys Subsea joint venture had been awarded 16 integrated FEED studies in the 14 months that had passed since the JV was formed, a strong endorsement of the integrated approach. Our proposed business combination with Technip further alleviates the concern of having multiple providers deliver a complex integrated EPCI project. The merged company will address this by providing a single contracting entity fully responsible for executing the integrated EPCI project. We are confident that our first integrated project award is imminent.
Finally, I want to comment on our planned merger with Technip. Integration planning is moving forward at a brisk pace. We have achieved major milestones and continue to be on track with the remaining legal and regulatory approvals, providing greater confidence for a first quarter 2017 close.
As the days go by, we are even more confident in the shared vision, culture and strategic alignment of our 2 companies. We look forward to unlocking the tremendous potential we see of the combined TechnipFMC.
I will now turn the call over to Maryann."
972117,376794552,1057902,"FMC Technologies, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2016",2016-10-20,"Earnings Calls","FMC Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Doug. Our third quarter diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.35 when excluding certain pretax charges of $43 million or $0.15 per diluted share.In the quarter, we also reported an income tax benefit of $9.5 million. When",1273,"Thanks, Doug. Our third quarter diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.35 when excluding certain pretax charges of $43 million or $0.15 per diluted share.
In the quarter, we also reported an income tax benefit of $9.5 million. When compared to the midpoint of our full year tax rate guidance of 21% to 23% expense, quarterly results were favorably impacted by approximately $18 million or $0.08 per diluted share.
Included in our reported results were the following total pretax charges: restructuring and other severance charges of $28 million, of which $20 million was reported in the segment results; merger, transaction and integration cost of $12 million; facility consolidation cost of $4 million; and impairment and other charges of $1 million.
When combined, these pretax charges totaling $43 million. We have provided a schedule in our press release issued last evening to show the quarterly impact of net income on all cost incurred.
Also in the quarter, we recorded a tax expense in discontinued operations of $14 million or $0.06 per diluted share following negotiations pertaining to an outstanding tax dispute in Algeria. This charge relates to a business that was sold in 2006, and we believe that we have fully reserved for any potential tax costs that may arise.
Moving to segment results. Subsea Technologies reported solid operating results in the quarter. Revenues were $798 million in the period. Quarter-over-quarter revenue comparisons were negatively impacted by lower project activity and lower service revenues. Subsea Technologies operating profit was $125 million in the quarter with a margin of 15.7%, excluding charges of $5 million.
Decremental margins were just 21% quarter-over-quarter when excluding charges, as our restructuring initiative and product cost reductions substantially mitigated the 27% revenue decline.
Given the progress to date as well as the structural nature of the charges we are making to the business, we remain confident in our ability to meet our margin targets both in 2016 and 2017. For the current year, we now expect margins to exceed 13% when excluding charges.
Segment backlog exiting the quarter was $2.5 billion, which compares to prior year backlog of $4.3 billion.
Moving to our Surface Technologies results. Surface Technologies revenue for the quarter were $218 million, down 40% quarter-over-quarter. Revenues were lower in all major geographies, with North America accounting for a significant component of the decline. The U.S. rig count average fell 45% from the prior year quarter, a steeper decline than the 30% reduction reported for the worldwide rig counts over the same period. Surface Technologies operating loss for the quarter was $5 million when excluding charges of $14 million.
We demonstrated good progress in reducing the losses reported in the second quarter. Operating results improved $12 million when excluding charges despite posting flat revenue on a sequential basis. The current quarter benefited from aggressive restructuring undertaken in the period, the strategic decision to reduce or curtail activity in certain unprofitable segments of the North American market, as well as the absence of operating losses related to the wireline business sold in the second quarter.
Segment backlog exiting the quarter stands at $379 million. This is predominantly related to our wellhead business outside of North America.
Moving to our Energy Infrastructure results. Revenue for the quarter was $77 million, down 21% from the prior year quarter, primarily due to lower product sales in both our measurement solutions and loading systems businesses. Energy Infrastructure operating profit for the quarter was $4 million when excluding restructuring charges of $1 million.
Let's turn to the corporate items. Corporate expense in the quarter was $14 million, down slightly from the prior year quarter. We expect spending of approximately $14 million to $15 million in the quarter -- fourth quarter of 2016. Other revenue and expense net reflects an expense of $44 million.
Quarterly results were impacted by the following charges: merger, transaction and integration of $12 million, restructuring and impairment charges of $8 million and $4 million related to facility consolidation cost.
For the fourth quarter of 2016, we expect that other revenue and expense will be an expense of approximately $30 million, which includes approximately $15 million of transaction and integration costs related to the merger. The quarterly estimate remains subject to foreign currency fluctuations.
We reported a tax benefit in the quarter of $9.5 million. The benefit reflects the quarterly impact from the change in the full year estimated earnings mix.
Our outlook for North America results has been reduced by a combination of lower operating results, restructuring charges and merger-related expenses. We now anticipate our 2016 tax rate to be between 12% and 15% for the full year given that mix of earnings.
Capital spending this quarter was $26 million, primarily directed toward Subsea Technologies. We now expect capital spending in 2016 to be approximately $120 million.
Depreciation and amortization this quarter was $57.3 million, a decrease of $3 million sequentially.
At the end of the third quarter, we had net debt of $190 million. It is comprised of $1.1 billion of cash and $1.3 billion of debt.
In accordance with the Business Combination Agreement related to the proposed merger with Technip, we have suspended share repurchase activity under our share repurchase program until the completion of the proposed merger. Accordingly, the company did not repurchase any stock in the quarter.
We remain at an average of 228 million diluted shares outstanding in the quarter.
Looking forward, full year revenue for Subsea Technologies is expected to approximate $3.3 billion, which includes the year-to-date impact of $73 million in headwind from the strength of the U.S. dollar.
With another quarter of solid execution, we now expect full year Subsea margins to exceed 13%, excluding charges. While we will continue to see further headcount reductions in the fourth quarter, charges related to these actions were reserved for in prior periods. We do not anticipate any material restructuring charges for Subsea in the fourth quarter.
Surface Technologies' year-over-year revenue is forecasted to be down near the high end of our previously guided range of 30% to 35% versus 2015. We currently expect Surface Technologies to be modestly profitable in the fourth quarter, excluding charges.
In Energy Infrastructure, we now expect revenue in the fourth quarter to look much like Q3. We expect profitability to be down modestly in the quarter.
In closing, we showed good sequential improvements this quarter in both our Subsea and Surface segments. When excluding charges, we reported one of the highest operating margins we have ever recorded in Subsea, leaving us well positioned to deliver double-digit margins in a more operationally challenged 2017.
Currently, we are assuming that 2017 inbound orders will exceed 2016. We see several large subsea projects that we believe are ready for award, although they are more likely to come in the latter part of next year. But should we face even greater challenges than anticipated, we have consistently demonstrated that we will take appropriate actions. Look to our surface business as an example, where after taking a series of significant restructuring actions over the past 2 years, we acted again in response to the more aggressive competitive behavior in the North American market.
We remain confident in our integrated surface business model for North America and believe we will be well positioned from both a market standpoint as well as a cost position to excel in the recovery.
These actions, which were taken across all of our business segments, should give you confidence that we remain committed to delivering both lower-cost solutions to our customers and strong financial return to our investors.

First of all, probably 3 key components that we're focused on for Subsea margins: project execution, cost reduction and product cost reduction. So to your first question, Q4, as you know, Q4 for Subsea traditionally is always a softer quarter for us. That really stems from the fact that subsea services is softer, and that's largely North Sea. We wouldn't expect that to look any different. Having said that, our project execution has been very strong. The cost reductions in terms of the headcount, we've been very aggressive, as you have seen throughout the last several quarters. And as I mentioned in my comments, we've got more to go, obviously, in the fourth quarter. And now we're beginning to see the benefit all [ph] of our own product cost reductions. So we certainly believe we will exceed 13% in Q4. Your second question was around 2017. We believe, obviously, we will take another step down in Subsea revenues. That's probably somewhere in the neighborhood of 15%. What we will have the benefit of going forward in '17, obviously, is the work that's left to be done on our manufacturing footprint. That is allowing us to lower the cost of the footprint while being able to remain -- to deliver on that throughput. We'll take any necessary actions that we need to in 2017. But as you heard Doug say, and I also, we believe that '16 is the trough. So we're expecting to see order intake in 2017, and we want to be sure that we've got the strategic assets that we need to be able to deliver that -- in that recovery. Having said that, we do remain committed to double-digit margins in 2017."

My view would be, though, is that the book in turn coming from that in 2017 would be relatively low. So you still have a pretty good revenue mix here in terms of backlog -- margin and backlog and then just the service aftermarket revenue component being a much larger percentage of total revenue in '17, even though it's -- in aggregate, you're down Subsea, you've got a better mix here. So it just seems like fair amount of margin resiliency still to come. Is that fair?"

Those margins should continue to be resilient. As you think about the turn from backlog, those margins, as you have seen, continue to be very solid margins from which we can execute from. And we would expect to turn a significant portion of that backlog, obviously, that which is not Petrobras.

So we're beyond the '16 now. I mean, it's really become a -- if you will, a way that we're doing business. So we continue to bring in the integrated FEED studies. Regarding the integrated, when do they convert and how quickly can they convert to a project, I think, is the question. So an integrated FEED study, depending upon the scope of the study, will typically run between 9 and 12 months. After that FEED study is completed, then the company goes through an investment decision. And that can typically take 3 to 6 months on average. So if we just take kind of an average between the 12 and the 18 months, that's kind of the range that we're looking at in terms of when we would expect to convert an integrated FEED award to an integrated EPCI execution project. So as I mentioned, we're confident that we will receive our first award very soon, and that would be a reflection of when we really started these integrated projects, which is now around that 18-month mark. So we're starting to see the flow of some of those projects move from the front-end engineering into an actual sanctioned project, and we expect one to occur very soon. Regarding 2017, we would expect additional projects. That's obviously a function of all the things I said earlier in terms of our customers' areas of focus and strengthening their balance sheets, protecting their dividends, but also looking for projects, real -- projects with real tangible savings that they can move forward.

So using trees as the indicator for the growth and the recovery of the market, given the fact that, as indicated, we believe that the early projects that will be sanctioned will be tieback projects to host facilities, so these are smaller tree count, but can have a much larger SURF scope, by the way, in terms of umbilical risers and flow lines because they're typically a long distance from the host facility, so the portion of the revenue that would go to the SURF contractor could be quite significant in those projects. But in terms of -- for an SPS contractor such as FMC Technologies, it's a smaller scope. When we look forward to the merged company of TechnipFMC, we really see that as an opportunity for us to create a significant amount of value by really driving standardization, short lead times, to help our customers be able to bring those projects on very quickly. So with that caveat, I think when we look at 2017, we expect the tree count to indeed increase. It could be in the range that you're indicating, and that certainly is in line with some of the other industry benchmarks that are available.

And as we track some of the larger projects from the list of projects that we provide to the market, if I look at that list of projects, there are 8 of those projects that are currently in active stage of negotiation that would result in a tree count of over 100 trees, if indeed they were awarded. That being said, I'm not indicating that all 8 of those are going to be sanctioned in 2017, but they are being actively tendered, reviewed and evaluated at this time. If we'd look back just 12 months ago, there were 0 projects. So there's definitely been an uptick in the level of activity under active review and evaluation at this point in time."

And as indicated, our fluid control business, we sell the consumables to the pressure pumpers to ensure that they can operate in a safe and efficient manner with their services. We have seen an increase in activity in that business, but it's been relatively modest at this time, although we have not seen any large capital orders start to flow through the system, although we are receiving tenders and being asked for pricing and availability of equipment. And I think this is the result of some of our customers contemplating bringing some of their current fleets back up to a level of readiness that they could be put into service, based upon their own metrics for when they would want to bring that additional capacity into the market. So we are having those discussions. And we will be prepared to serve our customers when they're ready to move forward with that investment decision. So what we're seeing now is an increased just level of total throughput. I think a lot of that is -- a lot of the fleets are going from operating daylight hours to operating 24 hours a day. That obviously can -- will drive more consumable product sales, and we're seeing the benefit of that. But again, no major significant changes in terms of capital orders at this time. We anticipate those, but we don't anticipate those until 2017. In regards to subsea, I think the -- I think we're largely in agreement with the consensus view of activity.

But that then would have to go through the process of basically introducing this new commercial model. We've completed that. The market acceptance has been quite robust. It has resulted in market share increases. What we've realized now looking back with this new view of the market is that we want to basically concentrate our assets to where we can generate the highest return through this new integrated model, which is, indeed, creating value for our customers and for ourselves. But in order to be able to do that, we had to make some difficult decisions in terms of pulling back from certain markets and concentrating resources in other markets. And that's the decision that we made because some of those markets are just not suitable for the integrated approach. And because of that, continuing to offer discrete products into those marketplaces where there's an x [ph] abundance of available assets today, we don't think is a very good or sustainable investment decision for our company. So we've gone -- we're going through the process now of basically the redistribution, reallocation, which will help us to even drive our integrated offering to the next level by being able to ensure that we have the right resources in the right areas. Then over time, as a larger portion of the market begins to show the optionality to be able to move into and provide integrated offerings into other parts of the market, we'll do that as well.

Welcome to our third quarter 2016 earnings conference call. With me today is Maryann Mannen, our Chief Financial Officer.I'll begin my remarks with a review of our operational results for the quarter, then comment on the market outlook and",1376,"Good morning. Welcome to our third quarter 2016 earnings conference call. With me today is Maryann Mannen, our Chief Financial Officer.
I'll begin my remarks with a review of our operational results for the quarter, then comment on the market outlook and will conclude with a discussion of the company's current areas of focus. Maryann will follow with specifics on our financial performance and updates to our financial outlook for the remainder of 2016. We'll then open the call for questions.
Our operational performance in the quarter gives us confidence that the work we have been doing to reduce both our structural and product costs is paying off. Operating results in the quarter were highlighted by strong operational performance in our Subsea Technologies segment. Our Surface Technologies segment benefited from notable sequential improvement while only partially capturing the benefits of the additional actions we took in the quarter.
Subsea Technologies achieved operating margins of 15.7% when excluding charges. These strong results reflect further progression in the transformation of our operating model, supported by strong execution despite a 27% revenue decline from the prior year quarter. Importantly, these changes will provide sustainable benefit.
2017 will be a more challenging year for our operating results. Revenues will be down for a third consecutive year. Superior execution is a function of both people and process, and we are committed to protecting and maintaining the core competencies that we have developed to deliver these solid results. This will not only benefit our execution through the downturn, but it will ensure that we have the capacity and capabilities needed to respond to the market recovery. This strategic investment will protect our execution capabilities and ensure that we are ready to serve our partners as the market recovers.
Even with lower revenues and this strategic investment, we remain confident in our ability to meet our profitability targets in both 2016 and 2017, given the structural changes and operational momentum we have delivered thus far.
Surface Technologies' operating results were much improved over the second quarter despite only a modest increase in revenues. Although North America is not yet profitable, the previously executed restructuring actions favorably impacted the quarter.
Additionally, we took a series of targeted actions in our North American surface wellhead business to address the profitability of specific product lines in specific basins using the same disciplined approach that led to the sale of our wireline business in the second quarter. These businesses all had similar characteristics. The markets they serve are challenged with excess capacity that will spend little time in balance over the course of a market cycle. And the markets are highly fragmented with limited differentiation and are currently experiencing unsustainable returns.
Given this new market reality, we will no longer invest capital or deploy assets where we cannot earn a reasonable return. Instead, we will redeploy our assets to support clients and basins, which benefit most from our new integrated delivery model. This is how we create differentiation and add value. Our integrated model continues to penetrate the North American market and has been endorsed by leading operators. These actions demonstrate how we intend to manage our global operations. The potential revenue loss that results from these actions is not material to our North American operations. And further, they did not impact our fluid control business.
Turning to orders. Total company inbound orders for the quarter were $692 million, including $401 million in Subsea Technologies. Subsea orders showed improvement over the first half order run rate, driven by an increase in equipment orders, a trend we expect to continue in the fourth quarter.
Third quarter results included the previously announced award of a subsea multiphase boosting pump for ENI's Block 15/06 West Hub Development. This was the second such award over the last 12 months, clearly demonstrating our capabilities in this attractive growth segment.
From our perspective, operators remain focused on several key items. There is a need for greater confidence in commodity price resiliency, strengthening balance sheets and protecting dividends. And they remain focused on maintaining a disciplined approach towards the allocation of capital resources.
In the nearer term, we have further confidence small equipment orders will improve in the coming quarters. Activity remained centered around 2 key themes, subsea tiebacks and subsea boosting, as enablers to move incremental barrels through existing facilities in a timely and capital-efficient manner.
The slow pace of project sanctioning has put increased operator focus on production levels beyond 2017. Operators can leverage existing infrastructure with short-cycle subsea tiebacks, making smaller investments in fields that do not require an additional host facility. The use of standardized equipment for a fully integrated offering can provide further economic benefit by significantly accelerating time to first oil. Subsea processing offers similar advantages, allowing the operator to gain incremental production from legacy assets with only a modest capital spend.
The fundamental question facing the subsea market remains. What is required to unlock the investment decision for large project awards? Operators are looking for real structural change in project economics, and we are seeing this happen today across many deepwater cost inputs. Our customers are taking aggressive internal actions to lower their own costs, and we continue to improve project economics through standardization, technology innovation and integrated business models. These actions are generating significant, tangible savings that will move some larger projects forward, giving us greater confidence that 2016 will likely mark the trough in orders for the current cycle.
Our company continues to focus on those things we can control by becoming the best cost provider, developing differentiated technologies and delivering value to our customers. These are not just talking points. We are making it real today. It starts by reinventing products where we are looking to significantly reduce product complexity and focus more on product deliverability and installability.
We recently talked about one such case with our subsea manifold. A manifold is a primary component of a subsea development. Its function is simple: It aggregates the flow of multiple wells into a single flow line. But the industry has added significant complexity in both design and build, leading to excessive manufacturing costs, extended lead times and costly installation.
Our approach is different. By addressing complexity with new proprietary technology, we have created a unique product that is much simpler. We've reduced the part count by over 50%, much lighter, more than a 50% reduction in weight and can be installed much quicker, 50% faster than a conventional manifold.
Reinventing products is just the first step. Through our alliance in Forsys Subsea joint venture with Technip, we are integrating proprietary technologies from both companies to enable simplified field design and installation.
In our alliance, we are thinking about our products and technologies as part of a complete subsea production system, including trees, controls, manifolds, umbilicals, risers and flow lines, completely redesigned with less complexity, reduced hardware requirements that results in shorter delivery schedules, faster installation, lower execution risk and savings of 25% to 30% on a combined scope.
Working with Technip, we are creating a sustainable differentiation that will make us uniquely positioned in the marketplace.
Customer interest in the integrated model continues to grow. In early September, we indicated that our Forsys Subsea joint venture had been awarded 16 integrated FEED studies in the 14 months that had passed since the JV was formed, a strong endorsement of the integrated approach. Our proposed business combination with Technip further alleviates the concern of having multiple providers deliver a complex integrated EPCI project. The merged company will address this by providing a single contracting entity fully responsible for executing the integrated EPCI project. We are confident that our first integrated project award is imminent.
Finally, I want to comment on our planned merger with Technip. Integration planning is moving forward at a brisk pace. We have achieved major milestones and continue to be on track with the remaining legal and regulatory approvals, providing greater confidence for a first quarter 2017 close.
As the days go by, we are even more confident in the shared vision, culture and strategic alignment of our 2 companies. We look forward to unlocking the tremendous potential we see of the combined TechnipFMC.
I will now turn the call over to Maryann."

When",1273,"Thanks, Doug. Our third quarter diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.35 when excluding certain pretax charges of $43 million or $0.15 per diluted share.
In the quarter, we also reported an income tax benefit of $9.5 million. When compared to the midpoint of our full year tax rate guidance of 21% to 23% expense, quarterly results were favorably impacted by approximately $18 million or $0.08 per diluted share.
Included in our reported results were the following total pretax charges: restructuring and other severance charges of $28 million, of which $20 million was reported in the segment results; merger, transaction and integration cost of $12 million; facility consolidation cost of $4 million; and impairment and other charges of $1 million.
When combined, these pretax charges totaling $43 million. We have provided a schedule in our press release issued last evening to show the quarterly impact of net income on all cost incurred.
Also in the quarter, we recorded a tax expense in discontinued operations of $14 million or $0.06 per diluted share following negotiations pertaining to an outstanding tax dispute in Algeria. This charge relates to a business that was sold in 2006, and we believe that we have fully reserved for any potential tax costs that may arise.
Moving to segment results. Subsea Technologies reported solid operating results in the quarter. Revenues were $798 million in the period. Quarter-over-quarter revenue comparisons were negatively impacted by lower project activity and lower service revenues. Subsea Technologies operating profit was $125 million in the quarter with a margin of 15.7%, excluding charges of $5 million.
Decremental margins were just 21% quarter-over-quarter when excluding charges, as our restructuring initiative and product cost reductions substantially mitigated the 27% revenue decline.
Given the progress to date as well as the structural nature of the charges we are making to the business, we remain confident in our ability to meet our margin targets both in 2016 and 2017. For the current year, we now expect margins to exceed 13% when excluding charges.
Segment backlog exiting the quarter was $2.5 billion, which compares to prior year backlog of $4.3 billion.
Moving to our Surface Technologies results. Surface Technologies revenue for the quarter were $218 million, down 40% quarter-over-quarter. Revenues were lower in all major geographies, with North America accounting for a significant component of the decline. The U.S. rig count average fell 45% from the prior year quarter, a steeper decline than the 30% reduction reported for the worldwide rig counts over the same period. Surface Technologies operating loss for the quarter was $5 million when excluding charges of $14 million.
We demonstrated good progress in reducing the losses reported in the second quarter. Operating results improved $12 million when excluding charges despite posting flat revenue on a sequential basis. The current quarter benefited from aggressive restructuring undertaken in the period, the strategic decision to reduce or curtail activity in certain unprofitable segments of the North American market, as well as the absence of operating losses related to the wireline business sold in the second quarter.
Segment backlog exiting the quarter stands at $379 million. This is predominantly related to our wellhead business outside of North America.
Moving to our Energy Infrastructure results. Revenue for the quarter was $77 million, down 21% from the prior year quarter, primarily due to lower product sales in both our measurement solutions and loading systems businesses. Energy Infrastructure operating profit for the quarter was $4 million when excluding restructuring charges of $1 million.
Let's turn to the corporate items. Corporate expense in the quarter was $14 million, down slightly from the prior year quarter. We expect spending of approximately $14 million to $15 million in the quarter -- fourth quarter of 2016. Other revenue and expense net reflects an expense of $44 million.
Quarterly results were impacted by the following charges: merger, transaction and integration of $12 million, restructuring and impairment charges of $8 million and $4 million related to facility consolidation cost.
For the fourth quarter of 2016, we expect that other revenue and expense will be an expense of approximately $30 million, which includes approximately $15 million of transaction and integration costs related to the merger. The quarterly estimate remains subject to foreign currency fluctuations.
We reported a tax benefit in the quarter of $9.5 million. The benefit reflects the quarterly impact from the change in the full year estimated earnings mix.
Our outlook for North America results has been reduced by a combination of lower operating results, restructuring charges and merger-related expenses. We now anticipate our 2016 tax rate to be between 12% and 15% for the full year given that mix of earnings.
Capital spending this quarter was $26 million, primarily directed toward Subsea Technologies. We now expect capital spending in 2016 to be approximately $120 million.
Depreciation and amortization this quarter was $57.3 million, a decrease of $3 million sequentially.
At the end of the third quarter, we had net debt of $190 million. It is comprised of $1.1 billion of cash and $1.3 billion of debt.
In accordance with the Business Combination Agreement related to the proposed merger with Technip, we have suspended share repurchase activity under our share repurchase program until the completion of the proposed merger. Accordingly, the company did not repurchase any stock in the quarter.
We remain at an average of 228 million diluted shares outstanding in the quarter.
Looking forward, full year revenue for Subsea Technologies is expected to approximate $3.3 billion, which includes the year-to-date impact of $73 million in headwind from the strength of the U.S. dollar.
With another quarter of solid execution, we now expect full year Subsea margins to exceed 13%, excluding charges. While we will continue to see further headcount reductions in the fourth quarter, charges related to these actions were reserved for in prior periods. We do not anticipate any material restructuring charges for Subsea in the fourth quarter.
Surface Technologies' year-over-year revenue is forecasted to be down near the high end of our previously guided range of 30% to 35% versus 2015. We currently expect Surface Technologies to be modestly profitable in the fourth quarter, excluding charges.
In Energy Infrastructure, we now expect revenue in the fourth quarter to look much like Q3. We expect profitability to be down modestly in the quarter.
In closing, we showed good sequential improvements this quarter in both our Subsea and Surface segments. When excluding charges, we reported one of the highest operating margins we have ever recorded in Subsea, leaving us well positioned to deliver double-digit margins in a more operationally challenged 2017.
Currently, we are assuming that 2017 inbound orders will exceed 2016. We see several large subsea projects that we believe are ready for award, although they are more likely to come in the latter part of next year. But should we face even greater challenges than anticipated, we have consistently demonstrated that we will take appropriate actions. Look to our surface business as an example, where after taking a series of significant restructuring actions over the past 2 years, we acted again in response to the more aggressive competitive behavior in the North American market.
We remain confident in our integrated surface business model for North America and believe we will be well positioned from both a market standpoint as well as a cost position to excel in the recovery.
These actions, which were taken across all of our business segments, should give you confidence that we remain committed to delivering both lower-cost solutions to our customers and strong financial return to our investors.

First of all, probably 3 key components that we're focused on for Subsea margins: project execution, cost reduction and product cost reduction. So to your first question, Q4, as you know, Q4 for Subsea traditionally is always a softer quarter for us. That really stems from the fact that subsea services is softer, and that's largely North Sea. We wouldn't expect that to look any different. Having said that, our project execution has been very strong. The cost reductions in terms of the headcount, we've been very aggressive, as you have seen throughout the last several quarters. And as I mentioned in my comments, we've got more to go, obviously, in the fourth quarter. And now we're beginning to see the benefit all [ph] of our own product cost reductions. So we certainly believe we will exceed 13% in Q4. Your second question was around 2017. We believe, obviously, we will take another step down in Subsea revenues. That's probably somewhere in the neighborhood of 15%. What we will have the benefit of going forward in '17, obviously, is the work that's left to be done on our manufacturing footprint. That is allowing us to lower the cost of the footprint while being able to remain -- to deliver on that throughput. We'll take any necessary actions that we need to in 2017. But as you heard Doug say, and I also, we believe that '16 is the trough. So we're expecting to see order intake in 2017, and we want to be sure that we've got the strategic assets that we need to be able to deliver that -- in that recovery. Having said that, we do remain committed to double-digit margins in 2017."

My view would be, though, is that the book in turn coming from that in 2017 would be relatively low. So you still have a pretty good revenue mix here in terms of backlog -- margin and backlog and then just the service aftermarket revenue component being a much larger percentage of total revenue in '17, even though it's -- in aggregate, you're down Subsea, you've got a better mix here. So it just seems like fair amount of margin resiliency still to come. Is that fair?"

So as we think about subsea service in 2017, our objective is to hold Subsea revenue levels in and about the same. So as a percent of the total, we would expect subsea services revenues to grow. Those margins should continue to be resilient. As you think about the turn from backlog, those margins, as you have seen, continue to be very solid margins from which we can execute from.

So we're beyond the '16 now. I mean, it's really become a -- if you will, a way that we're doing business. So we continue to bring in the integrated FEED studies. Regarding the integrated, when do they convert and how quickly can they convert to a project, I think, is the question. So an integrated FEED study, depending upon the scope of the study, will typically run between 9 and 12 months. After that FEED study is completed, then the company goes through an investment decision. And that can typically take 3 to 6 months on average. So if we just take kind of an average between the 12 and the 18 months, that's kind of the range that we're looking at in terms of when we would expect to convert an integrated FEED award to an integrated EPCI execution project. So as I mentioned, we're confident that we will receive our first award very soon, and that would be a reflection of when we really started these integrated projects, which is now around that 18-month mark. So we're starting to see the flow of some of those projects move from the front-end engineering into an actual sanctioned project, and we expect one to occur very soon. Regarding 2017, we would expect additional projects. That's obviously a function of all the things I said earlier in terms of our customers' areas of focus and strengthening their balance sheets, protecting their dividends, but also looking for projects, real -- projects with real tangible savings that they can move forward. So we would expect some additional projects to convert in 2017 as well."

So using trees as the indicator for the growth and the recovery of the market, given the fact that, as indicated, we believe that the early projects that will be sanctioned will be tieback projects to host facilities, so these are smaller tree count, but can have a much larger SURF scope, by the way, in terms of umbilical risers and flow lines because they're typically a long distance from the host facility, so the portion of the revenue that would go to the SURF contractor could be quite significant in those projects. But in terms of -- for an SPS contractor such as FMC Technologies, it's a smaller scope. When we look forward to the merged company of TechnipFMC, we really see that as an opportunity for us to create a significant amount of value by really driving standardization, short lead times, to help our customers be able to bring those projects on very quickly. So with that caveat, I think when we look at 2017, we expect the tree count to indeed increase. It could be in the range that you're indicating, and that certainly is in line with some of the other industry benchmarks that are available. I would tend to maybe be on the little bit of the lower end of that range from what we can see right now, but again, that will really be the result of 2 or 3 large major projects moving forward."

So we are having those discussions. And we will be prepared to serve our customers when they're ready to move forward with that investment decision.

What we've realized now looking back with this new view of the market is that we want to basically concentrate our assets to where we can generate the highest return through this new integrated model, which is, indeed, creating value for our customers and for ourselves. But in order to be able to do that, we had to make some difficult decisions in terms of pulling back from certain markets and concentrating resources in other markets. And that's the decision that we made because some of those markets are just not suitable for the integrated approach. And because of that, continuing to offer discrete products into those marketplaces where there's an x [ph] abundance of available assets today, we don't think is a very good or sustainable investment decision for our company.

So because of that, indeed, we have been talking to our customers. And that's what's given us great confidence in their understanding and the way that they're embracing and accepting this new way of doing business. What we'll -- what we've done by coming together is -- our intention to come together as a single entity is just remove some of the barriers that they have indicated to us over the course of having these discussions, one of which was, okay, we'll do an integrated FEED study through the joint venture, but we're not comfortable putting a large integrated EPCI project through a loosely-- a group of loosely affiliated companies, be it some sort of a project-specific commercial vehicle. We want to know that we're working with a single contracting entity and that we have confidence that, that company or that entity will be able to deliver such a project. So as a result of the announcement of our intent to merge back on the 19th of May, we've received significant positive feedback from our customers in terms of the fact that this further reduces any concern that they had about moving forward with this type of an integrated model. And we believe it will help us accelerate some of these projects into the execution phase."

So Jim, as you know, we're more than a manufacturing company, and we're a manufacturing services company and we provide a great amount of support for our customers, both in the front-end engineering all the way through the life of field. What's really making a difference for us, Jim, is as we -- it all starts at the engineering phase. You have to go back and you have to look at the product, then you have to ask the simple question is, can I remove complexity without affecting functionality? And if I can remove complexity without affecting functionality, then that's something that's going to have a sustainable cost advantage for our company going forward and create leverage for our company. And that's really what we're talking about doing is we've gone all the way back to the engineering of each and every one of our products and talked about what we could do, how we could do it differently. I gave the example of the subsea manifold. If you want to now take the subsea manifold and think of it in terms of a manufacturing company, the conventional manifold is not something that is manufactured, it's something that's basically assembled. You have to do it at a large fabrication yard. It involves thousands and thousands of resources and is mostly subcontracted activity. If we can take something like that and move it to being more of a standard product that we can put through, in your words, our highly efficient manufacturing structure, then that significantly, significantly increases our..."

So to the extent, as Doug mentioned, the trough, we're fairly confident that we're going to see a really solid handful -- from a market standpoint, a really solid handful of projects. Doug talked about 8 projects that are really ready for award. There are somewhere in excess of 100 trees. If we can get that volume in, in 2017 early enough and begin to see the change in the curve with respect to margins, then we have a good shot at '18 at least being stable to '17. The challenge that we'll have coming forward there is just what is the pricing in that inbound. But all of the work that we are doing, you mentioned, and Doug was walking through kind of the manufacturing benefit, none of that really came through, so to speak, in our last couple of quarters. This is largely, as Doug said, solid execution. As we complete the manufacturing footprint and we get the product costs that we've been working on flowing through those projects, there's been a tremendous amount of product cost work, we would hope very much so that, that could be offsetting to '18. It really does depend, as you well know, Jim, at the strength of 2017. And again, we're pretty optimistic about inbound in '17."

But if I look at what your historic inbound has been for the last several years, going back to 2004 with the exception of the great financial recession years, you were garnering anywhere from 125 to, like, 225 trees per annum. And obviously, we're in a different environment now that you did 50 in '15, you'll do a lot less than that in '16. So I'm just curious, while there is considerably increased breadth to your business, thinking about it from a tree standpoint, for what level of inbound and activity is your subsea business presently sized? And what I'm getting at is what kind of contraction have we seen in your manufacturing footprint? And are you done with that? Or are you continuing to rightsize, notwithstanding the fact that we expect a revival in orders next year from the depths of the lows that we've seen this year?"

And that was the key move from moving from a regional focus to moving to a global focus. We've gone one step further than that, which we're implementing now, which is even at the subcomponent level, not at the finished assembly level. So there -- we want to be able to make a subcomponent at one place around the world to service the world in a very cost-effective manner that we can get a lot of leverage, both in terms of volume leverage but also in terms of cost leverage. And when we do that, we'll be able to further reduce our manufacturing footprint, which we're -- which is underway today, without eliminating our ability to go back to those demonstrated levels of capacity that we've delivered in the past. And it sounds like a bit of a Herculean feat, but we've demonstrated it now. And we've demonstrated it first with 2 of our products to where we went to a single, if you will, a global organization providing those products for the world. And it's been very effective for our organization without reducing our capacity. So the trick here is we got it -- we need to lower our operating costs, but we need to maintain our capacity as we do expect to return to those levels of capacity in the coming years. And that's the activity that we've been going on. That's the retooling. That's the restructuring of our company, which has largely been completed and will be fully completed by the end of 2017."
