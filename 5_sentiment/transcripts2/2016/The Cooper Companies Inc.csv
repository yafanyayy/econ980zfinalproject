First, I'm pleased t",1648,"Thank you, Kim, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2016 conference call. We're off to a good start this year and I'm optimistic about our performance as we move forward. Let me start by touching on 3 key items. First, I'm pleased to report our fiscal first quarter financial results were strong. On a consolidated basis, we reported $450 million in revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.83. We are raising our fiscal 2016 revenue and earnings guidance to reflect this outperformance and to incorporate updated currency rates. Second, CooperVision posted 4% constant currency revenue growth, which met expectations. As such, we are maintaining our 5% to 7% constant currency revenue guidance at CooperVision for the fiscal year. Third, CooperSurgical had a strong quarter posting revenue growth of 12% or 6% pro forma. This was especially impressive given non-GAAP operating margins expanded 400 basis points over Q1 of last year. As a result of this outperformance, we are raising CooperSurgical's full-year revenue guidance to 15% to 18% or 5% to 8% pro forma. I'll expand on these items as I walk-through this quarter's performance but suffice it to say I'm proud of where we stand and excited about the future. 
CooperVision reported Q1 revenues of $364 million, down 1% year-over-year but up 4% in constant currency. The Americas were down 3% in constant currency due to the tough comp and aggressive promotional activity by Johnson & Johnson associated with their New Delhi Pocahontas shell product, which we discussed last quarter. Going forward, we expect the Americas to return to more normal growth starting in the second quarter. Regarding EMEA, sales grew 8% in constant currency. This was despite the soft on integration disruption we discussed on our last earnings call. These disruptions ended in Q1 that resulted in certain customer concessions that reduced results. EMEA growth was driven by a pro forma of silicone hydrogel products of Affinity, clariti, MyDay and Avaira. We also had a strong quarter in Asia Pacific, growing 12% in constant currency and this growth was also driven by our family silicone hydrogel products. We expect both these regions to continue performing well going forward. 
Within our specialty business, overall sales were up 4% year-over-year and multifocal were flat both within constant currency. This was softer than in the prior quarters due to the Americas where -- which is the largest region with these types of lenses. We remain a global leader in specialty lenses and expect sales to bounce back in Q2 as the Americas return to growth. Looking at silicone hydrogel lenses. This family of products delivered a strong growth of 13% in constant currency. Our Affinity and Avaira combined to grow 7% in constant currency with the only weakness being seen in the Americas. And again, we expect the Americas to rebound in Q2. We remain under index in the two-week and monthly silicon hydrogel space with the market being roughly 77% silicone hydrogel and us at 72% as we anticipate posting nice growth for many years to come. Regarding 1 Day silicone hydrogel lenses, clariti and MyDay, we were solid 50% of constant currency. We remain very optimistic about these products and are committed to our growth strategy which include a two-tiered approach with clariti positioned as the mass market offering and MyDay as the premium offering. Remember, the contact lens market is being driven by 1 Day growth and we strongly believe we have the best product offering in the space as the only company with premium and mass market lenses including the full portfolio of 1 Day, seer, and multifocal lenses. Regarding production on these products, MyDay is ramping up nicely and we are selling everything we can make. Production is also extremely well going extremely well for clariti, we continue to expect clariti post margins to be accretive worldwide gross margins as we exit fiscal year. 
Regarding Proclear, sales of this hydrogel product line were down 4% in constant currency, driven by our continuing shift to silicone. Before moving in the market data, let me finish with a comment on CooperVision's non-GAAP adjustment. As expected, we had around $23 million in charges this quarter but roughly 60%, 40% between manufacturing and operating expenses. With the majority of this soft line integration be how behind us, we expect this number to decline to under $10 million in Q2 with most of the charges in cost of goods associated with accelerated depreciation which relates to decisions we made last year. 
Now let me comment on CooperVision's performance and overall the contact lens market and remember, this information is on the last page of our earnings release. Counted for Q4, we continue taking market share growing 6% with the market up 4%. Regarding the market, the underlying story is changing due to a new product launch and easy comps, while our comp business was soft against difficult comps. Regionally Recently, CVI grew 9% in the EMEA with the market up 5%. In Asia PAC, CooperVision grew 12% with the market up 5% and in the Americas, CooperVision grew 1% with the market up 4%. If we look at the market on a modality basis, assuming each market continue thriving growth with CVI up 14% and the market up 12%. For non-silicon use lenses, CVI grew 2% while the market declined 1% and as you can see, our growth remains diverse and strong. For the full year -- calendar year 2016, CooperVision grew 7% in the market, grew 4%. Going forward, I expect the market to continue growing 4% to 6% over the next 5 years and most likely closer to 6%. The drivers will continue to be the shift to daily geographic expansion and expansion of the where base. We expect to continue to taking market share, led by the strong silicone hydrogel portfolio. 
Moving to CooperSurgical. We reported Q1 revenue of $85 million, up 12% year-on-year or 6% pro forma. We made solid progress in our office and surgical business, growing 7% and in our fertility business growing 6%, both pro forma. These results are much stronger than our initial guidance and there are a number of ongoing opportunities which are driving this. First, we significantly increased our focus on sales during the fiscal fourth quarter of last year. This included existing products, new product launches and acquired products. This new emphasis was seen in our Q1 results and we believe it will continue through the year. Second, we are combining our office and surgical and fertility businesses including transforming to a geographic sales focus. This is enabling us to cross some more effectively, which is especially beneficial with products such as our newly launched disposable scope, which sells to OB/GYN offices but also to fertility centers. This change will also allow us to better manage our infrastructure going forward and we'll reinvest those savings in sales and marketing to continue driving revenue growth. Third, as we continue to progress through the year, we'll be adding more sales personnel in under-penetrated areas and increasing our focus on high-growth areas such as generic testing. We anticipate doing this while leveraging revenue growth to improve operating margins as we did in Q1. All in, CooperSurgical is clearly moving to a more aggressive and efficient business model with a life sciences look and feel. 
With respect to CooperSurgical's products, the office and surgical business, comprised of a diverse portfolio of roughly 600 products sold primarily to obstetricians and gynecologists. As I stated earlier, this product portfolio grew 7% with strength in several key products. Within fertility, we grew 6% pro forma. Sales growth is still being negatively impacted by our strategic decision to exit low margin, non-CSI manufactured capital equipment. This will continue through Q2 but then, become largely immaterial in Q3. Also within fertility, our genetic testing business is performing extremely well. We entered these lab services space with the acquisition of 3 Point Genetics last August and it's proving a every nice strategic sale. Lastly, we're in complimentary, we added complimentary IVF products in mid-December with the acquisition of Research Instruments and we also acquired a small fertility microneedle company at the beginning of February, which we expect to have roughly $1 million of revenue per quarter going forward. These deals are also incorporated in our updated guidance. So overall, I'm very bullish on CooperSurgical. The passion drive of our surgical team is extremely high and I'm really proud of their efforts and excited about our future. 
Now let me touch a little more on guidance. Our fiscal 2016 revenue guidance for CooperVision remains unchanged at 5% to 7% constant currency growth. We are raising our CooperSurgical revenue guidance to 5% to 8% pro forma growth or 15% to 18% on an as-reported basis. We're also raising our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance to $8 to $8.30, up 13% to 17% pro forma. For cash flow, we continue to expect around $300 million of adjusted free cash flow for fiscal 2016. 
In conclusion, we're continuing our successful strategy which we frequently articulated in the past. This includes investing to take market share by expanding geographically, aggressively rolling out new products and investing in emerging markets. We do this while remaining focused on growing earnings per share and cash flow to deliver strong shareholder value. I'm pleased with the results and happy the issues we encountered in the fourth quarter, such as the European Sauflon integration activity are behind us and we remain very optimistic about the underlying fundamentals of our businesses and I believe we are well-positioned to deliver strong results for fiscal 2016 and beyond. With that, let me express my appreciation to our employees, our #1 asset. Their hard work and dedication to creating value is the backbone of our success. And now, I'll turn it over to Greg to cover our financial results."

Bob provided an overall summary of our performance including a review of the market and our revenue picture. I will focus on primarily are not GAAP results for the quarter. For the reconciliation to GAAP numbers,",1353,"Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Bob provided an overall summary of our performance including a review of the market and our revenue picture. I will focus on primarily are not GAAP results for the quarter. For the reconciliation to GAAP numbers, please refer to our earnings release. Looking at growth margins. In Q1, the non-GAAP gross margin was 61.4% compared with 64.2% in the prior year. Factors which impacted our non-GAAP gross margins were a net unfavorable FX impact with the favorable U.K.-based cost of goods sold impact more than offset by the unfavorable revenue impact. In addition, product mix was a negative as the sales weakness Bob mentioned in the Americas hurt our margins as this region has the greatest amount of torque and multifocal lenses, along with being a strong Biofinity franchise. We expect gross margins to rebound in Q2. CooperVision on a non-GAAP basis reported gross margin of 60.9% versus 64.2% in Q1 of last year. The factors which impacted our non-GAAP gross margin where the unfavorable net FX impact, as well as the product mix I just mentioned. CooperSurgical had non-GAAP gross margin of 63.6% which compares to Q1 '15 at 64%. Strength in the OB/GYN and IVF product families were offset by the inclusion of our 2 recent acquisitions, Repro Genetics and Research Instruments, which have lower gross margins. 
Looking at operating expenses. On a non-GAAP basis, SG&A decreased approximately 3% to $161.8 million or 36% of revenue, down from approximately 38% the prior year. The primary driver behind this was a reduction in G&A where we saw leveraging good management of expenses within the businesses. Now looking at R&D. In Q1, R&D on a non-GAAP basis was $14.8 million or 3.3% of revenue, down from the 3.6% in the prior year. We are seeing investment in CSI offset by synergies from the Sauflon acquisition and CVI. 
Moving to operating margins. For Q1 consolidated GAAP operating income and margins were $57.4 million and 12.8% of revenue versus $73.1 million and 16.4% of revenue in Q1 last year. Non-GAAP operating income and margin were $99.4 million and 22.1% of revenue versus $102.6 million, 23% of revenue for the prior year. The difference in operating margin year-over-year is the reduction in gross margin we discussed partially offset by operating expenses. In Q1, CooperVision non-GAAP operating income and margin were $87.4 million and 24% of revenue versus $98.4 million and 26.6% of revenue in the prior year. CooperSurgical's non-GAAP operating income and margin were $22.8 million and 26.7% of revenue versus Q1 '15 at $17.5 million and 23.1% of revenue. Now looking at depreciation and amortization in Q1. Depreciation was $37.3 million, up $8 million year-over-year which includes $6.1 million of accelerated depreciation related to the Sauflon acquisition, which we excluded in our non-GAAP numbers. Amortization was $16.2 million, up $2.6 million. The year-over-year amortization increase reflects recent acquisition activity. Interest expense was $5.3 million for the quarter, up $1.3 million year-over-year primarily due to acquisitions and higher interest rates. Looking at the effective tax rate. In Q1, the non-GAAP effective tax rate was 3.9% versus a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 10.8% in Q1 '15. The year-over-year effective tax rate was favorably impacted by several items including the release of reserves associated with a prior year tax filing which we've normally have reversed in Q3 of 2017, as well as a reduction in the U.K. tax rate which was enacted in November. Also note, as we've mentioned before the effective tax rate continues to be below the U.S. statutorily rate as a majority of our income is earned in foreign jurisdictions with lower taxes -- lower tax rates. Our earnings per share -- our Q1 earnings per share on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis was $1.05 to $1.83, respectively versus $1.25 and $1.75 for GAAP and non-GAAP in the prior year. Non-GAAP EPS on a pro forma basis, which adjusts for currency and acquisitions, were approximately 15% of the quarter. 
Looking at FX impact. The net currency impact on EPS year-over-year for Q1 was unfavorable by $0.18. This was $0.04 less than we guided as currencies were generally favorable to guidance range. Looking at the balance sheet liquidity. In Q1, we had cash provided by operations of $89.5 million, less capital expenditures of $45.1 million, resulting in $44.4 million of free cash flow. Excluding integration costs of $12.3 million, adjusted free cash flow was $56.7 million. Total debt increased within the quarter by $28.1 million to $1.377 billion primarily due to acquisitions, partially offset by operational cash flow generation. Inventories increased approximately $11.2 million to $430.9 million, up from last quarter, primarily due to an increase in data lenses for CooperVision and an increase due to acquisitions for CooperSurgical. For the quarter, we are seeing months on hand at 6.9 months. DSO was at 57 days, which is consistent with the prior quarter and last year. 
Before I get into guidance, let me comment on our senior credit facilities which we mentioned in our earnings release under Other. We entered the bank market a couple months ago to refinance our $100 billion revolver and raise a small term loans. We price these facilities as investment grade and we're pleasantly surprise with the demand. As such, we closed a five-year replacement of our $1 billion revolver and a new five-year $830 million term loan. We use the term loan proceeds to repay certain existing indebtedness and we'll be reducing our $700 million term loan, which matures in August 2017. Our overall activities were positive as it extends the life of our facilities at very favorable terms and conditions while providing additional flexibility through greater capacity. The financial impact we're expecting is for interest expense to be higher but roughly $1 million per quarter going forward. As Bob mentioned, this is offset by the higher operating income being generated by CooperSurgical. 
Now turning to guidance. Foreign exchange rates have been very volatile. It can have a large impact on our results. Now for guidance on our main currencies, we are using $1.07 for the euro, $1.15 for the yen and $1.38 for the pound. As our rate assumptions, we're expecting a negative impact to full year 2016 revenues or approximately $58 million and an unfavorable $0.41 impact to full-year 2016 EPS. By giving Q1 with a negative $22 million in revenues and $0.18 on EPS, we are looking at a negative $36 million of revenue or $0.23 for Q2 to Q4 with more the negative impact in Q2 and Q3. The negative revenue impact of $58 million is unchanged from our December guidance, which may be surprising. The positive moves from several currencies including the euro and yen are offset by the negative move in the pound, along with a few other currencies like the Russian ruble and the Brazilian real. Having said this, the earnings per share impact was negative as the pound is helping COGS in the back half of the year and positive moves in currencies like the yen are having a positive flow-through impact to our operating income. For 2016 guidance. The revenue range for the company is $1.865 billion to $1.905 billion or approximately 5% to 7% pro forma growth. CooperVision's revenue range is $1.51 billion to $1.54 billion or 5% to 7% constant currency growth. CooperSurgical's revenue range is $355 million to $365 million or 5% to 8% pro forma growth. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be around 64% for the year. OpEx is expected to be around 40%. Operating margin is expected to be around 24%. Interest expense is expected to be around $24 million. Our effective tax rate is expected to be around 8%. Our expected share count will be around 49.2 million shares. Our non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $8 to $8.30, which equates to a pro forma EPS of 13% to 17% growth. CapEx is expected to be around $200 million. Adjusted free cash flow is expected to be around $300 million. With that, let me turn it back to Kim for the Q&A session."

Relative to UPP if it went away or in the lateral pricing policy. If it went away tomorrow, I'm not sure there would be much of a significant impact on the industry or the competitive landscape. Suffice it to say, I think many independent eye care practitioners would figure it out that there are workarounds out there to UPP and maybe it's not all that it was cracked up to be when it first came out as a novel new idea.

Alcon's undergoing a major restructuring within Novartis and they're pulling things out of what we used to call out Alcon and probably in the future won't -- I don't know what to call them as they deal with the name. But that's certainly, is not a handicap to us. J&J is not going through another assignment of executives in some of their key areas which is kind of a training ground for J&J in the contact lens space. So there's a change there. They, of course, put a lot of muscle or the executive that was transitioning out -- put a lot of muscle the last 2 months in the last 2 quarters in rolling out OASYS 1 Day. And other thoughts are in the work there. We like change in that sense. We like what J&J did by way of trying to accelerate the death,  if you will, of the 2 weeks space in the U.S. which they happen to own well North 80% of. So anytime they put their own franchise in play, I think other competitors like that. And whether it gross into the so-called when we -- so-called 1 Day or work to go into the 1 month that's putting it all in play. That's fine from our perspective. So we still think we're the 1 to be caught up with relative to complete portfolio of silicone hydrogel 1 Day and mass market and having a silicone hydrogel entry into the 1 Day premium market. So we think, we have the best deck of cards or hand of cards, if you will and like the way the industry continues to perform in good times and in bad times. So growth in the industry is there. Everything we've said about its trading up into 1 Day as a driver of the industry.

Cooper is continuing to execute its plan which was to roll out MyDay as a premium 1 Day silicone hydrogel and clariti as the mass market 1 Day silicone hydrogel with a complete family of torque, multifocal and fear. Nothing is changing by way of our focus on executing that strategy. We still believe that silicone hydrogel belongs in the 1 Day space. And therefore the fact that 77% of the non-1 Day space is already silicone hydrogel, we still believe we have the right product portfolio in the right space and it will convert into silicone hydrogel as we go forward. And nothing in it -- any of the numbers we're looking at byways of growth of the 1 Day market or the growth of silicone hydrogel causes us to take pause in that view. The fact that J&J put up robust numbers, yes, they came up with a new product and yes, they distributed it widely and deeply. They had very easy comps from the prior year but some of that growth is anomalous. You may recall in the prior years, they were going through that transition where they were the only one that did adopt UPP or unilateral pricing policy for not only new products wherein we were dedicating a lot of time to the eye care professional to learn the new products. They decided to do it for the products they've had in the marketplace for 10 years. So there was nothing new about it. It was no surprise that the eye care professional had to dedicate a whole bunch of new time to learn the new technology but it was easy comps. So nothing changes from the point of view of our expectation as I pointed out, we had a very tough comps in the first quarter. We do not have the same top comps in the second, third, and fourth quarter. So our focus remains on execution. As far as MyDay in Japan, we are rolling it out literally this month, which is March. And we're not doing -- because of capacity limitations, anything like J&J OASYS 1 Day roll out where they hit everyone all over. So we'll be a much more orderly rollout that will be -- I wouldn't go crazy because of our capital limitation, our capacity limitations on having high expectations for significantly moving the needle on the top line this fiscal year."

I think what other than pointing at the EMEA growth of 8% this being fairly robust, meaning, the factors that had gross margin, and I think Greg touched upon them on multiple and concessions is 1 but there clearly foreign exchange and the lag on that is another and quite frankly, the ramping up of MyDay while it's still in the lower gross margin category, all factor. So no one is driving our gross margin 61% and I think we indicated that we're expecting to be in around 64% by the end of the year to give you some indication where direction that will go. Relative to the new version Biofinity, I   so see extended range as an example of things that we we're doing particularly in the area of torque where the extended range, custom lenses matter and 1 of Cooper's claims to fame same and why we're so good at specialty lenses is we're very capable of customizing lenses and giving and addressing 100% of the audience instead of 80%. A lot of our competitors only worry about the Bell curve, the 80%. So when we talk about making by affinity even better, it's things like that. And whether or not we upgrade and add things that some of our competitors have done over the years when they have a product that's been around a long time. Will there be some refreshing of different things perhaps. But we're not going to get any further into that at this juncture. I would just think the extended range just to -- because it is a broadening of the family and the sales quality of the family. As far as J&J. If they move into the monthly, that will only further exacerbate the death of the 2 week. So who's to say they own -- north of 80% of the wear base in the 2 week space, they know better than anyone how noncompliant it is and they know if they can move people from the 2 week space to the monthly space and charge 30%, 40%, 50% or 60% for monthly higher than a 2 week noncompliant, they are much better off even if they don't get -- they have to get the lion's share but even if they don't get it all, as they put people in play. So we view -- net-net net, we view J&J activity putting the 2 week market in play as a plus for Cooper, as a plus for the industry."

Welcome to our first quarter 2016 conference call. We're off to a good start this year, and I am optimistic about our performance as we move forward.

We're off to a good start this year, and I am optimistic about our performance as we move forward. Let me start by touching on 3 key items: first, I'm pleased to report our fiscal first quarter financial results were strong. On a consolidated basis, we reported $450 million in revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.83. We are raising our fiscal 2016 revenue and earnings guidance to reflect this outperformance and to incorporate updated currency rates; second, CooperVision posted 4% constant currency revenue growth, which met expectations. As such, we are maintaining our 5% to 7% constant currency revenue guidance for CooperVision for the fiscal year; third, CooperSurgical had a strong quarter, posting revenue growth of 12% or 6% pro forma. This was especially impressive given non-GAAP operating margins expanded 400 basis points over Q1 of last year. As a result of this outperformance, we are raising CooperSurgical's full-year revenue guidance to 15% to 18% or 5% to 8% pro forma. I'll expand on these items as I walk through this quarter's performance, but suffice it to say I'm proud of where we stand and excited about the future. 
CooperVision reported Q1 revenues of $364 million, down 1% year-over-year but up 4% in constant currency. The Americas were down 3% in constant currency due to the tough comp and aggressive promotional activity by Johnson & Johnson, associated with their new Dailies silicon hydrogel product, which we discussed last quarter. Going forward, we expect the Americas to return to more normal growth starting in the second quarter. Regarding EMEA, sales grew 8% in constant currency. This was despite the Sauflon integration disruptions we discussed on our last earnings call. These disruptions ended in Q1 but resulted in certain customer concessions that reduced results. EMEA growth was driven by a full family of silicone hydrogel products, Biofinity, clariti, MyDay and Avaira. We also had a strong quarter in Asia Pacific, growing 12% in constant currency and this growth was also driven by our family of silicone hydrogel products. We expect both these regions to continue performing well going forward. 
Within our specialty business, overall Toric sales were up 4% year-over-year and multifocals were flat, both in constant currency. This was softer than in the prior quarters due to the Americas where -- which is the largest regions with these types of lenses. We remain a global leader in specialty lenses and expect sales to bounce back in Q2 as the Americas return to growth. Looking at silicone hydrogel lenses. This family of products delivered a strong growth of 13% in constant currency. Biofinity and Avaira combined to grow 7% in constant currency, with the only weakness being seen in the Americas. And again, we expect the Americas to rebound in Q2. We remain under indexed in the two-week and monthly silicon hydrogel space, with the market being roughly 77% silicone hydrogels and us at 72%, so we anticipate posting nice growth for many years to come. Regarding 1 Day silicone hydrogel lenses, sales of clariti and MyDay, grew a solid 50% in constant currency. We remain very optimistic about these products and are committed to our growth strategy, which includes a two-tiered approach, with clariti positioned as the mass market offering and MyDay as the premium offering. Remember the contact lens market is being driven by 1 Day growth, and we strongly believe we have the best product offering in the space as the only company with premium and mass market lenses, including a full portfolio of 1 Day, Sphere, Toric and multifocal lenses. Regarding production on these products, MyDay is ramping up nicely and we're selling everything we can make. Production is also extremely well, going extremely well for clariti, and we continue to expect clariti gross margins to be accretive to worldwide gross margins as we exit the fiscal year. 
Regarding Proclear, sales of this hydrogel product line were down 4% in constant currency, driven by our continuing shift to silicones. Before moving to market data, let me finish with a comment on CooperVision's non-GAAP adjustment. As expected, we had around $23 million in charges this quarter split roughly 60%, 40% between manufacturing and operating expenses. With the majority of the soft line integration behind us, we expect this number to decline to under $10 million in Q2, with most of the charges in cost of goods associated with accelerated depreciation, which relates to decisions we made last year. 
Now let me comment on CooperVision's performance against overall, the overall contact lens market. And remember, this information is on the last page of our earnings release. Counted for Q4, we continued taking market share, growing 6% with the market up 4%. Regarding the market, the underlying story with J&J's strength, due to a new product launch and easy comps, while Alcon's business was soft against difficult comps. Regionally, CVI grew 9% in EMEA with the market up 5%. In Asia PAC, CooperVision grew 12% with the market up 5% and in the Americas, CooperVision grew 1% with the market up 4%. If we look at the market on a modality basis, the single-use market continued driving growth with CVI up 14% and the market up 12%. For non-silicon use lenses, CVI grew 2% while the market declined 1%, and as you can see, our growth remains diverse and strong. For the full year -- calendar year 2015, CooperVision grew 7% in the market, grew 4%. Going forward, I expect the market to continue growing 4% to 6% over the next 5 years and most likely closer to 6%. The drivers will continue to be the shift to Dailies geographic expansion and expansion of the wearer base. We expect to continue taking market share, led by the strong silicone hydrogel portfolio. 
Moving to CooperSurgical. We reported Q1 revenues of $85 million, up 12% year-over-year or 6% pro forma. We made solid progress in our office and surgical business, growing 7% and in our fertility business, growing 6% both pro forma. These results are much stronger than our initial guidance and there are a number of ongoing activities which are driving this: First, we significantly increased our focus on sales during the fiscal fourth quarter of last year. This included existing products, new product launches and acquired products. This new emphasis was seen in our Q1 results and we believe it will continue through the year. Second, we are combining our office and surgical and fertility businesses, including transforming to a geographic sales focus. This is enabling us to cross-sell more effectively, which is especially beneficial with products such as our newly launched disposable hysteroscope, EndoSee, which sells to OB/GYN offices but also to fertility centers. This change will also allow us to better manage our infrastructure going forward and we'll reinvest those savings in sales and marketing to continue driving revenue growth. Third, as we continue to progress through the year, we'll be adding more sales personnel in under-penetrated areas and increasing our focus on high-growth areas such as genetic testing. We anticipate doing this while leveraging revenue growth to improve operating margins as we did in Q1. All in, CooperSurgical is clearly moving to a more aggressive and efficient business model, with a life sciences look and feel. 
With respect to CooperSurgical's products, the office and surgical business, comprises a diverse portfolio of roughly 600 products sold primarily to obstetricians and gynecologists. As I stated earlier, this product portfolio grew 7%, with strength in several key products. Within fertility, we grew 6% pro forma. Sales growth is still being negatively impacted by our strategic decision to exit low margin, non-CSI manufactured capital equipment. This will continue through Q2 but then, become largely immaterial in Q3. Also within fertility, our genetic testing business is performing extremely well. We entered these lab services faced with the acquisition of Reprogenetics last August and it's proving a very nice strategic sale. Lastly, we are complimentary, we added complimentary IVF products in mid-December, with the acquisition of Research Instruments and we also acquired a small fertility microneedle company at the beginning of February, which we expect to have roughly $1 million of revenue per quarter going forward. These deals are incorporated in our updated guidance. So overall, I'm very bullish on CooperSurgical. The passion drive of our surgical team is extremely high and I am really proud of their efforts and excited about our future. 
Now let me touch a little more on guidance. Our fiscal 2016 revenue guidance for CooperVision remains unchanged at 5% to 7% constant currency growth. We are raising our CooperSurgical revenue guidance to 5% to 8% pro forma growth or 15% to 18% on an as-reported basis. We're also raising our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance to $8 to $8.30, up 13% to 17% pro forma. For cash flow, we continue to expect around $300 million of adjusted free cash flow for fiscal 2016. 
In conclusion, we're continuing our successful strategy which we frequently articulated in the past. This includes investing to take market share by expanding geographically, aggressively rolling out new products and investing in emerging markets. We do this while remaining focused on growing earnings per share and cash flow to deliver strong shareholder value. I'm pleased with the results and happy the issues we encountered in the fourth quarter, such as the European Sauflon integration activity are behind us. I remain very optimistic about the underlying fundamentals of our businesses and I believe we are well-positioned to deliver strong results for fiscal 2016 and beyond. With that, let me express my appreciation to our employees, our #1 asset. Their hard work and dedication to creating value is the backbone of our success. And now, I'll turn it over to Greg to cover our financial results."

Bob provided an overall summary of our performance, including a review of the market and our revenue picture. A bit of focus on primarily our non-GAAP results for the quarter. For the reconciliation to GAAP numbe",1362,"Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Bob provided an overall summary of our performance, including a review of the market and our revenue picture. A bit of focus on primarily our non-GAAP results for the quarter. For the reconciliation to GAAP numbers, please refer to our earnings release. Looking at gross margins. In Q1, the non-GAAP gross margin was 61.4% compared with 64.2% in the prior year. Factors which impacted our non-GAAP gross margins were a net unfavorable FX impact with the favorable U.K.-based cost of goods sold impact more than offset by the unfavorable revenue impact. In addition, product mix was a negative as the sales weakness Bob mentioned in the Americas hurt our margins as this region has the greatest amount of Toric and multifocal lenses, along with being a strong Biofinity franchise. We expect gross margins to rebound in Q2. CooperVision on a non-GAAP basis reported gross margin of 60.9% versus 64.2% in Q1 of last year. The factors which impacted our non-GAAP gross margin where the unfavorable net FX impact, as well as the product mix I just mentioned. CooperSurgical had non-GAAP gross margin of 63.6% which compares to Q1 '15 at 64%. Strength in the OB/GYN and IVF product families were offset by the inclusion of our 2 recent acquisitions, Reprogenetics and Research Instruments, which have lower gross margins. 
Now looking at operating expenses. On a non-GAAP basis, SG&A decreased approximately 3% to $161.8 million or 36% of revenue, down from approximately 38% the prior year. The primary driver behind this was a reduction in G&A where we saw leverage and good management of expenses within the businesses. Now looking at R&D. In Q1, R&D on a non-GAAP basis was $14.8 million or 3.3% of revenue, down from the 3.6% in the prior year. We are seeing investment in CSI offset by synergies from the Sauflon acquisition and CVI. 
Moving to operating margins. For Q1, consolidated GAAP operating income and margin were $57.4 million and 12.8% of revenue versus $73.1 million and 16.4% of revenue in Q1 last year. Non-GAAP operating income and margin were $99.4 million and 22.1% of revenue versus $102.6 million and 23% of revenue for the prior year. The difference in operating margin year-over-year is the reduction in gross margin we discussed, partially offset by operating expenses. In Q1, CooperVision's non-GAAP operating income and margin were $87.4 million and 24% of revenue versus $98.4 million and 26.6% of revenue in the prior year. CooperSurgical's non-GAAP operating income and margin were $22.8 million and 26.7% of revenue versus Q1 '15 at $17.5 million and 23.1% of revenue. Now looking at depreciation and amortization in Q1. Depreciation was $37.3 million, up $8 million year-over-year, which includes $6.1 million of accelerated depreciation related to the Sauflon acquisition, which we excluded in our non-GAAP numbers. Amortization was $16.2 million, up $2.6 million. The year-over-year amortization increase reflects recent acquisition activity. Interest expense was $5.3 million for the quarter, up $1.3 million year-over-year, primarily due to acquisitions and higher interest rates. Looking at the effective tax rate. In Q1, the non-GAAP effective tax rate was 3.9% versus a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 10.8% in Q1 '15. The year-over-year effective tax rate was favorably impacted by several items, including the release of reserves associated with a prior year tax filing which would normally have reversed in Q3 of 2017, as well as a reduction in the U.K. tax rate, which was enacted in November. Also note, as we've mentioned before, the effective tax rate continues to be below the U.S. statutorily rate as a majority of our income is earned in foreign jurisdictions with lower taxes -- or lower tax rates. Our earnings per share -- our Q1 earnings per share on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis was $1.05 and $1.83, respectively, versus $1.25 and $1.75 for GAAP and non-GAAP in the prior year. Non-GAAP EPS on a pro forma basis, which adjusts for currency and acquisitions, grew approximately 15% in the quarter. 
Looking at FX impact. The net currency impact on EPS year-over-year for Q1 was unfavorable by $0.18. This was $0.04 less than we guided as currencies were generally favorable to guidance rates. Looking at the balance sheet liquidity. In Q1, we had cash provided by operations of $89.5 million, less capital expenditures of $45.1 million, resulting in $44.4 million of free cash flow. Excluding integration cost of $12.3 million, adjusted free cash flow was $56.7 million. Total debt increased within the quarter by $28.1 million to $1.377 billion primarily due to acquisitions, partially offset by operational cash flow generation. Inventories increased approximately $11.2 million to $430.9 million, up from last quarter, primarily due to an increase in daily lenses for CooperVision and an increase due to acquisitions for CooperSurgical. For the quarter, we are seeing months on hand at 6.9 months. DSO was at 57 days, which is consistent with the prior quarter and last year. 
Before I get into guidance, let me comment on our senior credit facilities which we mentioned in our earnings release under Other. We entered the bank market a couple months ago to refinance our $100 billion revolver and raise a small term loan. We priced these facilities as investment grade and we're pleasantly surprised with the demand. As such, we closed a five-year replacement of our $1 billion revolver and a new five-year $830 million term loan. We use the term loan proceeds to repay certain existing indebtedness and we'll be reducing our $700 million term loan, which matures in August of 2017. Overall this activity is very positive as it extends the life of our facilities with very favorable terms and conditions, while providing additional flexibility through greater capacity. The financial impact we're expecting is for interest expense to be higher by roughly $1 million per quarter going forward. As Bob mentioned, this is offset by the higher operating income being generated by CooperSurgical. 
Now turning to guidance. Foreign exchange rates have been very volatile. It can have a large impact on our results. Now for guidance on our main currencies, we are using $1.07 for the euro, $1.15 for the yen and $1.38 for the pound. With our rate assumptions, we are expecting a negative impact to full year 2016 revenues of approximately $58 million and an unfavorable $0.41 impact to full-year 2016 EPS. By giving Q1 with a negative $22 million in revenues and $0.18 on EPS, we are looking at a negative $36 million of revenue or $0.23 for Q2 to Q4, with more of a negative impact in Q2 and Q3. The negative revenue impact of $58 million is unchanged from our December guidance, which may be surprising. The positive moves from several currencies including the euro and the yen are offset by the negative move in the pound, along with a few other currencies like the Russian ruble and the Brazilian real. Having said this, the earnings per share impact is less negative, as the pound is helping COGS in the back half of the year and positive moves in currencies like the yen are having a positive flow-through impact to our operating income. For 2016 guidance. The revenue range for the company is $1.865 billion to $1.905 billion or approximately 5% to 7% pro forma growth. CooperVision's revenue range is $1.51 billion to $1.54 billion or 5% to 7% constant currency growth. CooperSurgical's revenue range is $355 million to $365 million or 5% to 8% pro forma growth. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be around 64% for the year. OpEx is expected to be around 40%. Operating margin is expected to be around 24%. Interest expense is expected to be around $24 million. Our effective tax rate is expected to be around 8%. Our expected share count will be around 49.2 million shares. Our non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $8 to $8.30, which equates to a pro forma EPS of 13% to 17% growth. CapEx is expected to be around $200 million. Adjusted free cash flow is expected to be around $300 million. With that, let me turn it back to Kim for the Q&A session."

We had 11% growth a year ago, and so it's against that tough comp. Since the U.S. is so weighted to specialty lenses compared to outside the U.S. yet it shows up as what appears to be a deceleration of the growth of the lenses in our specialty area towards in multifocals. Our expectation is, we indicated several times is that the comps are easier post the first quarter, so we expect to return to a more normalized growth rate. It's built into our revenue guidance and certainly, that would impact, especially -- heavily, because of its U.S. orientation, and it will also impact our gross margin going forward, since specialty lenses carry a higher gross margin percent."

Relative to UPP, if it went away or unilateral pricing policy, if it went away tomorrow, I'm not sure there would be much of a significant impact on the industry or the competitive landscape. Suffice it to say, I think many independent eye care practitioners figured out that there are workarounds out there to UPP, and maybe it's not all that it was cracked up to be when it first came out as a novel new idea.

But that's certainly is not a handicap to us. J&J is not going through another assignment of executives in some of their key areas which is kind of a training ground for J&J in the contact lens space. So there's a change there. They, of course, put a lot of muscle or the executive that was transitioning out, put a lot of muscle the last 2 months in, the last 2 quarters in rolling out OASYS 1 Day. And other thoughts are in the work there. We like change in that sense. We like some of what J&J did by way of trying to accelerate the death,  if you will, of the 2 week space in the U.S. which they happen to own well north 80% of. So anytime they put their own franchise in play, I think all the competitors like that. And whether it goes into what the so-called one week, the so-called 1 Day, or were to go into the 1 month that's putting it all in play. That's fine from our perspective. So we still think we're the one to be caught up with, relative to a complete portfolio of silicone hydrogel 1 Day and at both the mass market and having a silicone hydrogel entry into the 1 Day premium market. So we think we have the best deck of cards or hand of cards, if you will and like the way the industry continues to perform in good times and in bad times. So the growth of the industry is there. Everything we've said about, trading up into 1 Day as a driver of the industry.

Cooper is continuing to execute its plan, which was to roll out MyDay as a premium 1 Day silicone hydrogel and clariti as the mass market 1 Day silicone hydrogel with a complete family of Toric, multifocal and Sphere. Nothing is changing by way of our focus on executing that strategy. We still believe that silicone hydrogel belongs in the 1 Day space. And therefore, the fact that 77% of the non-1 Day space is already silicone hydrogel, we still believe we have the right product portfolio in the right space, and it will convert into silicone hydrogel as we go forward. And nothing in it -- any of the numbers we're looking at by way of growth of the 1 Day market or the growth of silicone hydrogels causes us to take pause in that view. The fact that J&J put up robust numbers, yes, they came out with a new product and yes, they distributed it widely and deeply. They had very easy comps from the prior year, though some of that growth is anomalous. And you may recall in the prior years, they were going through that transition where they were the only one that did adopt UPP or unilateral pricing policy for not only new products wherein we were dedicating a lot of time to the eye care professional to learn the new products. They decided to do it for the products they've had in the marketplace for 10 years. So there was nothing new about it. There was no reason to think that the eye care professional had to dedicate a whole bunch of new time to learn the new technology, but it was easy comps. So nothing changes from the point of view of our expectation as I pointed out, we had a very tough comps in the first quarter. We do not have those same tough comps in the second, third, and fourth quarters. So our focus remains on execution. As far as MyDay in Japan, we are rolling it out, literally this month, which is March. And we're not doing -- because of capacity limitations, anything like the J&J OASYS 1 Day roll out where they hit everyone all over, so it will be a much more orderly rollout that will -- I wouldn't go crazy because of our capital limitations, or our capacity limitations on having high expectations for significantly moving the needle on the top line this fiscal year."

A lot of our competitors only worry about the Bell curve, the 80%. So when we talk about making Biofinity even better, it's things like that. And whether or not we upgrade and add things that some of our competitors have done over the years when they have a product that's been around a long time, will there be some refreshing of different things? Perhaps. But we're not -- go any further into that at this juncture. I was using the extended range just to -- because it is a broadening of the family and availability of the family. As far as J&J, if they move into the monthly, that will only further exacerbate the death of the 2 week. So who's to say they own  north of 80% of the wearer base in the 2 week space. They know better than anyone how noncompliant it is, and they know if they can move people from the 2 week space to the monthly space and charge 30%, 40%, 50% or 60% for a monthly higher than a 2 week noncompliant, they are much better off, even if they don't get -- they have to get the lion's share, but even if they don't get it all, as they put people in play. So we view -- net-net net, we view J&J activity putting the 2 week market in play as a plus for Cooper, as a plus for the industry."

Welcome to our first quarter 2016 conference call. We're off to a good start this year, and I am optimistic about our performance as we move forward.

We're off to a good start this year, and I am optimistic about our performance as we move forward. Let me start by touching on 3 key items: First, I'm pleased to report our fiscal first quarter financial results were strong. On a consolidated basis, we reported $450 million in revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.83. We are raising our fiscal 2016 revenue and earnings guidance to reflect this outperformance and to incorporate updated currency rates. Second, CooperVision posted 4% constant currency revenue growth, which met expectations. As such, we are maintaining our 5% to 7% constant currency revenue guidance for CooperVision for the fiscal year. Third, CooperSurgical had a strong quarter, posting revenue growth of 12% or 6% pro forma. This was especially impressive given non-GAAP operating margins expanded 400 basis points over Q1 of last year. As a result of this outperformance, we are raising CooperSurgical's full-year revenue guidance to 15% to 18% or 5% to 8% pro forma. I'll expand on these items as I walk through this quarter's performance, but suffice it to say, I'm proud of where we stand and excited about the future. 
CooperVision reported Q1 revenues of $364 million, down 1% year-over-year, but up 4% in constant currency. The Americas were down 3% in constant currency due to the tough comp and aggressive promotional activity by Johnson & Johnson, associated with their new daily silicone hydrogel product, which we discussed last quarter. Going forward, we expect the Americas to return to more normal growth starting in the second quarter. Regarding EMEA, sales grew 8% in constant currency. This was despite the Sauflon integration disruptions we discussed on our last earnings call. These disruptions ended in Q1, but resulted in certain customer concessions that reduced results. EMEA growth was driven by a full family of silicone hydrogel products, Biofinity, clariti, MyDay and Avaira. We also had a strong quarter in Asia Pacific, growing 12% in constant currency and this growth was also driven by our family of silicone hydrogel products. We expect both these regions to continue performing well going forward. 
Within our specialty business, overall Toric sales were up 4% year-over-year and multifocals were flat, both in constant currency. This was softer than in the prior quarters due to the Americas where -- which is the largest regions for these types of lenses. We remain a global leader in specialty lenses and expect sales to bounce back in Q2 as the Americas returns to growth. Looking at silicone hydrogel lenses. This family of products delivered a strong growth of 13% in constant currency. Biofinity and Avaira combined to grow 7% in constant currency, with the only weakness being seen in the Americas. And again, we expect the Americas to rebound in Q2. We remain under indexed in the 2-week and monthly silicone hydrogel space, with the market being roughly 77% silicone hydrogels and us at 72%, so we anticipate posting nice growth for many years to come. Regarding 1 Day silicone hydrogel lenses, sales of clariti and MyDay, grew a solid 50% in constant currency. We remain very optimistic about these products and are committed to our growth strategy, which includes a 2-tiered approach, with clariti positioned as the mass market offering and MyDay as the premium offering. Remember the contact lens market is being driven by 1 Day growth, and we strongly believe we have the best product offering in the space as the only company with premium and mass market lenses, including a full portfolio of 1 Day, Sphere, Toric and multifocal lenses. Regarding production on these products, MyDay is ramping up nicely and we're selling everything we can make. Production is also extremely well, going extremely well for clariti, and we continue to expect clariti gross margins to be accretive to worldwide gross margins as we exit the fiscal year. 
Regarding Proclear, sales of this hydrogel product line were down 4% in constant currency, driven by our continuing shift to silicones. Before moving to market data, let me finish with a comment on CooperVision's non-GAAP adjustments. As expected, we had around $23 million in charges this quarter split roughly 60%, 40% between manufacturing and operating expenses. With the majority of the soft line integration behind us, we expect this number to decline to under $10 million in Q2, with most of the charges in cost of goods associated with accelerated depreciation, which relates to decisions we made last year. 
Now let me comment on CooperVision's performance against overall, the overall contact lens market. And remember, this information is on the last page of our earnings release. For calendar Q4, we continued taking market share, growing 6% with the market up 4%. Regarding the market, the underlying story with J&J's strength, due to a new product launch and easy comps, while Alcon's business was soft against difficult comps. Regionally, CVI grew 9% in EMEA with the market up 5%. In Asia PAC, CooperVision grew 12% with the market up 5% and in the Americas, CooperVision grew 1% with the market up 4%. If we look at the market on a modality basis, the single-use market continued driving growth with CVI up 14% and the market up 12%. For non-silicone use lenses, CVI grew 2% while the market declined 1%, and as you can see, our growth remains diverse and strong. For the full year -- calendar year 2015, CooperVision grew 7% and the market grew 4%. Going forward, I expect the market to continue growing 4% to 6% over the next 5 years and most likely closer to 6%. The drivers will continue to be the shift to Dailies geographic expansion and expansion of the wearer base. We expect to continue taking market share, led by the strong silicone hydrogel portfolio. 
Moving to CooperSurgical. We reported Q1 revenues of $85 million, up 12% year-over-year or 6% pro forma. We made solid progress in our office and surgical business, growing 7% and in our fertility business, growing 6% both pro forma. These results are much stronger than our initial guidance and there are a number of ongoing activities which are driving this: First, we significantly increased our focus on sales during the fiscal fourth quarter of last year. This included existing products, new product launches and acquired products. This new emphasis was seen in our Q1 results and we believe it will continue through the year. Second, we are combining our office and surgical and fertility businesses, including transforming to a geographic sales focus. This is enabling us to cross-sell more effectively, which is especially beneficial with products such as our newly launched disposable hysteroscope, EndoSee, which sells to OB/GYN offices but also to fertility centers. This change will also allow us to better manage our infrastructure going forward and we'll reinvest those savings in sales and marketing to continue driving revenue growth. Third, as we continue to progress through the year, we'll be adding more sales personnel in under-penetrated areas and increasing our focus on high-growth areas such as genetic testing. We anticipate doing this while leveraging revenue growth to improve operating margins as we did in Q1. All in, CooperSurgical is clearly moving to a more aggressive and efficient business model, with a life sciences look and feel. 
With respect to CooperSurgical's products, the office and surgical business, comprises a diverse portfolio of roughly 600 products sold primarily to obstetricians and gynecologists. As I stated earlier, this product portfolio grew 7%, with strength in several key products. Within fertility, we grew 6% pro forma. Sales growth is still being negatively impacted by our strategic decision to exit low margin, non-CSI manufactured capital equipment. This will continue through Q2 but then, become largely immaterial in Q3. Also within fertility, our genetic testing business is performing extremely well. We entered these lab services faced with the acquisition of Reprogenetics last August and it's proving a very nice strategic sale. Lastly, we are complementary, we added complementary IVF products in mid-December, with the acquisition of Research Instruments and we also acquired a small fertility microneedle company at the beginning of February, which we expect to have roughly $1 million of revenue per quarter going forward. These deals are incorporated into our updated guidance. So overall, I'm very bullish on CooperSurgical. The passion and drive of our surgical team is extremely high and I am really proud of their efforts and excited about our future. 
Now let me touch a little more on guidance. Our fiscal 2016 revenue guidance for CooperVision remains unchanged at 5% to 7% constant currency growth. We are raising our CooperSurgical revenue guidance to 5% to 8% pro forma growth or 15% to 18% on an as-reported basis. We're also raising our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance to $8 -- to $8.30, up 13% to 17% pro forma. For cash flow, we continue to expect around $300 million of adjusted free cash flow for fiscal 2016. 
In conclusion, we're continuing our successful strategy which we frequently articulated in the past. This includes investing to take market share by expanding geographically, aggressively rolling out new products and investing in emerging markets. We do this while remaining focused on growing earnings per share and cash flow to deliver strong shareholder value. I'm pleased that our results and happy the issues we encountered in the fourth quarter, such as the European Sauflon integration activity are behind us. I remain very optimistic about the underlying fundamentals of our businesses and I believe we are well-positioned to deliver strong results for fiscal 2016 and beyond. With that, let me express my appreciation to our employees, our #1 asset. Their hard work and dedication to creating value is the backbone of our success. And now, I'll turn it over to Greg to cover our financial results."

Bob provided an overall summary of our performance, including a review of the market and our revenue picture. A bit of focus on primarily our non-GAAP results for the quarter. For the reconciliation to GAAP numbe",1358,"Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Bob provided an overall summary of our performance, including a review of the market and our revenue picture. A bit of focus on primarily our non-GAAP results for the quarter. For the reconciliation to GAAP numbers, please refer to our earnings release. Looking at gross margins. In Q1, the non-GAAP gross margin was 61.4% compared with 64.2% in the prior year. Factors which impacted our non-GAAP gross margins were a net unfavorable FX impact with the favorable U.K.-based cost of goods sold impact more than offset by the unfavorable revenue impact. In addition, product mix was a negative as the sales weakness Bob mentioned in the Americas hurt our margins as this region has the greatest amount of Toric and multifocal lenses, along with being a strong Biofinity franchise. We expect gross margins to rebound in Q2. CooperVision on a non-GAAP basis reported gross margin of 60.9% versus 64.2% in Q1 of last year. The factors which impacted our non-GAAP gross margin where the unfavorable net FX impact, as well as the product mix I just mentioned. CooperSurgical had non-GAAP gross margin of 63.6% which compares to Q1 '15 at 64%. Strength in the OB/GYN and IVF product families were offset by the inclusion of our 2 recent acquisitions, Reprogenetics and Research Instruments, which have lower gross margins. 
Now looking at operating expenses. On a non-GAAP basis, SG&A decreased approximately 3% to $161.8 million or 36% of revenue, down from approximately 38% the prior year. The primary driver behind this was a reduction in G&A where we saw leverage and good management of expenses within the businesses. Now looking at R&D. In Q1, R&D on a non-GAAP basis was $14.8 million or 3.3% of revenue, down from the 3.6% in the prior year. We are seeing investment in CSI offset by synergies from the Sauflon acquisition and CVI. 
Moving to operating margins. For Q1, consolidated GAAP operating income and margins were $57.4 million and 12.8% of revenue versus $73.1 million and 16.4% of revenue in Q1 last year. Non-GAAP operating income and margin were $99.4 million and 22.1% of revenue versus $102.6 million and 23% of revenue for the prior year. The difference in operating margin year-over-year is the reduction in gross margin we discussed, partially offset by operating expenses. In Q1, CooperVision's non-GAAP operating income and margin were $87.4 million and 24% of revenue versus $98.4 million and 26.6% of revenue in the prior year. CooperSurgical's non-GAAP operating income and margin were $22.8 million and 26.7% of revenue versus Q1 '15 at $17.5 million and 23.1% of revenue. Now looking at depreciation and amortization in Q1. Depreciation was $37.3 million, up $8 million year-over-year, which includes $6.1 million of accelerated depreciation related to the Sauflon acquisition, which we exclude in our non-GAAP numbers. Amortization was $16.2 million, up $2.6 million. The year-over-year amortization increase reflects recent acquisition activity. Interest expense was $5.3 million for the quarter, up $1.3 million year-over-year, primarily due to acquisitions and higher interest rates. Looking at the effective tax rate. In Q1, the non-GAAP effective tax rate was 3.9% versus a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 10.8% in Q1 '15. The year-over-year effective tax rate was favorably impacted by several items, including the release of reserves associated with a prior year tax filing which would normally have reversed in Q3 of 2017, as well as a reduction in the U.K. tax rate, which was enacted in November. Also note, as we've mentioned before, the effective tax rate continues to be below the U.S. statutory rate as a majority of our income is earned in foreign jurisdictions with lower taxes -- or lower tax rates. Our earnings per share -- our Q1 earnings per share on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis was $1.05 and $1.83, respectively, versus $1.25 and $1.75 for GAAP and non-GAAP in the prior year. Non-GAAP EPS on a pro forma basis, which adjusts for currency and acquisitions, grew approximately 15% in the quarter. 
Looking at FX impact. The net currency impact on EPS year-over-year for Q1 was unfavorable by $0.18. This was $0.04 less than we guided as currencies were generally favorable to guidance rates. Looking at the balance sheet liquidity. In Q1, we had cash provided by operations of $89.5 million, less capital expenditures of $45.1 million, resulting in $44.4 million of free cash flow. Excluding integration costs of $12.3 million, adjusted free cash flow was $56.7 million. Total debt increased within the quarter by $28.1 million to $1,377,000,000 primarily due to acquisitions, partially offset by operational cash flow generation. Inventories increased approximately $11.2 million to $430.9 million, up from last quarter, primarily due to an increase in daily lenses for CooperVision and an increase due to acquisitions for CooperSurgical. For the quarter, we are seeing months on hand at 6.9 months. DSO was at 57 days, which is consistent with the prior quarter and last year. 
Before I get into guidance, let me comment on our senior credit facilities which we mentioned in our earnings release under Other. We entered the bank market a couple months ago to refinance our $1 billion revolver and raise a small term loan. We priced these facilities as investment-grade and were pleasantly surprised with the demand. As such, we closed a 5-year replacement of our $1 billion revolver and a new 5-year $830 million term loan. We used the term loan proceeds to repay certain existing indebtedness and we'll be reducing our $700 million term loan, which matures in August of 2017. Overall, this activity is very positive as it extends the life of our facilities with very favorable terms and conditions, while providing additional flexibility through greater capacity. The financial impact we're expecting is for interest expense to be higher by roughly $1 million per quarter going forward. As Bob mentioned, this is offset by the higher operating income being generated by CooperSurgical. 
Now turning to guidance. Foreign exchange rates have been very volatile and can have a large impact on our results. For guidance on our main currencies, we are using $1.07 for the euro, $1.15 for the yen and $1.38 for the pound. With our rate assumptions, we are expecting a negative impact to full year 2016 revenues of approximately $58 million and an unfavorable $0.41 impact to full-year 2016 EPS. Given Q1 was a negative $22 million in revenues and $0.18 on EPS, we are looking at a negative $36 million of revenue or $0.23 for Q2 to Q4, with more of a negative impact in Q2 and Q3. The negative revenue impact of $58 million is unchanged from our December guidance, which may be surprising. The positive moves from several currencies including the euro and the yen are offset by the negative move in the pound, along with a few other currencies like the Russian ruble and the Brazilian real. Having said this, the earnings per share impact is less negative, as the pound is helping COGS in the back half of the year and positive moves in currencies like the yen are having a positive flow-through impact to our operating income. For 2016 guidance. The revenue range for the company is $1.865 billion to $1.905 billion or approximately 5% to 7% pro forma growth. CooperVision's revenue range is $1.51 billion to $1.54 billion or 5% to 7% constant currency growth. CooperSurgical's revenue range is $355 million to $365 million or 5% to 8% pro forma growth. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be around 64% for the year. OpEx is expected to be around 40%. Operating margin is expected to be around 24%. Interest expense is expected to be around $24 million. Our effective tax rate is expected to be around 8%. Our expected share count will be around 49.2 million shares. Our non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $8 to $8.30, which equates to a pro forma EPS of 13% to 17% growth. CapEx is expected to be around $200 million. Adjusted free cash flow is expected to be around $300 million. With that, let me turn it back to Kim for the Q&A session."

Suffice it to say, I think many independent eye care practitioners figured out that there are workarounds out there to UPP, and maybe it's not all that it was cracked up to be when it first came out as a novel new idea.

But that's certainly is not a handicap to us. J&J is going through another assignment of executives in some of their key areas which is kind of a training ground for J&J in the contact lens space. So there's a change there. They, of course, put a lot of muscle or the executive that was transitioning out, put a lot of muscle the last 2 months in, the last 2 quarters in rolling out OASYS 1 Day. And other thoughts are in the works there. We'd like change in that sense. We like some of what J&J did by way of trying to accelerate the death, if you will, of the 2-week space in the U.S. which they happen to own well north 80% of. So anytime they put their own franchise in play, I think all the competitors like that. And whether it goes into what the so-called one week, the so-called 1 Day, or were it to go into the 1 month that's putting it all in play. That's fine from our perspective. So we still think we're the one to be caught up with, relative to a complete portfolio of silicone hydrogel 1 Day and at both the mass market and having a silicone hydrogel entry into the 1 Day premium market. So we think we have the best deck of cards or hand of cards, if you will and like the way the industry continues to perform in good times and in bad times. So the growth of the industry is there. Everything we've said about, trading up into 1 Day as a driver of the industry.

Cooper is continuing to execute its plan, which was to roll out MyDay as a premium 1 Day silicone hydrogel and clariti as a mass market 1 Day silicone hydrogel with a complete family of Toric, multifocal and Sphere. Nothing is changing by way of our focus on executing that strategy. We still believe that silicone hydrogel belongs in the 1 Day space. And therefore, the fact that 77% of the non-1 Day space is already silicone hydrogel, we still believe we have the right product portfolio in the right space, and it will convert into silicone hydrogels as we go forward. And nothing in it -- any of the numbers we're looking at by way of growth of the 1 Day market or the growth of silicone hydrogels causes us to take pause in that view. The fact that J&J put up robust numbers, yes, they came out with a new product and yes, they distributed it widely and deeply. They had very easy comps from the prior year, so some of that growth is anomalous. And you may recall in the prior years, they were going through that transition where they were the only one that did adopt UPP or unilateral pricing policy for not only new products wherein we were dedicating a lot of time to the eye care professional to learn the new products. They decided to do it for the products they've had in the marketplace for 10 years. So there was nothing new about it. There was no reason to think that the eye care professional had to dedicate a whole bunch of new time to learn the new technology, but it was easy comps. So nothing changes from the point of view of our expectation as I pointed out, we had a very tough comps in the first quarter. We do not have those same tough comps in the second, third, and fourth quarters. So our focus remains on execution. As far as MyDay in Japan, we are rolling it out, literally this month, which is March. And we're not doing -- because of capacity limitations, anything like the J&J OASYS 1 Day roll out where they hit everyone all over, so it will be a much more orderly rollout that will -- I wouldn't go crazy because of our capital limitations, or our capacity limitations on having high expectations for significantly moving the needle on the top line this fiscal year."

And I know you expect to improve in the second quarter. So if you would give that, it would be helpful, but -- anyway, that just a request. And then, on Biofinity, Joanne asked about another, new version. So just to be clear, you talked about extended ranges, so it sounds like you're not planning to come out with a Sphere [ph] version with UPP in 2016. And sorry, guys, just lastly, for my real question. Does J&J, if they do come out with a monthly lens, Bob, how do you see that for Cooper? Obviously, there's some rumors of that, that we haven't confirmed it, but what would be the impact for Cooper if they come out with a monthly lens?"

We said the same thing on the fourth quarter call. I think what, other than me pointing you at the EMEA growth of 8% as being fairly robust, meaning, the factors that hit gross margin, and I think Greg touched upon them, are multiple and concessions is one, but they're clearly foreign exchange and the lag on that is another, and quite frankly, the ramping up of MyDay, while it's still in a lower gross margin category, it all factors. So it's -- no one is driving our gross margin of 61% and I think we indicated we're expecting to be in around 64% by the end of the year to give you some indication where, direction that will go. Relative to, of the new version Biofinity, I'll use the extended range as an example of things that we we're doing, particularly in the area of Toric's, where extended ranges, custom lenses matter, and one of Cooper's claims to fame, and why we're so good in specialty lenses is, we're very capable of customizing lenses, and giving -- and addressing 100% of the audience, instead of 80%. A lot of our competitors only worry about the Bell curve, the 80%. So when we talk about making Biofinity even better, it's things like that. And whether or not we upgrade and add things that some of our competitors have done over the years when they have a product that's been around a long time, will there be some refreshing of different things? Perhaps. But we're not going any further into that at this juncture. I was using the extended range just to -- because it is a broadening of the family and availability of the family. As far as J&J, if they move into the monthly, that will only further exacerbate the death of the 2-week. So who's to say they own north of 80% of the wearer base in the 2-week space. They know better than anyone how noncompliant it is, and they know if they can move people from the 2-week space to the monthly space and charge 30%, 40%, 50% or 60% for a monthly higher than a 2-week noncompliant, they are much better off, even if they don't get -- they have to get the lion's share, but even if they don't get it all, as they put people in play. So we view -- net-net-net, we view J&J activity putting the 2-week market in play as a plus for Cooper, as a plus for the industry."

Let me start by highlighting 3 key areas; first, I'm pleased to report strong financial results for our fiscal second quarter. On a consolidated basis, we reported $484 million in revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.05; second, CooperVision posted 9% revenue growth on both a constant currency and as-reported basis and strong results in all key areas of the business. Since we use silicone hydrogel, grew 52%, while 2 week and monthly silicone hydrogel lenses grew a combined 14% both in constant currency; third, CooperSurgical had another strong quarter posting revenue growth of 23% and pro forma growth of 6%. We also closed several strategic acquisitions since our last earnings call. 
Moving into the details, CooperVision reported second quarter revenues of $391 million, up 9%. This was our strongest quarter growth quarter since 2014 and really shows the strength of our product portfolio. Regarding revenue by geography, the Americas grew 9% in constant currency, showing a nice rebound from last quarter. Strength was seen in multiple categories led by silicone hydrogel products. Our enhanced clarity lens has been extremely well received and MyDay had another strong quarter. Our toric and multifocal also posted strong growth driven by Biofinity family. EMEA had another strong quarter and sales grew 5% in constant currency. Growth was driven by our family of silicone hydrogel products, Biofinity, clariti, MyDay and Avaira. We also launched of Avaira Vitality in EMEA during the quarter and it is being well received. Avaira Vitality is our new 2 week silicone hydrogel lens which is an enhanced replacement for the original Avaira lens. It was developed using improved manufacturing processes, resulting in a higher quality product at a lower cost per unit. We expect to launch this lens in the U.S. later this year subject to FDA approval. Asia Pacific had a very strong quarter, up 18% in constant currency. Growth was strong throughout the region and Biofinity and Proclear 1 Day stood out in Japan. Also in Japan, we began our MyDay launch during the quarter and we're seeing full signs that MyDay could be a very successful premium offering in that market. 
Turning to our product categories. Toric and multifocals grew a healthy 15% year-over-year in constant currency. We saw a very nice rebound in the U.S. which bolstered our strength throughout the rest of the world. We remained the global leader in specialty lenses. 
Looking at silicone hydrogel lenses. These products grew 20% in constant currency and now represent 60% of our total sales. Within the two-week and monthly space, Biofinity and Avaira combined to grow 14% in constant currency. We remain under index in the two-week and monthly silicone hydrogel space at 74% of sales versus the market at 79%, so we anticipate a very nice growth for many years to come. Regarding our silicone hydrogel 1 Day lenses, clariti and MyDay, they combined to grow 52% in constant currency. We remain very optimistic about these products and are committed to our growth strategy which includes a two-tier approach with clariti positioned as the mass market offering and MyDay as the premium offering. Remember the biggest driver in the contact lens market is the 1 Day growth and we strongly believe we have the best product offering in the space as the only company with premium and mass market lenses including a full portfolio of 1 Day silicone hydrogel, sphere, toric and multifocal lenses. 
Before finishing with market data, let me make a quick comment on matters. We continue to finalize our Sauflon inspiration activities and we're very close to being done. Provision had a very small non-GAAP adjustment this quarter or smaller non-GAAP adjustment this quarter of roughly $9 million excluding amortization. We forecast similar charges in Q3 and Q4, mostly within costs of goods but it should end this fiscal year. 
Now let me comment on the overall contact lens market and remember, this information is on the last page of the earnings release. For calendar Q1, we continue taking share growing 9% with the market up 3%. Geographically, CooperVision grew 9% in the Americas. The market was flat. In Asia Pacific, CooperVision grew 14% with the market up 5%, and in EMEA, we grew 6%, in line with the market. On modality basis, single-use lenses continue driving growth and CVI -- with CVI up 14% and the market up 9%. For non-single-use lenses, we grew 6% while the market declined 1%. We also see -- as you can see, our growth remains diverse and strong. On a trailing 12 month basis, CooperVision grew 8% and the market grew 5%. Going forward, I expect the market to continue growing forward to 6% over the next 5 years and most likely closer to 6%. The drivers will continue to be a shift to daily geographic expansion and an expansion of the wear base. We expect to continue taking market share, led by our strong silicone hydrogel portfolio. 
Moving to CooperSurgical. We reported second quarter revenues of $93 million, up 23% year-over-year or up 6% pro forma. Our fertility products led the way up 60% or 8% pro forma and our office and surgical products grew 5%. We continued executing on several initiatives which are driving success including transitioning to a geographic sales model, adding sales representative in under-penetrated areas and increasing our focus on high-growth areas such as IBF kinetic testing. These moves are clearly gaining traction as we saw growth throughout core business in Q2. Going forward, I believe we'll continue to see solid growth as the business keeps moving into more aggressive and efficient business model. 
Regarding acquisitions. We've completed several over the past few months, so let me touch on those in the strategic rationale. At the beginning of April, we added Genesis Genetics, a genetic testing lab company focused on free implantation, genetic screening and diagnosis used during the IBF process. This is a nice addition to our genetic testing platform. At the beginning of May, we added complementary IBF capital equipment products through the acquisition of Case Systems, a small acquisition of roughly $7 million in revenue per year. And finally, we added the assets of Recombine last week. Recombine is a genetic testing company specializing in carrier screening, which is a great fit within our IBF and genetic testing franchise as it adds the #1 carrier screening test sold to the IBF clinics. As you can see, we're very focused on combining a full-service provider within the IBF global market and we truly believe this strategy will yield success for many years to come. These deals are all Incorporated into our updated guidance. With that, let me touch on our guidance details. We are raising our fiscal 2016 revenue guidance for CooperVision to 5.5% to 7% constant currency growth. Our CooperSurgical revenue guidance is also raised to 6% to 8% pro forma growth or up 24% to 27% on an as-reported basis. We're also raising our non-GAAP EPS guidance to $8.20 to $8.50. 
In conclusion, I'm very pleased with our results and remain optimistic about the underlying fundamentals of our business. I believe we're well-positioned to deliver solid results for the remainder of the fiscal year and beyond. With that, let me express my appreciation to our employees, our #1 asset. Their hard work and dedication to creating value is the backbone of our success. And now, I'll turn it over to Greg to cover the financial results."

We're going to focus primarily on our non-GAAP results for the quarter. For the reconciliation to GAAP numbers, please refer to our earnings release. Looking at gross margins. In Q2, the non-GAAP gross margin was 63.2% compared to 63.4% in the prior year. Although CooperVision had positives from currency and strong Biofinity sales, it's margin was lower than expected. The primary items driving this were a negative margin impact from stronger Asia Pac sales where we have higher 1 Day sales and charges associated with idle equipment and legacy hydrogel inventory. Regarding these last 2 items, let me cover them separately. We have made a lot of progress improving our manufacturing operations, including some very recent successes. For competitive reasons, I won't get into specifics but our production per line has increased materially resulting in lower cost per unit and a lesser need for future CapEx. This has resulted in idling from equipment, which hurts us in Q2 and will also negatively impact Q3 and Q4. We anticipate this being a short-term negative as we will grow into this production over time. The other item is our legacy hydrogel inventory, where we wrote off more than we planned. As our silicone hydrogel sales were very strong and we're forecasting that to continue. Our disbursements in Q2 we expect will negatively impact Q3 and Q4. Now, to be clear, we're not excluding these items from earnings, so they are negatively impacting our non-GAAP earnings per share. 
CooperVision, on a non-GAAP basis, reported gross margin of 62.8% versus 63.3% in Q2 of last year. The factors which impacted margin were the items I just mentioned. CooperSurgical had non-GAAP gross margin of 64.8%, which compares to Q2 '15 of 63.5%. Strength in the OB/GYN and IBF product families drove this gross margin. 
SG&A. On a non-GAAP basis, SG&A increased approximately 6% to $171.6 million or 35% of revenue, down from approximately 37% of revenue the prior year. Primary driver behind this leverage was strong SG&A controls. Now, looking at R&D. In Q2, R&D on a non-GAAP basis was $16.6 million or 3.4% of revenue, flat in dollars and down from 3.8% of revenue in the prior year. We're seeing investments in CSI offset by synergies from the Sauflon acquisition and CVI. 
Now moving to operating margins. For Q2, consolidated GAAP operating income and margin were $89.8 million and 18.6% of revenue versus $71 million and 16.3% of revenue in Q2 last year. Non-GAAP operating income and margin were $117.6 million and 24.3% of revenue versus $96.7 million and 22.2% of revenue for the prior year. Primarily difference in operating margin year-over-year is the operating expense leverage. In Q2, CooperVision, on a non-GAAP operating income and margin were $102.4 million and 26.2% of revenue versus $88.8 million and 24.7% of revenue in the prior year. CooperSurgical's non-GAAP operating income and margin were $26.6 million and 28.8% of revenue versus Q2 '15 of $18.8 million of operating income and 25% of revenue. 
Moving on to depreciation and amortization. In Q2, depreciation was $33.7 million, up $1.5 million year-over-year. Amortization was $14.3 million, up $2 million, reflecting our recent acquisition activity. Interest expense of $7.6 million for the quarter, up $2.9 million year-over-year, primarily due to higher debt and interest rate associated with acquisitions. Looking at the effective tax rate. In Q2, the non-GAAP effective tax rate was 9.4% versus a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 8.4% in Q2 '15. 
Earnings per share. And our Q2 earnings per share on GAAP and non-GAAP basis was $1.52 and $2.05, respectively versus $1.23 and $1.72 for GAAP and non-GAAP in the prior year. Non-GAAP earnings per share on a pro forma basis, which adjust for currency and acquisitions, were approximately 13% in the quarter. Now looking at FX. Net currency impact on earnings per share year-over-year for Q2 was a favorable $0.10. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. In Q2, we had cash provided by operations of $97.8 million less capital expenditures of $41.1 million, resulting in $56.7 million of free cash flow. Excluding integration costs of $9 million, adjusted free cash flow was $65.7 million. Total debt increase within the quarter by $64.1 million to $1, 441, 400,000, primarily due to higher average cash balances and acquisitions, partially offset by operational cash flow. Inventories increased from last quarter, approximately $2.7 million, to $433.6 million. This is entirely driven by CSI acquisitions. In CooperVision, we saw inventories declined as growth in silicone daily inventory to support our product launches was offset by a reduction in our hydrogel inventory. For the quarter, we're seeing months on hand at 7 months. Day sales outstanding is at 54 days, which is down 3 days from the prior quarter and 2 days from last year. 
Now turning to guidance. For our main currencies, we are using 1.10 for the euro, 112 for the yen and 1.46 for the pound. The consolidated revenue range is being raised to $1.929 billion to $1.960 billion or approximately 5.5% to 7% pro forma growth. CooperVision's revenue range is being raised to $1.545 billion to $1.567 billion or roughly 5.5% to 7% constant currency growth. CooperSurgical's revenue range is being raised to $384 million to $393 million or roughly 68% pro forma growth. Note that roughly half of the increase in guidance is from currency, while the other half is primarily from acquisitions. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be around 63% for the year. This is a reduction from the previous guidance of around 64% as it incorporates the CooperVision items I mentioned earlier, along with lower gross margins from CooperSurgical, associated with recent acquisitions. Having said that, we still expect improving Q3 and Q4 gross margins around 64% each quarter. OpEx expected to be around 39%. Operating margins still expected to be around 24%. Interest expense is expected to be around $28 million. Our effective tax rate is expected to be around 8%. Our expected share count will be around 49.1 million shares and our non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to be $0.20 higher on the top and bottom of our range to $8.20 to $8.50, which equates to a pro forma earnings per share of 10% to 14% growth. From our last guidance, currency is roughly a $0.40 positive and we have actually improved our operational performance by roughly $0.10, but we are expecting the idle legacy inventory write-offs to negatively impact us by roughly $0.30. CapEx is expected to be around $200 million. We finished paying for equipment we have ordered over the prior year and those adjusted free cash flow is still expected to be around $300 million. With that, let me turn it back to Kim for the Q&A session."

So no one can say they can't do that again. Having said that, this is a product coming into the monthly modality. It is -- it's basically coming in with only a sphere not at toric and multifocal, so it's not a family of products going against a family of products. That is a big distinction as contrasted to the pipeline dragging everything in under 1 umbrella as they did their whole family of products and going after  a sphere going after a sphere. In that case, it was always the 1 Day going against Total1 primarily in that space but it consumed, it took all the air out of the practitioner's office, if you will or filled up all the space. And there clearly is no guarantee they would try flooding the market again. As far as the way we think about it longer-term, Biofinity's very established product wherein we continue to expand the offerings under that umbrella. It's a very global product and it's 1 where -- it's been in the monthly and we also have a Avaira Splash vitality coming out in the 2 week, which is the sweet spot of the market in terms of the number of wearers. There are more wearers in the 2 week part of the market than there are in the monthly. Quite frankly, as some of you know, I would always tell you to do that it's a good strategy for J&J, if they are intent on trading up and basically migrating the noncompliant wearer base they have in the 2 week space into a compliant monthly modality. That would be a good trade up in modalities because a noncompliant wearer is 1 who is basically only using 24 lenses a year compared to a monthly using 24 and conversely they're getting the price point of a 2 week wear and that's a pretty big part of that 2 week modality. So we think -- we'll continue to see that market grow the monthly and we'll get our fair share with Biofinity. in the meantime, we'll be more active down the road in the 2 week space and we'll basically neutralize it for the most part."

It's biggest market by far in terms of the 1 Day modality anyplace in the world and therefore, MyDay is a very good fit in a very good market and we think the combination of MyDay as a silicone hydrogel and Proclear 1 Day as a hydrogel is a good entree into that market. As Japan has been historically pretty lethargic the last -- I want to say, 7, 8 years, it's showing a little bit worldwide than it has and the only reason it's been lethargic is because it grew so rapidly in the prior decade compared to this decade. It got ahead of itself on the 1 Day modality became the first to adapt that because they were anti- lens care regimen and wanted the lenses to be boiled and therefore, everyone migrated into the 1 Day modality rather than boiling lenses everyday. So I'll just say that we're pretty excited about MyDay there. It's going to take some work. It's only a sphere thus far, so there will be other plans relative to leverage the MyDay experience."

I would have normally said, think of that as like a 75% mass market, 25% premium market. And I think that's the U.S. portion of the model. I think when you get into certain regions of the world, for example, Japan were only MyDay is playing, then -- so if you're factoring that into the overall global result, you'll end up with MyDay outgrowing because it's coming off of a lower base and it's just getting into Japan at least for the foreseeable future are growing as a percent, getting more of its share of the bucket, so it's instead of saying 75%, 25%, MyDay may move up that spectrum and get a higher portion in the interim. When clariti is available throughout Asia Pac and around the world, that may come back more into the mass market premium split. But for now, 1 point is we're not capacity constraint on either of these products. We will continue in the case of MyDay expanding the portfolio offering, so that will help. Right now, it's a sphere completing with clariti which has a sphere, multifocal and a toric and that will weigh wait more towards the clariti piece. Relative to margins, we will continue to focus from a pricing point of view being keenly aware of that two-tier market, the premium market which we'll call the players there in the U.S. clearly Total1, oasis and MyDay and TruEye is the 1 that's there on that space but oasis will consume more and more of TruEye. And in the mass market, then clariti remains the only game in town relative to silicone hydrogel in the 1 Day mass market. So that is a function of watching the migration of hydrogels into this silicone hydrogel space in that mass market arena. Cost of goods gross margins, we expect as we've indicated in the past to have our 1 Day silicone hydrogel franchise and most notably clariti not a drag on our overall gross margin for the next several years anyway, MyDay is ramping up the learning curve, moving very nicely and I would say, the indicator of some of the idling and the indicator of us having enough MyDay capacity is just how well that's ramping up. As it ramps up cost of goods come down to the yields and deficiencies, so we're very pleased with that, and we expect more than -- probably more than 50% out of MyDay as we get down the road a couple of years."

Relative to surgical and the 6% to 8%, a lot of that growth is a reflection of, #1, the emphasis on early selling the product and the global realignment with the selling effort. We have some -- obviously, even some good products in the surgical side that are driving organic growth there. The acquisitions we made are the expectation there keenly is double-digit in many of those acquisitions so we expect to drive a lot of the genetic testing and surround the IBF process so that we are the key player that the IBF centers are engaging with and we're pretty optimistic about that and obviously, the last 2 quarters have indicated it's a pretty successful strategy.

I think you've seen the overall silicone hydrogel 1 Day numbers were 52% growth. So suffice it to say that the enhancement, as well as -- of course, we had some activity in the fourth quarter regarding our integration process in Europe that caused some bumps then but suffice it to say we're running on all cylinders now with clariti in the marketplace and the enhancement is certainly been very beneficial in that process. As far as UPP and the markets, 3% growth in the market, is much as anything is probably much more influence by the J&J cycle that they put the market through with strong market 2 quarters ago and that's followed by basically a void in the U.S. in this quarter. So were not for that  it would be more normalized. The trailing four quarters is a much better gauge, that is approaching 5% worldwide relative to the U.S. and UPP and whether or not there's any pricing post-UPP or a decline in pricing, I would say that certainly, I know that some vendors may -- and retailers and they have also J&J prices but by and large of the market is continue to drive itself as in the past, pricing is not really a factor. It's all about trading up and shelf space and fit and it remains that way. The focus on getting a new fit in the marketplace where you have a new product trying to  get a conversion onto your product. There is a fair amount of stickiness to most of these products, so I would say the real driver of your product doing well is the new fit arena is the big contributor. Pricing, to me, this market is traded up for 30 years and it continues to do a phenomenal job and over that 30 years, there may be 1 or 2 price scrimmages. UPP was  a fairly shallow attempt at a marketing strategy that was obviously, beneficial to the independent compared to the retailers whether or not it's worth anything. Can it continue to be debated? There's obviously a lot of emotions on both sides of the table on that in the marketplace but if UPP went away tomorrow, it would not be the end of the world. If it stays where it is, it's okay also. So I don't see that as a material catalyst one way or the other in the marketplace."

First, I'm pleased to report strong financial results for our fiscal second quarter. On a consolidated basis, we reported $484 million in revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.05. 
Second, CooperVision posted 9% revenue growth on both a constant currency and as-reported basis and strong results in all key areas of the business. Since we used silicone hydrogel, lenses grew 52%, while 2-week and monthly silicone hydrogel lenses grew a combined 14% both in constant currency. 
Third, CooperSurgical had another strong quarter, posting revenue growth of 23% and pro forma growth of 6%. We also closed several strategic acquisitions since our last earnings call. 
Moving into the details, CooperVision reported second quarter revenues of $391 million, up 9%. This was our strongest quarter -- growth quarter since 2014 and really shows the strength of our product portfolio. Regarding revenue by geography, the Americas grew 9% in constant currency, showing a nice rebound from last quarter. Strength was seen in multiple categories led by silicone hydrogel products. Our enhanced clariti lens has been extremely well received and MyDay had another strong quarter. Our toric and multifocals also posted strong growth driven by the Biofinity family. 
EMEA had another strong quarter and sales grew 5% in constant currency. Growth was driven by our family of silicone hydrogel products, Biofinity, clariti, MyDay and Avaira. We also launched Avaira Vitality in EMEA during the quarter and it is being well received. Avaira Vitality is our new 2-week silicone hydrogel lens, which is an enhanced replacement for the original Avaira lens. It was developed using improved manufacturing processes, resulting in a higher quality product at a lower cost per unit. We expect to launch this lens in the U.S. later this year subject to FDA approval. 
Asia Pacific had a very strong quarter, up 18% in constant currency. Growth was strong throughout the region and Biofinity and Proclear 1 Day stood out in Japan. Also within Japan, we began our MyDay launch during the quarter and we're seeing early signs that MyDay could be a very successful premium offering in that market. 
Turning to our product categories. Toric and multifocals grew a healthy 13% year-over-year in constant currency. We saw a very nice rebound in the U.S., which bolstered our strength throughout the rest of the world. We remained the global leader in specialty lenses. 
Looking at silicone hydrogel lenses. These products grew 20% in constant currency and now represent 60% of our total sales. Within the 2-week and monthly space, Biofinity and Avaira combined to grow 14% in constant currency. We remain under index in the 2-week and monthly silicone hydrogel space at 74% of sales versus the market at 79%, so we anticipate a very nice growth for many years to come. 
Regarding our silicone hydrogel 1 Day lenses, clariti and MyDay, they combined to grow 52% in constant currency. We remain very optimistic about these products and are committed to our growth strategy, which includes a 2-tier approach with clariti positioned as the mass market offering and MyDay as the premium offering. Remember the biggest driver in the contact lens market is the 1 Day growth, and we strongly believe we have the best product offering in the space as the only company with premium and mass market lenses, including a full portfolio of 1 Day silicone hydrogel, sphere, toric and multifocal lenses. 
Before finishing with market data, let me make a quick comment on integration matters. We continue to finalize our Sauflon integration activities and we're very close to being done. You'll note that provision had a very small non-GAAP adjustment this quarter -- or a smaller non-GAAP adjustment this quarter of roughly $9 million excluding amortization. We forecast similar charges in Q3 and Q4, mostly within costs of goods, but these should end this fiscal year. 
Now let me comment on the overall contact lens market and remember, this information is on the last page of the earnings release. For calendar Q1, we continue taking share, growing 9%, with the market up 3%. Geographically, CooperVision grew 9% in the Americas while market was flat. In Asia Pacific, CooperVision grew 14%, with the market up 5%. And in EMEA, we grew 6%, in line with the market. 
On modality basis, single-use lenses continue driving growth and CVI -- with CVI up 14% and the market up 9%. For non-single-use lenses, we grew 6% while the market declined 1%. We also see -- as you can see, our growth remains diverse and strong. On a trailing 12 month basis, CooperVision grew 8% and the market grew 5%. Going forward, I expect the market to continue growing forward to 6% over the next 5 years and most likely closer to 6%. The drivers will continue to be a shift to dailies' geographic expansion and an expansion of the wear base. We expect to continue taking market share, led by our strong silicone hydrogel portfolio. 
Moving to CooperSurgical. We reported second quarter revenues of $93 million, up 23% year-over-year or up 6% pro forma. Our fertility products led the way up 60% or 8% pro forma and our office and surgical products grew 5%. We continued executing on several initiatives, which are driving success, including transitioning to a geographic sales model, adding sales representatives in under-penetrated areas and increasing our focus on high-growth areas such as IVF and genetic testing. These moves are clearly gaining traction as we saw growth throughout core business in Q2. Going forward, I believe we'll continue to see solid growth as the business keeps moving into a more aggressive and efficient business model. 
Regarding acquisitions. We've completed several over the past few months, so let me touch on those and the strategic rationale. At the beginning of April, we added Genesis Genetics, a genetic testing lab company focused on preimplantation genetic screening and diagnosis using -- used during the IVF process. This is a nice addition to our existing genetic testing platform. 
At the beginning of May, we added complementary IVF capital equipment products through the acquisition of K-Systems, a small acquisition with roughly $7 million in revenue per year. 
And finally, we added the assets of Recombine last week. Recombine is a genetic testing company specializing in carrier screening, which is a great fit within our IVF and genetic testing franchise as it adds the #1 carrier screening test sold to the IVF clinics. 
As you can see, we're very focused on combining a full-service provider within the IVF global market, and we truly believe this strategy will yield success for many years to come. These deals are all incorporated into our updated guidance. With that, let me touch on our guidance details. 
We are raising our fiscal 2016 revenue guidance for CooperVision to 5.5% to 7% constant currency growth. Our CooperSurgical revenue guidance is also raised to 6% to 8% pro forma growth or up 24% to 27% on an as-reported basis. We're also raising our non-GAAP EPS guidance to $8.20 to $8.50. 
In conclusion, I'm very pleased with our results and remain optimistic about the underlying fundamentals of our business. I believe we're well positioned to deliver solid results through the remainder of the fiscal year and beyond. With that, let me express my appreciation to our employees, our #1 asset. Their hard work and dedication to creating value is the backbone of our success. 
And now I'll turn it over to Greg to cover the financial results."
263609,334265350,995004,"The Cooper Companies Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jun 02, 2016",2016-06-02,"Earnings Calls","The Cooper Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll provide the overall summary of our performance, including a review of the market and our revenue picture. We're going to focus primarily on our non-GAAP results for the quarter. For the reconciliation to GAA",1144,"Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll provide the overall summary of our performance, including a review of the market and our revenue picture. We're going to focus primarily on our non-GAAP results for the quarter. For the reconciliation to GAAP numbers, please refer to our earnings release. 
Looking at gross margins. In Q2, the non-GAAP gross margin was 63.2% compared to 63.4% in the prior year. Although CooperVision had positives from currency and strong Biofinity sales, its margin was lower than expected. The primary items driving this were a negative margin impact from stronger Asia Pac sales, where we have higher 1 Day sales, and charges associated with idle equipment and legacy hydrogel inventory. 
Regarding these last 2 items, let me cover them separately. We have made a lot of progress improving our manufacturing operations, including some very recent successes. For competitive reasons, I won't get into specifics but our production per line has increased materially, resulting in lower cost per unit and a lesser need for future CapEx. This has resulted in idling from equipment, which hurts us in Q2 and will also negatively impact Q3 and Q4. We anticipate this being a short-term negative as we will grow into this production over time. 
The other item is our legacy hydrogel inventory, where we wrote off more than we planned, as our silicone hydrogel sales were very strong and we're forecasting that to continue. Disbursements in Q2 and we expect it will negatively impact Q3 and Q4. To be clear, we're not excluding these items from earnings, so they are negatively impacting our non-GAAP earnings per share. 
CooperVision on a non-GAAP basis reported gross margin of 62.8% versus 63.3% in Q2 of last year. The factors which impacted margin were the items I just mentioned. CooperSurgical had non-GAAP gross margin of 64.8%, which compares to Q2 '15 of 63.5%. Strength in the OB/GYN and IVF product families drove this quarter's margin. 
SG&A. On a non-GAAP basis, SG&A increased approximately 6% to $171.6 million or 35% of revenue, down from approximately 37% of revenue in the prior year. Primary driver behind this leverage was strong SG&A controls. 
Now looking at R&D. In Q2, R&D on a non-GAAP basis was $16.6 million or 3.4% of revenue, flat in dollars and down from 3.8% of revenue in the prior year. We're seeing investments in CSI, offset by synergies from the Sauflon acquisition in CVI. 
Now moving to operating margins. For Q2, consolidated GAAP operating income and margin were $89.8 million and 18.6% of revenue versus $71 million and 16.3% of revenue in Q2 last year. Non-GAAP operating income and margin were $117.6 million and 24.3% of revenue versus $96.7 million and 22.2% of revenue for the prior year. Primary difference in operating margin year-over-year is the operating expense leverage. 
In Q2, CooperVision, on a non-GAAP operating income and margin, were $102.4 million and 26.2% of revenue versus $88.8 million and 24.7% of revenue in the prior year. 
CooperSurgical's non-GAAP operating income and margin were $26.6 million and 28.8% of revenue versus Q2 '15 of $18.8 million of operating income and 25% of revenue. 
Moving on to depreciation and amortization. In Q2, depreciation was $33.7 million, up $1.5 million year-over-year. Amortization was $14.3 million, up $2 million, reflecting our recent acquisition activity. 
Interest expense was $7.6 million for the quarter, up $2.9 million year-over-year, primarily due to higher debt and interest rate associated with acquisitions. Looking at the effective tax rate. In Q2, the non-GAAP effective tax rate was 9.4% versus a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 8.4% in Q2 '15. 
Earnings per share. Our Q2 earnings per share on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis was $1.52 and $2.05, respectively versus $1.23 and $1.72 for GAAP and non-GAAP in the prior year. Non-GAAP earnings per share on a pro forma basis, which adjust for currency and acquisitions, were approximately 13% in the quarter. 
Now looking at FX. The net currency impact on earnings per share year-over-year for Q2 was a favorable $0.10. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. In Q2, we had cash provided by operations of $97.8 million less capital expenditures of $41.1 million, resulting in $56.7 million of free cash flow. Excluding integration costs of $9 million, adjusted free cash flow was $65.7 million. 
Total debt increase within the quarter by $64.1 million to $1,441,400,000, primarily due to higher average cash balances and acquisitions, partially offset by operational cash flow. 
Inventories increased from last quarter, approximately $2.7 million, to $433.6 million. This is entirely driven by CSI acquisitions. In CooperVision, we saw inventories decline as growth in silicone daily inventory to support our product launches was offset by a reduction in our hydrogel inventory. For the quarter, we're seeing months on hand at 7 months. Day sales outstanding is at 54 days, which is down 3 days from the prior quarter and 2 days from last year. 
Now turning to guidance. For our main currencies, we are using 1.10 for the euro, 112 for the yen and 1.46 for the pound. 
The consolidated revenue range is being raised to $1.929 billion to $1.960 billion or approximately 5.5% to 7% pro forma growth. CooperVision's revenue range is being raised to $1.545 billion to $1.567 billion or roughly 5.5% to 7% constant currency growth. CooperSurgical's revenue range is being raised to $384 million to $393 million or roughly 68% pro forma growth. Note that roughly half of the increase in guidance is from currency, while the other half is primarily from acquisitions. 
We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be around 63% for the year. This is a reduction from the previous guidance of around 64% as it incorporates the CooperVision items I mentioned earlier, along with lower gross margins from CooperSurgical, associated with recent acquisitions. Having said that, we still expect improving Q3 and Q4 gross margins around 64% each quarter. 
OpEx expected to be around 39%. Operating margins still expected to be around 24%. 
Interest expense is expected to be around $28 million. 
Our effective tax rate is expected to be around 8%. 
Our expected share count will be around 49.1 million shares. 
And our non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to be $0.20 higher on the top and bottom of our range to $8.20 to $8.50, which equates to a pro forma earnings per share of 10% to 14% growth. 
From our last guidance, currency is roughly a $0.40 positive, and we have actually improved our operational performance by roughly $0.10, but we are expecting the idle legacy inventory write-off to negatively impact us by roughly $0.30. 
CapEx is expected to be around $200 million. 
We finished paying for equipment we have ordered over the prior year, and thus, adjusted free cash flow is still expected to be around $300 million. 
With that, let me turn it back to Kim for the Q&A session."

And then, we sought in their negative U.S. results in the most recent quarter. So no one can say they can't do that again. Having said that, this is a product coming into the monthly modality. It's basically coming in with only a sphere, not at toric and a multifocal, so it's not a family of products going against a family of products. And that is a big distinction as contrasted to the pipeline dragging everything in under one umbrella, as they did their whole family of products, and going after a sphere going after a sphere. In that case, it was always the 1 Day going against Total1 primarily in that space. But it consumed -- it took all the air out of the practitioner's office, if you will, or filled up all the space. And there clearly is no guarantee they wouldn't try flooding the market again. As far as the way we think about it longer-term, Biofinity is a very established product, wherein we continue to expand the offerings under that umbrella. It's a very global product, and it's one where -- it's [indiscernible] in the monthly and we also have Avaira Splash Vitality [ph] coming out in the 2-week, which is the sweet spot of the market in terms of the number of wearers. There are more wearers in the 2-week part of the market than there are in the monthly. Quite frankly, as some of you know, I've always held the view that it's a good strategy for J&J if they're intent on trading up and basically migrating the noncompliant wearer base they have in the 2-week space into a compliant monthly modality. That would be a good trade-up in modalities because a noncompliant wearer is one who is basically only using 24 lenses a year compared to a monthly using 24 and conversely they're getting the price point of a 2-week wear. And that's a pretty big part of that 2-week modality. So we think -- yes, we'll continue to see that market grow, the monthly, and we'll get our fair share with Biofinity. In the meantime, we'll be more active down the road in the 2-week space, and we'll basically neutralize it for the most part."

As Japan has been historically pretty lethargic in the last -- I want to say, 7, 8 years. It's showing a little bit more life than it has. And the only reason it's been lethargic is because it grew so rapidly in the prior decade compared to this decade. It got ahead of itself on the 1 Day modality and became the first to adapt that because there were very anti-lens care regimens and wanted the lenses to be boiled, and therefore, everyone migrated into the 1 Day modality rather than boiling lenses every day. And I'll just say that we're pretty excited about MyDay there. It's going to take some work.

I would have normally said, think of that as like a 75% mass market, 25% premium market. And I think that's the U.S. portion of the model. I think when you get into certain regions of the world, for example, Japan, where only MyDay is playing, then -- so if you're factoring that into the overall global results, you'll end up with MyDay outgrowing because it's coming off of a lower base and it's just getting into Japan, at least for the foreseeable future, outgrowing as a percent, getting more of its share of the bucket. So it's instead of saying 75%-25%, MyDay may move up that spectrum and get a higher portion in the interim. When clariti is available throughout Asia Pac and around the world, that may come back more into the mass market premium split. But for now, one point is we're not capacity constrained on either of these products. We will continue, in the case of MyDay, expanding the portfolio offering, so that will help. Right now, it's a sphere competing with clariti, which has a sphere, a multifocal and a toric, and that will weigh more towards the clariti piece. Relative to margins, we will continue to focus -- from a pricing point of view, being keenly aware of that 2-tier market, the premium market, which we'll call the players there in the U.S., clearly Total1, OASYS and MyDay. And TruEye is the other one that's kind of there on that space, but OASYS will consume more and more of TruEye. And in the mass market, then clariti remains the only game in town relative to a silicone hydrogel in the 1 Day mass market. So that is a function of watching the migration of hydrogels into this silicone hydrogel space in that mass market arena. Cost of goods gross margins, we expect, as we've indicated in the past, to have our 1 Day silicone hydrogel franchise, and most notably clariti, not a drag on our overall gross margin for the next several years. Anyway, MyDay is ramping up the learning curve, moving very nicely. And I would say, the indicator of some of the idling and the indicator of us having enough MyDay capacity is just how well that's ramping up. As it ramps up, the cost of goods come down to the yields and deficiencies, so we're very pleased with that, and we expect more than -- currently more than 50% out of MyDay as we get down the road a couple of years."

It's very early in the game, so it didn't -- so the strength you're seeing there is just how well some of the geographic expansions are going, how well Japan is going ex MyDay, and then the MyDay launch. But it is not the driver of that 18%, which -- and MyDay was only launched mid-March, so really, it's only got 1.5 months in Japan in that period -- in the quarter. Relative to what to expect in that region, we certainly expect continued robust numbers out of Asia Pac for the foreseeable future. Number one, we're under-indexed. Number two, we're delivering a lot of these new products, clariti coming into the more and more of Asia Pac, and of course, MyDay, which we talked about. So we're pretty optimistic that we'll see a continued strength in that market. Relative to surgical and the 6% to 8%, a lot of that growth is a reflection of, number one, the emphasis on really selling the product and the global realignment with the selling effort. We have some -- obviously, even some good products in the surgical side that are driving organic growth there. The acquisitions we've made are -- the expectation there keenly is -- clearly is double-digit in many of those acquisitions, so we expect to drive a lot of the genetic testing and surround the IVF process so that we are the key player that the IVF centers are engaging with. And we're pretty optimistic about that, and obviously, the last 2 quarters have indicated it's a pretty successful strategy. I think going forward, the 6% to 8% reflects some of the more recent acquisitions having more organic top line growth potential than our historic legacy products within CooperSurgical."

The product relative to the enhancement that we made to clariti, I think you've seen the overall silicone hydrogel 1 Day numbers were 52% growth. So suffice it to say that the enhancement as well as -- of course, we had some activity in the fourth quarter regarding our integration process in Europe that caused some bumps then. But suffice it to say we're running on all cylinders now with clariti in the marketplace and the enhancement is certainly been very beneficial in that process. As far as UPP and the market, 3% growth in the market. It's much -- if anything, it's probably much more influenced by the J&J cycle that they put the market through with a strong market 2 quarters ago, and that's followed by basically a void in the U.S. in this quarter. So were it not for that, it would be more normalized. The trailing four quarters is a much better gauge that is approaching 5% worldwide relative to the U.S. and UPP. And whether or not there's any pricing post-UPP or a decline in pricing, I would say that certainly, I know that some vendors may have -- or retailers may have altered J&J prices, but by and large, the market continues to drive itself with. As in the past, pricing is not really a factor. It's all about trading up and shelf space and first fits, and it remains that way. The focus on getting a new fit in the marketplace or where you have a new product, trying to get a conversion onto your product. There is a fair amount of stickiness to most of these products, so I would say the real driver of your product doing well, the new fit arena is the big contributor. Pricing, to me, this market has traded up for 30 years and it continues to do a phenomenal job. And over that 30 years, there has been but maybe 1 or 2 price scrimmages. UPP was a fairly shallow attempt at a marketing strategy that was obviously, beneficial to the independents compared to the retailers. Whether or not it was worth anything, it continued to be debated. There's obviously a lot of emotions on both sides of the table on that in the marketplace. But if UPP went away tomorrow, it would not be the end of the world. If it stays where it is, it's okay also. So I don't see that as a material catalyst one way or the other in the marketplace."

First, I'm pleased to report strong financial results for our fiscal second quarter. On a consolidated basis, we reported $484 million in revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.05. 
Second, CooperVision posted 9% revenue growth on both a constant currency and as-reported basis and strong results in all key areas of the business. Single-use silicone hydrogel lenses grew 52%, while 2-week and monthly silicone hydrogel lenses grew a combined 14%, both in constant currency. 
Third, CooperSurgical had another strong quarter, posting revenue growth of 23% and pro forma growth of 6%. We also closed several strategic acquisitions since our last earnings call. 
Moving into the details, CooperVision reported second quarter revenues of $391 million, up 9%. This was our strongest quarter -- growth quarter since 2014 and really shows the strength of our product portfolio. Regarding revenue by geography, the Americas grew 9% in constant currency, showing a nice rebound from last quarter. Strength was seen in multiple categories led by silicone hydrogel products. Our enhanced clariti lens has been extremely well received and MyDay had another strong quarter. Our toric and multifocals also posted strong growth driven by the Biofinity family. 
EMEA had another strong quarter and sales grew 5% in constant currency. Growth was driven by our family of silicone hydrogel products, Biofinity, clariti, MyDay and Avaira. We also launched Avaira Vitality in EMEA during the quarter and it is being well received. Avaira Vitality is our new 2-week silicone hydrogel lens, which is an enhanced replacement for the original Avaira lens. It was developed using improved manufacturing processes, resulting in a higher quality product at a lower cost per unit. We expect to launch this lens in the U.S. later this year subject to FDA approval. 
Asia Pacific had a very strong quarter, up 18% in constant currency. Growth was strong throughout the region and Biofinity and Proclear 1 Day stood out in Japan. Also within Japan, we began our MyDay launch during the quarter and we're seeing early signs that MyDay could be a very successful premium offering in that market. 
Turning to our product categories. Toric and multifocals grew a healthy 13% year-over-year in constant currency. We saw a very nice rebound in the U.S., which bolstered our strength throughout the rest of the world. We remained the global leader in specialty lenses. 
Looking at silicone hydrogel lenses. These products grew 20% in constant currency and now represent 60% of our total sales. Within the 2-week and monthly space, Biofinity and Avaira combined to grow 14% in constant currency. We remain under indexed in the 2-week and monthly silicone hydrogel space at 74% of sales versus the market at 79%, so we anticipate a very nice growth for many years to come. 
Regarding our silicone hydrogel 1 Day lenses, clariti and MyDay, they combined to grow 52% in constant currency. We remain very optimistic about these products and are committed to our growth strategy, which includes a 2-tier approach with clariti positioned as the mass market offering and MyDay as the premium offering. Remember the biggest driver in the contact lens market is the 1 Day growth, and we strongly believe we have the best product offering in the space as the only company with premium and mass market lenses, including a full portfolio of 1 Day silicone hydrogel, sphere, toric and multifocal lenses. 
Before finishing with market data, let me make a quick comment on integration matters. We continue to finalize our Sauflon integration activities and we're very close to being done. You'll note CooperVision had a very small non-GAAP adjustment this quarter -- or a smaller non-GAAP adjustment this quarter of roughly $9 million excluding amortization. We forecast similar charges in Q3 and Q4, mostly within cost of goods, but these should end this fiscal year. 
Now let me comment on the overall contact lens market and remember, this information is on the last page of the earnings release. For calendar Q1, we continue taking share, growing 9%, with the market up 3%. Geographically, CooperVision grew 9% in the Americas while market was flat. In Asia Pacific, CooperVision grew 14%, with the market up 5%. And in EMEA, we grew 6%, in line with the market. 
On a modality basis, single-use lenses continue driving growth and CVI -- with CVI up 14% and the market up 9%. For non-single-use lenses, we grew 6% while the market declined 1%. We also see -- as you can see, our growth remains diverse and strong. On a trailing 12-month basis, CooperVision grew 8% and the market grew 5%. Going forward, I expect the market to continue growing 4% to 6% over the next 5 years and most likely closer to 6%. The drivers will continue to be a shift to dailies' geographic expansion and an expansion of the wear base. We expect to continue taking market share, led by our strong silicone hydrogel portfolio. 
Moving to CooperSurgical. We reported second quarter revenues of $93 million, up 23% year-over-year or up 6% pro forma. Our fertility products led the way up 60% or 8% pro forma and our office and surgical products grew 5%. We continued executing on several initiatives, which are driving success, including transitioning to a geographic sales model, adding sales representatives in under-penetrated areas and increasing our focus on high-growth areas such as IVF and genetic testing. These moves are clearly gaining traction as we saw growth throughout our business in Q2. Going forward, I believe we'll continue to see solid growth as the business keeps moving into a more aggressive and efficient business model. 
Regarding acquisitions. We've completed several over the past few months, so let me touch on those and the strategic rationale. At the beginning of April, we added Genesis Genetics, a genetic testing lab company focused on preimplantation genetic screening and diagnosis using -- used during the IVF process. This is a nice addition to our existing genetic testing platform. 
At the beginning of May, we added complementary IVF capital equipment products through the acquisition of K-Systems, a small acquisition with roughly $7 million in revenue per year. 
And finally, we added the assets of Recombine last week. Recombine is a genetic testing company specializing in carrier screening, which is a great fit within our IVF and genetic testing franchise as it adds the #1 carrier screening test sold to the IVF clinics. 
As you can see, we're very focused on combining a full-service provider within the IVF global market, and we truly believe this strategy will yield success for many years to come. These deals are all incorporated into our updated guidance. With that, let me touch on our guidance details. 
We are raising our fiscal 2016 revenue guidance for CooperVision to 5.5% to 7% constant currency growth. Our CooperSurgical revenue guidance is also raised to 6% to 8% pro forma growth or up 24% to 27% on an as-reported basis. We're also raising our non-GAAP EPS guidance to $8.20 to $8.50. 
In conclusion, I'm very pleased with our results and remain optimistic about the underlying fundamentals of our business. I believe we're well-positioned to deliver solid results through the remainder of the fiscal year and beyond. With that, let me express my appreciation to our employees, our #1 asset. Their hard work and dedication to creating value is the backbone of our success. 
And now I'll turn it over to Greg to cover the financial results."

I'll provide the overall summary of our performance, including a review of the market and our revenue picture. We're going to focus primarily on our non-GAAP results for the quarter. For the reconciliation to GAA",1149,"Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll provide the overall summary of our performance, including a review of the market and our revenue picture. We're going to focus primarily on our non-GAAP results for the quarter. For the reconciliation to GAAP numbers, please refer to our earnings release. 
Looking at gross margins. In Q2, the non-GAAP gross margin was 63.2% compared to 63.4% in the prior year. Although CooperVision had positives from currency and strong Biofinity sales, its margin was lower than expected. The primary items driving this were a negative margin impact from stronger Asia Pac sales, where we have higher 1 Day sales, and charges associated with idle equipment and legacy hydrogel inventory. 
Regarding these last 2 items, let me cover them separately. We have made a lot of progress improving our manufacturing operations, including some very recent successes. For competitive reasons, I won't get into specifics, but our production per line has increased materially, resulting in lower cost per unit and a lesser need for future CapEx. This has resulted in idling from equipment, which hurts us in Q2 and will also negatively impact Q3 and Q4. We anticipate this being a short-term negative as we will grow into this production over time. 
The other item is our legacy hydrogel inventory, where we wrote off more than we planned, as our silicone hydrogel sales were very strong and we're forecasting that to continue. This hurts us in Q2 and we expect it will negatively impact Q3 and Q4. To be clear, we're not excluding these items from earnings, so they are negatively impacting our non-GAAP earnings per share. 
CooperVision on a non-GAAP basis reported gross margin of 62.8% versus 63.3% in Q2 of last year. The factors which impacted margin were the items I just mentioned. CooperSurgical had non-GAAP gross margin of 64.8%, which compares to Q2 '15 of 63.5%. Strength in the OB/GYN and IVF product families drove this quarter's margin. 
SG&A. On a non-GAAP basis, SG&A increased approximately 6% to $171.6 million or 35% of revenue, down from approximately 37% of revenue the prior year. Primary driver behind this leverage was strong SG&A controls. 
Now looking at R&D. In Q2, R&D on a non-GAAP basis was $16.6 million or 3.4% of revenue, flat in dollars and down from 3.8% of revenue in the prior year. We're seeing investment in CSI, offset by synergies from the Sauflon acquisition in CVI. 
Now moving to operating margins. For Q2, consolidated GAAP operating income and margin were $89.8 million and 18.6% of revenue versus $71 million and 16.3% of revenue in Q2 last year. Non-GAAP operating income and margin were $117.6 million and 24.3% of revenue versus $96.7 million and 22.2% of revenue for the prior year. Primary difference in operating margin year-over-year is the operating expense leverage. 
In Q2, CooperVision, on a non-GAAP operating income and margin, were $102.4 million and 26.2% of revenue versus $88.8 million and 24.7% of revenue in the prior year. 
CooperSurgical's non-GAAP operating income and margin were $26.6 million and 28.8% of revenue versus Q2 '15 of $18.8 million of operating income and 25% of revenue. 
Moving on to depreciation and amortization. In Q2, depreciation was $33.7 million, up $1.5 million year-over-year. Amortization was $14.3 million, up $2 million, reflecting our recent acquisition activity. 
Interest expense was $7.6 million for the quarter, up $2.9 million year-over-year, primarily due to higher debt and interest rates associated with acquisitions. Looking at the effective tax rate. In Q2, the non-GAAP effective tax rate was 9.4% versus a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 8.4% in Q2 '15. 
Earnings per share. Our Q2 earnings per share on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis was $1.52 and $2.05, respectively, versus $1.23 and $1.72 for GAAP and non-GAAP in the prior year. Non-GAAP earnings per share on a pro forma basis, which adjusts for currency and acquisitions, grew approximately 13% in the quarter. 
By looking at FX, the net currency impact on earnings per share year-over-year for Q2 was a favorable $0.10. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. In Q2, we had cash provided by operations of $97.8 million less capital expenditures of $41.1 million, resulting in $56.7 million of free cash flow. Excluding integration costs of $9 million, adjusted free cash flow was $65.7 million. 
Total debt increased within the quarter by $64.1 million to $1,441,400,000, primarily due to higher average cash balances and acquisitions, partially offset by operational cash flow. 
Inventories increased from last quarter, approximately $2.7 million, to $433.6 million. This is entirely driven by CSI acquisitions. In CooperVision, we saw inventories decline as growth in silicone daily inventory to support our product launches was offset by a reduction in our hydrogel inventory. For the quarter, we're seeing months on hand at 7 months. Days sales outstanding is at 54 days, which is down 3 days from the prior quarter and 2 days from last year. 
Now turning to guidance. For our main currencies, we are using 1.10 for the euro, 112 for the yen and 1.46 for the pound. 
The consolidated revenue range is being raised to $1.929 billion to $1.960 billion or approximately 5.5% to 7% pro forma growth. CooperVision's revenue range is being raised to $1.545 billion to $1.567 billion or roughly 5.5% to 7% constant currency growth. CooperSurgical's revenue range is being raised to $384 million to $393 million or roughly 6% to 8% pro forma growth. Note that roughly half of the increase in guidance is from currency, while the other half is primarily from acquisitions. 
We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be around 63% for the year. This is a reduction from the previous guidance of around 64% as it incorporates the CooperVision items I mentioned earlier, along with lower gross margins from CooperSurgical, associated with recent acquisitions. Having said that, we still expect improving Q3 and Q4 gross margins of around 64% each quarter. 
OpEx is expected to be around 39%. Operating margins still expected to be around 24%. 
Interest expense is expected to be around $28 million. 
Our effective tax rate is expected to be around 8%. 
Our expected share count will be around 49.1 million shares. 
And our non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to be $0.20 higher on the top and bottom of our range to $8.20 to $8.50, which equates to a pro forma earnings per share of 10% to 14% growth. 
From our last guidance, currency is roughly a $0.40 positive, and we have actually improved our operational performance by roughly $0.10, but we are expecting the idle legacy inventory write-off to negatively impact us by roughly $0.30. 
CapEx is expected to be around $200 million. 
We finished paying for equipment we have ordered over the prior year, and thus, adjusted free cash flow is still expected to be around $300 million. 
With that, let me turn it back to Kim for the Q&A session."

And then, we saw it in their negative U.S. results in the most recent quarter. So no one is going to say they can't do that again. Having said that, this is a product coming into the monthly modality. It's basically coming in with only a sphere, not a toric and a multifocal, so it's not a family of products going against a family of products. And that is a big distinction as contrasted to the pipeline dragging everything in under one umbrella, as they did their whole family of products, and going after a sphere going after a sphere. In that case, it was always the 1 Day going against Total1 primarily in that space. But it consumed -- it took all the air out of the practitioner's office, if you will, or filled up all the space. And there clearly is no guarantee they wouldn't try flooding the market again. As far as the way we think about it longer-term, Biofinity is a very established product, wherein we continue to expand the offerings under that umbrella. It's a very global product, and it's one where -- it's good in the monthly and we also have Avaira Splash Vitality [ph] coming out in the 2-week, which is the sweet spot of the market in terms of the number of wearers. There are more wearers in the 2-week part of the market than there are in the monthly. Quite frankly, as some of you know, I've always held the view that it's a good strategy for J&J if they're intent on trading up and basically migrating the noncompliant wearer base they have in the 2-week space into a compliant monthly modality. That would be a good trade-up in modalities because a noncompliant wearer is one who is basically only using 24 lenses a year compared to a monthly using 24 and conversely they're getting the price point of a 2-week wearer. And that's a pretty big part of that 2-week modality. So we think -- yes, we'll continue to see that market grow, the monthly, and we'll get our fair share with Biofinity. In the meantime, we'll be more active down the road in the 2-week space, and we'll basically neutralize it for the most part."

And we think the combination of MyDay as a silicone hydrogel and Proclear 1 Day as a hydrogel will be -- is a good entree into that market. As Japan has been historically pretty lethargic the last -- I want to say, 7, 8 years. It's showing a little bit more life than it has. And the only reason it's been lethargic is because it grew so rapidly in the prior decade compared to this decade. It got ahead of itself on the 1 Day modality and became the first to adopt that because they were very anti-lens care regimens and wanted the lenses to be boiled, and therefore, everyone migrated into the 1 Day modality rather than boiling lenses every day. And I'll just say that we're pretty excited about MyDay there. It's going to take some work. It's only a sphere thus far, so there will be other plans relative to how to leverage the MyDay experience."

I would have normally said, think of that as like a 75% mass market, 25% premium market. And I think that's the U.S. portion of the model. I think when you get into certain regions of the world, for example, Japan, where only MyDay is playing, then -- so if you're factoring that into the overall global results, you'll end up with MyDay outgrowing because it's coming off of a lower base and it's just getting into Japan, at least for the foreseeable future, outgrowing as a percent, getting more of its share of the bucket. So instead of saying 75%-25%, MyDay may move up that spectrum and get a higher portion in the interim. When clariti is available throughout Asia Pac and around the world, that may come back more into the mass market premium split. But for now, one point is we're not capacity constrained on either of these products. We will continue, in the case of MyDay, expanding the portfolio offering, so that will help. Right now, it's a sphere competing with clariti, which has a sphere, a multifocal and a toric, and that will weight more towards the clariti piece. Relative to margins, we will continue to focus in -- from a pricing point of view, being keenly aware of that 2-tier market, the premium market, which we'll call the players there in the U.S., clearly Total1, OASYS and MyDay. And TruEye is the other one that's kind of there in that space, but OASYS will consume more and more of TruEye. And in the mass market, then clariti remains the only game in town relative to a silicone hydrogel in the 1 Day mass market. So that is a function of watching the migration of hydrogels into this silicone hydrogel space in that mass market arena. Cost of goods gross margins, we expect, as we've indicated in the past, to have our 1 Day silicone hydrogel franchise, and most notably clariti, not a drag on our overall gross margin for the next several years. Anyway, MyDay is ramping up the learning curve, moving very nicely. And I would say, the indicator of some of the idling and the indicator of us having enough MyDay capacity is just how well that's ramping up. As it ramps up, the cost of goods come down to the yields and deficiencies, so we're very pleased with that, and we expect more than -- clearly more than 50% out of MyDay as we get down the road a couple of years."

It's very early in the game, so it didn't -- so the strength you're seeing there is just how well some of the geographic expansions are going, how well Japan is going ex MyDay, and then the MyDay launch. But it is not the driver of that 18%, which -- and MyDay was only launched mid-March, so really, it's only got 1.5 months in Japan in that period -- in the quarter. Relative to what to expect in that region, we certainly expect continued robust numbers out of Asia Pac for the foreseeable future. Number one, we're under-indexed. Number two, we're delivering a lot of these new products, clariti coming into more and more of Asia Pac, and of course, MyDay, which we talked about. So we're pretty optimistic that we'll see a continued strength in that market. Relative to surgical and the 6% to 8%, a lot of that growth is a reflection of, number one, the emphasis on really selling the product and the global realignment with the selling effort. We have some -- obviously, even some good products in the surgical side that are driving organic growth there. The acquisitions we've made are -- the expectation there keenly is -- clearly is double-digit in many of those acquisitions, so we expect to drive a lot of the genetic testing and surround the IVF process, so that we are the key player that the IVF centers are engaging with. And we're pretty optimistic about that, and obviously, the last 2 quarters have indicated it's a pretty successful strategy. I think going forward, the 6% to 8% reflects some of the more recent acquisitions having more organic top line growth potential than our historic legacy products within CooperSurgical."

So suffice it to say that the enhancement as well as -- of course, we had some activity in the fourth quarter regarding our integration process in Europe that caused some bumps then. But suffice it to say we're running on all cylinders now with clariti in the marketplace and the enhancement has certainly been very beneficial in that process. As far as UPP and the market, the 3% growth in the market, as much as anything, it's probably much more influenced by the J&J cycle stuff [ph] that they put the market through with a strong market 2 quarters ago, and that followed by basically a void in the U.S. in this quarter. So were it not for that, it would be more normalized. The trailing 4 quarters is a much better gauge that is approaching 5% worldwide relative to the U.S. and UPP. And whether or not there's any pricing post-UPP or a decline in pricing, I would say that certainly, I know that some vendors may have -- or retailers may have altered J&J prices, but by and large, the market continues to drive itself the way it has the past. Pricing is not really a factor. It's all about trading up and shelf space and first fits, and it remains that way. The focus on getting a new fit in the marketplace or where you have a new product, trying to get a conversion onto your product. There is a fair amount of stickiness to most of these products, so I would say the real driver of your product doing well is the new fit arena is the big contributor. Pricing, to me, this market has traded up for 30 years and it continues to do a phenomenal job. And over that 30 years, there has been but maybe 1 or 2 price skirmishes. UPP was a fairly shallow attempt at a marketing strategy that was, obviously, beneficial to the independents compared to the retailers. Whether or not it was worth anything, it continued to be debated. There's obviously a lot of emotions on both sides of the table on that in the marketplace. But if UPP went away tomorrow, it would not be the end of the world. If it stays where it is, it's okay also. So I don't see that as a material catalyst one way or the other in the marketplace."

First, I'm pleased to report strong financial results for our fiscal second quarter. On a consolidated basis, we reported $484 million in revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.05. 
Second, CooperVision posted 9% revenue growth on both a constant currency and as-reported basis and strong results in all key areas of the business. Single-use silicone hydrogel lenses grew 52%, while 2-week and monthly silicone hydrogel lenses grew a combined 14%, both in constant currency. 
Third, CooperSurgical had another strong quarter, posting revenue growth of 23% and pro forma growth of 6%. We also closed several strategic acquisitions since our last earnings call. 
Moving into the details, CooperVision reported second quarter revenues of $391 million, up 9%. This was our strongest quarter -- growth quarter since 2014 and really shows the strength of our product portfolio. Regarding revenue by geography, the Americas grew 9% in constant currency, showing a nice rebound from last quarter. Strength was seen in multiple categories led by silicone hydrogel products. Our enhanced clariti lens has been extremely well received and MyDay had another strong quarter. Our toric and multifocals also posted strong growth driven by the Biofinity family. 
EMEA had another strong quarter and sales grew 5% in constant currency. Growth was driven by our family of silicone hydrogel products, Biofinity, clariti, MyDay and Avaira. We also launched Avaira Vitality in EMEA during the quarter and it is being well received. Avaira Vitality is our new 2-week silicone hydrogel lens, which is an enhanced replacement for the original Avaira lens. It was developed using improved manufacturing processes, resulting in a higher quality product at a lower cost per unit. We expect to launch this lens in the U.S. later this year subject to FDA approval. 
Asia Pacific had a very strong quarter, up 18% in constant currency. Growth was strong throughout the region and Biofinity and Proclear 1 Day stood out in Japan. Also within Japan, we began our MyDay launch during the quarter and we're seeing early signs that MyDay could be a very successful premium offering in that market. 
Turning to our product categories. Toric and multifocals grew a healthy 13% year-over-year in constant currency. We saw a very nice rebound in the U.S., which bolstered our strength throughout the rest of the world. We remained the global leader in specialty lenses. 
Looking at silicone hydrogel lenses. These products grew 20% in constant currency and now represent 60% of our total sales. Within the 2-week and monthly space, Biofinity and Avaira combined to grow 14% in constant currency. We remain under indexed in the 2-week and monthly silicone hydrogel space at 74% of sales versus the market at 79%, so we anticipate a very nice growth for many years to come. 
Regarding our silicone hydrogel 1 Day lenses, clariti and MyDay, they combined to grow 52% in constant currency. We remain very optimistic about these products and are committed to our growth strategy, which includes a 2-tier approach with clariti positioned as the mass market offering and MyDay as the premium offering. Remember the biggest driver in the contact lens market is the 1 Day growth, and we strongly believe we have the best product offering in the space as the only company with premium and mass market lenses, including a full portfolio of 1 Day silicone hydrogel, sphere, toric and multifocal lenses. 
Before finishing with market data, let me make a quick comment on integration matters. We continue to finalize our Sauflon integration activities and we're very close to being done. You'll note CooperVision had a very small non-GAAP adjustment this quarter -- or a smaller non-GAAP adjustment this quarter of roughly $9 million excluding amortization. We forecast similar charges in Q3 and Q4, mostly within cost of goods, but these should end this fiscal year. 
Now let me comment on the overall contact lens market and remember, this information is on the last page of the earnings release. For calendar Q1, we continue taking share, growing 9%, with the market up 3%. Geographically, CooperVision grew 9% in the Americas while market was flat. In Asia Pacific, CooperVision grew 14%, with the market up 5%. And in EMEA, we grew 6%, in line with the market. 
On a modality basis, single-use lenses continue driving growth and CVI -- with CVI up 14% and the market up 9%. For non-single-use lenses, we grew 6% while the market declined 1%. We also see -- as you can see, our growth remains diverse and strong. On a trailing 12-month basis, CooperVision grew 8% and the market grew 5%. Going forward, I expect the market to continue growing 4% to 6% over the next 5 years and most likely closer to 6%. The drivers will continue to be a shift to dailies' geographic expansion and an expansion of the wear base. We expect to continue taking market share, led by our strong silicone hydrogel portfolio. 
Moving to CooperSurgical. We reported second quarter revenues of $93 million, up 23% year-over-year or up 6% pro forma. Our fertility products led the way up 60% or 8% pro forma and our office and surgical products grew 5%. We continued executing on several initiatives, which are driving success, including transitioning to a geographic sales model, adding sales representatives in under-penetrated areas and increasing our focus on high-growth areas such as IVF and genetic testing. These moves are clearly gaining traction as we saw growth throughout our business in Q2. Going forward, I believe we'll continue to see solid growth as the business keeps moving into a more aggressive and efficient business model. 
Regarding acquisitions. We've completed several over the past few months, so let me touch on those and the strategic rationale. At the beginning of April, we added Genesis Genetics, a genetic testing lab company focused on preimplantation genetic screening and diagnosis using -- used during the IVF process. This is a nice addition to our existing genetic testing platform. 
At the beginning of May, we added complementary IVF capital equipment products through the acquisition of K-Systems, a small acquisition with roughly $7 million in revenue per year. 
And finally, we added the assets of Recombine last week. Recombine is a genetic testing company specializing in carrier screening, which is a great fit within our IVF and genetic testing franchise as it adds the #1 carrier screening test sold to the IVF clinics. 
As you can see, we're very focused on combining a full-service provider within the IVF global market, and we truly believe this strategy will yield success for many years to come. These deals are all incorporated into our updated guidance. With that, let me touch on our guidance details. 
We are raising our fiscal 2016 revenue guidance for CooperVision to 5.5% to 7% constant currency growth. Our CooperSurgical revenue guidance is also raised to 6% to 8% pro forma growth or up 24% to 27% on an as-reported basis. We're also raising our non-GAAP EPS guidance to $8.20 to $8.50. 
In conclusion, I'm very pleased with our results and remain optimistic about the underlying fundamentals of our business. I believe we're well-positioned to deliver solid results through the remainder of the fiscal year and beyond. With that, let me express my appreciation to our employees, our #1 asset. Their hard work and dedication to creating value is the backbone of our success. 
And now I'll turn it over to Greg to cover the financial results."

I'll provide the overall summary of our performance, including a review of the market and our revenue picture. We're going to focus primarily on our non-GAAP results for the quarter. For the reconciliation to GAA",1149,"Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll provide the overall summary of our performance, including a review of the market and our revenue picture. We're going to focus primarily on our non-GAAP results for the quarter. For the reconciliation to GAAP numbers, please refer to our earnings release. 
Looking at gross margins. In Q2, the non-GAAP gross margin was 63.2% compared to 63.4% in the prior year. Although CooperVision had positives from currency and strong Biofinity sales, its margin was lower than expected. The primary items driving this were a negative margin impact from stronger Asia Pac sales, where we have higher 1 Day sales, and charges associated with idle equipment and legacy hydrogel inventory. 
Regarding these last 2 items, let me cover them separately. We have made a lot of progress improving our manufacturing operations, including some very recent successes. For competitive reasons, I won't get into specifics, but our production per line has increased materially, resulting in lower cost per unit and a lesser need for future CapEx. This has resulted in idling from equipment, which hurts us in Q2 and will also negatively impact Q3 and Q4. We anticipate this being a short-term negative as we will grow into this production over time. 
The other item is our legacy hydrogel inventory, where we wrote off more than we planned, as our silicone hydrogel sales were very strong and we're forecasting that to continue. This hurts us in Q2 and we expect it will negatively impact Q3 and Q4. To be clear, we're not excluding these items from earnings, so they are negatively impacting our non-GAAP earnings per share. 
CooperVision on a non-GAAP basis reported gross margin of 62.8% versus 63.3% in Q2 of last year. The factors which impacted margin were the items I just mentioned. CooperSurgical had non-GAAP gross margin of 64.8%, which compares to Q2 '15 of 63.5%. Strength in the OB/GYN and IVF product families drove this quarter's margin. 
SG&A. On a non-GAAP basis, SG&A increased approximately 6% to $171.6 million or 35% of revenue, down from approximately 37% of revenue the prior year. Primary driver behind this leverage was strong SG&A controls. 
Now looking at R&D. In Q2, R&D on a non-GAAP basis was $16.6 million or 3.4% of revenue, flat in dollars and down from 3.8% of revenue in the prior year. We're seeing investment in CSI, offset by synergies from the Sauflon acquisition in CVI. 
Now moving to operating margins. For Q2, consolidated GAAP operating income and margin were $89.8 million and 18.6% of revenue versus $71 million and 16.3% of revenue in Q2 last year. Non-GAAP operating income and margin were $117.6 million and 24.3% of revenue versus $96.7 million and 22.2% of revenue for the prior year. Primary difference in operating margin year-over-year is the operating expense leverage. 
In Q2, CooperVision, on a non-GAAP operating income and margin, were $102.4 million and 26.2% of revenue versus $88.8 million and 24.7% of revenue in the prior year. 
CooperSurgical's non-GAAP operating income and margin were $26.6 million and 28.8% of revenue versus Q2 '15 of $18.8 million of operating income and 25% of revenue. 
Moving on to depreciation and amortization. In Q2, depreciation was $33.7 million, up $1.5 million year-over-year. Amortization was $14.3 million, up $2 million, reflecting our recent acquisition activity. 
Interest expense was $7.6 million for the quarter, up $2.9 million year-over-year, primarily due to higher debt and interest rates associated with acquisitions. Looking at the effective tax rate. In Q2, the non-GAAP effective tax rate was 9.4% versus a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 8.4% in Q2 '15. 
Earnings per share. Our Q2 earnings per share on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis was $1.52 and $2.05, respectively, versus $1.23 and $1.72 for GAAP and non-GAAP in the prior year. Non-GAAP earnings per share on a pro forma basis, which adjusts for currency and acquisitions, grew approximately 13% in the quarter. 
By looking at FX, the net currency impact on earnings per share year-over-year for Q2 was a favorable $0.10. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. In Q2, we had cash provided by operations of $97.8 million less capital expenditures of $41.1 million, resulting in $56.7 million of free cash flow. Excluding integration costs of $9 million, adjusted free cash flow was $65.7 million. 
Total debt increased within the quarter by $64.1 million to $1,441,400,000, primarily due to higher average cash balances and acquisitions, partially offset by operational cash flow. 
Inventories increased from last quarter, approximately $2.7 million, to $433.6 million. This is entirely driven by CSI acquisitions. In CooperVision, we saw inventories decline as growth in silicone daily inventory to support our product launches was offset by a reduction in our hydrogel inventory. For the quarter, we're seeing months on hand at 7 months. Days sales outstanding is at 54 days, which is down 3 days from the prior quarter and 2 days from last year. 
Now turning to guidance. For our main currencies, we are using 1.10 for the euro, 112 for the yen and 1.46 for the pound. 
The consolidated revenue range is being raised to $1.929 billion to $1.960 billion or approximately 5.5% to 7% pro forma growth. CooperVision's revenue range is being raised to $1.545 billion to $1.567 billion or roughly 5.5% to 7% constant currency growth. CooperSurgical's revenue range is being raised to $384 million to $393 million or roughly 6% to 8% pro forma growth. Note that roughly half of the increase in guidance is from currency, while the other half is primarily from acquisitions. 
We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be around 63% for the year. This is a reduction from the previous guidance of around 64% as it incorporates the CooperVision items I mentioned earlier, along with lower gross margins from CooperSurgical, associated with recent acquisitions. Having said that, we still expect improving Q3 and Q4 gross margins of around 64% each quarter. 
OpEx is expected to be around 39%. Operating margins still expected to be around 24%. 
Interest expense is expected to be around $28 million. 
Our effective tax rate is expected to be around 8%. 
Our expected share count will be around 49.1 million shares. 
And our non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to be $0.20 higher on the top and bottom of our range to $8.20 to $8.50, which equates to a pro forma earnings per share of 10% to 14% growth. 
From our last guidance, currency is roughly a $0.40 positive, and we have actually improved our operational performance by roughly $0.10, but we are expecting the idle legacy inventory write-off to negatively impact us by roughly $0.30. 
CapEx is expected to be around $200 million. 
We finished paying for equipment we have ordered over the prior year, and thus, adjusted free cash flow is still expected to be around $300 million. 
With that, let me turn it back to Kim for the Q&A session."

And then, we saw it in their negative U.S. results in the most recent quarter. So no one is going to say they can't do that again. Having said that, this is a product coming into the monthly modality. It's basically coming in with only a sphere, not a toric and a multifocal, so it's not a family of products going against a family of products. And that is a big distinction as contrasted to the pipeline dragging everything in under one umbrella, as they did their whole family of products, and going after a sphere going after a sphere. In that case, it was always the 1 Day going against Total1 primarily in that space. But it consumed -- it took all the air out of the practitioner's office, if you will, or filled up all the space. And there clearly is no guarantee they wouldn't try flooding the market again. As far as the way we think about it longer-term, Biofinity is a very established product, wherein we continue to expand the offerings under that umbrella. It's a very global product, and it's one where -- it's good in the monthly and we also have Avaira Splash Vitality [ph] coming out in the 2-week, which is the sweet spot of the market in terms of the number of wearers. There are more wearers in the 2-week part of the market than there are in the monthly. Quite frankly, as some of you know, I've always held the view that it's a good strategy for J&J if they're intent on trading up and basically migrating the noncompliant wearer base they have in the 2-week space into a compliant monthly modality. That would be a good trade-up in modalities because a noncompliant wearer is one who is basically only using 24 lenses a year compared to a monthly using 24 and conversely they're getting the price point of a 2-week wearer. And that's a pretty big part of that 2-week modality. So we think -- yes, we'll continue to see that market grow, the monthly, and we'll get our fair share with Biofinity. In the meantime, we'll be more active down the road in the 2-week space, and we'll basically neutralize it for the most part."

And we think the combination of MyDay as a silicone hydrogel and Proclear 1 Day as a hydrogel will be -- is a good entree into that market. As Japan has been historically pretty lethargic the last -- I want to say, 7, 8 years. It's showing a little bit more life than it has. And the only reason it's been lethargic is because it grew so rapidly in the prior decade compared to this decade. It got ahead of itself on the 1 Day modality and became the first to adopt that because they were very anti-lens care regimens and wanted the lenses to be boiled, and therefore, everyone migrated into the 1 Day modality rather than boiling lenses every day. And I'll just say that we're pretty excited about MyDay there. It's going to take some work. It's only a sphere thus far, so there will be other plans relative to how to leverage the MyDay experience."

I would have normally said, think of that as like a 75% mass market, 25% premium market. And I think that's the U.S. portion of the model. I think when you get into certain regions of the world, for example, Japan, where only MyDay is playing, then -- so if you're factoring that into the overall global results, you'll end up with MyDay outgrowing because it's coming off of a lower base and it's just getting into Japan, at least for the foreseeable future, outgrowing as a percent, getting more of its share of the bucket. So instead of saying 75%-25%, MyDay may move up that spectrum and get a higher portion in the interim. When clariti is available throughout Asia Pac and around the world, that may come back more into the mass market premium split. But for now, one point is we're not capacity constrained on either of these products. We will continue, in the case of MyDay, expanding the portfolio offering, so that will help. Right now, it's a sphere competing with clariti, which has a sphere, a multifocal and a toric, and that will weight more towards the clariti piece. Relative to margins, we will continue to focus in -- from a pricing point of view, being keenly aware of that 2-tier market, the premium market, which we'll call the players there in the U.S., clearly Total1, OASYS and MyDay. And TruEye is the other one that's kind of there in that space, but OASYS will consume more and more of TruEye. And in the mass market, then clariti remains the only game in town relative to a silicone hydrogel in the 1 Day mass market. So that is a function of watching the migration of hydrogels into this silicone hydrogel space in that mass market arena. Cost of goods gross margins, we expect, as we've indicated in the past, to have our 1 Day silicone hydrogel franchise, and most notably clariti, not a drag on our overall gross margin for the next several years. Anyway, MyDay is ramping up the learning curve, moving very nicely. And I would say, the indicator of some of the idling and the indicator of us having enough MyDay capacity is just how well that's ramping up. As it ramps up, the cost of goods come down to the yields and deficiencies, so we're very pleased with that, and we expect more than -- clearly more than 50% out of MyDay as we get down the road a couple of years."

But it is not the driver of that 18%, which -- and MyDay was only launched mid-March, so really, it's only got 1.5 months in Japan in that period -- in the quarter. Relative to what to expect in that region, we certainly expect continued robust numbers out of Asia Pac for the foreseeable future. Number one, we're under-indexed. Number two, we're delivering a lot of these new products, clariti coming into more and more of Asia Pac, and of course, MyDay, which we talked about. So we're pretty optimistic that we'll see a continued strength in that market. Relative to surgical and the 6% to 8%, a lot of that growth is a reflection of, number one, the emphasis on really selling the product and the global realignment with the selling effort. We have some -- obviously, even some good products in the surgical side that are driving organic growth there. The acquisitions we've made are -- the expectation there keenly is -- clearly is double-digit in many of those acquisitions, so we expect to drive a lot of the genetic testing and surround the IVF process, so that we are the key player that the IVF centers are engaging with. And we're pretty optimistic about that, and obviously, the last 2 quarters have indicated it's a pretty successful strategy. I think going forward, the 6% to 8% reflects some of the more recent acquisitions having more organic top line growth potential than our historic legacy products within CooperSurgical."

So the U.S. market growth in the quarter was probably the lowest in a while, I believe, and I was just wondering whether or not this was a result of some pricing war that's going on within the market and just your general thoughts around the UPP and how you think that might benefit you moving forward."

The product relative to the enhancement that we made to clariti, I think you've seen the overall silicone hydrogel 1 Day numbers were 52% growth. So suffice it to say that the enhancement as well as -- of course, we had some activity in the fourth quarter regarding our integration process in Europe that caused some bumps then. But suffice it to say we're running on all cylinders now with clariti in the marketplace and the enhancement has certainly been very beneficial in that process. As far as UPP and the market, the 3% growth in the market, as much as anything, it's probably much more influenced by the J&J cycle stuff [ph] that they put the market through with a strong market 2 quarters ago, and that followed by basically a void in the U.S. in this quarter. So were it not for that, it would be more normalized. The trailing 4 quarters is a much better gauge that is approaching 5% worldwide relative to the U.S. and UPP. And whether or not there's any pricing post-UPP or a decline in pricing, I would say that certainly, I know that some vendors may have -- or retailers may have altered J&J prices, but by and large, the market continues to drive itself the way it has the past. Pricing is not really a factor. It's all about trading up and shelf space and first fits, and it remains that way. The focus on getting a new fit in the marketplace or where you have a new product, trying to get a conversion onto your product. There is a fair amount of stickiness to most of these products, so I would say the real driver of your product doing well is the new fit arena is the big contributor. Pricing, to me, this market has traded up for 30 years and it continues to do a phenomenal job. And over that 30 years, there has been but maybe 1 or 2 price skirmishes. UPP was a fairly shallow attempt at a marketing strategy that was, obviously, beneficial to the independents compared to the retailers. Whether or not it was worth anything, it continued to be debated. There's obviously a lot of emotions on both sides of the table on that in the marketplace. But if UPP went away tomorrow, it would not be the end of the world. If it stays where it is, it's okay also. So I don't see that as a material catalyst one way or the other in the marketplace."

Welcome to our third quarter 2016 conference call. Let me start by highlighting 3 key points.

Welcome to our third quarter 2016 conference call. Let me start by highlighting 3 key points. First, I'm pleased to report another strong quarter including the first-ever quarter with revenues over $500 million. This includes the CooperVision recording revenues over $400 million for the first time and CooperSurgical recording revenues over $100 million for the first time. This resulted in non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.30 and free cash flow of $98 million. 
Second, CooperVision posted strong results in all key areas of its business, resulting in 6% as recorded in cost of currency growth, single-use silicone hydrogel grew 40% while 2 week and monthly silicone hydrogel lenses grew a combined 11% both in constant currency. 
Third, CooperSurgical had another strong quarter posting revenue growth of 38% or 6% pro forma. Fertility was the highlight posting the strongest quarter in many years with growth of 108% or 10% pro forma. 
Moving into details, CooperVision reported second quarter revenues of $410 million, up 6%. This was another strong quarter and continue to show the strength of our product portfolio. The Americas grew 6% in constant currency with strength in multiple category led by Biofinity and our 1 Day silicone hydrogel franchise. Our enhanced clariti lens continues to perform well and MyDay had another strong quarter. During the quarter, we received FDA approval for Vera Vitality and launch in the U.S. in late July. You'll recall, Vera Vitality is the replacement product for Avaira in the two-week silicone hydrogel market. The market reaction has been positive. We remain optimistic about this upgraded product. We also introduced Biofinity at the American Optimistic Conference in July and again, the launch is August. This premium Biofinity product has received excellent reviews and we're confident we will have great success in its offering. 
EMEA posted a solid quarter from 3% year-over-year in constant currency against the tough comp. Growth was driven by Biofinity and the 1 Day silicone hydrogel franchise. Asia Pacific had a very strong quarter with 16% constant currency growth. Growth was strong throughout the region driven by Biofinity and the 1 Day silicone hydrogel franchise. Within Japan, our MyDay launch is progressing well and we introduced MyDay toric during the quarter. We believe both MyDay Sear and toric have a potential to be a very successful premium offering in this market. 
Turning to our product categories. toric screw a healthy  10% year-over-year and multifocal grew 5%, both in constant currency. We remained the global leader in specialty lenses and our success with Biofinity and clariti in both of these categories should continue to drive growth for many years. 
Looking at silicone hydrogel lenses, this product grew 16% in constant currency and now represents 61% of our total sales. The ended 2 week and monthly space, Biofinity and Avaira combined to grow 11% in constant currency. We remain under index for the two-week and monthly silicone hydrogel space at 75% of revenue versus the market at 79%, so we expect to continue growing faster than the market given our strong product portfolio. 
Regarding our silicone hydrogel 1 Day lenses, clariti and MyDay, they combined to grow 40% in constant currency. The biggest driver in our contact lens market is 1 Day growth and we strongly believe we have the best product portfolio offering in this space as the only company with premium and mass market lenses including a full portfolio of 1 Day, silicone hydrogel, sear, toric and multifocal lenses. Now let me comment on the overall contact lens market and remember, this information is on the last page of the earnings release. For the calendar quarter Q2, we continue taking share growth 10% with a market of 5%. Geographically, CooperVision grew 8% in the Americas while the market was up 4%. In Asian-Pacific, we grew 20% with the market up 4% and in EMEA, we grew 9% with the market up 7%. On a modality basis, single used lenses continue driving growth with CooperVision up 18% and the market up 10%. For non-silicone hydrogel, for non single-use lenses, we grew 7% while the market grew 1%. As you can see our growth remains diverse and strong. On a trailing 12 month basis, CooperVision grew 8% and the market grew 5%. Going forward, I expect market to continue growing 4% to 6% over the next 5 years and most likely closer to 6%. The drivers will continue to be the shift to daily geographic expansion and expansion of the wearer base. We expect to continue taking market share led by our strong silicone hydrogel portfolio. 
Moving to CooperSurgical, we recorded Q2 revenues of $105 million, up 38% year-over-year, driven by strong organic growth and acquisitions. On a pro forma basis, growth was up 6%. Our fertility products led up 108% or 10% pro forma. Within fertility, we had growth throughout the business and continue to believe our market leading product portfolio, which includes medical devices, genetic testing and capital equipment is the broadest portfolio in the space and should continue to drive growth for many years to come. Within our office and surgical category are moderated a slightly from the last quarters, up 3%. We're continuing to execute on several product launches including our disposable EndoSee and we believe we will -- we're well-positioned in this segment going forward. Regarding acquisitions, we've been actively working on integrating the deals we've done over the past year and the rationale behind these deals remains intact. We are very focused on becoming a full-service provider within the global IDF space. 
Finally, on CooperSurgical, we're continuing to execute on several initiatives which should significantly strengthen the business and pay dividends for many years to come. These include: transitioning to a geographic sales model, adding sales reps in under-penetrated areas, launching products in new markets and increasing our focus on high growth areas such as IDF genetic testing. To some degree, these investments are masking our strong underlying operating performance but it's critical that we lay the groundwork to support the business on a long term growth perspective. 
Now turning to guidance. I'll let Greg go through the details but let me touch on a few items. For Q4, we're guiding CooperVision to roughly 5% to 7.5% constant currency growth and CooperSurgical, roughly 5% to 8% pro forma growth. So similar growth to Q3. Regarding non-GAAP earnings per share for Q4, we're guiding to $2.15 to $2.30. Regarding fiscal 2017, it's too early to provide financial guidance but I will say it should be a strong year given the momentum in our 2 businesses as well as recent currency moves. From a longer-term perspective, we're still targeting operating margins of 27% or higher in 2020. 
In conclusion, I want to express my appreciation to our employees for all their hard work and dedication. I also want to say a special thank you to Greg Matz, who has announced his planned retirement after more than 6 years of service to our company including roughly the last 5 years as our CFO. Greg will be greatly missed and we wish him the best in his future endeavors. With Greg's departure, we have announced that Al White, who many of you know really well will succeed Greg as CFO. Al will assume this role in addition to his current leadership responsibilities with CooperSurgical. I'm very confident that his leadership and abilities will allow us to continue driving long-term shareholder value. From a timing perspective, Greg will remain CFO until the end of fiscal year, and then Al will take over the position. Greg will remain with us through March of next year to ensure a smooth transition. And now, I'll turn it over to Greg to cover our financial results."

For the reconciliation to GAAP numbe",1171,"Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Bob provided overall summary of our performance including a review of the market and our revenue picture. I'm going to focus primarily on our non-GAAP results for the quarter. For the reconciliation to GAAP numbers, please refer to our earnings release. Looking at gross margins. In Q3, the non-GAAP gross margin was 63.6% compared with 62.4% in the prior year. This increase is largely due to a favorable mix led by Biofinity and favorable FX offset by recent CSI acquisitions which have lowered gross margin. CooperVision on a non-GAAP basis reported gross margin of 64.2% versus 61.8% in Q3 of last year. The factors which impacted margin were the items I just mentioned. CooperSurgical had a non-GAAP gross margin of 61.2% which compares to Q3 '15 of 65.4%. Acquisitions in the genetic testing space where the primary drivers for this reduction. 
Now looking at operating expenses. On a non-GAAP basis, SG&A increased approximately 8% to $179.7 million or 35% of revenue, down to approximately 36% of revenue in the prior year. The primary driver behind this drop was strong spending controls as we had leverage in both CooperVision and CooperSurgical. Now looking at R&D Q3. R&D on a non-GAAP basis decreased 2% to $16 million or 3.1% of revenue, down from 3.5% of revenue in the prior year. The primary driver is the leverage we're seeing from the Sauflon acquisition. 
Now moving to operating margins. For Q3, consolidated GAAP operating income and margin were $102.7 million and 19.9% of revenue versus $50.3 million and 10.9% of revenue Q3 last year. Non-GAAP operating income and margin were $131.6 million and 25.6% of revenue versus $106.1 million and 23% of revenue for the prior year. The primary difference in the operating margin year-over-year is improved gross margins and operating expense leverage. In Q3, CooperVision's non-GAAP operating income and margin were $119.4 million and 29.1% of revenue versus $97.7 million and 25.3% of revenue in the prior year. CooperSurgical's non-GAAP operating income and margin were $23.5 million and 22.4% of revenue versus Q3 '15 of $19.5 million of operating income and 25.6% of revenue. Depreciation and amortization, Q3. Depreciation was $33.9 million, down $7.5 million year-over-year. Amortization was $15.6 million, up $3.1 million, reflecting our recent acquisition activity. Interest expense was $8 million for the quarter, up $3.3 million year-over-year, primarily due to higher debt and interest rate associated with acquisitions. 
Looking at the effective tax rate. In Q3, the non-GAAP effective tax rate was 7.7% versus a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 3.1% in Q3 '15. As a reminder, in the prior year, we had a higher dollar amount of Q3 discreet items related to prior years which reversed in that quarter. On earnings per share. Our Q3 earnings per share on a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis was $1.79 and $2.30, respectively versus $0.91 and $1.97 for GAAP and non-GAAP in the prior year. Now looking at some balance sheet and liquidity items. In Q3, we had cash provided by operations of $128.9 million with capital expenditures of $31.1 million, resulting in $97.8 million of free cash flow. Excluding integration cost of $6.9 million, adjusted free cash flow was $104.3 million. Total debt increased slightly within the quarter by $2.7 million to $1,444,100,000 primarily due to average higher cash balances and acquisitions, largely offset by operational cash flow generation. Inventory decreased by approximately $3.3 million to $430.3 million from last quarter and CooperVision, we saw overall inventory decline as growth in silicon daily inventory to support our product launches were offset by a reduction in our hydrogel inventory. In CooperSurgical, we saw a small increase largely due to new acquisitions. For the quarter we're seeing month long hand at 6.5 months, down from 7 months last quarter. Days sales outstanding is at 54 days, same as last quarter and down 1 day from the prior year. 
Now turning to guidance. For our main currencies, we're using 1.10 for the euro, 104 for the yen and 1.30 for the pound. In looking at the full year, the consolidated revenue range is being raised at the low end to reflect our Q3 performance and is now $1.944 to $1.957 billion or approximately 6% to 7% pro forma growth, up from the previous 5.5% to 7% range. For the fourth quarter, CooperVision's revenue range is $390 million to $400 million or roughly 5% to 7.5% constant currency growth. And CooperSurgical's revenue range is $106 million to $109 million or roughly 5% to 8% pro forma revenue growth. We expect non-GAAP gross margin for the fourth quarter to be slightly over 64%, driven by a strong quarter for CooperVision. This would result in a full year gross margin around 63%. OpEx is expected to be slightly under 39% for the fourth quarter as well as for the full year. Operating margin is expected to be around 26% in Q4 which would result in the full year margins being in the mid-24% range. Interest expense is expected to be a little over $7 million in Q4 or slightly over $28 million for the year. Our effective tax rate guidance is the same as last quarter, thus a full year rate of around 8% translates to 10.5% to 11% in Q4. Our expected share count is around 49.1 million shares. Our non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to be $2.15 to $2.30 in the fourth quarter, which equates to $8.32 to $8.47 for the full year. From our last earnings call, currency was a positive in Q3 helping roughly $0.04 but we are expecting a negative impact in Q4 of roughly $0.02 from our previous guidance. Unfortunately, some of the positives we experienced in Q3 from currency such as the yen and the euro are now being more than offset by the move in the pound since Brexit occurred in late June. As Bob mentioned, as currency hold, we should see a lot of benefit next year led by cost of goods which roughly 40% of CooperVision's product is manufactured in pound was roughly a 6 months lag to the P&L. To be clear, this is roughly 40% of CooperVision's manufacturing, so on a consolidated basis, this is roughly 30% of our total cost of goods. Also note, the pound move associated with Brexit occurred in late June, so this positive impact starts in January, so more muted positive impact in fiscal Q1 versus the remainder of the year. The other point to note, as I mentioned earlier, is our effective tax rate guidance remains changed which means Q4 tax rate range about 10.5% to 11%. Regarding cash flow, our CapEx was low this quarter but we do expect around $50 million in Q4, so around $170 million of CapEx for the year now. This should result in free cash flow over $300 million and adjusted free cash flow and excluding integration related activity of well north $300 million. With that, let me turn it back to Kim for the Q&A session."

There's really primarily about 1 answer to that and it's industry-wide answer but not for the reason most people would say. Rarely in the past we talked about workdays in a month but in this case, I'll highlight back at July this year, were 19 workdays compared to 22 last year because of the way we test sell and that translate to about a 17% -- 16%, 17% reduction in revenue we had the same revenue per day or the orders per day. So pretty profound impact that weighted did heavily because of the anomaly of the way we can sell. Conversely, you get some of that back in August, relative to the fourth quarter however, probably the best way to look at it is workdays were down 3% this year in the third quarter and they will be up 1.5% in the fourth quarter. So there's one more workday in the fourth quarter, so it smooths out within the quarter anomaly between July and August by workday."

The amount of push they put behind Vita was nothing compared to a year ago when they launch the OASYS 1 Day modality. So a lot more muted. Having said that, there were a lot more active once in the space albeit leveraging their franchise,, if you will. Interestingly, they still do not call OASYS 1 Day a silicone hydrogel lens but as well know, it is a silicone hydrogel lens. As I think I indicated in the past, it was my belief that there would be some swamping of the 2 week noncompliance into the monthly compliance, which in essence is a clever way of saying is a trade up strategy and I think we're seeing more and more of that as they're trying to continue the deceleration or the negative growth of the 2 week space, which they own 90% of, and migrate it into more profitable profit. And there's no doubt profitable pocket means the 1 Day modality but quite frankly, their strategy is not shortsighted, so to speak, when it comes to monthly price point yields more revenue than a two-week compliance. And most -- the vast majority of the 2 week wears are noncompliant. As far as our product, the non-1 Day space, we are rolled out initially Biofinity and it's just getting very early in the game but so far so good. There's a lot of excitement about a novel wins that really address people with iPhones and being in front of screens -- TV screens and computer screens professionally. So there's a lot of interest by the eye care professionals that we have engaged in discussions thus far. We also are -- approval to launch vitality in the 2 weeks space and vitality is targeted to replace our low gross margin, Avaira in the 2 weeks space. The low gross margin came about a number of years ago when we had to recall and had to change the manufacturing technique which became very cumbersome. So it is a significant step up in gross margin and it's very early in that launch, I think it was late July. And the attempt there, it will probably take us to our 3 years to roll up the entire family of the toric and the sear worldwide in this migration. This year we'll go faster and the majority of the Avaira product line is 70% of it or more is the sear side so that 1 will show up quicker. But it's an inventory turn and when you have toric, it takes longer to transition trends, if you will that. So we're excited about that and then of course we have all the actions going on in the 1 Day space."

TruEye, started there, so in essence, this silicone hydrogel market part for all practical purposes in Japan. The beauty of having a MyDay toric in Japan. First of all, we have clariti available in the rest of the world. Clariti has a sear, a toric and a multifocal. In Japan, we only have MyDay at this juncture and have been a toric to go along with it have a halo effect. We will be the only one in the Japanese market with a silicone hydrogel sear and a toric. While the toric market is not as mature as even the European market, it's early in the cycle there. It is a nice halo effect for lot of practitioners wanted particularly more so some of your independents in Japan.

Talking about Brexit, one of the things to keep in mind and I mentioned that so it hit in late June, we would start to see the benefit of that really coming in January. So Q1 will be a little bit of a benefit and then provided the rates stay where they at, you'll get that benefit throughout the rest of the year. So it is a benefit from a CooperVision perspective, about 40% of our COGS are in pound based manufacturing. And that's 30% roughly for the total company. So you will see that flow through again a good part of next year provided the pound stays at about these rates. It's definitely down quite a bit from prior years and that's -- we win more on -- when that happens from a pound perspective on the manufacturing than we lose on the revenue but in the short term like Q4, we actually get impacted by the revenue first and the benefit will come out outside of the fiscal year."

B&L is in a remaking mode, changing their structure yet again, I think, and J&J, with a fairly weak product portfolio is a good marketing company. And so, I would compliment them on making the best of the product portfolio they have. Some of their programs, the whole disruption they've caused in the marketplace over the last few years with directions going on all the way with UPP and then going the other way, they've taken some bumps in terms of the messaging. So 1 Day, they're saying to you we're the friend with the independents, with these products and then, the next day, they are saying, well, we have a different story to tell you but it's not going to be UPP. So there's no doubt there some reaction that. As far as Vita for example, the new product launch in the monthly space, very much it's moving into a space where it's going against some franchise products and Biofinity is a franchise product. Biofinity is a product that has a toric, a sphere and a multifocal plus now it has things like, which is an enhanced product for people -- that like 99% of the people on the planet, using more and more technology. So I don't expect them to get to robust but I do think that's a lot different than what they did a year ago with OASYS 1 Day, where they basically said, we want to participate in the shift of silicone hydrogel where leaving the 2 weeks space and catch them in the 1 Day market with a huge trade up. So they're playing out that strategy to a large degree, they cannibalize TruEye in the U.S. Not worldwide, but in the U.S. and OASYS 1 Day and TruEye and MyDay are giving a competition in this case, Alcon's subtle 1 -- run for their money. Alcon get out here first when it was only one competitive in that space which was TruEye. J&J knew that was a deficient product in the U.S. and I'm not sure why in the U.S. is actually done pretty well historically in Japan but for whatever reason, the U.S. is weak in product. So product rollouts, we hear a lot of noise about B&L on, which is their answer to trying of refresh the product line for monthly products, monthly silicone hydrogel products. They've gone and expended now, I think, from beyond a fear but a lot of what B&L is doing is it's capturing some of their legacy products Pure Vision and Softline 66. So when you put it all together B&L has some new products, Ultra  but it's about holding breakeven with our entire product portfolio including the fall off of their legacy product. The worldwide thinks the last quarter, they're probably 1% to 2% growth. So they would have lost some margins here last quarter. Alcon, likewise, 2% numbers in a market growing 5% so last year, so the gainers were Cooper and with a robust 10% in J&J."

I would highlight, however, that some of the analysts has more aggressive foreign exchange rate and some analysts maybe I think Greg kind of hit a nail in the head, some of the models on the impact of that pound, et cetera emphasizing that is 30% of our worldwide instead of our 40% of our worldwide cost of goods is an important attribute. So hopefully we gave some color for people to sharpen the pencil with their models, in some case. So beyond saying there's a lot of tailwinds that we're standing by and happy with and the foreign exchange rates will be whatever they are and they change literally by the hour, we're not going to add any color at this juncture. As far as the 10-10-10 hit. $0.10 in the second quarter, $0.10 in the third quarter, $0.10 in the fourth quarter due to idle equipment and inventory write-off that were over and above normal, they are in the numbers. There are other write-offs that are routine and they continue throughout 2016 and will continue throughout 2017. Directionally, we indicated that a lot of those call-out charges are associated with some of our improving efficiencies a lot more than we thought that led us to idling some equipment, so directionally, you can see the growth numbers in our 1 Day silicone hydrogel franchise of 40%. That certainly, will go towards improving absorption and importantly, when something goes from idle to use in production, it goes from a direct period charge which is what the 10-10-10 to the balance sheet and is making inventory.

So I just want to get your take on where you think CapEx can go here over the next several years, I think you said $170-ish million for this year but where does it go and how does that translate to free cash flow generation? And I guess, along with that, should we expect no additional software and integration charges next year? And then the other part of the question is, I think certainly, the odds of an interest rate increase have gone up and you can see something coming in this month and how you're thinking about that and what's built into your guidance?"

The cyclicality of the CapEx and you're absolutely right, we ramped up for Biofinity and Avaira the last decade, we're very capital intent. We got real efficient. We ramped down and then all of a sudden, particularly with the Sauflon acquisition and the MyDay without silicone hydrogel 1 Day, it became very capital intensive again over the last several years. And lo and behold, we've got real efficient and here we are again a little ahead of ourselves in a perfect world. Translation there is we think we have a pretty long run way on improving efficiencies that will continue over the next several -- multiple years and that will be cap on CapEx requirements. We've taken the CapEx this year from $200 million down to $30 million, to $170 million. The outlook for post 2016 will be for less than that. We're thinking in that $150 million range. So year-over-year, a reduction of in that $50 million range. When you look at cash flow, we've now taken our to $300 million to a lot stronger statement about $300 million. So we're $300 million headed towards $400 million, no real change in that signal on that going forward. There is, in my opinion, multiple tiers of runway of some of those efficiencies that were talking about. As far as Sauflon or interest charges, the -- what's built into our thinking is given that we have followed cash flow generation, we see that as part of a minimizer. So when you have $1.4 million in debt worldwide, you're generating $300 million to $400 million in cash flow, that will sort of offset. We do expect that probably between now and year-end, there will be some movement in rates and of course, we've guided through year-end so at this juncture, we haven't really guided the treasure goes crazy then that will obviously, influence the guidance we come out within in December but I think foreign-exchange volatility and interest rates depending on who got their mouth open at a given moment out there since like the government is very more proactive in trying to direct economic thinking, which is a detriment, I think  overall because it does create uncertainty about volatility but we're still in the low inflationary modality. We can all speculate and pretend we're autonomous. So stay tuned and we'll refresh what our thinking is in December."

Welcome to our third quarter 2006 (sic) [ 2016 ] conference call.
Let me start by highlighting 3 key points. First, I'm pleased to report another strong quarter, including the first-ever quarter with revenues over $500 million. This includes CooperVision reporting revenues over $400 million for the first time and CooperSurgical reporting revenues over $100 million for the first time. This resulted in non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.30 and free cash flow of $98 million.
Second, CooperVision posted strong results in all key areas of its business, resulting in 6% as reported in constant currency growth. Single-use silicone hydrogel lenses grew 40%, while 2-week and monthly silicone hydrogel lenses grew a combined 11%, both in constant currency.
Third, CooperSurgical had another strong quarter, posting revenue growth of 38% or 6% pro forma. Fertility was the highlight, posting the strongest quarter in many years with growth of 108% or 10% pro forma.
Moving into details. CooperVision reported second quarter revenues of $410 million, up 6%. This was another strong quarter and continues to show the strength of our product portfolio. The Americas grew 6% in constant currency with strength in multiple categories led by Biofinity and our 1 Day silicone hydrogel franchise. Our enhanced clariti lens continues to perform well, and MyDay had another strong quarter.
During the quarter, we received FDA approval for Avaira Vitality, and again, the launch in the U.S. in late July. You'll recall, Avaira Vitality is the replacement product for Avaira in the 2-week silicone hydrogel market. The market reaction has been positive. We remain optimistic about this upgraded product.
We also introduced Biofinity Energys at the American Optometric Association conference in July, and again, the launch in August. This premium Biofinity product has received excellent reviews, and we're confident we will have great success in this offering.
EMEA posted a solid quarter from 3% year-over-year in constant currency against the tough comp. Growth was driven by Biofinity and the 1 Day silicone hydrogel franchise. Asia Pacific had a very strong quarter with 16% constant currency growth. Growth was strong throughout the region, driven by Biofinity and the 1 Day silicone hydrogel franchise. Within Japan, our MyDay sphere launch is progressing well, and we introduced MyDay toric during the quarter. We believe both MyDay sphere and toric have the potential to be a very successful premium offering in this market.
Turning to our product categories. Torics grew a healthy  10% year-over-year and multifocals grew 5%, both in constant currency. We remain the global leader in specialty lenses, and our success with Biofinity and clariti in both of these categories should continue to drive growth for many years.
Looking at silicone hydrogel lenses. These products grew 16% in constant currency and now represents 61% of our total sales. Within the 2-week and monthly space, Biofinity and Avaira combined to grow 11% in constant currency. We remain under-indexed for the 2-week and monthly silicone hydrogel space at 75% of revenue versus the market at 79%, so we expect to continue growing faster than the market given our strong product portfolio.
Regarding our silicone hydrogel 1 Day lenses, clariti and MyDay, they combined to grow 40% in constant currency. The biggest driver in the contact lens market is 1 Day growth, and we strongly believe we have the best product portfolio offering in this space as the only company with premium and mass market lenses, including a full portfolio of 1 Day silicone hydrogel, sphere, toric and multifocal lenses.
Now let me comment on the overall contact lens market. And remember, this information is on the last page of the earnings release. For the calendar quarter Q2, we continued taking share, growing 10% with the market up 5%. Geographically, CooperVision grew 8% in the Americas while the market was up 4%. In Asian Pacific, we grew 20% with the market up 4%. And in EMEA, we grew 9% with the market up 7%. On a modality basis, single-use lenses continue driving growth with CooperVision up 18% and the market up 10%. For non-silicone hydrogel -- for non-single-use lenses, we grew 7% while the market grew 1%.
As you can see, our growth remains diverse and strong. On a trailing 12-month basis, CooperVision grew 8% and the market grew 5%. Going forward, I expect market to continue growing 4% to 6% over the next 5 years and most likely closer to 6%. The drivers will continue to be the shift to daily geographic expansion and the expansion of the wearer base. We expect to continue taking market share led by our strong silicone hydrogel portfolio.
Moving to CooperSurgical. We reported Q2 revenues of $105 million, up 38% year-over-year, driven by strong organic growth and acquisitions. On a pro forma basis, growth was up 6%.
Our fertility products led the way, up 108% or 10% pro forma. Within fertility, we had growth throughout the business and continue to believe our market-leading product portfolio, which includes medical devices, genetic testing and capital equipment, is the broadest portfolio in the space and should continue to drive growth for many years to come.
Within our office and surgical category, our growth moderated slightly from the last few quarters, up 3%. We're continuing to execute on several product launches, including our disposable hysteroscope EndoSee, and we believe we will -- we're well positioned in this segment going forward. Regarding acquisitions, we've been actively working on integrating the deals we've done over the past year, and the strategic rationale behind these deals remains intact. We are very focused on becoming a full-service provider within the global IVF space.
Finally, on CooperSurgical, we're continuing to execute on several initiatives, which should significantly strengthen the business and pay dividends for many years to come. These include transitioning to a geographic sales model, adding sales reps in under-penetrated areas, launching products in new markets and increasing our focus on high-growth areas such as IVF genetic testing. To some degree, these investments are masking our strong underlying operating performance, but it's critical that we lay the groundwork to support the business on a long-term growth -- from a long-term growth perspective.
Now turning to guidance. I'll let Greg go through the details, but let me touch on a few items. For Q4, we're guiding CooperVision to roughly 5% to 7.5% constant currency growth and CooperSurgical roughly to 5% to 8% pro forma growth. So similar growth to Q3. Regarding non-GAAP earnings per share for Q4, we're guiding to $2.15 to $2.30. Regarding fiscal 2017, it's too early to provide financial guidance, but I will say it should be a strong year given the momentum in our 2 businesses as well as recent currency moves. From a longer-term perspective, we're still targeting operating margins of 27% or higher in 2020.
In conclusion, I want to express my appreciation to our employees for all their hard work and dedication. I also want to say a special thank you to Greg Matz, who has announced his planned retirement after more than 6 years of service of our company, including roughly the last 5 years as our CFO. Greg will be greatly missed and we wish him the best in his future endeavors. With Greg's departure, we have announced that Al White, who many of you know really well, will succeed Greg as CFO. Al will assume this role in addition to his current leadership responsibilities with CooperSurgical. I am very confident that his leadership and abilities will allow us to continue driving long-term shareholder value. From a timing perspective, Greg will remain CFO until the end of the fiscal year, and then Al will take over the position. Greg will remain with us through March of next year to ensure a smooth transition.
And now I'll turn it over to Greg to cover our financial results."

I'm going to focus primarily on our non-GAAP results for the quarter. For the reconciliation to GAAP numbers, please refer to our earnings release.
Looking at gross margins. In Q3, the non-GAAP gross margin was 63.6% compared with 62.4% in the prior year. This increase is largely due to a favorable mix led by Biofinity and favorable FX offset by recent CSI acquisitions, which have lower gross margins. CooperVision on a non-GAAP basis reported gross margin of 64.2% versus 61.8% in Q3 of last year. The factors which impacted margin were the items I just mentioned. CooperSurgical had a non-GAAP gross margin of 61.2%, which compares to Q3 '15 of 65.4%. Acquisitions in the genetic testing space where the primary drivers for this reduction.
Now looking at operating expenses. On a non-GAAP basis, SG&A increased approximately 8% to $179.7 million or 35% of revenue, down to approximately 36% of revenue in the prior year. The primary driver behind this drop was strong spending controls as we had leverage in both CooperVision and CooperSurgical.
Now looking at R&D. In Q3, R&D on a non-GAAP basis decreased 2% to $16 million or 3.1% of revenue, down from 3.5% of revenue in the prior year. The primary driver is the leverage we're seeing from the Sauflon acquisition.
Moving to operating margins. For Q3, consolidated GAAP operating income and margin were $102.7 million and 19.9% of revenue versus $50.3 million and 10.9% of revenue in Q3 last year. Non-GAAP operating income and margin were $131.6 million and 25.6% of revenue versus $106.1 million and 23% of revenue for the prior year. The primary difference in the operating margin year-over-year is improved gross margins and operating expense leverage. In Q3, CooperVision's non-GAAP operating income and margin were $119.4 million and 29.1% of revenue versus $97.7 million and 25.3% of revenue in the prior year. CooperSurgical's non-GAAP operating income and margin were $23.5 million and 22.4% of revenue versus Q3 '15 of $19.5 million of operating income and 25.6% of revenue.
Looking at depreciation and amortization. In Q3, depreciation was $33.9 million, down $7.5 million year-over-year. Amortization was $15.6 million, up $3.1 million, reflecting our recent acquisition activity. Interest expense was $8 million for the quarter, up $3.3 million year-over-year, primarily due to higher debt and interest rate associated with acquisitions.
Looking at the effective tax rate. In Q3, the non-GAAP effective tax rate was 7.7% versus a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 3.1% in Q3 '15. As a reminder, in the prior year, we had a higher dollar amount of Q3 discreet items related to prior years, which reversed in that quarter.
On earnings per share, our Q3 earnings per share on a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis was $1.79 and $2.30, respectively, versus $0.91 and $1.97 for GAAP and non-GAAP in the prior year.
Looking at some balance sheet and liquidity items. In Q3, we had cash provided by operations of $128.9 million with capital expenditures of $31.1 million, resulting in $97.8 million of free cash flow. Excluding integration cost of $6.5 million, adjusted free cash flow was $104.3 million. Total debt increased slightly within the quarter by $2.7 million to $1,444,100,000, primarily due to higher average cash balances and acquisitions, largely offset by operational cash flow generation.
Inventory decreased by approximately $3.3 million to $430.3 million from last quarter. In CooperVision, we saw overall inventory decline as growth in silicone daily inventory to support our product launches were offset by a reduction in our hydrogel inventory. In CooperSurgical, we saw a small increase largely due to new acquisitions. For the quarter, we're seeing month on hand at 6.5 months, down from 7 months last quarter. Days sales outstanding is at 54 days, same as last quarter and down 1 day from the prior year.
Now turning to guidance. For our main currencies, we're using 1.10 for the euro, 104 for the yen and 1.30 for the pound.
And looking at the full year. The consolidated revenue range is being raised on the low end to reflect our Q3 performance and is now $1.944 to $1.957 billion or approximately 6% to 7% pro forma growth, up from the previous 5.5% to 7% range.
For the fourth quarter, CooperVision's revenue range is $390 million to $400 million or roughly 5% to 7.5% constant currency growth. And CooperSurgical's revenue range is $106 million to $109 million or roughly 5% to 8% pro forma growth.
We expect non-GAAP gross margin for the fourth quarter to be slightly over 64%, driven by a strong quarter for CooperVision. This would result in a full year gross margin around 63%. OpEx is expected to be slightly under 39% for the fourth quarter as well as for the full year. Operating margin is expected to be around 26% in Q4, which would result in the full year margin being in the mid-24% range. Interest expense is expected to be a little over $7 million in Q4 or slightly over $28 million for the year. Our effective tax rate guidance is the same as last quarter. Thus, a full year rate of around 8% translates to 10.5% to 11% in Q4. Our expected share count is around 49.1 million shares. Our non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to be $2.15 to $2.30 in the fourth quarter, which equates to $8.32 to $8.47 for the full year.
From our last earnings call, currency was a positive in Q3, helping roughly $0.04. But we are expecting a negative impact in Q4 of roughly $0.02 from our previous guidance. Unfortunately, some of the positives we experienced in Q3 from currencies such as the yen and the euro are now being more than offset by the move in the pound since Brexit occurred in late June. As Bob mentioned, as currency holds, we should see a lot of benefit next year led by cost of goods as roughly 40% of CooperVision's product is manufactured in pound with roughly a 6-month lag to the P&L. To be clear, this is roughly 40% of CooperVision's manufacturing, so on a consolidated basis, this is roughly 30% of our total cost of goods. Also note, the pound move associated with Brexit occurred in late June, so this positive impact starts in January, so a more muted positive impact in fiscal Q1 versus the remainder of the year.
The other point to note, as I mentioned earlier, is our effective tax rate guidance remains unchanged, which means a Q4 tax rate range of about 10.5% to 11%. Regarding cash flow, our CapEx was low this quarter but we do expect around $50 million in Q4, so around $170 million of CapEx for the year now. This should result in free cash flow over $300 million and adjusted free cash flow when excluding integration-related activity of well north of $300 million.
With that, let me turn it back to Kim for the Q&A session."

And yes, that's kind of jumped off the page a little, that July must have been soft relatively speaking. There's really primarily but one answer to that, and it's an industry-wide answer but not for the reasons most people would think. Rarely in the past have we talked about workdays in a month, but in this case, I'll highlight the fact that in July this year, there were 19 workdays compared to 22 last year because of the way we can sell. And that translates to about a 17% -- 16%, 17% reduction in revenue if we had the same revenue per day or the orders per day. So pretty profound impact that weighted heavily because of the anomaly of the way we can sell. Conversely, you get some of that back in August. Relative to a full quarter however, probably the best way to look at it is workdays were down 3% this year in the third quarter, and they'll be up 1.5% in the fourth quarter. So there's one more workday in the fourth quarter. So it smooths out within the quarter, but there is an anomaly between July and August caused by workdays."

And now they're moving with a different package into the monthly modality with VITA. The amount of push they put behind VITA out of the gate [ph] was nothing compared to a year ago when they launched the OASYS 1 Day modality. So a lot more muted. Having said that, they're one of the more active ones in the space, albeit leveraging their OASYS franchise, if you will. Interestingly, they still do not call OASYS 1 Day a silicone hydrogel lens. But as we all know, it is a silicone hydrogel lens. As I think I indicated in the past, it was my belief that there would be some swapping of the 2-week noncompliance into the monthly compliance, which in essence is a clever way of saying it's a trade-up strategy, and I think we're seeing more and more of that as they're trying to continue the deceleration or the negative growth of the 2-week space, which they own 90% of, and migrate it into more profitable profit bucket. And there is no doubt profitable bucket means the 1 Day modality, but quite frankly, their strategy is not shortsighted, so to speak, when it comes to monthly price point yields more revenue than a 2-week noncompliance. And most -- the vast majority of the 2-week wearers are noncompliant. As far as our product in the non-1 Day space, we rolled out initially Biofinity Energys. It's just getting -- it's very early in the game but so far so good. There's a lot of excitement about a novel win that really addresses people with iPhones and being in front of screens -- TV screens and computer screens professionally. So there's a lot of interest by the eye care professionals that we have engaged in discussions thus far. We also are -- got approval to launch Vitality in the 2-week space. And Vitality is targeted to replace our low gross margin Avaira product in the 2-week space. That low gross margin came about a number of years ago when we had to recall and had to change the manufacturing technique, which became very cumbersome. So it is a significant step-up in gross margin, and it's very early in that launch. I think it was late July. And the intent there is it will probably take us 2 to 3 years to roll out the entire family of the toric and the sphere worldwide in this migration. This year we'll go faster, and the majority of the Avaira product line is 70% of it or more is the sphere side. So that one will show up quicker. But it's an inventory turn. And when you have toric, it takes longer to transition, if you will, that. So we're excited about that. And then, of course, we have all the action that's going on in the 1 Day space."

First of all, double-digit in Asia Pac is somewhat a reflection of our immaturity in that market with a fabulous product portfolio. So we have a great product portfolio. A lot of it emanated out of EMEA. So it started in Europe and it came to the U.S. And really, Asia PAC is the last to get it all. In addition, we were clearly under-indexed overall in that market. We have invested over the last 3 or 4 years heavily in some areas like China and the surrounding geographic area. So we're starting to get momentum there. As far as MyDay in Japan, MyDay is a 1 Day product. There are silicone hydrogel players in the Japanese market. TruEye started there, so in essence, the silicone hydrogel market really started for all practical purposes in Japan. The beauty of having a MyDay toric in Japan, first of all, we have clariti available in the rest of the world. clariti has a sphere, a toric and a multifocal. In Japan, we only have MyDay at this juncture, and having a toric to go along with it has a halo effect. We will be the only one in the Japanese market with a silicone hydrogel sphere and a toric. While the toric market is not as mature as even the European market, it's early in the cycle there. It is a nice halo effect. A lot of practitioners want it, and particularly more so some of your independents in Japan. So it's a good story with not only the large retailers that exist there but also the independents. So yes, I do expect that we will put up robust numbers going forward, double-digit numbers, certainly in many quarters going forward in the Asia Pac marketplace."

It's about up $0.02 for the full year, year-over-year. You talked about Brexit. One of the things to keep in mind, and I mentioned that in the script, is when it hit. It hit in late June. So we would start to see the benefit of that really coming in, in January. So Q1 will get a little bit of the benefit, and then provided the rates stay where they're at, you'll get that benefit throughout the rest of the year. So it's a  nice benefit. From a CooperVision perspective, about 40% of our COGS are in pound-based manufacturing. And that's 30% roughly for the total company. So you'll see that flow through again in a good part of next year provided the pound stays at about these rates. It's definitely down quite a bit from prior years, and that's -- we win more on -- when that happens from a pound perspective, we win more on the manufacturing than we lose on the revenue. But in the short term like Q4, we actually get impacted by the revenue first and the benefit will come out outside of this fiscal year."

And Alcon obviously is still in a remaking mode. B&L is in a remaking mode, changing their structure yet again, I think. And J&J, with a fairly weak product portfolio, is a good marketing company. And so I would compliment them on making the best of the product portfolio they have. Some of their programs, the whole disruption they've caused in the marketplace over the last few years with directions going all the way with UPP and then directions going the other way, they've taken some bumps in terms of the messaging. So 1 Day, they're saying to you we're the friend with the independents with these products. And then the next day, they are saying, well, we have a different story to tell you but it's not going to be UPP. So there is no doubt there's some reaction to that. As far as VITA, for example, their new product launch in the monthly space, very much it's moving into a space where it's going against some franchise products, and Biofinity is a franchise product. And Biofinity is the product that has a toric, a sphere and a multifocal. Plus now it has things like Energys, which is an enhanced product for people that, like 99% of the people on the planet, are using more and more technology. So I don't expect them to get too robust about that. I do think that's a lot different than what they did a year ago with OASYS 1 Day where they basically said, ""We want to participate in the shift of silicone hydrogel wearers, leaving the 2-week space and catch some in the 1 Day market with a huge trade-up."" So they're playing out that strategy. To a large degree, they cannibalize TruEye in the U.S., not worldwide but in the U.S. And OASYS 1 Day and TruEye and MyDay are giving the competition, in this case Alcon's TOTAL1, a run for their money. Now Alcon got out there first when there was only one competitor in that space, which was TruEye. J&J knew that was a deficient product in the U.S., and I'm not sure why in the U.S. when it actually has done pretty well historically in Japan. But for whatever reason, the U.S. is a weaker product. So product rollouts, we hear a lot of noise about B&L on ULTRA, which is their answer to trying to refresh the product line for monthly products, monthly silicone hydrogel products. They've gone and expended now, I think, from beyond a sphere. But a lot of what B&L is doing is capturing some of their legacy products, so PureVision and SofLens 66. So when you put it all together, B&L has some new products, ULTRA, but it's about holding breakeven with the entire product portfolio, including the fall-off of their legacy product. So worldwide, I think the last quarter, they're probably 1% to 2% growth. So they would have lost some margins here last quarter. Alcon, likewise, came up with 2% number in a market growing 5%. So last year, so the gainers were Cooper and with a robust 10% in J&J."

Otherwise, you would -- if there was something out of whack, you would call it out?

First question on August and July, yes, it's safe to assume that the anomalies between the weak July and August have to do with workdays not anything ingrained in the marketplace. Relative to 2017 where we educated we're not prepared at this juncture to put specifics on the line, no, we wouldn't comment one way or the other on what consensus is out there. I would highlight, however, that some of the analysts have more aggressive foreign exchange rates. And some analysts maybe -- I think Greg kind of hit the nail on the head. Some of the models on the impact of the pound, et cetera, emphasizing that is 30% of our worldwide instead of 40% of our worldwide cost of goods is an important attribute. So hopefully, we gave some color for people to sharpen the pencil with their models, in some case. But beyond saying there's a lot of tailwinds that we're standing by and happy with. And the foreign exchange rates will be whatever they are, and they change literally by the hour. We're not going to add any more color at this juncture. As far as the 10-10-10 hit, $0.10 in the second quarter, $0.10 in the third quarter, $0.10 in the fourth quarter, due to idle equipment and inventory write-offs that were over and above normal, they are in the numbers. There are other write-offs that are routine, and they continue throughout 2016 and will continue throughout 2017. Directionally, we indicated that a lot of those call-out charges are associated with some of our improving efficiencies a lot more than we thought. So that led us to idling some equipment. So directionally, you can see the growth numbers in our 1 Day silicone hydrogel franchise of 40%. That certainly will go towards improving absorption. And importantly, when something goes from idle to used in production, it goes from a direct period charge, which is what the 10-10-10 is about, to -- suddenly it moves on to the balance sheet when it's making inventory. So that will continue throughout 2017, if you will."

There are also periods of time where you grow into that capacity, and in this case, you've got some of these idle equipment sitting around now that will add to that. So I just wanted to get your take on where you think CapEx can go here over the next several years. I think you said $170-ish million for this year. But where does it go? And how does that translate to free cash flow generation? And I guess along with that, should we expect no additional Sauflon integration charges next year? And then the other part of the question is I think certainly the odds of an interest rate increase have gone up, and we can see something coming in this month. And how are you thinking about that? And what's built into guidance?"

We're very capital intensive. We got real efficient. We ramped down. And then all of a sudden, particularly with the Sauflon acquisition and with MyDay rollout of silicone hydrogel 1 Day, we became very capital intensive again over the last several years. And lo and behold, we got real efficient, and here we are again, a little ahead of ourselves in the perfect world. The translation there is we think we have a pretty long runway on improving efficiencies that will continue over the next several -- multiple years, and that will be somewhat of a cap on CapEx requirements. We've taken the CapEx needs this year from $200 million down $30 million to $170 million. The outlook for post 2016 will be for less than that. We're thinking in that $150 million range. So year-over-year, a reduction of -- in that $50 million range. When you look at cash flow, we've now taken our -- should get to $300 million to a lot stronger statement above $300 million. So we're $300 million headed towards $400 million. No real change in that signal on that going forward. There is, in my opinion, multiple tiers of runway on some of those efficiencies that were talking about. As far as Sauflon or interest charges, the -- what's built into our thinking is given that we have forward cash flow generation, we see that as part of a minimizer. So when you have $1.4 million in debt worldwide, you're generating $300 million to $400 million in cash flow, that will serve to offset. We do expect that probably between now and year-end, there will be some movement in rates, and of course, we've only guided through year-end. So at this juncture, we haven't really guided -- if the Treasury goes crazy, then that will obviously influence the guidance we come out with in December. But I think between foreign exchange volatility and interest rates, depending on who's got their mouth open on a given moment out there, it seems like the government is very -- more proactive in trying to direct economic thinking, which is a detriment, I think, overall because it does create uncertainty in volatility. But we're still in the low inflationary modality. We can all speculate and pretend we're autonomous. So stay tuned and we'll refresh what our thinking is in December."

Welcome to our third quarter 2006 (sic) [ 2016 ] conference call.Let me start by highlighting 3 key points. First, I'm pleased to report another strong quarter, including the first-ever quarter with revenues",1313,"Thank you, Kim, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2006 (sic) [ 2016 ] conference call.
Let me start by highlighting 3 key points. First, I'm pleased to report another strong quarter, including the first-ever quarter with revenues over $500 million. This includes CooperVision reporting revenues over $400 million for the first time and CooperSurgical reporting revenues over $100 million for the first time. This resulted in non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.30 and free cash flow of $98 million.
Second, CooperVision posted strong results in all key areas of its business, resulting in 6% as reported in constant currency growth. Single-use silicone hydrogel lenses grew 40%, while 2-week and monthly silicone hydrogel lenses grew a combined 11%, both in constant currency.
Third, CooperSurgical had another strong quarter, posting revenue growth of 38% or 6% pro forma. Fertility was the highlight, posting the strongest quarter in many years with growth of 108% or 10% pro forma.
Moving into details. CooperVision reported second quarter revenues of $410 million, up 6%. This was another strong quarter and continues to show the strength of our product portfolio. The Americas grew 6% in constant currency with strength in multiple categories led by Biofinity and our 1 Day silicone hydrogel franchise. Our enhanced clariti lens continues to perform well, and MyDay had another strong quarter.
During the quarter, we received FDA approval for Avaira Vitality and began to launch in the U.S. in late July. You'll recall, Avaira Vitality is the replacement product for Avaira in the 2-week silicone hydrogel market. The market reaction has been positive. We remain optimistic about this upgraded product.
We also introduced Biofinity Energys at the American Optometric Association conference in July and began the launch in August. This premium Biofinity product has received excellent reviews, and we're confident we will have great success in this offering.
EMEA posted a solid quarter growing 3% year-over-year in constant currency against the tough comp. Growth was driven by Biofinity and the 1 Day silicone hydrogel franchise. Asia Pacific had a very strong quarter with 16% constant currency growth. Growth was strong throughout the region, driven by Biofinity and the 1 Day silicone hydrogel franchise. Within Japan, our MyDay sphere launch is progressing well, and we introduced MyDay toric during the quarter. We believe both MyDay sphere and toric have the potential to be a very successful premium offering in this market.
Turning to our product categories. Torics grew a healthy 10% year-over-year and multifocals grew 5%, both in constant currency. We remain the global leader in specialty lenses, and our success with Biofinity and clariti in both of these categories should continue to drive growth for many years.
Looking at silicone hydrogel lenses. These products grew 16% in constant currency and now represent 61% of our total sales. Within the 2-week and monthly space, Biofinity and Avaira combined to grow 11% in constant currency. We remain under-indexed for the 2-week and monthly silicone hydrogel space at 75% of revenue versus the market at 79%, so we expect to continue growing faster than the market given our strong product portfolio.
Regarding our silicone hydrogel 1 Day lenses, clariti and MyDay, they combined to grow 40% in constant currency. The biggest driver in the contact lens market is 1 Day growth, and we strongly believe we have the best product portfolio offering in this space as the only company with premium and mass market lenses, including a full portfolio of 1 Day silicone hydrogel, sphere, toric and multifocal lenses.
Now let me comment on the overall contact lens market. And remember, this information is on the last page of the earnings release. For the calendar quarter Q2, we continued taking share, growing 10% with the market up 5%. Geographically, CooperVision grew 8% in the Americas while the market was up 4%. In Asian Pacific, we grew 20% with the market up 4%. And in EMEA, we grew 9% with the market up 7%. On a modality basis, single-use lenses continue driving growth with CooperVision up 18% and the market up 10%. For non-silicone hydrogel -- for non-single-use lenses, we grew 7% while the market grew 1%.
As you can see, our growth remains diverse and strong. On a trailing 12-month basis, CooperVision grew 8% and the market grew 5%. Going forward, I expect the market to continue growing 4% to 6% over the next 5 years and most likely closer to 6%. The drivers will continue to be the shift to daily geographic expansion and the expansion of the wearer base. We expect to continue taking market share led by our strong silicone hydrogel portfolio.
Moving to CooperSurgical. We reported Q2 revenues of $105 million, up 38% year-over-year, driven by strong organic growth and acquisitions. On a pro forma basis, growth was up 6%.
Our fertility products led the way, up 108% or 10% pro forma. Within fertility, we had growth throughout the business and continue to believe our market-leading product portfolio, which includes medical devices, genetic testing and capital equipment, is the broadest portfolio in the space and should continue to drive growth for many years to come.
Within our office and surgical category, our growth moderated slightly from the last few quarters, up 3%. We're continuing to execute on several product launches, including our disposable hysteroscope EndoSee, and we believe we will -- we're well positioned in this segment going forward.
Regarding acquisitions, we've been actively working on integrating the deals we've done over the past year, and the strategic rationale behind these deals remains intact. We are very focused on becoming a full-service provider within the global IVF space.
Finally, on CooperSurgical, we're continuing to execute on several initiatives, which should significantly strengthen the business and pay dividends for many years to come. These include transitioning to a geographic sales model, adding sales reps in under-penetrated areas, launching products in new markets and increasing our focus on high-growth areas such as IVF genetic testing. To some degree, these investments are masking all our strong underlying operating performance, but it's critical that we lay the groundwork to support the business on a long-term growth -- from a long-term growth perspective.
Now turning to guidance. I'll let Greg go through the details, but let me touch on a few items. For Q4, we're guiding CooperVision to roughly 5% to 7.5% constant currency growth and CooperSurgical roughly to 5% to 8% pro forma growth. So similar growth to Q3. Regarding non-GAAP earnings per share for Q4, we're guiding to $2.15 to $2.30. Regarding fiscal 2017, it's too early to provide financial guidance, but I will say it should be a strong year given the momentum in our 2 businesses as well as recent currency moves. From a longer-term perspective, we're still targeting operating margins of 27% or higher in 2020.
In conclusion, I want to express my appreciation to our employees for all their hard work and dedication. I also want to say a special thank you to Greg Matz, who has announced his planned retirement after more than 6 years of service of our company, including roughly the last 5 years as our CFO. Greg will be greatly missed and we wish him the best in his future endeavors. With Greg's departure, we have announced that Al White, who many of you know really well, will succeed Greg as CFO. Al will assume this role in addition to his current leadership responsibilities with CooperSurgical. I am very confident that his leadership and abilities will allow us to continue driving long-term shareholder value. From a timing perspective, Greg will remain CFO until the end of the fiscal year, and then Al will take over the position. Greg will remain with us through March of next year to ensure a smooth transition.
And now I'll turn it over to Greg to cover our financial results."

I'm going to focus primarily on our non-GAAP results for the quarter. For the reconciliation to GAAP numbers, please refer to our earnings release.
Looking at gross margins. In Q3, the non-GAAP gross margin was 63.6% compared with 62.4% in the prior year. This increase is largely due to a favorable mix led by Biofinity and favorable FX offset by recent CSI acquisitions, which have lower gross margins. CooperVision on a non-GAAP basis reported gross margin of 64.2% versus 61.8% in Q3 of last year. The factors which impacted margin were the items I just mentioned. CooperSurgical had a non-GAAP gross margin of 61.2%, which compares to Q3 '15 of 65.4%. Acquisitions in the genetic testing space were the primary drivers for this reduction.
Now looking at operating expenses. On a non-GAAP basis, SG&A increased approximately 8% to $179.7 million or 35% of revenue, down from approximately 36% of revenue in the prior year. The primary driver behind this drop was strong spending controls as we had leverage in both CooperVision and CooperSurgical.
Now looking at R&D. In Q3, R&D on a non-GAAP basis decreased 2% to $16 million or 3.1% of revenue, down from 3.5% of revenue in the prior year. The primary driver is the leverage we're seeing from the Sauflon acquisition.
Moving to operating margins. For Q3, consolidated GAAP operating income and margin were $102.7 million and 19.9% of revenue versus $50.3 million and 10.9% of revenue in Q3 last year. Non-GAAP operating income and margin were $131.6 million and 25.6% of revenue versus $106.1 million and 23% of revenue for the prior year. The primary difference in the operating margin year-over-year is improved gross margins and operating expense leverage. In Q3, CooperVision's non-GAAP operating income and margin were $119.4 million and 29.1% of revenue versus $97.7 million and 25.3% of revenue in the prior year. CooperSurgical's non-GAAP operating income and margin were $23.5 million and 22.4% of revenue versus Q3 '15 of $19.5 million of operating income and 25.6% of revenue.
Looking at depreciation and amortization. In Q3, depreciation was $33.9 million, down $7.5 million year-over-year. Amortization was $15.6 million, up $3.1 million, reflecting our recent acquisition activity. Interest expense was $8 million for the quarter, up $3.3 million year-over-year, primarily due to higher debt interest rates associated with acquisitions.
Looking at the effective tax rate. In Q3, the non-GAAP effective tax rate was 7.7% versus a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 3.1% in Q3 '15. As a reminder, in the prior year, we had a higher dollar amount of Q3 discreet items related to prior years, which reversed in that quarter.
On earnings per share, our Q3 earnings per share on a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis was $1.79 and $2.30, respectively, versus $0.91 and $1.97 for GAAP and non-GAAP in the prior year.
Looking at some balance sheet and liquidity items. In Q3, we had cash provided by operations of $128.9 million with capital expenditures of $31.1 million, resulting in $97.8 million of free cash flow. Excluding integration cost of $6.5 million, adjusted free cash flow was $104.3 million. Total debt increased slightly within the quarter by $2.7 million to $1,444,100,000, primarily due to higher average cash balances and acquisitions, largely offset by operational cash flow generation.
Inventories decreased by approximately $3.3 million to $430.3 million from last quarter. In CooperVision, we saw overall inventory decline as growth in silicone daily inventory to support our product launches was offset by a reduction in our hydrogel inventory. In CooperSurgical, we saw a small increase largely due to new acquisitions. For the quarter, we're seeing month on hand at 6.5 months, down from 7 months last quarter. Days sales outstanding is at 54 days, same as last quarter and down 1 day from the prior year.
Now turning to guidance. For our main currencies, we're using 1.10 for the euro, 104 for the yen and 1.30 for the pound.
And looking at the full year. The consolidated revenue range is being raised on the low end to reflect our Q3 performance and is now $1.944 billion to $1.957 billion or approximately 6% to 7% pro forma growth, up from the previous 5.5% to 7% range.
For the fourth quarter, CooperVision's revenue range is $390 million to $400 million or roughly 5% to 7.5% constant currency growth. And CooperSurgical's revenue range is $106 million to $109 million or roughly 5% to 8% pro forma growth.
We expect non-GAAP gross margin for the fourth quarter to be slightly over 64%, driven by a strong quarter for CooperVision. This would result in a full year gross margin around 63%. OpEx is expected to be slightly under 39% for the fourth quarter as well as for the full year. Operating margin is expected to be around 26% in Q4, which would result in the full year margin being in the mid-24% range. Interest expense is expected to be a little over $7 million in Q4 or slightly over $28 million for the year. Our effective tax rate guidance is the same as last quarter. Thus, a full year rate of around 8% translates to 10.5% to 11% in Q4. Our expected share count is around 49.1 million shares. Our non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to be $2.15 to $2.30 in the fourth quarter, which equates to $8.32 to $8.47 for the full year.
From our last earnings call, currency was a positive in Q3, helping roughly $0.04. But we are expecting a negative impact in Q4 of roughly $0.02 from our previous guidance. Unfortunately, some of the positives we experienced in Q3 from currencies such as the yen and the euro are now being more than offset by the move in the pound since Brexit occurred in late June. As Bob mentioned, if currency holds, we should see a lot of benefit next year led by cost of goods as roughly 40% of CooperVision's product is manufactured in pounds with roughly a 6-month lag to the P&L. To be clear, this is roughly 40% of CooperVision's manufacturing, so on a consolidated basis, this is roughly 30% of our total cost of goods. Also note, the pound move associated with Brexit occurred in late June, so this positive impact starts in January, so a more muted positive impact in fiscal Q1 versus the remainder of the year.
The other point to note, as I mentioned earlier, is our effective tax rate guidance remains unchanged, which means a Q4 tax rate range of about 10.5% to 11%. Regarding cash flow, our CapEx was low this quarter but we do expect around $50 million in Q4, so around $170 million of CapEx for the year now. This should result in free cash flow over $300 million and adjusted free cash flow when excluding integration-related activity of well north of $300 million.
With that, let me turn it back to Kim for the Q&A session."

It's always tough to read CLI data and try to translate that given the off 1 month, how your fiscal quarter closes. But if I look, it looks as if maybe the forward month slowed a little bit.

And yes, that's kind of jumped off the page a little, that July must have been soft relatively speaking. There's really primarily but one answer to that, and it's an industry-wide answer but not for the reasons most people would think. Rarely in the past have we talked about workdays in a month, but in this case, I'll highlight the fact that in July this year, there were 19 workdays compared to 22 last year because of the way weekends fell. And that translates to about a 17% -- 16%, 17% reduction in revenue if you had the same revenue per day or the orders per day. So pretty profound impact that weighted heavily because of the anomaly of the way weekends fell. Conversely, you get some of that back in August. Relative to the full quarter however, probably the best way to look at it is, workdays were down 3% this year in the third quarter, and they'll be up 1.5% in the fourth quarter. So there's one more workday in the fourth quarter. So it smooths out within the quarter, but there is an anomaly between July and August caused by workdays."

And now they're moving with a different package into the monthly modality with VITA. The amount of push they put behind VITA out of the gate [ph] was nothing compared to a year ago when they launched the OASYS 1 Day modality. So a lot more muted. Having said that, they're one of the more active ones in the space, albeit leveraging their OASYS franchise, if you will. Interestingly, they still do not call OASYS 1 Day a silicone hydrogel lens. But as we all know, it is a silicone hydrogel lens. As I think I indicated in the past, it was my belief that there would be some swapping of the 2-week noncompliant into the monthly compliant, which in essence is a clever way of saying it's a trade-up strategy, and I think we're seeing more and more of that as they're trying to continue the deceleration or the negative growth of the 2-week space, which they own 90% of, and migrate it into more profitable buckets. And there is no doubt profitable bucket means the 1 Day modality, but quite frankly, their strategy is not shortsighted, so to speak, when it comes to monthly price point yields more revenue than a 2-week noncompliant. And most -- the vast majority of the 2-week wearers are noncompliant. As far as our product in the non-1 Day space, we rolled out initially Biofinity Energys. It's getting -- it's very early in the game, but so far so good. There's a lot of excitement about a novel win that really addresses people with iPhones and being in front of screens -- TV screens and computer screens professionally. So there's a lot of interest by the eye care professionals that we have engaged in discussion thus far. We also are -- got approval to launch Vitality in the 2-week space. And Vitality is targeted to replace our low gross margin Avaira product in the 2-week space. That low gross margin came about a number of years ago when we had a recall and had to change the manufacturing technique, which became very cumbersome. So it is a significant step-up in gross margin, and it's very early in that launch. I think it was late July. And the intent there is, it will probably take us 2 to 3 years to roll out the entire family of the toric and the sphere worldwide in this migration. The sphere will go faster, and the majority of the Avaira product line is -- 70% of it or more is the sphere side. So that one will show up quicker. But it's an inventory turn. And when you have toric, it takes longer to transition, if you will, that. So we're excited about that. And then, of course, we have all the action that's going on in the 1 Day space."

We have invested over the last 3 or 4 years heavily in some areas like China and the surrounding geographic area. So we're starting to get momentum there. As far as MyDay in Japan, MyDay is a 1 Day product. There are silicone hydrogel players in the Japanese market. TruEye started there, so in essence, the silicone hydrogel market really started for all practical purposes in Japan. The beauty of having a MyDay toric in Japan, first of all, we have clariti available in the rest of the world. clariti has a sphere, a toric and a multifocal. In Japan, we only have MyDay at this juncture, and having a toric to go along with it has a halo effect. We will be the only one in the Japanese market with a silicone hydrogel sphere and a toric. While the toric market is not as mature as even the European market, it's early in the cycle there. It is a nice halo effect. A lot of practitioners want it, and particularly more so some of your independents in Japan. So it's a good story with not only the large retailers that exist there but also the independents. So yes, I do expect that we will put up robust numbers going forward, double-digit numbers, certainly in many quarters going forward in the Asia Pac marketplace."

The second part of that question has to do with what was the FX impact on EPS in the third quarter and the current thinking for the full year? And then my second question has to do -- more big picture. We've all been very worried and very focused about J&J's product launches, and while Seva and Bausch have struggled, is there anything that you see coming down sort of the pike that we need to be aware of as we look forward?"

And that was about $0.04 above what we had guided to, or what was in our guidance in Q3 -- or I'm sorry, Q2. If you look for the full year, we're looking at -- FX is about flat. It's about up $0.02 for the full year, year-over-year. You talked about Brexit. One of the things to keep in mind, and I mentioned that in the script, is when it hit. It hit in late June. So we would start to see the benefit of that really coming in, in January. So Q1 will get a little bit of the benefit, and then provided the rates stay where they're at, you'll get that benefit throughout the rest of the year. So it's a nice benefit. From a CooperVision perspective, about 40% of our COGS are in pound-based manufacturing. And that's 30% roughly for the total company. So you'll see that flow through again a good part of next year provided the pound stays at about these rates. It's definitely down quite a bit from prior years, and that's -- we win more on -- when that happens from a pound perspective, we win more on the manufacturing than we lose on the revenue. But in the short term like Q4, we actually get impacted by the revenue first and the benefit will come out outside of this fiscal year."

And Alcon obviously is still in a remaking mode. B&L is in a remaking mode, changing their structure yet again, I think. And J&J, with a fairly weak product portfolio, is a good marketing company. And so I would compliment them on making the best of the product portfolio they have. Some of their programs, the whole disruption they've caused in the marketplace over the last 2 years with directionally going all the way with UPP and then directionally going the other way, they've taken some bumps in terms of their messaging. So one day they're saying to you, ""We're the friend with the independents with these products."" And then the next day, they are saying, ""Well, we have a different story to tell you, but it's not going to be UPP."" So there is no doubt there's some reaction to that. As far as VITA, for example, their new product launch in the monthly space, very much it's moving into a space where it's going against some franchised products, and Biofinity is a franchised product. And Biofinity is the product that has a toric, a sphere and a multifocal. Plus now it has things like Energys, which is an enhanced product for people that -- like 99% of the people on the planet, are using more and more technology. So I don't expect them to get too robust about that. I do think that's a lot different than what they did a year ago with OASYS 1 Day where they basically said, ""We want to participate in the shift of silicone hydrogel wearers, leaving the 2-week space and catch some in the 1 Day market with a huge trade-up."" So they're playing out that strategy. To a large degree, they cannibalize TruEye in the U.S., not worldwide but in the U.S. And OASYS 1 Day and TruEye and MyDay are giving the competition, in this case Alcon's TOTAL1, a run for their money. Now Alcon got out there first when there was only one competitor in that space, which was TruEye. J&J knew that was a deficient product in the U.S., and I'm not sure why in the U.S. when it actually has done pretty well historically in Japan. But for whatever reason, the U.S., it's a weaker product. So product rollouts, we hear a lot of noise about B&L on ULTRA, which is their answer to trying to refresh the product line for monthly products, monthly silicone hydrogel products. They've gone and expanded now, I think, from beyond a sphere. But a lot of what B&L is doing is capturing some of their legacy products, so PureVision and SofLens 66. So when you put it all together, B&L has some new products, ULTRA, but it's about holding breakeven with the entire product portfolio, including the fall-off of their legacy products. So worldwide, I think the last quarter, they're probably 1% to 2% growth. So they would have lost some margins here last quarter. Alcon, likewise, came up with 2% numbers in a market growing 5%. So they lost share, so the gainers were Cooper and with a robust 10% in J&J."

First question on August and July, yes, it's safe to assume that the anomalies between the weak July and August have to do with workdays, not anything ingrained in the marketplace. Relative to 2017 where we indicated we're not prepared at this juncture to put specifics on the line, no, we wouldn't comment one way or the other on what consensus is out there. I would highlight, however, that some of the analysts have more aggressive foreign exchange rates. And some analysts maybe -- I think Greg kind of hit the nail on the head. Some of the models on the impact of the pound, et cetera, emphasizing that it's on 30% of our worldwide instead of 40% of our worldwide cost of goods is an important attribute. So hopefully, we gave some color for people to sharpen the pencil with their models, in some case. But beyond saying there's a lot of tailwinds that we're standing by and happy with. And the foreign exchange rates will be whatever they are, and they change literally by the hour. We're not going to add any more color at this juncture. As far as the 10-10-10 hit, $0.10 in the second quarter, $0.10 in the third quarter, $0.10 in the fourth quarter, due to idle equipment and inventory write-offs that were over and above normal, they are in the numbers. There are other write-offs that are routine, and they continued throughout 2016 and will continue throughout 2017. Directionally, we indicated that a lot of those call-out charges are associated with some of our improving efficiency a lot more than we thought. So that led us to idling some equipment. So directionally, you can see the growth numbers in our 1 Day silicone hydrogel franchise of 40%. That certainly will go towards improving absorption. And importantly, when something goes from idle to use in production, it goes from a direct period charge, which is what the 10-10-10 is about, to -- suddenly it moves on to the balance sheet when it's making inventory. So that will continue throughout 2017, if you will."

There are also periods of time where you grow into that capacity, and in this case, you've got some of these idle equipment sitting around now that will add to that. So I just wanted to get your take on where you think CapEx can go here over the next several years. I think you said $170-ish million for this year. But where does it go? And how does that translate to free cash flow generation? And I guess along with that, should we expect no additional Sauflon integration charges next year? And then the other part of the question is I think certainly the odds of an interest rate increase have gone up, and we can see something coming in this month. And how are you thinking about that?

We were very capital intense. We got real efficient. We ramped down. And then all of a sudden, particularly with the Sauflon acquisition and with MyDay rollout of silicone hydrogel 1 Day, we became very capital intense again over the last several years. And lo and behold, we got real efficient, and here we are again, a little ahead of ourselves in the perfect world. The translation there is we think we have a pretty long runway on improving efficiencies that will continue over the next several -- multiple years, and that will be somewhat of a cap on CapEx requirements. We've taken the CapEx needs this year from $200 million down $30 million to $170 million. The outlook for post-2016 will be for less than that. We're thinking in that $150 million range. So year-over-year, a reduction of -- in that $50 million range. When you look at cash flow, we've now taken our -- should get to $300 million to a lot stronger statement above $300 million. So we're $300 million headed towards $400 million. No real change in that signal on that going forward. There is, in my opinion, multiple years of runway on some of those efficiencies that we're talking about. As far as Sauflon or interest charges, the -- what's built into our thinking is given that we have solid cash flow generation, we see that as part of a minimizer. So when you have $1.4 million in debt worldwide, you're generating $300 million to $400 million in cash flow that will serve to offset. We do expect that probably between now and year-end, there will be some movement in rates, and of course, we've only guided through year-end. So at this juncture, we haven't really guided -- if the Treasury goes crazy, then that will obviously influence the guidance we come out with in December. But I think between foreign exchange volatility and interest rates, depending on who's got their mouth open on a given moment out there, it seems like the government is very -- more proactive in trying to direct economic thinking, which is a detriment, I think, overall because it does create uncertainty in volatility. But we're still on a low inflationary modality. We can all speculate and pretend we're autonomous. So stay tuned and we'll refresh what our thinking is in December."

Welcome to our third quarter 2006 (sic) [ 2016 ] conference call.Let me start by highlighting 3 key points.

Welcome to our third quarter 2006 (sic) [ 2016 ] conference call.
Let me start by highlighting 3 key points. First, I'm pleased to report another strong quarter, including the first-ever quarter with revenues over $500 million. This includes CooperVision reporting revenues over $400 million for the first time and CooperSurgical reporting revenues over $100 million for the first time. This resulted in non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.30 and free cash flow of $98 million.
Second, CooperVision posted strong results in all key areas of its business, resulting in 6% as reported in constant currency growth. Single-use silicone hydrogel lenses grew 40%, while 2-week and monthly silicone hydrogel lenses grew a combined 11%, both in constant currency.
Third, CooperSurgical had another strong quarter, posting revenue growth of 38% or 6% pro forma. Fertility was the highlight, posting the strongest quarter in many years with growth of 108% or 10% pro forma.
Moving into details. CooperVision reported second quarter revenues of $410 million, up 6%. This was another strong quarter and continues to show the strength of our product portfolio. The Americas grew 6% in constant currency with strength in multiple categories led by Biofinity and our 1 Day silicone hydrogel franchise. Our enhanced clariti lens continues to perform well, and MyDay had another strong quarter.
During the quarter, we received FDA approval for Avaira Vitality and began to launch in the U.S. in late July. You'll recall, Avaira Vitality is the replacement product for Avaira in the 2-week silicone hydrogel market. The market reaction has been positive. We remain optimistic about this upgraded product.
We also introduced Biofinity Energys at the American Optometric Association conference in July and began the launch in August. This premium Biofinity product has received excellent reviews, and we're confident we will have great success in this offering.
EMEA posted a solid quarter growing 3% year-over-year in constant currency against the tough comp. Growth was driven by Biofinity and the 1 Day silicone hydrogel franchise. Asia Pacific had a very strong quarter with 16% constant currency growth. Growth was strong throughout the region, driven by Biofinity and the 1 Day silicone hydrogel franchise. Within Japan, our MyDay sphere launch is progressing well, and we introduced MyDay toric during the quarter. We believe both MyDay sphere and toric have the potential to be a very successful premium offering in this market.
Turning to our product categories. Torics grew a healthy 10% year-over-year and multifocals grew 5%, both in constant currency. We remain the global leader in specialty lenses, and our success with Biofinity and clariti in both of these categories should continue to drive growth for many years.
Looking at silicone hydrogel lenses. These products grew 16% in constant currency and now represent 61% of our total sales. Within the 2-week and monthly space, Biofinity and Avaira combined to grow 11% in constant currency. We remain under-indexed for the 2-week and monthly silicone hydrogel space at 75% of revenue versus the market at 79%, so we expect to continue growing faster than the market given our strong product portfolio.
Regarding our silicone hydrogel 1 Day lenses, clariti and MyDay, they combined to grow 40% in constant currency. The biggest driver in the contact lens market is 1 Day growth, and we strongly believe we have the best product portfolio offering in this space as the only company with premium and mass market lenses, including a full portfolio of 1 Day silicone hydrogel, sphere, toric and multifocal lenses.
Now let me comment on the overall contact lens market. And remember, this information is on the last page of the earnings release. For the calendar quarter Q2, we continued taking share, growing 10% with the market up 5%. Geographically, CooperVision grew 8% in the Americas while the market was up 4%. In Asian Pacific, we grew 20% with the market up 4%. And in EMEA, we grew 9% with the market up 7%. On a modality basis, single-use lenses continue driving growth with CooperVision up 18% and the market up 10%. For non-silicone hydrogel -- for non-single-use lenses, we grew 7% while the market grew 1%.
As you can see, our growth remains diverse and strong. On a trailing 12-month basis, CooperVision grew 8% and the market grew 5%. Going forward, I expect the market to continue growing 4% to 6% over the next 5 years and most likely closer to 6%. The drivers will continue to be the shift to daily geographic expansion and the expansion of the wearer base. We expect to continue taking market share led by our strong silicone hydrogel portfolio.
Moving to CooperSurgical. We reported Q2 revenues of $105 million, up 38% year-over-year, driven by strong organic growth and acquisitions. On a pro forma basis, growth was up 6%.
Our fertility products led the way, up 108% or 10% pro forma. Within fertility, we had growth throughout the business and continue to believe our market-leading product portfolio, which includes medical devices, genetic testing and capital equipment, is the broadest portfolio in the space and should continue to drive growth for many years to come.
Within our office and surgical category, our growth moderated slightly from the last few quarters, up 3%. We're continuing to execute on several product launches, including our disposable hysteroscope EndoSee, and we believe we will -- we're well positioned in this segment going forward.
Regarding acquisitions, we've been actively working on integrating the deals we've done over the past year, and the strategic rationale behind these deals remains intact. We are very focused on becoming a full-service provider within the global IVF space.
Finally, on CooperSurgical, we're continuing to execute on several initiatives, which should significantly strengthen the business and pay dividends for many years to come. These include transitioning to a geographic sales model, adding sales reps in under-penetrated areas, launching products in new markets and increasing our focus on high-growth areas such as IVF genetic testing. To some degree, these investments are masking all our strong underlying operating performance, but it's critical that we lay the groundwork to support the business on a long-term growth -- from a long-term growth perspective.
Now turning to guidance. I'll let Greg go through the details, but let me touch on a few items. For Q4, we're guiding CooperVision to roughly 5% to 7.5% constant currency growth and CooperSurgical roughly to 5% to 8% pro forma growth. So similar growth to Q3. Regarding non-GAAP earnings per share for Q4, we're guiding to $2.15 to $2.30. Regarding fiscal 2017, it's too early to provide financial guidance, but I will say it should be a strong year given the momentum in our 2 businesses as well as recent currency moves. From a longer-term perspective, we're still targeting operating margins of 27% or higher in 2020.
In conclusion, I want to express my appreciation to our employees for all their hard work and dedication. I also want to say a special thank you to Greg Matz, who has announced his planned retirement after more than 6 years of service of our company, including roughly the last 5 years as our CFO. Greg will be greatly missed and we wish him the best in his future endeavors. With Greg's departure, we have announced that Al White, who many of you know really well, will succeed Greg as CFO. Al will assume this role in addition to his current leadership responsibilities with CooperSurgical. I am very confident that his leadership and abilities will allow us to continue driving long-term shareholder value. From a timing perspective, Greg will remain CFO until the end of the fiscal year, and then Al will take over the position. Greg will remain with us through March of next year to ensure a smooth transition.
And now I'll turn it over to Greg to cover our financial results."

Bob provided overall summary of our performance, including a review of the market and our revenue picture. I'm going to focus primarily on our non-GAAP results for the quarter. For the reconciliation to GAAP numb",1175,"Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Bob provided overall summary of our performance, including a review of the market and our revenue picture. I'm going to focus primarily on our non-GAAP results for the quarter. For the reconciliation to GAAP numbers, please refer to our earnings release.
Looking at gross margins. In Q3, the non-GAAP gross margin was 63.6% compared with 62.4% in the prior year. This increase is largely due to a favorable mix led by Biofinity and favorable FX offset by recent CSI acquisitions, which have lower gross margins. CooperVision on a non-GAAP basis reported gross margin of 64.2% versus 61.8% in Q3 of last year. The factors which impacted margin were the items I just mentioned. CooperSurgical had a non-GAAP gross margin of 61.2%, which compares to Q3 '15 of 65.4%. Acquisitions in the genetic testing space were the primary drivers for this reduction.
Now looking at operating expenses. On a non-GAAP basis, SG&A increased approximately 8% to $179.7 million or 35% of revenue, down from approximately 36% of revenue in the prior year. The primary driver behind this drop was strong spending controls as we had leverage in both CooperVision and CooperSurgical.
Now looking at R&D. In Q3, R&D on a non-GAAP basis decreased 2% to $16 million or 3.1% of revenue, down from 3.5% of revenue in the prior year. The primary driver is the leverage we're seeing from the Sauflon acquisition.
Moving to operating margins. For Q3, consolidated GAAP operating income and margin were $102.7 million and 19.9% of revenue versus $50.3 million and 10.9% of revenue in Q3 last year. Non-GAAP operating income and margin were $131.6 million and 25.6% of revenue versus $106.1 million and 23% of revenue for the prior year. The primary difference in the operating margin year-over-year is improved gross margins and operating expense leverage. In Q3, CooperVision's non-GAAP operating income and margin were $119.4 million and 29.1% of revenue versus $97.7 million and 25.3% of revenue in the prior year. CooperSurgical's non-GAAP operating income and margin were $23.5 million and 22.4% of revenue versus Q3 '15 of $19.5 million of operating income and 25.6% of revenue.
Looking at depreciation and amortization. In Q3, depreciation was $33.9 million, down $7.5 million year-over-year. Amortization was $15.6 million, up $3.1 million, reflecting our recent acquisition activity. Interest expense was $8 million for the quarter, up $3.3 million year-over-year, primarily due to higher debt interest rates associated with acquisitions.
Looking at the effective tax rate. In Q3, the non-GAAP effective tax rate was 7.7% versus a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 3.1% in Q3 '15. As a reminder, in the prior year, we had a higher dollar amount of Q3 discreet items related to prior years, which reversed in that quarter.
On earnings per share, our Q3 earnings per share on a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis was $1.79 and $2.30, respectively, versus $0.91 and $1.97 for GAAP and non-GAAP in the prior year.
Looking at some balance sheet and liquidity items. In Q3, we had cash provided by operations of $128.9 million with capital expenditures of $31.1 million, resulting in $97.8 million of free cash flow. Excluding integration cost of $6.5 million, adjusted free cash flow was $104.3 million. Total debt increased slightly within the quarter by $2.7 million to $1,444,100,000, primarily due to higher average cash balances and acquisitions, largely offset by operational cash flow generation.
Inventories decreased by approximately $3.3 million to $430.3 million from last quarter. In CooperVision, we saw overall inventory decline as growth in silicone daily inventory to support our product launches was offset by a reduction in our hydrogel inventory. In CooperSurgical, we saw a small increase largely due to new acquisitions. For the quarter, we're seeing month on hand at 6.5 months, down from 7 months last quarter. Days sales outstanding is at 54 days, same as last quarter and down 1 day from the prior year.
Now turning to guidance. For our main currencies, we're using 1.10 for the euro, 104 for the yen and 1.30 for the pound.
And looking at the full year. The consolidated revenue range is being raised on the low end to reflect our Q3 performance and is now $1.944 billion to $1.957 billion or approximately 6% to 7% pro forma growth, up from the previous 5.5% to 7% range.
For the fourth quarter, CooperVision's revenue range is $390 million to $400 million or roughly 5% to 7.5% constant currency growth. And CooperSurgical's revenue range is $106 million to $109 million or roughly 5% to 8% pro forma growth.
We expect non-GAAP gross margin for the fourth quarter to be slightly over 64%, driven by a strong quarter for CooperVision. This would result in a full year gross margin around 63%. OpEx is expected to be slightly under 39% for the fourth quarter as well as for the full year. Operating margin is expected to be around 26% in Q4, which would result in the full year margin being in the mid-24% range. Interest expense is expected to be a little over $7 million in Q4 or slightly over $28 million for the year. Our effective tax rate guidance is the same as last quarter. Thus, a full year rate of around 8% translates to 10.5% to 11% in Q4. Our expected share count is around 49.1 million shares. Our non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to be $2.15 to $2.30 in the fourth quarter, which equates to $8.32 to $8.47 for the full year.
From our last earnings call, currency was a positive in Q3, helping roughly $0.04. But we are expecting a negative impact in Q4 of roughly $0.02 from our previous guidance. Unfortunately, some of the positives we experienced in Q3 from currencies such as the yen and the euro are now being more than offset by the move in the pound since Brexit occurred in late June. As Bob mentioned, if currency holds, we should see a lot of benefit next year led by cost of goods as roughly 40% of CooperVision's product is manufactured in pounds with roughly a 6-month lag to the P&L. To be clear, this is roughly 40% of CooperVision's manufacturing, so on a consolidated basis, this is roughly 30% of our total cost of goods. Also note, the pound move associated with Brexit occurred in late June, so this positive impact starts in January, so a more muted positive impact in fiscal Q1 versus the remainder of the year.
The other point to note, as I mentioned earlier, is our effective tax rate guidance remains unchanged, which means a Q4 tax rate range of about 10.5% to 11%. Regarding cash flow, our CapEx was low this quarter but we do expect around $50 million in Q4, so around $170 million of CapEx for the year now. This should result in free cash flow over $300 million and adjusted free cash flow when excluding integration-related activity of well north of $300 million.
With that, let me turn it back to Kim for the Q&A session."

And Al, plus or minus, we'll see how it goes here over the next few years. That was a joke. And so, Bob, I just want to start with you just on kind of the monthly trend here. It's always tough to read CLI data and try to translate that given the off 1 month, how your fiscal quarter closes. But if I look, it looks as if maybe the forward month slowed a little bit. Looking at CLI data versus your reported number for the quarter, there has been some question of utilization issues out there. So just any color you can give us on kind of the monthly gating of what you have been seeing in the industry here over the last few months."

And yes, that's kind of jumped off the page a little, that July must have been soft relatively speaking. There's really primarily but one answer to that, and it's an industry-wide answer but not for the reasons most people would think. Rarely in the past have we talked about workdays in a month, but in this case, I'll highlight the fact that in July this year, there were 19 workdays compared to 22 last year because of the way weekends fell. And that translates to about a 17% -- 16%, 17% reduction in revenue if you had the same revenue per day or the orders per day. So pretty profound impact that weighted heavily because of the anomaly of the way weekends fell. Conversely, you get some of that back in August. Relative to the full quarter however, probably the best way to look at it is, workdays were down 3% this year in the third quarter, and they'll be up 1.5% in the fourth quarter. So there's one more workday in the fourth quarter. So it smooths out within the quarter, but there is an anomaly between July and August caused by workdays."

And now they're moving with a different package into the monthly modality with VITA. The amount of push they put behind VITA out of the gate [ph] was nothing compared to a year ago when they launched the OASYS 1 Day modality. So a lot more muted. Having said that, they're one of the more active ones in the space, albeit leveraging their OASYS franchise, if you will. Interestingly, they still do not call OASYS 1 Day a silicone hydrogel lens. But as we all know, it is a silicone hydrogel lens. As I think I indicated in the past, it was my belief that there would be some swapping of the 2-week noncompliant into the monthly compliant, which in essence is a clever way of saying it's a trade-up strategy, and I think we're seeing more and more of that as they're trying to continue the deceleration or the negative growth of the 2-week space, which they own 90% of, and migrate it into more profitable buckets. And there is no doubt profitable bucket means the 1 Day modality, but quite frankly, their strategy is not shortsighted, so to speak, when it comes to monthly price point yields more revenue than a 2-week noncompliant. And most -- the vast majority of the 2-week wearers are noncompliant. As far as our product in the non-1 Day space, we rolled out initially Biofinity Energys. It's getting -- it's very early in the game, but so far so good. There's a lot of excitement about a novel win that really addresses people with iPhones and being in front of screens -- TV screens and computer screens professionally. So there's a lot of interest by the eye care professionals that we have engaged in discussion thus far. We also are -- got approval to launch Vitality in the 2-week space. And Vitality is targeted to replace our low gross margin Avaira product in the 2-week space. That low gross margin came about a number of years ago when we had a recall and had to change the manufacturing technique, which became very cumbersome. So it is a significant step-up in gross margin, and it's very early in that launch. I think it was late July. And the intent there is, it will probably take us 2 to 3 years to roll out the entire family of the toric and the sphere worldwide in this migration. The sphere will go faster, and the majority of the Avaira product line is -- 70% of it or more is the sphere side. So that one will show up quicker. But it's an inventory turn. And when you have toric, it takes longer to transition, if you will, that. So we're excited about that. And then, of course, we have all the action that's going on in the 1 Day space."

A lot of it emanated out of EMEA. So it started in Europe and it came to the U.S. And really, Asia PAC is the last to get it all. In addition, we were clearly under-indexed overall in that market. We have invested over the last 3 or 4 years heavily in some areas like China and the surrounding geographic area. So we're starting to get momentum there. As far as MyDay in Japan, MyDay is a 1 Day product. There are silicone hydrogel players in the Japanese market. TruEye started there, so in essence, the silicone hydrogel market really started for all practical purposes in Japan. The beauty of having a MyDay toric in Japan, first of all, we have clariti available in the rest of the world. clariti has a sphere, a toric and a multifocal. In Japan, we only have MyDay at this juncture, and having a toric to go along with it has a halo effect. We will be the only one in the Japanese market with a silicone hydrogel sphere and a toric. While the toric market is not as mature as even the European market, it's early in the cycle there. It is a nice halo effect. A lot of practitioners want it, and particularly more so some of your independents in Japan. So it's a good story with not only the large retailers that exist there but also the independents. So yes, I do expect that we will put up robust numbers going forward, double-digit numbers, certainly in many quarters going forward in the Asia Pac marketplace."

So I'm just trying to think of -- is there any reason why we can't get above 65% next year? And then just a longer-term question on gross margin, I mean, when you did the Sauflon acquisition, you've kind of gotten this ability of doing silicone hydrogel without having the need for alcohol in the manufacturing process. And just trying to think of when you can take that manufacturing ability and start launching your own organic products with that kind of unique process and when we should expect some products like that."

At the same time, again, we are -- you saw the acquisitions that CooperSurgical is doing, and that will have some impact on the overall gross margins because as you get into more lab-based businesses, they're going to come with lower gross margins. And so as you said, we're not giving guidance for next year. You've seen the gross margins start to edge up throughout the entire year, so you can see that where we're looking at being in the fourth quarter is, again, higher than where we were in the third quarter."

However, I would agree with Greg's point that with the surgical acquisitions that we have made and with surgical now in around 61%, going up a little from there, there is a mix headwind that comes into play. So directionally, you're right, there's a tremendous amount of tailwinds to help us out. And we'll see where that all ends down on the road."

It's about up $0.02 for the full year, year-over-year. You talked about Brexit. One of the things to keep in mind, and I mentioned that in the script, is when it hit. It hit in late June. So we would start to see the benefit of that really coming in, in January. So Q1 will get a little bit of the benefit, and then provided the rates stay where they're at, you'll get that benefit throughout the rest of the year. So it's a nice benefit. From a CooperVision perspective, about 40% of our COGS are in pound-based manufacturing. And that's 30% roughly for the total company. So you'll see that flow through again a good part of next year provided the pound stays at about these rates. It's definitely down quite a bit from prior years, and that's -- we win more on -- when that happens from a pound perspective, we win more on the manufacturing than we lose on the revenue. But in the short term like Q4, we actually get impacted by the revenue first and the benefit will come out outside of this fiscal year."

And Alcon obviously is still in a remaking mode. B&L is in a remaking mode, changing their structure yet again, I think. And J&J, with a fairly weak product portfolio, is a good marketing company. And so I would compliment them on making the best of the product portfolio they have. Some of their programs, the whole disruption they've caused in the marketplace over the last 2 years with directionally going all the way with UPP and then directionally going the other way, they've taken some bumps in terms of their messaging. So one day they're saying to you, ""We're the friend with the independents with these products."" And then the next day, they are saying, ""Well, we have a different story to tell you, but it's not going to be UPP."" So there is no doubt there's some reaction to that. As far as VITA, for example, their new product launch in the monthly space, very much it's moving into a space where it's going against some franchised products, and Biofinity is a franchised product. And Biofinity is the product that has a toric, a sphere and a multifocal. Plus now it has things like Energys, which is an enhanced product for people that -- like 99% of the people on the planet, are using more and more technology. So I don't expect them to get too robust about that. I do think that's a lot different than what they did a year ago with OASYS 1 Day where they basically said, ""We want to participate in the shift of silicone hydrogel wearers, leaving the 2-week space and catch some in the 1 Day market with a huge trade-up."" So they're playing out that strategy. To a large degree, they cannibalize TruEye in the U.S., not worldwide but in the U.S. And OASYS 1 Day and TruEye and MyDay are giving the competition, in this case Alcon's TOTAL1, a run for their money. Now Alcon got out there first when there was only one competitor in that space, which was TruEye. J&J knew that was a deficient product in the U.S., and I'm not sure why in the U.S. when it actually has done pretty well historically in Japan. But for whatever reason, the U.S., it's a weaker product. So product rollouts, we hear a lot of noise about B&L on ULTRA, which is their answer to trying to refresh the product line for monthly products, monthly silicone hydrogel products. They've gone and expanded now, I think, from beyond a sphere. But a lot of what B&L is doing is capturing some of their legacy products, so PureVision and SofLens 66. So when you put it all together, B&L has some new products, ULTRA, but it's about holding breakeven with the entire product portfolio, including the fall-off of their legacy products. So worldwide, I think the last quarter, they're probably 1% to 2% growth. So they would have lost some margins here last quarter. Alcon, likewise, came up with 2% numbers in a market growing 5%. So they lost share, so the gainers were Cooper and with a robust 10% in J&J."

First question on August and July, yes, it's safe to assume that the anomalies between the weak July and August have to do with workdays, not anything ingrained in the marketplace. Relative to 2017 where we indicated we're not prepared at this juncture to put specifics on the line, no, we wouldn't comment one way or the other on what consensus is out there. I would highlight, however, that some of the analysts have more aggressive foreign exchange rates. And some analysts maybe -- I think Greg kind of hit the nail on the head. Some of the models on the impact of the pound, et cetera, emphasizing that it's on 30% of our worldwide instead of 40% of our worldwide cost of goods is an important attribute. So hopefully, we gave some color for people to sharpen the pencil with their models, in some case. But beyond saying there's a lot of tailwinds that we're standing by and happy with. And the foreign exchange rates will be whatever they are, and they change literally by the hour. We're not going to add any more color at this juncture. As far as the 10-10-10 hit, $0.10 in the second quarter, $0.10 in the third quarter, $0.10 in the fourth quarter, due to idle equipment and inventory write-offs that were over and above normal, they are in the numbers. There are other write-offs that are routine, and they continued throughout 2016 and will continue throughout 2017. Directionally, we indicated that a lot of those call-out charges are associated with some of our improving efficiency a lot more than we thought. So that led us to idling some equipment. So directionally, you can see the growth numbers in our 1 Day silicone hydrogel franchise of 40%. That certainly will go towards improving absorption. And importantly, when something goes from idle to use in production, it goes from a direct period charge, which is what the 10-10-10 is about, to -- suddenly it moves on to the balance sheet when it's making inventory. So that will continue throughout 2017, if you will."

And how does that translate to free cash flow generation? And I guess along with that, should we expect no additional Sauflon integration charges next year?

We were very capital intense. We got real efficient. We ramped down. And then all of a sudden, particularly with the Sauflon acquisition and with MyDay rollout of silicone hydrogel 1 Day, we became very capital intense again over the last several years. And lo and behold, we got real efficient, and here we are again, a little ahead of ourselves in the perfect world. The translation there is we think we have a pretty long runway on improving efficiencies that will continue over the next several -- multiple years, and that will be somewhat of a cap on CapEx requirements. We've taken the CapEx needs this year from $200 million down $30 million to $170 million. The outlook for post-2016 will be for less than that. We're thinking in that $150 million range. So year-over-year, a reduction of -- in that $50 million range. When you look at cash flow, we've now taken our -- should get to $300 million to a lot stronger statement above $300 million. So we're $300 million headed towards $400 million. No real change in that signal on that going forward. There is, in my opinion, multiple years of runway on some of those efficiencies that we're talking about. As far as Sauflon or interest charges, the -- what's built into our thinking is given that we have solid cash flow generation, we see that as part of a minimizer. So when you have $1.4 million in debt worldwide, you're generating $300 million to $400 million in cash flow that will serve to offset. We do expect that probably between now and year-end, there will be some movement in rates, and of course, we've only guided through year-end. So at this juncture, we haven't really guided -- if the Treasury goes crazy, then that will obviously influence the guidance we come out with in December. But I think between foreign exchange volatility and interest rates, depending on who's got their mouth open on a given moment out there, it seems like the government is very -- more proactive in trying to direct economic thinking, which is a detriment, I think, overall because it does create uncertainty in volatility. But we're still on a low inflationary modality. We can all speculate and pretend we're autonomous. So stay tuned and we'll refresh what our thinking is in December."

And clariti, which has a big European franchise, has a bigger hurdle. clariti is still the one that is targeting the mass market, and therefore, will always be most likely the bigger product. It's the one with the toric and the multifocal, which also will make it the bigger product. So it's still about, I don't know, 70-30-ish. However, with MyDay off of a lower base going into Japan, you may see it, as that rollout occurs, take over somewhat bigger portion of the pie given Japan is such a huge 1 Day market. I guess, Greg, on the tax rate?"

Typically, Q4 is a higher quarter. Last year was an exception to that, and that was based on a lot of work around the integration and restructuring cost, which allowed deductions. So the Q4 rate being in that 10.5% to 11% is probably the more typical outside just the last year or so."

Let me start by saying I'm very proud of our accomplishments this quarter, including record revenue and free cash flow. We also delivered a very strong fiscal year gaining share in the $7.2 billion contact lens industry, continuing our approach into the 1 Day silicone hydrogel space, expanding our Biofinity franchise and posting strong growth in our CooperSurgical business. We enter fiscal 2017 with strong momentum. We remain confident we will see market share gains in both of our businesses for the foreseeable future. 
Let me highlight 3 key points for the quarter. First, I'm pleased to report another strong quarter, with revenues over $5 million. This includes CooperVision reporting revenues over $400 million and CooperSurgical reporting revenues over $100 million. This resulted in non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.28 and free cash flow of $158 million. Second, CooperVision posted strong results in all key areas of its business, resulting in 10% as reported and 11% constant currency revenue growth. This includes 1 Day silicone hydrogel lenses growing 53% and 2-week and monthly silicone hydrogel lenses growing a combined 14%, both in constant currency. Third, CooperSurgical had another strong quarter, posting revenue growth of 20% or 6% pro forma. Fertility was a highlight, posting growth of 74% or 80% [ph] pro forma. Moving into the details. CooperVision reported fourth quarter revenue of $412 million, up 10% as reported and 11% in constant currency. This is the fastest CooperVision has grown in 11 quarters. The Americas grew 8% in constant currency with strengths in multiple categories including Biofinity and 1 Day silicone hydrogel lenses. Biofinity continues to be our workhorse and we began our launch in Biofinity Energys in mid-August to strong reviews. Our enhanced clariti lens is also performing well and MyDay had another very strong quarter. EMEA posted a very strong quarter, up 12% in constant currency. Growth was driven by Biofinity and our 1 Day silicone hydrogel franchise. Asia Pacific also had a very strong quarter, up 13% in constant currency. Growth is strong throughout the region, driven by Biofinity and our 1 Day silicone hydrogel franchise. Within Japan, our MyDay sphere and toric [ph] launch is progressing well. And while it's still early, we continue to believe MyDay can be a very successful premium offering in that market. 
Turning to product categories. Parts [ph] grew a healthy 14% and multifocals 10%, both in constant currency. We remain a global leader in specialty lenses, and our success in Biofinity and clariti in both of these categories should continue to drive growth for many years to come. 
Looking at silicone hydrogel lenses. These products grew 21% in constant currency and now represents 62% of our sales. We expect this strong growth to continue, given our product portfolio which includes Biofinity, Vitality, [ph] our newly launched 2-week product and our diverse 1 Day offering. And remember, the biggest driver in the contact lens market is the 1 Day growth, and we strongly believe we have the best product offering in this space as the only company selling premium and mass market silicone hydrogel lenses, including a portfolio of sphere, toric and multifocal lenses. We are also investing in sales and marketing to support our strong product portfolio. Forecasting new hires is always challenging, especially when you're evaluating opportunities around the world. But we believe CooperVision can add numerous sales reps and get a very nice return given our strong product platform, our capacity and our growth opportunities that we see. We believe this initiative -- we began this initiative in our fourth quarter and expect it to continue through fiscal 2017 and possibly into 2018. For competitive reasons, I won't get into many details but, suffice it to say, we carefully evaluate our hiring and expect to realize a solid return from this activity. 
Now let me comment on our overall contact lens market and remember, this information is on the last page of our earnings release. For calendar Q3 2016, we continue To taking share growing 6%, with the market up 1%. Geographically, CooperVision grew 3% in the Americas while the market was down 3%. In the EMEA, we were up 8%, and the market was up 7%. In Asia Pacific, we grew 9%, with the market up 3%. On a modality basis, single-use lenses continued driving growth, with CooperVision up 12% and the market up 8%. For non-single-use lenses, we grew 3% while the market declined 4%. As you can see, our growth remains diverse and strong. On a trailing 12-month basis, CooperVision grew 8% while the market grew 3%. Although the market remains choppy and hard to read at times, we continue to believe it will strengthen and grow towards [ph] 6% over the next 5 years driven by continuing shift to dailies, G rep expansion [ph] and an expansion of the wearer base. We expect to continue taking market share led by our strong portfolio of market-leading products. 
Moving to CooperSurgical, we reported fourth quarter revenues of $107 million, up 30% year-over-year, driven by organic growth and acquisitions. On a pro forma basis, we grew 6%. Fertility led the way, up 74% or 8% pro forma. Within Fertility, we had growth throughout the business and continue to believe our market-leading product portfolio which includes medical devices, genetic testing and capital equipment is the broadest portfolio in the space and should continue to drive growth for many years to come. 
Within our office and surgical category, growth was 5%. We're continuing to execute on several product launches, including our disposable hysteroscope EndoSee [ph], and we continue to see success in this area. Regarding other activity, we announced on November 6 that we acquired the Wallace [ph] portfolio from Smiths Medical [ph] for approximately $168 million. This is a great strategic fit with our existing global IVF portfolio as it brings the gold standard of embryo transport catheters [ph] along with several other premier products. Finally, CooperSurgical -- on CooperSurgical, we're busy integrating recent acquisitions but also executing on several initiatives which should significantly strengthen the business. These include transitioning to a global sales model, adding sales reps in underpenetrated areas, launching products into new markets and increasing our focus on high-growth areas such as IVF genetic testing. We have made a lot of progress in these areas over the past year and expect to continue -- even have more progress as we go forward.  
Now before I turn it over to Al, let me comment on a couple other items. We anticipate another strong year of revenue growth in 2017, including CooperVision growing 6% to 8% in constant currency and CooperSurgical growing 6% to 8% pro forma. We also remain bullish on our future and are updating our long-term objectives for operating margins of 28% and free cash flow generation of over $2 billion by 2021. 
In conclusion, I want to express my appreciation to our employees for all their hard work and dedication. And now I'll turn it over to Al to cover the financial results."

Bob did an excellent job covering revenues, so I'll focus on the rest of our Q4 financial performance along with guidance. Most of my commentary will be on a non-GAAP basis, and a full reconciliation between our GAAP and non-GAAP results is included in today's earnings release. 
For the quarter, gross margins were slightly over 64%, with both CooperVision and CooperSurgical up year-over-year. CooperVision improved roughly 50 basis points to 64.8% driven by factors such as currency and product mix while CooperSurgical grew roughly 30 basis points to 62.5% driven by cost-reduction efforts. Operating expenses grew 11.7% in the quarter driven heavily by CooperSurgical's acquisition-related activity. Within operating expenses, sales and marketing expenses grew 14% as both CooperVision and CooperSurgical executed on sales and marketing expansion plans to capitalize on strong product portfolios. Outside of sales and marketing, we drove leverage through general cost controls. Operating margins were 25.1%, up nicely from 24% last year driven by gross margin improvement and operating expense leverage. 
Moving to interest expense. We reported $5.3 million, which was lower than our guidance as we had a true-up of roughly $1.5 million. This true-up was associated with an overallocation of commitment fees in Q2 and Q3 related to the refinancing of our credit facilities completed in Q2 of this year. What should have happened is Q2 interest expense should have been lower by $600,000, and Q3 should have been lower by $900,000. Our effective tax rate was 10.3%, and the resulting non-GAAP EPS was $2.28 with roughly 49.3 million average shares outstanding. Total debt decreased this quarter by $110 million to roughly $1.33 billion driven by strong free cash flow of $158 million comprised of $193 million of operating cash flow and $35 million of CapEx. 
Regarding full year fiscal 2016 results, consolidated revenues were $1.967 billion, up 9.4% or 7.3% pro forma; CooperVision revenues were $1.577 billion, up 6% or 7.5% in constant currency; and CooperSurgical's revenues were $390 million, up 26% or 6.3% pro forma; non-GAAP EPS was $8.44, up 13%; lastly, free cash flow was $357 million. So all in, a very strong year. 
Moving to fiscal 2017 guidance. Let me start by commenting on currency which has moved significantly against us over the past month or so. For 2017, we're estimating a negative year-over-year currency impact to revenues of approximately $57 million and negative $0.10 to EPS. Incorporating this into our outlook, we expect fiscal 2017 consolidated revenues of $2.09 billion to $2.13 billion. This is comprised of $1.62 billion to $1.65 billion at CooperVision which equates to roughly 6% to 8% constant currency growth and $470 million to $480 million in CooperSurgical which equates to roughly 6% to 8% pro forma growth. We expect gross margins to improve to around 64.5% and operating margins to improve to 25%. Interest expense is expected to be around $28 million which includes the additional debt from the Wallace acquisition along with an assumption of 125 basis points rate increase. The effective tax rate is expected to be around 10%. This may be higher than many you were expecting, but it's based on our current forecast which includes fewer discrete items and is, thus, [ph] more of a true run rate of our current operations. 
Non-GAAP EPS for fiscal 2017 is expected to be in the range of $9 to $9.30 based on 49.4 million shares outstanding. To provide color on this, the higher year-over-year tax rate will negatively impact earnings by roughly $0.20, and FX will negatively impact earnings by $0.10. We also anticipate continuing to invest in sales and marketing above and beyond our normal level, and this will likely be in excess of $10 million or $0.20 in fiscal 2017. Having said that, we do have several positives such as accretion from our CSI acquisition, less idle equipment and inventory charges, savings from manufacturing improvements and the royalty roll-off, and these will help drive earnings growth. Regarding Q1, we anticipate revenues of $494 million to $508 million. This is comprised of $383 million to $393 million at CooperVision or roughly 7% to 10% constant currency growth, and $111 million to $115 million at CooperSurgical which equates to roughly 3% to 7% pro forma growth. For Q1 non-GAAP EPS, we expect $1.78 to $1.88 and note, this assumes a 10% tax rate as compared to last year's 3.9%. And with that, I'll hand it back to the operator for questions."

So when you look at the incremental sales and marketing investments and you look at the higher tax rate which is somewhere around $0.13 for Q1 combined with only getting the pound benefit for really the month of January, I think that's probably where -- that probably comprises, certainly, the vast majority of the delta."

And probably the best way to think about it is that, a year ago, the Americas showed 11% growth and the entire market showed 8% growth worldwide driven very heavily by the Americas. This year, that kind of slips splits [ph] to a negative of 3% for the Americas and only 1% for worldwide. So you really have to look at 5 quarters or better yet, even 2 rolling years because of what happened a year ago was all the activity by J&J as they rolled out new products or things going on with UPP, so channel fill, [ph] so you end up with probably a delink [ph] between the way data comes into CLI and the public company. There's variances there, too, and including some of the activity associated with that. So when I think of the market, I kind of say, ""All right, let's put the 2 together."" Last year is 11, this year it's negative 3, that's 8. Divided by 2, it looks more like 4 to me. And in the interim, we had a fourth quarter 4, a second quarter 4 and then a flat first quarter last year. So last year -- my way of thinking, last year rippled into the first quarter, so that 11% third quarter showed up as a neutral first quarter. The long and the short of it is it's probably best to look at it as 5 -- the average of 5 quarters if you're going to make much sense out of it."

We're obviously rolling out some new products. We had a slightly easier comp from a year ago, particularly relative to the Europe theater which is going through consolidation last year with Sauflon but, by and large, a solid quarter. As far as tax reform, well, tax reform has been talked about forever, and I could give you 2 theories on -- if I just walked in on one thing that's being turned around out there, 35% going to 15%, suffice                                                                                              it to say that wouldn't be bad for most anyone and will serve as a neutralizer to a degree on however it shakes out the rest of the world. There are too many different debates going on out there. There's the fact that any meaningful change would require a vote of 60% of the Senate to go along with it, and that could be tough or only come with a lot of compromise. So I think it would be way premature to know if it's a net plus or a net minus, but most people wouldn't complain about a huge reduction in the corporate tax rate."

If you have a vacancy or you're under-indexed in a geographic area, and I've always used an example of a city like Las Vegas and said, ""You know, if you didn't have a salesperson in Las Vegas, it's a pretty big town, maybe you ought to have a salesperson there as you have a lot of products to talk about."" So in some cases, it's adding junior people to support senior people in other places that will be having feet on the Street where you're currently making telephone calls and kind of piggybacking on that."

Having said that, we kind of targeted for basically some approaching 50% for the year, a slight acceleration from the prior years, the way we thought about it coming into this year. So it's kind of moving along those lines. And the way it's moving is, obviously, the more mature market is EMEA where these products started out, both MyDay and clariti. The least mature is Japan and the Americas, so we're very early in the cycle in those 2 areas and rapidly expanding the offering even in Europe. So it's geographically across all theaters and very much -- we've now kind of did the redo of the first clariti that was out there, and that's performing real well. So we're now expanding our attention into more than our own accounts. Initially, we had to take care of our accounts that we had given the first generation, if you will, product to. So a long way to go, and we're very early in the cycle and obviously moving off of a larger base as we go forward. As far as the deceleration in the planned replacement area, the non-1 Day, really, that market, if we look at it from a 2.5-year, 3-year perspective, is around breakeven, with the growth all being driven by the 1 Day. That's -- and pretty consistent over the last 4 years, and we don't see that changing. Actually, it's been consistent a lot -- a driver longer than 4 years, but more so outside the U.S. and more recently inside the U.S., so don't see any changes there. There is activity in the planned replacement market, things like Biofinity, obviously, are still putting up terrific numbers so there's room to grow. And particularly as we think about the geographic expansion, some of what goes into China and into some of those theaters, maybe a little less weighted initially in the 1 Day modality, although that -- we can't make that statement about every country. So a lot of opportunities even in the planned replacement arena, and we're obviously continuing to grow that while the market may -- not growing, if you will."

And as I indicated in my commentary, to the extent that we'll look [ph] into 2018 where we're getting the top line growth we want, we will continue that modality. The driver there is if you have a lot of products to talk about and you have the capacity then you should try selling the product and leverage the capacity. We know we have excess capacity, and why not use it? So to the extent we're getting our payback, which will include diminishing the idle charges that we're incurring in cost of goods as a byproduct, we're going to do it. And we obviously have an agenda of gaining market share, and we've certainly done a good job of that the last 7 years. And if I look at it over the last 12 months, it's been greater than 2% that we've grown in the market. You can't make much out of this quarter's numbers because we grew 6 in the market, 1 -- grew 1. I'm not going to say we're growing 6x the market but, obviously, we are growing around that 2x. Relative to the rest of operating cost, this fusion, [ph] G&A and even, to a lesser extent, R&D, we expect to get leverage out of those around the world. So it isn't to say that operating cost in total will keep going up as a percentage of revenue. [indiscernible] plan, I'm not going to get too detailed into it because there are too many soft spots and too many assumptions you'd have to make but I guess I'd point one thing out which I think is very important, when we look at -- people think we're very oriented towards outside the U.S. the way we think. But the fact of the matter is our headcount around the world is pretty balanced U.S. and the rest of the world, both as to revenue and as to headcount. And that is after you count Puerto Rico where we make 1 billion lenses in Puerto Rico. That is a possession of the United States and is part of U.S. So when we kind of think about this, we convey [ph] that we're hearing about, we, the U.S. against the rest of the world. We, the U.S. 5% compared to 95% of those outside the U.S. It is not as imbalanced in Cooper's model as some may think it is. Long and the short of it is I'm not going to overreact to any theory that's thrown around out there, and I'll react to legislation. There hasn't been meaningful legislations since, I think, 1986. There's been a few things along the way that have come and gone, but it would be very premature to overanalyze it."

So just wondering if you're doubling down on that channel or expanding in other retail channels? And then, in terms of the competitive landscape, it would just be great to get an update, sort of where [indiscernible] sits at this point. It looks like they're still in a position of giving up some share and similarly, Bausch & Lomb and J&J."

Our focus in terms of feet on the street and whether it's independent ODs or ODs that are at the retail level is OD, wherever they are and a lot of -- Cooper is very open as part of its strategy, being, it could be branded, affinity or it could be private label. So we're indifferent to what is called but what we have learned in the past is just because you send a bunch of your product, whether it's private label or branded, to a large retailer, if you don't work it, it's not going to work itself. You have to go to OD, whether they're under the umbrella of a retailer or not. That as contrasted to maybe an online or some other mechanism, we don't waste our time with that. If you don't like subscription, you don't have our attention and that will continue. Relative to the competitive landscape, yes, our competitors continue to be in various stages of disarray. We know what the CEO and Chairman of Novartis basically said. They are restructuring that organization. The risk disruption there. They have a tired product line, B&L, likewise is in a very disruptive environment, to say the least. And J&J has done a pretty good job of marketing 1 product, OASYS, by any other name is OASYS. So it's all over. 1 Day, 1 week, 2 week, 1 month, called Vita. So of the 3 competitors, I would say J&J kind of have, in fact, together, better than the other 2. But having said that, they're obviously presenting some opportunities in their approach. Are they in UPP, 1 Day and then they're out of UPP the next day? UPP wholesale across all of their products and then they had the entire team come up with a different plan. So we've been pretty steady state in the way we're approaching the market. We have the product portfolio and well, we kind of feel good about our competitors."

You had talked previously about 50% of the $10 billion market to be in the 1 Day modality and of that, about somewhere between 20% and 77% to be in silicone hydrogel and thought maybe the middle of that made sense. With more experience now of how these products are rolling out, do you have confidence that over the next few years that you're going to be turning more above that 50% of the market towards that 77%?

And therefore, it's now I think over 20% of the -- or close to 25% of the 1 Day market. So I do believe, the 1 Day will be more than 50% of the, let's say, that target $10 billion down the road 2020, 2021. And who knows? Foreign exchange keeps coming along kind of putting a dent into some of that, so assuming the dollar stabilizes, we're directionally headed towards that $10 billion. 1 Day will be greater than 50% and there's no doubt that silicone hydrogel 1 Day will be much greater than 20% of that 1 Day market. And will it be similar to the planned replacement where it's close to 80%? 79% to 80% or a lot less? I think there are some reasons that it won't -- well beyond 50% barrier short-term because there's so much activity in the non-silicone hydrogel mass market space, that somewhat barrier. To answer your question about our cost coming down, MyDay is making good progress. We believe it's in the 30s now and we would expect that in 2018 sometime will be honing in on that 50% target for 1 Day gross margin. And clariti, because of its novel approach to manufacturing and cost, will not be a drag and it's not a drag today on our gross margin. So the mix you see is holding its own within that mix and is not a headwind on gross margin percentage."

So nothing -- I would say, nothing imminent where it's certainly in a non-investment mode over the next 1 to 2 years. So the roll-off of idle equipment is somewhat a function of success of the growth of our various areas whether it's Vitality, whether it's 1 Day, whether its clariti, the growth in those products will form the basis of consuming some of that idle equipment over the next 1 to 2 years. We indicated partly because of the continuing successes in cutting cost and getting better yields and getting better throughput, we're now talking about lines with north of $80 million unit production that 2 years ago, we didn't even have on the drawing board by way of a thought. So those kind of profound changes means we'll be able to continue to ramp up and continue to be ahead of the curve in terms of the demand side for quite a while in some of those areas, clariti and MyDay.

Continuing growth like that put those lines to use and the idle equipment goes down. So the expansion focus on sales and marketing to drive topline growth and driving single-use, one of the nice benefits of that is it's going to put equipment to work. We obviously don't need to buy new equipment which helps free cash flow and we would move equipment charges and put that into production. So I would say that we're still kind of looking at that $0.10 a quarter here to start the year and depending upon our success that will moved down and hopefully move to 0 by the end of this year but more likely, we'll see those charges even moved into 2018 a little bit."

Let me start by saying I'm very proud of our accomplishments this quarter, including record revenue and free cash flow. We also delivered a very strong fiscal year gaining share in the $7.2 billion contact lens industry, continuing our approach into the 1 Day silicone hydrogel space, expanding our Biofinity franchise and posting strong growth in our CooperSurgical business. We enter fiscal 2017 with strong momentum. We remain confident we will see market share gains in both of our businesses for the foreseeable future. 
Let me highlight 3 key points for the quarter. First, I'm pleased to report another strong quarter, with revenues over $5 million. This includes CooperVision reporting revenues over $400 million and CooperSurgical reporting revenues over $100 million. This resulted in non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.28 and free cash flow of $158 million. Second, CooperVision posted strong results in all key areas of its business, resulting in 10% as reported and 11% constant currency revenue growth. This includes 1 Day silicone hydrogel lenses growing 53% and 2-week and monthly silicone hydrogel lenses growing a combined 14%, both in constant currency. Third, CooperSurgical had another strong quarter, posting revenue growth of 20% or 6% pro forma. Fertility was a highlight, posting growth of 74% or 8% pro forma. Moving into the details. CooperVision reported fourth quarter revenue of $412 million, up 10% as reported and 11% in constant currency. This is the fastest CooperVision has grown in 11 quarters. The Americas grew 8% in constant currency with strengths in multiple categories including Biofinity and 1 Day silicone hydrogel lenses. Biofinity continues to be our workhorse and we began our launch in Biofinity Energys in mid-August to strong reviews. Our enhanced clariti lens is also performing well and MyDay had another very strong quarter. EMEA posted a very strong quarter, up 12% in constant currency. Growth was driven by Biofinity and our 1 Day silicone hydrogel franchise. Asia Pacific also had a very strong quarter, up 13% in constant currency. Growth is strong throughout the region, driven by Biofinity and our 1 Day silicone hydrogel franchise. Within Japan, our MyDay sphere and toric launch is progressing well. And while it's still early, we continue to believe MyDay can be a very successful premium offering in that market. 
Turning to product categories. Torics grew a healthy 14% and multifocals 10%, both in constant currency. We remain a global leader in specialty lenses, and our success in Biofinity and clariti in both of these categories should continue to drive growth for many years to come. 
Looking at silicone hydrogel lenses. These products grew 21% in constant currency and now represents 62% of our sales. We expect this strong growth to continue, given our product portfolio which includes Biofinity, Vitality, our newly launched 2-week product and our diverse 1 Day offering. And remember, the biggest driver in the contact lens market is the 1 Day growth, and we strongly believe we have the best product offering in this space as the only company selling premium and mass market silicone hydrogel lenses, including a portfolio of sphere, toric and multifocal lenses. We are also investing in sales and marketing to support our strong product portfolio. Forecasting new hires is always challenging, especially when you're evaluating opportunities around the world. But we believe CooperVision can add numerous sales reps and get a very nice return given our strong product platform, our capacity and our growth opportunities that we see. We believe this initiative -- we began this initiative in our fourth quarter and expect it to continue through fiscal 2017 and possibly into 2018. For competitive reasons, I won't get into many details but, suffice it to say, we carefully evaluate our hiring and expect to realize a solid return from this activity. 
Now let me comment on our overall contact lens market and remember, this information is on the last page of our earnings release. For calendar Q3 2016, we continue taking share, growing 6%, with the market up 1%. Geographically, CooperVision grew 3% in the Americas while the market was down 3%. In the EMEA, we were up 8%, and the market was up 7%. In Asia Pacific, we grew 9%, with the market up 3%. On a modality basis, single-use lenses continued driving growth, with CooperVision up 12% and the market up 8%. For non-single-use lenses, we grew 3% while the market declined 4%. As you can see, our growth remains diverse and strong. On a trailing 12-month basis, CooperVision grew 8% while the market grew 3%. Although the market remains choppy and hard to read at times, we continue to believe it will strengthen and grow towards 6% over the next 5 years driven by continuing shift to dailies, geographic expansion and an expansion of the wearer base. We expect to continue taking market share led by our strong portfolio of market-leading products. 
Moving to CooperSurgical, we reported fourth quarter revenues of $107 million, up 30% year-over-year, driven by organic growth and acquisitions. On a pro forma basis, we grew 6%. Fertility led the way, up 74% or 8% pro forma. Within Fertility, we had growth throughout the business and continue to believe our market-leading product portfolio which includes medical devices, genetic testing and capital equipment is the broadest portfolio in the space and should continue to drive growth for many years to come. 
Within our office and surgical category, growth was 5%. We're continuing to execute on several product launches, including our disposable hysteroscope, EndoSee, and we continue to see success in this area. Regarding other activity, we announced on November 6 that we acquired the Wallace portfolio from Smiths Medical for approximately $168 million. This is a great strategic fit with our existing global IVF portfolio as it brings the gold standard of embryo transfer catheters along with several other premier products. Finally, CooperSurgical -- on CooperSurgical, we're busy integrating recent acquisitions but also executing on several initiatives which should significantly strengthen the business. These include transitioning to a global sales model, adding sales reps in underpenetrated areas, launching products into new markets and increasing our focus on high-growth areas such as IVF genetic testing. We have made a lot of progress in these areas over the past year and expect to continue -- even have more progress as we go forward.  
Now before I turn it over to Al, let me comment on a couple other items. We anticipate another strong year of revenue growth in 2017, including CooperVision growing 6% to 8% in constant currency and CooperSurgical growing 6% to 8% pro forma. We also remain bullish on our future and are updating our long-term objectives for operating margins of 28% and free cash flow generation of over $2 billion by 2021. 
In conclusion, I want to express my appreciation to our employees for all their hard work and dedication. And now I'll turn it over to Al to cover the financial results."

Bob did an excellent job covering revenues, so I'll focus on the rest of our Q4 financial performance along with guidance. Most of my commentary will be on a non-GAAP basis, and a full reconciliation between our GAAP and non-GAAP results is included in today's earnings release. 
For the quarter, gross margins were slightly over 64%, with both CooperVision and CooperSurgical up year-over-year. CooperVision improved roughly 50 basis points to 64.8% driven by factors such as currency and product mix while CooperSurgical grew roughly 30 basis points to 62.5% driven by cost-reduction efforts. Operating expenses grew 11.7% in the quarter driven heavily by CooperSurgical's acquisition-related activity. Within operating expenses, sales and marketing expenses grew 14% as both CooperVision and CooperSurgical executed on sales and marketing expansion plans to capitalize on strong product portfolios. Outside of sales and marketing, we drove leverage through general cost controls. Operating margins were 25.1%, up nicely from 24% last year driven by gross margin improvement and operating expense leverage. 
Moving to interest expense. We reported $5.3 million, which was lower than our guidance as we had a true-up of roughly $1.5 million. This true-up was associated with an overallocation of commitment fees in Q2 and Q3 related to the refinancing of our credit facilities completed in Q2 of this year. What should have happened is Q2 interest expense should have been lower by $600,000, and Q3 should have been lower by $900,000. Our effective tax rate was 10.3%, and the resulting non-GAAP EPS was $2.28 with roughly 49.3 million average shares outstanding. Total debt decreased this quarter by $110 million to roughly $1.33 billion driven by strong free cash flow of $158 million comprised of $193 million of operating cash flow and $35 million of CapEx. 
Regarding full year fiscal 2016 results, consolidated revenues were $1.967 billion, up 9.4% or 7.3% pro forma; CooperVision revenues were $1.577 billion, up 6% or 7.5% in constant currency; and CooperSurgical's revenues were $390 million, up 26% or 6.3% pro forma; non-GAAP EPS was $8.44, up 13%; lastly, free cash flow was $357 million. So all in, a very strong year. 
Moving to fiscal 2017 guidance. Let me start by commenting on currency which has moved significantly against us over the past month or so. For 2017, we're estimating a negative year-over-year currency impact to revenues of approximately $57 million and negative $0.10 to EPS. Incorporating this into our outlook, we expect fiscal 2017 consolidated revenues of $2.09 billion to $2.13 billion. This is comprised of $1.62 billion to $1.65 billion at CooperVision which equates to roughly 6% to 8% constant currency growth and $470 million to $480 million in CooperSurgical which equates to roughly 6% to 8% pro forma growth. We expect gross margins to improve to around 64.5% and operating margins to improve to 25%. Interest expense is expected to be around $28 million which includes the additional debt from the Wallace acquisition along with an assumption of 125 basis points rate increase. The effective tax rate is expected to be around 10%. This may be higher than many you were expecting, but it's based on our current forecast which includes fewer discrete items and is, thus, more of a true run rate of our current operations. 
Non-GAAP EPS for fiscal 2017 is expected to be in the range of $9 to $9.30 based on 49.4 million shares outstanding. To provide color on this, the higher year-over-year tax rate will negatively impact earnings by roughly $0.20, and FX will negatively impact earnings by $0.10. We also anticipate continuing to invest in sales and marketing above and beyond our normal level, and this will likely be in excess of $10 million or $0.20 in fiscal 2017. Having said that, we do have several positives such as accretion from our CSI acquisition, less idle equipment and inventory charges, savings from manufacturing improvements and the royalty roll-off, and these will help drive earnings growth. Regarding Q1, we anticipate revenues of $494 million to $508 million. This is comprised of $383 million to $393 million at CooperVision or roughly 7% to 10% constant currency growth, and $111 million to $115 million at CooperSurgical which equates to roughly 3% to 7% pro forma growth. For Q1 non-GAAP EPS, we expect $1.78 to $1.88 and note, this assumes a 10% tax rate as compared to last year's 3.9%. And with that, I'll hand it back to the operator for questions."

So when you look at the incremental sales and marketing investments and you look at the higher tax rate which is somewhere around $0.13 for Q1 combined with only getting the pound benefit for really the month of January, I think that's probably where -- that probably comprises, certainly, the vast majority of the delta."

And probably the best way to think about it is that, a year ago, the Americas showed 11% growth and the entire market showed 8% growth worldwide driven very heavily by the Americas. This year, that kind of splits to a negative of 3% for the Americas and only 1% for worldwide. So you really have to look at 5 quarters or better yet, even 2 rolling years because of what happened a year ago was all the activity by J&J as they rolled out new products or things going on with UPP, so channel fill, so you end up with probably a delink between the way data comes into CLI and the public company. There's variances there, too, and including some of the activity associated with that. So when I think of the market, I kind of say, ""All right, let's put the 2 together."" Last year is 11%, this year it's negative 3%, that's 8%. Divided by 2, it looks more like 4% to me. And in the interim, we had a fourth quarter, 4%; a second quarter, 4%; and then a flat first quarter last year. So last year -- my way of thinking, last year rippled into the first quarter, so that 11% third quarter showed up as a neutral first quarter. The long and the short of it is it's probably best to look at it as 5 -- the average of 5 quarters if you're going to make much sense out of it."

We're obviously rolling out some new products. We had a slightly easier comp from a year ago, particularly relative to the Europe theater which is going through consolidation last year with Sauflon but, by and large, a solid quarter. As far as tax reform, well, tax reform has been talked about forever, and I could give you 2 theories on -- if I just walked in on one thing that's being turned around out there, 35% going to 15%, suffice                                                                                              it to say that wouldn't be bad for most anyone and will serve as a neutralizer to a degree on however it shakes out the rest of the world. There are too many different debates going on out there. There's the fact that any meaningful change would require a vote of 60% of the Senate to go along with it, and that could be tough or only come with a lot of compromise. So I think it would be way premature to know if it's a net plus or a net minus, but most people wouldn't complain about a huge reduction in the corporate tax rate."

And as I indicated, I'm not going to start quoting numbers of adds in terms of number of sales force we're adding. But suffice it to say, we also are rolling out many new products. Some of them are conceptually new like Energys. So there'll be a certain amount of energy also supporting those new products. And putting the 2 together, we will -- we're giving you guidance at 6% to 8% top line growth for both Surgical and Vision. We will be, suffice it to say, growing our sales and marketing at a rate faster primarily in the area of both feet on the street and, to a                                                                       lesser extent, the marketing support behind that. Beyond that, we're not -- like I said, we're not going to really get into how under-indexed we are compared to our competitors. And I would say it's -- in many cases, it will be not across the board. If you have a vacancy or you're under-indexed in a geographic area, and I've always used an example of a city like Las Vegas and said, ""You know, if you didn't have a salesperson in Las Vegas, it's a pretty big town, maybe you ought to have a salesperson there as you have a lot of products to talk about."" So in some cases, it's adding junior people to support senior people in other places that will be having feet on the street where you're currently making telephone calls and kind of piggybacking on that."

Having said that, we kind of targeted for basically some approaching 50% for the year, a slight acceleration from the prior years, the way we thought about it coming into this year. So it's kind of moving along those lines. And the way it's moving is, obviously, the more mature market is EMEA where these products started out, both MyDay and clariti. The least mature is Japan and the Americas, so we're very early in the cycle in those 2 areas and rapidly expanding the offering even in Europe. So it's geographically across all theaters and very much -- we've now kind of did the redo of the first clariti that was out there, and that's performing real well. So we're now expanding our attention into more than our own accounts. Initially, we had to take care of our accounts that we had given the first generation, if you will, product to. So a long way to go, and we're very early in the cycle and obviously moving off of a larger base as we go forward. As far as the deceleration in the planned replacement area, the non-1 Day, really, that market, if we look at it from a 2.5-year, 3-year perspective, is around breakeven, with the growth all being driven by the 1 Day. That's -- and pretty consistent over the last 4 years, and we don't see that changing. Actually, it's been consistent a lot -- a driver longer than 4 years, but more so outside the U.S. and more recently inside the U.S., so don't see any changes there. There is activity in the planned replacement market, things like Biofinity, obviously, are still putting up terrific numbers so there's room to grow. And particularly as we think about the geographic expansion, some of what goes into China and into some of those theaters, maybe a little less weighted initially in the 1 Day modality, although that -- we can't make that statement about every country. So a lot of opportunities even in the planned replacement arena, and we're obviously continuing to grow that while the market may -- not growing, if you will."

And as I indicated in my commentary, to the extent that we look into 2018 where we're getting the top line growth we want, we will continue that modality. The driver there is if you have a lot of products to talk about and you have the capacity then you should try selling the product and leverage the capacity. We know we have excess capacity, and why not use it? So to the extent we're getting our payback, which will include diminishing the idle charges that we're incurring in cost of goods as a byproduct, we're going to do it. And we obviously have an agenda of gaining market share, and we've certainly done a good job of that the last 7 years. And if I look at it over the last 12 months, it's been greater than 2% that we've grown in the market. You can't make much out of this quarter's numbers because we grew 6 in the market, 1 -- grew 1. I'm not going to say we're growing 6x the market but, obviously, we are growing around that 2x. Relative to the rest of operating cost, distribution, G&A and even, to a lesser extent, R&D, we expect to get leverage out of those around the world. So it isn't to say that operating cost in total will keep going up as a percentage of revenue. As far as the buy-in plan, I'm not going to get too detailed into it because there are too many soft spots and too many assumptions you'd have to make but I guess I'd point one thing out which I think is very important, when we look at -- people think we're very oriented towards outside the U.S. the way we think. But the fact of the matter is our headcount around the world is pretty balanced U.S. and the rest of the world, both as to revenue and as to headcount. And that is after you count Puerto Rico where we make 1 billion lenses in Puerto Rico. That is a possession of the United States and is part of U.S. So when we kind of think about this, we, they that we're hearing about -- we, the U.S. against the rest of the world. We, the U.S., 5% compared to 95% of those outside the U.S. It is not as imbalanced in Cooper's model as some may think it is. Long and the short of it is I'm not going to overreact to any theory that's thrown around out there, and I'll react to legislation. There hasn't been meaningful legislations since, I think, 1986. There's been a few things along the way that have come and gone, but it would be very premature to overanalyze it."

We assumed a 25 basis point rate increase happening, with the Fed moving here in the month of December so kind of fully baked in that end for the year, if you will. We -- probably a little conservative on interest expense, where we're at, based on the amount of cash flow we're generating and so forth and where we'll come out on the pricing grid, but we'll see how that plays out. When you look at the tax rate itself, we've been running kind of on a look-through basis, if you will, somewhere around that 10%. We've had a number of discrete items that have come through. We've had acquisition-related activity and so forth that have allowed some write-offs and so forth that have pushed the tax rate down. Could it come in lower than 10%? It could, but I would tell you right now, based on what we have today, we're looking at somewhere around that 10%, with Q1, Q2, Q4 probably being somewhat similar and, as usual, Q3 being a little lighter but not as dramatic as what you've seen in prior years where you would see a quarter that was a 3% or 4% quarter as an example."

And then I think about your private label business, it's somewhere around 25% or 30% of revenue, and I'd assume that's a lower touch business. Just wanting to understand why is the big focus on sales force additions at this point and what's really driving that? And then maybe, Al, for you, a follow-up question. I think I agree your EPS guidance looks like maybe there's some levers of conservatism in there, but 6% to 8% CVI growth in a fairly choppy market and maybe in a med tech market that's a little uncertain right now doesn't feel overly conservative to me, so maybe if you can address your thoughts on the 6% to 8% CVI growth for '17, that would be helpful as well."

And J&J, if we're going to do allocations against market share, with their 40% market share or there and thereabout to our 23%, that would barely line up. I think more importantly is it really is about if you have the product and we have the broadest product portfolio and you have the capacity, something we have not had in the past at least relative to clariti, MyDay and, to a lesser extent, even Biofinity. So if you have your -- the capacity you want, why wouldn't you test the water and see how good your products are? Why wouldn't you go after your competitors' accounts more aggressively? And we can't do it if we're under-indexed on feet on the street. So it's one thing if you're kind of growing methodically and you're confined with how much you can grow, it's another thing if you don't have those limitations which I'll call capacity."

So I think that's a very fair question. I would tell you I think that giving a 6% to 8% range in today's world is prudent and a good way to look at the business, but I don't think anybody would be very happy, I'll put to you that way, if we were growing in the 6% to 7% range."

And a lot of our -- Cooper is very open as part of its strategy being -- it could be a branded entity or it could be private label. So we're indifferent to what it's called. But what we have learned in the past is just because you send a bunch of your product, whether it's private label or branded, to a large retailer, if you don't work it, it's not going to work itself. You have to go to the OD, whether they're under an umbrella of a retailer or not. That has contrasted to maybe an online or some other mechanism, we don't waste our time with that. If you don't like the prescription, you don't have our attention, and that will continue. Relative to the competitive landscape, yes, our competitors continue to be in various stages of disarray, Alcon, we know what the CEO and Chairman of Novartis basically said, they are restructuring that organization. There is disruption there. They have a tired product line. B&L likewise is in a very disruptive environment to say the least. And J&J has done a pretty good job of marketing 1 product, OASYS. By any other name, it's OASYS, so it's all over, 1-day, 1-week, 2-week, 1-month called VITA. So of the 3 competitors, I would say J&J kind of has its act together better than the other 2. But having said that, they're obviously presenting some opportunities in their approach, they're in UPP one day and then they're out of UPP the next day. UPP wholesale across all of their products and then they vacate the entire thing, come up with a different plan. So we've been pretty steady state in the way we're approaching the market. We have the product portfolio and we kind of feel good about our competitors."

And then Bob, for you, you had talked previously about 50% of the $10 billion market to be in the 1 day modality; of that, about somewhere between 20% and 77% to be in silicone hydrogel, and thought maybe the middle of that made sense. With more experience now of how these products are rolling out, do you have more confidence that over the next few years that you're going to be turning more above that 50% of the market towards that 77%?

So I do believe the 1-days will be more than 50% of the -- let's say, that target, $10 billion down the road 2020, 2021. And who knows? Foreign exchange keeps coming along, kind of putting a dent into some of that. So assuming the dollar stabilizes, we're directionally headed towards that $10 billion. 1 Day will be greater than 50%, and there's no doubt that silicone hydrogel 1 Day will be much greater than 20% of that 1 day market. And will it be similar to the planned replacement where it's close to 80%, 79% to 80%, or a lot less? I think there are some reasons that it won't go well beyond the 50% barrier short-term because there is so much activity in the non-silicone hydrogel mass market space that will be somewhat a barrier. To answer your question about our cost coming down, MyDay is making good progress. We believe it's in the 30s now and we would expect that in 2018, some time, will be honing in on that 50% target for 1 Day gross margin. And clariti, because of its novel approach to manufacturing and cost, will not be a drag. And it's not a drag today on our gross margin. So the mix you see is holding its own within that mix and is not a headwind on gross margin percentages."

So nothing -- I would say, nothing imminent where it's suddenly in a non-investment mode over the next 1 to 2 years. The roll-off of idle equipment is somewhat a function of the success of the growth of our various areas. Whether it's Vitality, whether it's MyDay, whether it's clariti, the growth in those products will form the basis of consuming some of that idle equipment over the next 1 to 2 years. We indicated partly because of the continuing successes in cutting cost and getting better yields and getting better throughput, we're now talking about lines with north of $80 million unit production that 2 years ago we didn't even have on the drawing board by way of a thought. So those kind of profound changes means we'll be able to continue to ramp up and continue to be ahead of the curve in terms of the demand side for quite a while in some of those areas, clariti and MyDay.

Continuing growth like that put those lines to use and the idle equipment goes down. So the expansion, the focus on sales and marketing to drive topline growth and driving single-use, one of the nice benefits of that is it's going to put equipment to work. We obviously don't need to buy new equipment, which helps free cash flow and we would move idle equipment charges and put that into production. So I would say that we're still kind of looking at that $0.10 a quarter here to start the year. But then depending upon our success that will move down and hopefully move to 0 by the end of this year. But more likely, we'll see those charges even move into 2018 a little bit."

Welcome to the fourth quarter and full year 2016 conference call. Let me start by saying I'm very proud of our accomplishments this quarter, including record revenue and free cash flow. We also delivered a ver",1177,"Thank you, Kim, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to the fourth quarter and full year 2016 conference call. Let me start by saying I'm very proud of our accomplishments this quarter, including record revenue and free cash flow. We also delivered a very strong fiscal year gaining share in the $7.2 billion contact lens industry, continuing our approach into the 1 Day silicone hydrogel space, expanding our Biofinity franchise and posting strong growth in our CooperSurgical business. We enter fiscal 2017 with strong momentum. We remain confident we will see market share gains in both of our businesses for the foreseeable future. 
Let me highlight 3 key points for the quarter. First, I'm pleased to report another strong quarter, with revenues over $500 million. This includes CooperVision reporting revenues over $400 million and CooperSurgical reporting revenues over $100 million. This resulted in non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.28 and free cash flow of $158 million. Second, CooperVision posted strong results in all key areas of its business, resulting in 10% as reported and 11% constant currency revenue growth. This includes 1 Day silicone hydrogel lenses growing 53% and 2-week and monthly silicone hydrogel lenses growing a combined 14%, both in constant currency. Third, CooperSurgical had another strong quarter, posting revenue growth of 20% or 6% pro forma. Fertility was a highlight, posting growth of 74% or 8% pro forma. 
Moving into the details. CooperVision reported fourth quarter revenue of $412 million, up 10% as reported and 11% in constant currency. This is the fastest CooperVision has grown in 11 quarters. The Americas grew 8% in constant currency with strength in multiple categories including Biofinity and 1 Day silicone hydrogel lenses. Biofinity continues to be our workhorse and we began our launch in Biofinity Energys in mid-August to strong reviews. Our enhanced clariti lens is also performing well and MyDay had another very strong quarter. EMEA posted a very strong quarter, up 12% in constant currency. Growth was driven by Biofinity and our 1 Day silicone hydrogel franchise. Asia Pacific also had a very strong quarter, up 13% in constant currency. Growth is strong throughout the region, driven by Biofinity and our 1 Day silicone hydrogel franchise. Within Japan, our MyDay sphere and toric launch is progressing well. And while it's still early, we continue to believe MyDay can be a very successful premium offering in that market. 
Turning to product categories. Torics grew a healthy 14% and multifocals 10%, both in constant currency. We remain a global leader in specialty lenses, and our success in Biofinity and clariti in both of these categories should continue to drive growth for many years to come.  Looking at silicone hydrogel lenses. These products grew 21% in constant currency and now represents 62% of our sales. We expect this strong growth to continue, given our product portfolio which includes Biofinity, Vitality, our new launched 2-week product and our diverse 1 Day offering. And remember, the biggest driver in the contact lens market is the 1 Day growth, and we strongly believe we have the best product offering in the space as the only company selling premium and mass market silicone hydrogel lenses, including a portfolio of sphere, toric and multifocal lenses. We are also investing in sales and marketing to support our strong product portfolio. 
Forecasting new hires is always challenging, especially when you're evaluating opportunities around the world. But we believe CooperVision can add numerous sales reps and get a very nice return given our strong product platform, our capacity and our growth opportunities that we see. We believe this initiative -- we began this initiative in our fourth quarter and expect it to continue through fiscal 2017 and possibly into 2018. For competitive reasons, I won't get into many details but, suffice it to say, we carefully evaluate our hiring and expect to realize a solid return from this activity. 
Now let me comment on our overall contact lens market and remember, this information is on the last page of our earnings release. For calendar Q3 2016, we continued taking share, growing 6%, with the market up 1%. Geographically, CooperVision grew 3% in the Americas while the market was down 3%. In the EMEA, we were up 8%, and the market was up 7%. In Asia Pacific, we grew 9%, with the market up 3%. On a modality basis, single-use lenses continued driving growth, with CooperVision up 12% and the market up 8%. For non-single-use lenses, we grew 3% while the market declined 4%. As you can see, our growth remains diverse and strong. On a trailing 12-month basis, CooperVision grew 8% while the market grew 3%. Although the market remains choppy and hard to read at times, we continue to believe it will strengthen and grow 4% to 6% over the next 5 years driven by continuing shift to dailies, geographic expansion and an expansion of the wearer base. We expect to continue taking market share led by our strong portfolio of market-leading products. 
Moving to CooperSurgical, we reported fourth quarter revenues of $107 million, up 30% year-over-year, driven by organic growth and acquisitions. On a pro forma basis, we grew 6%. Fertility led the way, up 74% or 8% pro forma. Within Fertility, we had growth throughout the business and continue to believe our market-leading product portfolio which includes medical devices, genetic testing and capital equipment is the broadest portfolio in the space and should continue to drive growth for many years to come.  Within our office and surgical category, growth was 5%. 
We're continuing to execute on several product launches, including our disposable hysteroscope, EndoSee, and we continue to see success in this area. Regarding other activity, we announced on November 6 that we acquired the Wallace portfolio from Smiths Medical for approximately $168 million. This is a great strategic fit with our existing global IVF portfolio as it brings the gold standard of embryo transfer catheters along with several other premier products. Finally, CooperSurgical -- on CooperSurgical, we're busy integrating recent acquisitions but also executing on several initiatives which should significantly strengthen the business. These include transitioning to a global sales model, adding sales reps in underpenetrated areas, launching products into new markets and increasing our focus on high-growth areas such as IVF genetic testing. We have made a lot of progress in these areas over the past year and expect to continue -- even have more progress as we go forward.  
Now before I turn it over to Al, let me comment on a couple other items. We anticipate another strong year of revenue growth in 2017, including CooperVision growing 6% to 8% in constant currency and CooperSurgical growing 6% to 8% pro forma. We also remain bullish on our future and are updating our long-term objectives for operating margins of 28% and free cash flow generation of over $2 billion by 2021. 
In conclusion, I want to express my appreciation to our employees for all their hard work and dedication. And now I'll turn it over to Al to cover the financial results."

Bob did an excellent job covering revenues, so I'll focus on the rest of our Q4 financial performance along with guidance. Most of my commentary will be on a non-GAAP basis, and a full reconciliation between our GAAP and non-GAAP results is included in today's earnings release. 
For the quarter, gross margins were slightly over 64%, with both CooperVision and CooperSurgical up year-over-year. CooperVision improved roughly 50 basis points to 64.8% driven by factors such as currency and product mix while CooperSurgical grew roughly 30 basis points to 62.5% driven by cost-reduction efforts. Operating expenses grew 11.7% in the quarter driven heavily by CooperSurgical's acquisition-related activity. Within operating expenses, sales and marketing expenses grew 14% as both CooperVision and CooperSurgical executed on sales and marketing expansion plans to capitalize on strong product portfolios. Outside of sales and marketing, we drove leverage through general cost controls. Operating margins were 25.1%, up nicely from 24% last year driven by gross margin improvement and operating expense leverage. 
Moving to interest expense. We reported $5.3 million, which was lower than our guidance as we had a true-up of roughly $1.5 million. This true-up was associated with an over allocation of commitment fees in Q2 and Q3 related to the refinancing of our credit facilities completed in Q2 of this year. What should have happened is Q2 interest expense should have been lower by $600,000, and Q3 should have been lower by $900,000. Our effective tax rate was 10.3%, and the resulting non-GAAP EPS was $2.28 with roughly 49.3 million average shares outstanding. Total debt decreased this quarter by $110 million to roughly $1.33 billion driven by strong free cash flow of $158 million comprised of $193 million of operating cash flow and $35 million of CapEx. 
Regarding full year fiscal 2016 results, consolidated revenues were $1.967 billion, up 9.4% or 7.3% pro forma; CooperVision revenues were $1.577 billion, up 6% or 7.5% in constant currency; and CooperSurgical's revenues were $390 million, up 26% or 6.3% pro forma; non-GAAP EPS was $8.44, up 13%; lastly, free cash flow was $357 million. So all in, a very strong year. 
Moving to fiscal 2017 guidance. Let me start by commenting on currency, which has moved significantly against us over the past month or so. For 2017, we're estimating a negative year-over-year currency impact to revenues of approximately $57 million and negative $0.10 to EPS. Incorporating this into our outlook, we expect fiscal 2017 consolidated revenues of $2.09 billion to $2.13 billion. This is comprised of $1.62 billion to $1.65 billion at CooperVision which equates to roughly 6% to 8% constant currency growth and $470 million to $480 million in CooperSurgical which equates to roughly 6% to 8% pro forma growth. We expect gross margins to improve to around 64.5% and operating margins to improve to 25%. Interest expense is expected to be around $28 million which includes the additional debt from the Wallace acquisition along with an assumption of 125 basis points rate increase. The effective tax rate is expected to be around 10%. This may be higher than many of you were expecting, but it's based on our current forecast which includes fewer discrete items, and is thus more of a true run rate of our current operations. 
Non-GAAP EPS for fiscal 2017 is expected to be in the range of $9 to $9.30 based on 49.4 million shares outstanding. To provide color on this, the higher year-over-year tax rate will negatively impact earnings by roughly $0.20, and FX will negatively impact earnings by $0.10. We also anticipate continuing to invest in sales and marketing above and beyond our normal level, and this will likely be in excess of $10 million or $0.20 in fiscal 2017. Having said that, we do have several positives such as accretion from our CSI acquisition, less idle equipment and inventory charges, savings from manufacturing improvements and the royalty roll-off, and these will help drive earnings growth. Regarding Q1, we anticipate revenues of $494 million to $508 million. This is comprised of $383 million to $393 million at CooperVision or roughly 7% to 10% constant currency growth, and $111 million to $115 million at CooperSurgical which equates to roughly 3% to 7% pro forma growth. For Q1 non-GAAP EPS, we expect $1.78 to $1.88 and note, this assumes a 10% tax rate as compared to last year's 3.9%. 
And with that, I'll hand it back to the operator for questions."

And probably the best way to think about it is that, a year ago, the Americas showed 11% growth and the entire market showed 8% growth worldwide driven very heavily by the Americas. This year, that kind of flips to a negative of 3% for the Americas and only 1% for worldwide. So you really have to look at 5 quarters or better yet, even 2 rolling years because of what happened a year ago was all the activity by J&J as they rolled out new products or things going on with UPP, so channel fill, so you end up with probably a delink between the way data comes into CLI and the public company. There's variances there, too, and including some of the activity associated with that. So when I think of the market, I kind of say, ""All right, let's put the 2 together."" Last year is 11%, this year it's negative 3%, that's 8%. Divided by 2, it looks more like 4% to me. And in the interim, we had a fourth quarter, 4%; a second quarter, 4%; and then a flat first quarter last year. So last year -- my way of thinking, last year rippled into the first quarter, so that 11% third quarter showed up as a neutral first quarter. The long and the short of it is it's probably best to look at it as 5 -- the average of 5 quarters if you're going to make much sense out of it."

We're obviously rolling out some new products. We had a slightly easier comp from a year ago, particularly relative to the Europe theater which is going through consolidation last year with Sauflon but, by and large, a solid quarter. As far as tax reform, well, tax reform has been talked about forever, and I could give you 2 theories on, if I just lock in on one thing that's being thrown around out there, the 35% going to 15%, suffice it to say that wouldn't be bad for most anyone and will serve as a neutralizer to a degree on however it shakes out the rest of the world. There are too many different debates going on out there. There's the fact that any meaningful change would require a vote of 60% of the Senate to go along with it, and that could be tough or only come with a lot of compromise. So I think it would be way premature to know if it's a net plus or a net minus, but most people wouldn't complain about a huge reduction in the corporate tax rate."

We're leveraging the rest of the infrastructure. And in the area of sales and marketing, that is both on the Vision side, heavily feet on the street, we're under-indexed compared to our competitors. And as I indicated, I'm not going to start quoting numbers of adds in terms of number of sales force we're adding. But suffice it to say, we also are rolling out many new products. Some of them are conceptually new like Energys. So there'll be a fair amount of energy also supporting those new products. And putting the 2 together, we will – while we're giving you guidance at 6% to 8% top line growth for both Surgical and Vision. We will be, suffice it to say, growing our sales and marketing at a rate faster primarily in the area of both feet on the street and, to a lesser extent, the marketing support behind that. Beyond that, we're not -- like I said, we're not going to really get into how under-indexed we are compared to our competitors. And I would say it's -- in many cases, it will be not across the board. If you have a vacancy or you're under-indexed in a geographic area, and I've always used an example of a city like Las Vegas and said, ""You know, if you didn't have a salesperson in Las Vegas, it's a pretty big town, maybe you ought to have a salesperson there if you have a lot of products to talk about."" So in some cases, it's adding junior people to support senior people, in other places there will be having feet on the street where you're currently making telephone calls and kind of piggybacking on that."

Having said that, we kind of targeted for basically some approaching 50% for the year, a slight acceleration from the prior year is the way we thought about it coming into this year. So it's kind of moving along those lines. And the way it's moving is, obviously, the more mature market is EMEA where these products started out, both MyDay and clariti. The least mature is Japan and the Americas, so we're very early in the cycle in those 2 areas and rapidly expanding the offering even in Europe. So it's geographically across all theaters and very much -- we've now kind of did the redo of the first clariti that was out there, and that's performing real well. So we're now expanding our attention into more than our own accounts. Initially, we had to take care of our accounts that we had given the first generation, if you will, product to. So a long way to go, and we're very early in the cycle and obviously moving off of a larger base as we go forward. As far as the deceleration in the planned replacement area, the non-1 Day, really, that market, if we look at it from a 2.5-year, 3-year perspective, is in around breakeven, with the growth all being driven by the 1 Day. That's been pretty consistent over the last 4 years, and we don't see that changing. Actually, it's been consistent a lot -- a driver longer than 4 years, but more so outside the U.S. and more recently inside the U.S., so don't see any changes there. There is activity in the planned replacement market, things like Biofinity, obviously, are still putting up terrific numbers so there's room to grow. And particularly as we think about the geographic expansion, some of what goes into China and into some of those theaters, maybe a little less weighted initially in the 1 Day modality, although that -- we can't make that statement about every country. So a lot of opportunity even in the planned replacement arena, and we're obviously continuing to grow that while the market may be not growing, if you will."

And as I indicated in my commentary, to the extent it rolls into 2018 where we're getting the top line growth we want, we will continue that modality. The driver there is if you have a lot of products to talk about and you have the capacity then you should try selling the product and leverage the capacity. We know we have excess capacity, and why not use it? So to the extent we're getting our payback, which will include diminishing the idle charges that we're incurring on cost of goods as a byproduct, we're going to do it. And we obviously have an agenda of gaining market share, and we've certainly done a good job of that the last 7 years. And if I look at it over the last 12 months, it's been greater than 2% that we've grown in the market. You can't make much out of this quarter's numbers because we grew 6 and the market 1 -- grew 1. I'm not going to say we're growing 6x the market but, obviously, we are growing around that 2x. Relative to the rest of operating cost, distribution, G&A and even, to a lesser extent, R&D, we expect to get leverage out of those around the world. So it isn't to say that operating cost in total will keep going up as a percentage of revenue. As far as the Ryan plan, I'm not going to get too detailed into it because there are too many soft spots and too many assumptions you'd have to make. But I guess I'd point one thing out which I think is very important. When we look at -- people think we're very oriented towards outside the U.S. the way we think. But the fact of the matter is our headcount around the world is pretty balanced U.S. and the rest of the world, both as to revenue and as to headcount. And that is after you count Puerto Rico where we make 1 billion lenses in Puerto Rico, that is a possession of the United States and is part of U.S. So when we kind of think about this, we, they that we're hearing about -- we, the U.S. against the rest of the world; we, the U.S., 5% compared to 95% of those outside the U.S., it is not as imbalanced in Cooper's model as some may think it is. Long and the short of it is I'm not going to overreact to any theory that gets thrown around out there, and I'll react to legislation. There hasn't been meaningful legislation since, I think, 1986. There's been a few things along the way that have come and gone, but it would be very premature to overanalyze it."

When you look at the tax rate itself, we've been running kind of on a look-through basis, if you will, somewhere around that 10%. We've had a number of discrete items that have come through. We've had acquisition-related activity and so forth that have allowed some write-offs and so forth that have pushed the tax rate down. Could it come in lower than 10%? It could.

I think I agree, your EPS guidance looks like maybe there's some levers of conservatism in there, but 6% to 8% CVI growth in a fairly choppy market and maybe in a med tech market that's a little uncertain right now doesn't feel overly conservative to me, so maybe if you can address your thoughts on the 6% to 8% CVI growth for '17, that would be helpful as well."

I think more importantly is it really is about if you have the product and we have the broadest product portfolio and you have the capacity, something we have not had in the past at least relative to clariti, MyDay and, to a lesser extent, even Biofinity. So if you have your -- the capacity you want, why wouldn't you test the water and see how good your products are? Why wouldn't you go after your competitors' accounts more aggressively? And we can't do it if we're under-indexed on feet on the street.

I would tell you I think that giving a 6% to 8% range in today's world is prudent and a good way to look at the business, but I don't think anybody would be very happy, let me put it to you that way, if we were growing in the 6% to 7% range."

And a lot of our -- Cooper is very open as part of its strategy being -- it could be a branded entity or it could be private label. So we're indifferent to what it's called. But what we have learned in the past is just because you send a bunch of your product, whether it's private label or branded, to a large retailer, if you don't work it, it's not going to work itself. You have to go to the OD, whether they're under an umbrella of a retailer or not. That has contrasted to maybe an online or some other mechanism, we don't waste our time with that. If you don't like the prescription, you don't have our attention, and that will continue. Relative to the competitive landscape, yes, our competitors continue to be in various stages of disarray, Alcon, we know what the CEO and Chairman of Novartis basically said, they are restructuring that organization. There is disruption there. They have a tired product line. B&L likewise is in a very disruptive environment to say the least. And J&J has done a pretty good job of marketing 1 product, OASYS. By any other name, it is OASYS, so it's all over, 1-day, 1-week, 2-week, 1-month called VITA. So of the 3 competitors, I would say J&J kind of has its act together better than the other 2. But having said that, they're obviously presenting some opportunity in their approach, are they in UPP one day and then they're out of UPP the next day. UPP wholesale across all of their products and then they vacate the entire thing, come up with a different plan. So we've been pretty steady state in the way we're approaching the market. We have the product portfolio and we kind of feel good about our competitors."

So I do believe the 1-days will be more than 50% of the -- let's say, that target, $10 billion down the road 2020, 2021. And who knows? Foreign exchange keeps coming along, kind of putting a dent into some of that. So assuming the dollar stabilizes, we're directionally headed towards that $10 billion. 1 Day will be greater than 50%, and there's no doubt that silicone hydrogel 1 Day will be much greater than 20% of that 1 day market. And will it be similar to the planned replacement where it's close to 80%, 79% to 80%, or a lot less? I think there are some reasons that it won't get well beyond the 50% barrier short-term because there is so much activity in the non-silicone hydrogel mass market space that, that will be somewhat a barrier. To answer your question about our cost coming down, MyDay is making good progress. We believe it's in the 30s now and we would expect that by 2018 sometime, will be honing in on that 50% target for 1 Day gross margin. And clariti, because of its novel approach to manufacturing and cost, will not be a drag. And it's not a drag today on our gross margin. So the mix you see, it's holding its own within that mix and is not a headwind on gross margin percentages."

But with the new products, with Energys, with conversion of -- from Avaira to Vitality, with a new toric -- a new MyDay toric, all that activity, there certainly is -- and particularly upfront, as you come out with new products, some energy on the marketing side. Some of that will tail off and some of it will continue as you roll it out around the world. So nothing -- I would say, nothing imminent where it's suddenly in a non-investment mode over the next 1 to 2 years. The roll-off of idle equipment is somewhat a function of the success of the growth of our various areas. Whether it's Vitality, whether it's MyDay, whether it's clariti, the growth in those products will form the basis of consuming some of that idle equipment over the next 1 to 2 years. We indicated partly because of the continuing successes in cutting costs and getting better yields and getting better throughput, we're now talking about lines with north of $80 million unit production that 2 years ago we didn't even have on the drawing board by way of a thought. So those kind of profound changes means we'll be able to continue to ramp up and continue to be ahead of the curve in terms of the demand side for quite a while in some of those areas, clariti and MyDay.

Continuing growth like that puts those lines to use and the idle equipment goes down. So the expansion, the focus on sales and marketing to drive topline growth, driving single-use, one of the nice benefits of that is it's going to put equipment to work. We obviously don't need to buy new equipment, which helps free cash flow and we would move idle equipment charges and put that into production. So I would say that we're still kind of looking at that $0.10 a quarter here to start the year. But then depending upon our success that will move down and hopefully move to 0 by the end of this year. But more than likely, we'll see those charges even move into 2018 a little bit."

Let me start by saying I'm very proud of our accomplishments this quarter, including record revenue and free cash flow. We also delivered a very strong fiscal year gaining share in the $7.2 billion contact lens industry, continuing our approach into the 1 Day silicone hydrogel space, expanding our Biofinity franchise and posting strong growth in our CooperSurgical business. We enter fiscal 2017 with strong momentum. We remain confident we will see market share gains in both of our businesses for the foreseeable future. 
Let me highlight 3 key points for the quarter. First, I'm pleased to report another strong quarter, with revenues over $500 million. This includes CooperVision reporting revenues over $400 million and CooperSurgical reporting revenues over $100 million. This resulted in non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.28 and free cash flow of $158 million. Second, CooperVision posted strong results in all key areas of its business, resulting in 10% as reported and 11% constant currency revenue growth. This includes 1 Day silicone hydrogel lenses growing 53% and 2-week and monthly silicone hydrogel lenses growing a combined 14%, both in constant currency. Third, CooperSurgical had another strong quarter, posting revenue growth of 20% or 6% pro forma. Fertility was a highlight, posting growth of 74% or 8% pro forma. 
Moving into the details. CooperVision reported fourth quarter revenue of $412 million, up 10% as reported and 11% in constant currency. This is the fastest CooperVision has grown in 11 quarters. The Americas grew 8% in constant currency with strength in multiple categories including Biofinity and 1 Day silicone hydrogel lenses. Biofinity continues to be our workhorse and we began our launch in Biofinity Energys in mid-August to strong reviews. Our enhanced clariti lens is also performing well and MyDay had another very strong quarter. EMEA posted a very strong quarter, up 12% in constant currency. Growth was driven by Biofinity and our 1 Day silicone hydrogel franchise. Asia Pacific also had a very strong quarter, up 13% in constant currency. Growth is strong throughout the region, driven by Biofinity and our 1 Day silicone hydrogel franchise. Within Japan, our MyDay sphere and toric launch is progressing well. And while it's still early, we continue to believe MyDay can be a very successful premium offering in that market. 
Turning to product categories. Torics grew a healthy 14% and multifocals 10%, both in constant currency. We remain a global leader in specialty lenses, and our success in Biofinity and clariti in both of these categories should continue to drive growth for many years to come.  Looking at silicone hydrogel lenses. These products grew 21% in constant currency and now represents 62% of our sales. We expect this strong growth to continue, given our product portfolio which includes Biofinity, Vitality, our new launched 2-week product and our diverse 1 Day offering. And remember, the biggest driver in the contact lens market is the 1 Day growth, and we strongly believe we have the best product offering in the space as the only company selling premium and mass market silicone hydrogel lenses, including a portfolio of sphere, toric and multifocal lenses. We are also investing in sales and marketing to support our strong product portfolio. 
Forecasting new hires is always challenging, especially when you're evaluating opportunities around the world. But we believe CooperVision can add numerous sales reps and get a very nice return given our strong product platform, our capacity and our growth opportunities that we see. We believe this initiative -- we began this initiative in our fourth quarter and expect it to continue through fiscal 2017 and possibly into 2018. For competitive reasons, I won't get into many details but, suffice it to say, we carefully evaluate our hiring and expect to realize a solid return from this activity. 
Now let me comment on our overall contact lens market and remember, this information is on the last page of our earnings release. For calendar Q3 2016, we continued taking share, growing 6%, with the market up 1%. Geographically, CooperVision grew 3% in the Americas while the market was down 3%. In the EMEA, we were up 8%, and the market was up 7%. In Asia Pacific, we grew 9%, with the market up 3%. On a modality basis, single-use lenses continued driving growth, with CooperVision up 12% and the market up 8%. For non-single-use lenses, we grew 3% while the market declined 4%. As you can see, our growth remains diverse and strong. On a trailing 12-month basis, CooperVision grew 8% while the market grew 3%. Although the market remains choppy and hard to read at times, we continue to believe it will strengthen and grow 4% to 6% over the next 5 years driven by continuing shift to dailies, geographic expansion and an expansion of the wearer base. We expect to continue taking market share led by our strong portfolio of market-leading products. 
Moving to CooperSurgical, we reported fourth quarter revenues of $107 million, up 30% year-over-year, driven by organic growth and acquisitions. On a pro forma basis, we grew 6%. Fertility led the way, up 74% or 8% pro forma. Within Fertility, we had growth throughout the business and continue to believe our market-leading product portfolio which includes medical devices, genetic testing and capital equipment is the broadest portfolio in the space and should continue to drive growth for many years to come.  Within our office and surgical category, growth was 5%. 
We're continuing to execute on several product launches, including our disposable hysteroscope, EndoSee, and we continue to see success in this area. Regarding other activity, we announced on November 6 that we acquired the Wallace portfolio from Smiths Medical for approximately $168 million. This is a great strategic fit with our existing global IVF portfolio as it brings the gold standard of embryo transfer catheters along with several other premier products. Finally, CooperSurgical -- on CooperSurgical, we're busy integrating recent acquisitions but also executing on several initiatives which should significantly strengthen the business. These include transitioning to a global sales model, adding sales reps in underpenetrated areas, launching products into new markets and increasing our focus on high-growth areas such as IVF genetic testing. We have made a lot of progress in these areas over the past year and expect to continue -- even have more progress as we go forward.  
Now before I turn it over to Al, let me comment on a couple other items. We anticipate another strong year of revenue growth in 2017, including CooperVision growing 6% to 8% in constant currency and CooperSurgical growing 6% to 8% pro forma. We also remain bullish on our future and are updating our long-term objectives for operating margins of 28% and free cash flow generation of over $2 billion by 2021. 
In conclusion, I want to express my appreciation to our employees for all their hard work and dedication. And now I'll turn it over to Al to cover the financial results."

Bob did an excellent job covering revenues, so I'll focus on the rest of our Q4 financial performance along with guidance. Most of my commentary will be on a non-GAAP basis, and a full reconciliation between our GAAP and non-GAAP results is included in today's earnings release. 
For the quarter, gross margins were slightly over 64%, with both CooperVision and CooperSurgical up year-over-year. CooperVision improved roughly 50 basis points to 64.8% driven by factors such as currency and product mix while CooperSurgical grew roughly 30 basis points to 62.5% driven by cost-reduction efforts. Operating expenses grew 11.7% in the quarter driven heavily by CooperSurgical's acquisition-related activity. Within operating expenses, sales and marketing expenses grew 14% as both CooperVision and CooperSurgical executed on sales and marketing expansion plans to capitalize on strong product portfolios. Outside of sales and marketing, we drove leverage through general cost controls. Operating margins were 25.1%, up nicely from 24% last year driven by gross margin improvement and operating expense leverage. 
Moving to interest expense. We reported $5.3 million, which was lower than our guidance as we had a true-up of roughly $1.5 million. This true-up was associated with an over allocation of commitment fees in Q2 and Q3 related to the refinancing of our credit facilities completed in Q2 of this year. What should have happened is Q2 interest expense should have been lower by $600,000, and Q3 should have been lower by $900,000. Our effective tax rate was 10.3%, and the resulting non-GAAP EPS was $2.28 with roughly 49.3 million average shares outstanding. Total debt decreased this quarter by $110 million to roughly $1.33 billion driven by strong free cash flow of $158 million comprised of $193 million of operating cash flow and $35 million of CapEx. 
Regarding full year fiscal 2016 results, consolidated revenues were $1.967 billion, up 9.4% or 7.3% pro forma; CooperVision revenues were $1.577 billion, up 6% or 7.5% in constant currency; and CooperSurgical's revenues were $390 million, up 26% or 6.3% pro forma; non-GAAP EPS was $8.44, up 13%; lastly, free cash flow was $357 million. So all in, a very strong year. 
Moving to fiscal 2017 guidance. Let me start by commenting on currency, which has moved significantly against us over the past month or so. For 2017, we're estimating a negative year-over-year currency impact to revenues of approximately $57 million and negative $0.10 to EPS. Incorporating this into our outlook, we expect fiscal 2017 consolidated revenues of $2.09 billion to $2.13 billion. This is comprised of $1.62 billion to $1.65 billion at CooperVision which equates to roughly 6% to 8% constant currency growth and $470 million to $480 million in CooperSurgical which equates to roughly 6% to 8% pro forma growth. We expect gross margins to improve to around 64.5% and operating margins to improve to 25%. Interest expense is expected to be around $28 million which includes the additional debt from the Wallace acquisition along with an assumption of 125 basis points rate increase. The effective tax rate is expected to be around 10%. This may be higher than many of you were expecting, but it's based on our current forecast which includes fewer discrete items, and is thus more of a true run rate of our current operations. 
Non-GAAP EPS for fiscal 2017 is expected to be in the range of $9 to $9.30 based on 49.4 million shares outstanding. To provide color on this, the higher year-over-year tax rate will negatively impact earnings by roughly $0.20, and FX will negatively impact earnings by $0.10. We also anticipate continuing to invest in sales and marketing above and beyond our normal level, and this will likely be in excess of $10 million or $0.20 in fiscal 2017. Having said that, we do have several positives such as accretion from our CSI acquisition, less idle equipment and inventory charges, savings from manufacturing improvements and the royalty roll-off, and these will help drive earnings growth. Regarding Q1, we anticipate revenues of $494 million to $508 million. This is comprised of $383 million to $393 million at CooperVision or roughly 7% to 10% constant currency growth, and $111 million to $115 million at CooperSurgical which equates to roughly 3% to 7% pro forma growth. For Q1 non-GAAP EPS, we expect $1.78 to $1.88 and note, this assumes a 10% tax rate as compared to last year's 3.9%. 
And with that, I'll hand it back to the operator for questions."

So when you look at the incremental sales and marketing investments and you look at the higher tax rate which is somewhere around $0.13 for Q1 combined with only getting the pound benefit for really the month of January, I think that's probably where -- that probably comprises, certainly, the vast majority of the delta."

And probably the best way to think about it is that, a year ago, the Americas showed 11% growth and the entire market showed 8% growth worldwide driven very heavily by the Americas. This year, that kind of flips to a negative of 3% for the Americas and only 1% for worldwide. So you really have to look at 5 quarters or better yet, even 2 rolling years because of what happened a year ago was all the activity by J&J as they rolled out new products or things going on with UPP, so channel fill, so you end up with probably a delink between the way data comes into CLI and the public company. There's variances there, too, and including some of the activity associated with that. So when I think of the market, I kind of say, ""All right, let's put the 2 together."" Last year is 11%, this year it's negative 3%, that's 8%. Divided by 2, it looks more like 4% to me. And in the interim, we had a fourth quarter, 4%; a second quarter, 4%; and then a flat first quarter last year. So last year -- my way of thinking, last year rippled into the first quarter, so that 11% third quarter showed up as a neutral first quarter. The long and the short of it is it's probably best to look at it as 5 -- the average of 5 quarters if you're going to make much sense out of it."

We're obviously rolling out some new products. We had a slightly easier comp from a year ago, particularly relative to the Europe theater which is going through consolidation last year with Sauflon but, by and large, a solid quarter. As far as tax reform, well, tax reform has been talked about forever, and I could give you 2 theories on, if I just lock in on one thing that's being thrown around out there, the 35% going to 15%, suffice it to say that wouldn't be bad for most anyone and will serve as a neutralizer to a degree on however it shakes out the rest of the world. There are too many different debates going on out there. There's the fact that any meaningful change would require a vote of 60% of the Senate to go along with it, and that could be tough or only come with a lot of compromise. So I think it would be way premature to know if it's a net plus or a net minus, but most people wouldn't complain about a huge reduction in the corporate tax rate."

We're leveraging the rest of the infrastructure. And in the area of sales and marketing, that is both on the Vision side, heavily feet on the street, we're under-indexed compared to our competitors. And as I indicated, I'm not going to start quoting numbers of adds in terms of number of sales force we're adding. But suffice it to say, we also are rolling out many new products. Some of them are conceptually new like Energys. So there'll be a fair amount of energy also supporting those new products. And putting the 2 together, we will – while we're giving you guidance at 6% to 8% top line growth for both Surgical and Vision. We will be, suffice it to say, growing our sales and marketing at a rate faster primarily in the area of both feet on the street and, to a lesser extent, the marketing support behind that. Beyond that, we're not -- like I said, we're not going to really get into how under-indexed we are compared to our competitors. And I would say it's -- in many cases, it will be not across the board. If you have a vacancy or you're under-indexed in a geographic area, and I've always used an example of a city like Las Vegas and said, ""You know, if you didn't have a salesperson in Las Vegas, it's a pretty big town, maybe you ought to have a salesperson there if you have a lot of products to talk about."" So in some cases, it's adding junior people to support senior people, in other places there will be having feet on the street where you're currently making telephone calls and kind of piggybacking on that."

Having said that, we kind of targeted for basically some approaching 50% for the year, a slight acceleration from the prior year is the way we thought about it coming into this year. So it's kind of moving along those lines. And the way it's moving is, obviously, the more mature market is EMEA where these products started out, both MyDay and clariti. The least mature is Japan and the Americas, so we're very early in the cycle in those 2 areas and rapidly expanding the offering even in Europe. So it's geographically across all theaters and very much -- we've now kind of did the redo of the first clariti that was out there, and that's performing real well. So we're now expanding our attention into more than our own accounts. Initially, we had to take care of our accounts that we had given the first generation, if you will, product to. So a long way to go, and we're very early in the cycle and obviously moving off of a larger base as we go forward. As far as the deceleration in the planned replacement area, the non-1 Day, really, that market, if we look at it from a 2.5-year, 3-year perspective, is in around breakeven, with the growth all being driven by the 1 Day. That's been pretty consistent over the last 4 years, and we don't see that changing. Actually, it's been consistent a lot -- a driver longer than 4 years, but more so outside the U.S. and more recently inside the U.S., so don't see any changes there. There is activity in the planned replacement market, things like Biofinity, obviously, are still putting up terrific numbers so there's room to grow. And particularly as we think about the geographic expansion, some of what goes into China and into some of those theaters, maybe a little less weighted initially in the 1 Day modality, although that -- we can't make that statement about every country. So a lot of opportunity even in the planned replacement arena, and we're obviously continuing to grow that while the market may be not growing, if you will."

And then the second question, to circle back to the tax issue, we're getting questions from investors regarding your buy-in plan and what it means -- may or may not mean for Cooper which manufactures a fair bit outside of the United States, generates a fair bit of its revenue outside the United States, and I was curious if you had looked into that yet."

And as I indicated in my commentary, to the extent it rolls into 2018 where we're getting the top line growth we want, we will continue that modality. The driver there is if you have a lot of products to talk about and you have the capacity then you should try selling the product and leverage the capacity. We know we have excess capacity, and why not use it? So to the extent we're getting our payback, which will include diminishing the idle charges that we're incurring on cost of goods as a byproduct, we're going to do it. And we obviously have an agenda of gaining market share, and we've certainly done a good job of that the last 7 years. And if I look at it over the last 12 months, it's been greater than 2% that we've grown in the market. You can't make much out of this quarter's numbers because we grew 6 and the market 1 -- grew 1. I'm not going to say we're growing 6x the market but, obviously, we are growing around that 2x. Relative to the rest of operating cost, distribution, G&A and even, to a lesser extent, R&D, we expect to get leverage out of those around the world. So it isn't to say that operating cost in total will keep going up as a percentage of revenue. As far as the Ryan plan, I'm not going to get too detailed into it because there are too many soft spots and too many assumptions you'd have to make. But I guess I'd point one thing out which I think is very important. When we look at -- people think we're very oriented towards outside the U.S. the way we think. But the fact of the matter is our headcount around the world is pretty balanced U.S. and the rest of the world, both as to revenue and as to headcount. And that is after you count Puerto Rico where we make 1 billion lenses in Puerto Rico, that is a possession of the United States and is part of U.S. So when we kind of think about this, we, they that we're hearing about -- we, the U.S. against the rest of the world; we, the U.S., 5% compared to 95% of those outside the U.S., it is not as imbalanced in Cooper's model as some may think it is. Long and the short of it is I'm not going to overreact to any theory that gets thrown around out there, and I'll react to legislation. There hasn't been meaningful legislation since, I think, 1986. There's been a few things along the way that have come and gone, but it would be very premature to overanalyze it."

When you look at the tax rate itself, we've been running kind of on a look-through basis, if you will, somewhere around that 10%. We've had a number of discrete items that have come through. We've had acquisition-related activity and so forth that have allowed some write-offs and so forth that have pushed the tax rate down. Could it come in lower than 10%? It could.

I think more importantly is it really is about if you have the product and we have the broadest product portfolio and you have the capacity, something we have not had in the past at least relative to clariti, MyDay and, to a lesser extent, even Biofinity. So if you have your -- the capacity you want, why wouldn't you test the water and see how good your products are? Why wouldn't you go after your competitors' accounts more aggressively?

You have to go to the OD, whether they're under an umbrella of a retailer or not. That has contrasted to maybe an online or some other mechanism, we don't waste our time with that. If you don't like the prescription, you don't have our attention, and that will continue. Relative to the competitive landscape, yes, our competitors continue to be in various stages of disarray, Alcon, we know what the CEO and Chairman of Novartis basically said, they are restructuring that organization. There is disruption there. They have a tired product line. B&L likewise is in a very disruptive environment to say the least. And J&J has done a pretty good job of marketing 1 product, OASYS. By any other name, it is OASYS, so it's all over, 1-day, 1-week, 2-week, 1-month called VITA. So of the 3 competitors, I would say J&J kind of has its act together better than the other 2. But having said that, they're obviously presenting some opportunity in their approach, are they in UPP one day and then they're out of UPP the next day. UPP wholesale across all of their products and then they vacate the entire thing, come up with a different plan. So we've been pretty steady state in the way we're approaching the market.

Foreign exchange keeps coming along, kind of putting a dent into some of that. So assuming the dollar stabilizes, we're directionally headed towards that $10 billion. 1 Day will be greater than 50%, and there's no doubt that silicone hydrogel 1 Day will be much greater than 20% of that 1 day market. And will it be similar to the planned replacement where it's close to 80%, 79% to 80%, or a lot less? I think there are some reasons that it won't get well beyond the 50% barrier short-term because there is so much activity in the non-silicone hydrogel mass market space that, that will be somewhat a barrier. To answer your question about our cost coming down, MyDay is making good progress. We believe it's in the 30s now and we would expect that by 2018 sometime, will be honing in on that 50% target for 1 Day gross margin. And clariti, because of its novel approach to manufacturing and cost, will not be a drag. And it's not a drag today on our gross margin.

First, in terms of the investment in sales and marketing, should we be thinking about that as sort of solely sales force hire investments? Or is there any discrete marketing investments that are embedded in there? And then, secondly, Al, on the idle equipment charges, the enhanced charges we've seen owing to the efficiencies, how should we be thinking about those rolling off in 2017?"

But with the new products, with Energys, with conversion of -- from Avaira to Vitality, with a new toric -- a new MyDay toric, all that activity, there certainly is -- and particularly upfront, as you come out with new products, some energy on the marketing side. Some of that will tail off and some of it will continue as you roll it out around the world. So nothing -- I would say, nothing imminent where it's suddenly in a non-investment mode over the next 1 to 2 years. The roll-off of idle equipment is somewhat a function of the success of the growth of our various areas. Whether it's Vitality, whether it's MyDay, whether it's clariti, the growth in those products will form the basis of consuming some of that idle equipment over the next 1 to 2 years. We indicated partly because of the continuing successes in cutting costs and getting better yields and getting better throughput, we're now talking about lines with north of $80 million unit production that 2 years ago we didn't even have on the drawing board by way of a thought. So those kind of profound changes means we'll be able to continue to ramp up and continue to be ahead of the curve in terms of the demand side for quite a while in some of those areas, clariti and MyDay. Al, I don't know what other color you want to..."

We had talked last year about kind of $0.10 a quarter above and beyond for idle equipment and some inventory charges. And we had that in Q2, Q3, Q4. I would say that we're continuing to have that right now. Those idle charges are mostly linked to the dailies side. So the growth that you're seeing is absolutely fantastic for us. Continuing growth like that puts those lines to use and the idle equipment goes down. So the expansion, the focus on sales and marketing to drive topline growth, driving single-use, one of the nice benefits of that is it's going to put equipment to work. We obviously don't need to buy new equipment, which helps free cash flow and we would move idle equipment charges and put that into production. So I would say that we're still kind of looking at that $0.10 a quarter here to start the year. But then depending upon our success that will move down and hopefully move to 0 by the end of this year. But more than likely, we'll see those charges even move into 2018 a little bit."
