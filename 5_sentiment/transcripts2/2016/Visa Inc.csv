I'm going to start with a series of comments both about the quarter and a little bit about what we're seeing in the world, and then I will pass it over to Vasant before we take questions. 
First a few comments about the overall results. We continue to be pleased with the performance of the company, given the ongoing macroeconomic headwinds that we had discussed before. Operating revenue grew 5% nominally or 8% on a constant currency basis, reflecting a negative 3 percentage point impact from FX. Adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 10%. Volume growth continued at a healthy pace growing 11.5% in constant dollars only down slightly from September's 12% growth. U.S. payments volume growth was essentially flat at about 10%, again, healthy growth. International payments, volume growth was 14%, down 1 point from last quarter, but we continue to see weakness in cross-border volume. 
U.S. outbound spend is strong, but it is offset by continued weakness from Canada, Brazil and Russia and more recently, we're seeing increasing weakness in the Middle East and China. We do see some area of restraints such as Mexico, Japan and New Zealand, but they're obviously, smaller markets for us. Now a couple of words about the U.S. holiday season. Overall, consumer spending by our Visa cardholders during the season was similar to last year, but spending patterns are changing. E-commerce continues to grow at a much higher rate than the spending at physical stores. We saw a midteens e-commerce growth during the holiday period versus mid-single digits growth in the physical world. 
More than 25% of all spending on Visa cards during November and December was online, up from less than 20% just 3 years ago. Also, the pattern of spending during the holidays has changed. While Black Friday and Cyber Monday remain important shopping days, less spending is consolidated on these 2 days than recent years and more people delay their spending to later in the season this year. We move on and say a couple of words about Visa Europe. We're making very good progress. We continue to work towards a projected second calendar quarter closing. We've received 2 of 3 required regulatory approvals with the third 1 that's required from the European Commission. Vasant will discuss it, but we feel very good about the execution of our $16 billion debt financing. And most importantly, we feel as good about the transaction today as the day we made our announcement. 
We've had great interactions with our Visa European colleagues. We've had a series of very positive conversations with European financial internationally and we remain confident that we're creating value and our focus on execution at this point. Move on to China now. We continue to work towards the ability to make a formal application. We're waiting for final regulations to be released. We have a clear path to have a compliant operating environment so we can compete domestically if we are awarded a license. I was in China last week and participated in the signing of 2 MOUs. They involve Visa working with 2 Chinese groups on driving financial inclusion as a means to support poverty alleviation. The strategic partnership and programs we announced underscore our long-term commitment to China and to fulfilling the Chinese government's goal of reducing poverty and promoting inclusive finance. 
We also continued to collaborate with government institutions, industry organizations and NGOs to support the global goals of a leading -- of alleviating poverty, promoting transparency and fostering inclusive social and economic development. As we work through our plans for entry into the domestic Chinese marketplace, we continue to feel good about our ability to help expand the rate of growth of the Chinese economy and increase the Chinese bank's ability to compete domestically, especially in the e-commerce space. Let's talk for a second about some client activity. In the United States, we expanded our relationship with Fidelity and U.S. Bank where we are now the exclusive payment network for their co-brand card. Card members can earn cash back with the Fidelity rewards Visa signature card and the Fidelity investments 5 29 College rewards Visa signature card. The new cards on the program will be issued with chip technology for security and give access to the payment industry's leading digital wallets, including loading Apple Pay, Samsung Pay and Android Pay. Visa and Walmart announced an acceptance agreement with Sam's Club. Beginning next Monday, more than 650 Sam's Clubs across the United States and Puerto Rico will begin accepting Visa credit cards in store. Walmart.com and SamsClub.com will also begin supporting Visa Checkout this year. And we continue to expand our relationships with clients around the world as well. 
Just a few notable highlights. We've seen very strong renewal activity across the world in places such as New Zealand, India, China and Latin America. Some names include ANZ in New Zealand, ICICI, Bank of China and the Agricultural Bank of China. In Latin America, we renewed a multi-year credit, debit and commercial agreement with BBBA, one of the largest issuers within our Latin American region. The deal covers 7 markets, including Chile, Peru, Venezuela, Uruguay, Paraguay, Argentina and Colombia. And we renewed a multiyear credit and debit agreement with Predesco, another one of our largest issuers in Latin America. 
We'll say a few words about Visa Checkout. We continue to be encouraged by the growth that we see since it was launched 18 months ago. We have more than 10 million registered users in 16 countries, and over 600 financial institution partners participating globally. More than 250,000 merchants, including some of our largest global retailers have signed on to accept Visa Checkout, representing 100 billion in addressable volume. Starbucks, Walgreens, NFL shop, HSM and Match are among the new merchants taking advantage of Visa Checkout's ability to deliver seamless digital payments. And as I mentioned earlier, Walmart.com and samsclub.com will also begin supporting it this year. 
Our confidence in Visa Checkout is based upon independent research that supports the notion that it makes commerce easier for consumers and ultimately results in increased sales for merchants. According to new independent research from ComScore, Visa Checkout significantly increases sales conversion. Visa Checkout customers completed 86% of transactions compared to 73% for PayPal Express Checkout and 57% for the traditional merchant Checkout. Visa Checkout customers are more active online shoppers in general, completing 30% more transactions per person than the overall population of online shoppers and 95% of Visa Checkout customers say sign up was easy and 96% feel secure making purchases with Visa Checkout. 
We recently launched a new platform called Visa Commerce Network, built on the TrialPay platform, which we acquired in 2015. Visa Commerce Network enables our merchants to deliver targeted discounts and benefits to Visa cardholders in order to acquire new customers and increase sales. Visa cardholders receive these benefits seamlessly by simply using their Visa cards to make purchases, no coupons or codes are required. To date, more than a dozen leading merchants including Dunkin' Donuts, Real Entertainment Group, Shake Shack and others have successfully used Visa Commerce Network, and we recently entered into a partnership with Uber. 
Uber riders have started receiving discounted rides when they use their Visa card at certain local retailers. I'll say a couple of words about the migration to EMV in the United States. We reached an important milestone on October 1, which was the official kickoff to chip in the U.S. We're optimistic about the progress and momentum we're seeing as banks issue more cards, merchants activate chip terminals and consumers increasingly make secure chip transactions. Already, there are more Visa chip cards issued in the U.S. than in any other country in the world. More than 200 million Visa chip cards were issued as of December 2015. 43% of all credit cards representing 72% of purchase volume, 21% of all debit cards representing 45% of purchase volume. Over 750,000 merchant locations have enabled EMV, representing 17% of the total face-to-face locations in the U.S. Based on our recent client surveys, we expect 50% of locations to be enabled by the end of this year. 
While we know we have a long way to go over the next few years to reach the critical mass of adoption that we desire, we feel very good about the progress to date. Now before I turn it over to Vasant, just a few comments about the environment. It's clearly a mixed bag, but certainly creating some short-term pressures for us. The headwinds we discussed last quarter continue and are probably slightly worse with little relief in sight in the short-term. As a reminder, they are the translation impact of the strong U.S. dollar; reduced cross-border volume, driven by the strong dollar; continuing drag from lower oil prices; and while we are believers in China for the long-term, the domestic volatility is creating increased headwinds for us. 
These headwinds are muting our growth today both through the translation FX as well as reduced business volumes and will likely continue for the foreseeable future, but our ability to grow over the long-term will be driven by our continued, strong underlying payment volume growth. So our mindset is that we have to be cautious in the short-term due to the headwinds, but the long-term fundamentals of our business volume growth remain strong. And as I've said before, our business volumes can change quickly, but changes in the U.S. dollar and domestic consumer confidence around the world, it's just hard to predict the timing. Vasant will cover it in more detail. But even though there's been much talk over the past few weeks of the slowdown in the U.S., our business volumes in January has been strong. 
So given all of this, our results are reasonably good, which speaks to the strength of our business model, our brand, our people, but do not reflect the long-term value of the franchise. But the pressures we have seen will likely continue for the foreseeable future before abating. Now over to Vasant."

In a turbulent and uncertain global environment, we're pleased to report that our business performed well in the first quarter as a result, modestly ahead of our expectations. A few highlights. Net operating revenues increased 8% in constant dollars. The exchange rate drag was 2 percentage points, both in line with expectation. Weaker-than-anticipated cross-border revenue was offset by lower-than-expected decline incentives. Client incentives were lower due to softer volumes in international markets and some deal delays. 
Expenses only grew 2%, well below the high single-digit rate we had indicated. We have focused hard on prioritizing and phasing our spending program given the uncertain macroeconomic environment. As the year progresses, we will continue to look at opportunities to moderate expense growth while ensuring critical initiatives are adequately funded. We marked down the value of the Visa Euro Board from $255 million to $0, since the VE Board, Visa Europe Board, amended the port in connection with our proposed acquisition. 
We are required to revalue the each quarter. We're still awaiting regulatory clearance, but expect to close the transaction in line with the transaction agreement, leaving us to lower value of the portfolio. This noncash, nonoperating gain added $0.10 to our reported earning. As a reminder, should the deal not close, the board will be reinstated in its unamended form and we will need to value this liability based on all available information at that point. In December, we issued $16 billion in debt, the maturities ranging from 2 to 30 years. The weighted average interest rate was 3.08% with a weighted average maturity of 13.1 years. 
This was the low end of the 3% to 3.5% interest range we indicated last year. We are pleased with this outcome. We will of course, use the proceeds to fund the upfront cash consideration for the Visa Europe acquisition as well as to step up stock buybacks over the next 5 to 6 quarters to offset the dilutive impact of preferred stock that will be issued to VE members. With the next instruction now in place, we will have interest expenses of $125 million each quarter, almost $0.04 per share. In the first quarter, we recorded interest expense of $24 million. We will incur the full $125 million interest expense in the second quarter with no offsetting benefit from Visa Europe operating income. 
Finally, we repurchased 25.7 million shares during the quarter, at an average price of $1.78 [ph] and $0.52 [ph] per share for a total of $2 billion. As we had indicated, we stepped up the pace of our buybacks to make up for stock not purchased in the fourth quarter last year due to the impending Visa Europe transaction. At the end of the quarter, we had remaining authorization of $5.8 billion for stock repurchases. We have continued to be buyers of our stock in January under our 10B5 program. 
Moving on to the quarter business drivers. Global payment volume growth in constant dollars for the December quarter continue to be strong at 11%. U.S. credit grew 9%, moderating 1 percentage point compared to the September quarter as a positive effect of the Chase conversion at last. U.S. debit grew 10%, up 1 percentage point, benefiting from some Interlink gains. Adjusted for conversion and the impact of gas prices, underlying growth in U.S. payment volumes of both debit and credit have stayed very stable over the past several quarters. 
In the quarter, the gas price drag was around 1 percentage point on credit and 2 percentage points on debit. In December, we lack the inflection point for gas strike declines, which should help reported growth rates going forward, although gas prices will remain a modest drag since pricing is still below last year. This is already evident in January U.S. aggregate payment volume numbers, which show a modest uptick of 1 percentage point to 11% through January 21. To date, macroeconomic weakness is not evident in U.S. consumer spending, but this could change as the year progresses. 
International payment volume constant dollar growth of 14% was down 1 percentage point from the prior quarter. While 14% is a healthy level of growth, we have seen a step down in growth rate in Brazil, Russia, and the Middle East as a result of the oil price collapse and weakness in commodity markets. Growth has remained strong across Mexico and other parts of Latin America as well as parts of Asia like India. Of course, the impact of the strong dollar on international payment volumes has been significant with growth flat in nominal terms. 
Cross-border volumes have been slowing for several quarters now. Cross-border growth continued to decelerate, dropping to 4% in the December quarter from 5% in the prior quarter. In the past quarter, we saw a sharp slowdown in outbound commerce from China and the Middle East, and a strong dollar continues to hurt commerce into the U.S. You might recall that we had expected cross-border trends to remain weak in the first half and have hoped for some improvement in the second half of our fiscal year as comparisons became easier and all of the dollars stabilize. 
Given recent trends, that appears less likely due to the deceleration from oil linked and China linked economies. Through January 21, cross-border volume growth in constant dollars is running at 5%. On the positive front, inbound commerce into Europe remains the strongest quarter, though this has also slowed due to China in the Middle East. Also, closing of the Visa Europe transaction, we will begin to benefit from growth of commerce into Europe. Transactions processed over Visa Net totaled $19 billion in the first quarter, an 8% increase over the prior period and unchanged from the September quarter. 
The U.S. delivered 11% growth and international growth was flat, both unchanged from the prior quarter. As a reminder, the international growth rate is negatively impacted by the transfer of domestic processing in Russia that started at the end of April. Through January 21, processed transaction growth was 8% with the U.S. rate of 11% and flat international growth. 
Turning to our financial results. Service revenue grew 7% in excess of nominal payment volume growth of 4%, helped by the pricing actions we took last year. Data processing revenues also grew 10%. Both were in line with our expectations. International revenue growth dropped to 6% from 16% in the prior quarter. Currency volatility moderated substantially in the quarter, reverting to the long-term mean. This drives most of the decline in the reported rate of growth. The impact of the pricing actions we took last year was largely offset by the significant negative impact from exchange rates. 
While this sharp decline in the growth rate of international revenues was mostly expected, cross-border volumes were weaker as I mentioned earlier due to China and the Middle East. Exchange rate and revenues from currency volatility will continue to be a drag on reported international revenue growth through the year. Other revenues were down 3%, primarily as a result of lower license fees generated outside the U.S. due to slowing payment volume growth. 
As it became clear that the global economy was going to experience a period of turbulence and uncertainty, we focused hard on prioritizing and phasing our spending plans for the year. As such, we were able to limit our expense growth to 2%. We held the line on personnel costs and professional fees, marketing programs have been reprioritize-ed and faced in the context of the uncertain revenue outlook for the year. Network and processing expenses grew due to the MSB transaction in Russia. 
Reported G&A expenses are up, driven by a variety of factors, including exchange rate adjustments and cross product enhancement. Our adjusted effective tax rate was 29.3%, modestly lower than our full-year expectation on low 30s. This was largely due to the recognition of certain benefits earlier than we had anticipated. Our full-year tax rate production remains unchanged. 
Looking ahead, to the second quarter. Service and transaction processing revenue trends remain unchanged. International revenues remained weak. Currency volatility are high going into the quarter, but could revert to the mean as they did last quarter and leave a lap high volatilities from last year. The exchange rate drag remains approximately 3 percentage points. Net-net, mid-single digit nominal revenue growth appeared likely to be sustained. 
Expense growth rate will step up to the mid-single-digit range with increases in personnel costs and the growth in national and processing expenses due to Russia. One big change between the 2 quarters, which is important to note, is interest expense. We will have a full quarter of interest expense starting in the second quarter of $125 million, almost $0.04 per share. We want to make sure you all incorporate this into your models going forward. 
As we look ahead to the second half of the year, our primary concern is the economic weakness in the international markets and the risk that will impact the U.S. As you may recall from our commentary last quarter, our outlook assumed some second half acceleration in the U.S. growth and higher cross-border growth due to easier comparisons. Current trends create some uncertainty around our revenue outlook for the year. 
As the year progresses, we will continue to look at opportunities to moderate expense growth while ensuring critical initiatives are adequately funded. At this point, there is not much more we can tell you about the back half. In terms of Visa Europe, we do not have any financial updates at this time. As a reminder, our outlook for the full year excludes Visa Europe. Assuming things proceed as planned, we will provide more detail on our second half expectations, inclusive of Visa Europe, when we talk to you again at the end of April. 
With that, I'll turn this back to Jack."

Domestically across the world, there are local networks that we compete with. And there are emerging global competitors such as Chinese UnionPay in the traditional space, as well as a series of people in the e-com space whose names you know, that we continue to compete with. I think when we think about what we have at Visa and the quality of the network, the safety, the security, the global acceptance, and now the capabilities that we built in the world of digital commerce and the value-added services, we feel terrific about our ability to continue to compete. And we're very, very clear that we know that we have to continue to add value to transactions that run over our network in order to sustain the kind of margins that make this such an attractive business.

So first of all, I just want to be really, just clear for a second, is we are not building a business, which is consumer direct and we're not building a business, which is merchant direct. There are occasional times when we will do something directly with the consumer or directly with the merchant. But it's in a way that supports the core party module in a way that we believe is ultimately good for issuers and acquirers. We're just acting as a facilitator. So we still very, very much believe that the model that we have is an amazing model and we continue to -- most of what we do to work through those people. But the fact is, we are consumer brands. And we have a role that we've got to play there. When it comes to the comments and expenses, I guess what you should take away is that nothing that we have done when it comes to rephasing, delaying or reducing any of the expense dollars that we contemplated, in our minds, relate to anything, which is going to help build the business for the future. I mean if you asked us, are we as efficient as we should be? Are we spending every last dollar wisely across the place? The answer is no, and the answer is still no today. And so what this environment does is it gives us the ability to take a harder look at we're not as efficient as we should be and attack those dollars. So we've not cut back on anything that relates to building our digital business, the APIs and SDKs that are part of the developer center, the things that we're doing on behalf of the merchants, the things that we're doing on behalf of issuers to build our consulting services. We're still very, very committed to building that. And as we think about what this environment does is, it's just -- creating extra focus for us. We certainly don't think that the slowdown that we're seeing that's affecting the business is something that changes the business model for the long-term. So we're not going to change the things that we think really build the business for the long-term as we sit here."

What I will say is that we love partnering with people that we think are good for the payment system and preserve our clients roles and our role in the ecosystem. And there are many examples around the world of people that we partner with in order to do that. There are also some examples of people that don't do that. And people that generate business for us in the short-term whose business model is built around this intermediating us eventually and our clients, is not something that we like, not something that we support and not something that we're just going to sit idly by and watch. Our first preference is to figure out how to work differently with those people. Those are the active conversations that we're engaged in. If we can't get to a productive conclusion, there are a lot of things at our disposable that we can do, which we have not done, which will enable us we believe, to compete in a very clear and very direct way in a way that's a level playing field for everyone. And so our first preference is to figure out how to partner with people. But if that doesn't work out, then we'll compete directly with them. And that will involve in the near future. And so more to come on that. And the second question was around..."

That business is focused both in the browser space, but also in the mobile space. And we've just made a series of changes internally with some leadership changes that we're very excited about, to help re-energize the business there and to be in a position to compete. We also made an investment in stripe and work very closely with them, and we think they're just extremely talented people who are almost solely focused on the mobile space and enabling mobile commerce in a way that's very friendly to us, and we're excited to continue to help them build their business globally."

When we're able to quote the kind of numbers that we're able to quote on ComScore for what it actually does to merchant sites, and the merchants themselves, actually share those experiences, nothing is -- nothing changes the sales discussion more than that. And so I think it's fair to say when we first started these discussions, it could be 6 to 9 months in terms of a calling process, if not longer. I'll tell you, I saw a note today on the way down here that we got an incoming call from a sizable merchant, which was very surprising to me, saying that they would like to implement Visa Checkout. So it really is -- I mean, the game is changing. And so in our minds, we know -- I mean, this is merchant by merchant. It's a long-term build and we just have to continue to show the kinds of progress that we're seeing with these -- with the numbers of merchants and the size of merchants. The implementation of these, I forget what it was. But it's dramatically quicker and easier for merchants to implement. If they can fit us into their queue, it's literally weeks at this point, as opposed to when we had the first incarnation, it was multiple months. So the real issue is just making sure they understand why it's good for them and just having a merchant decide that it's a priority for them and that's what we're starting to see."

The thing to point out is, if you look at international payment volumes as we said in our comments, in constant dollars, they're actually up 14%. So it's still incredibly healthy growth and then in nominal terms, it comes down to 0, so you can see what kind of a huge impact exchange rates have had. And U.S. payment volumes with credit and debit, if you adjust for conversion and gas, have been remarkably stable so that's what makes us optimistic about the long-term. In the short run, as Charlie said, I mean, this issue, the strong dollar is hurting commerce into the U.S., which is a very sizable business for us and has been a big drag in our performance for multiple years. The dollar also affects FX translation, you saw that from 14% constant dollar growth to 0. It's huge. And then cross-border trends, clearly are being hurt by both the strong dollar as well as what's happening in commodity markets, China, et cetera. So we see all these as not really reflecting the long-term trends in our business. And so we really don't want to change anything in terms of our longtime profile of investment. What we are also mindful of the fact that the next few quarters, we will face the same pressures. So all we're really doing is being prudent and prioritizing, not fundamentally changing anything in our investment posture.

And of course, there with the evolving relationship with JPMorgan and what they're doing now on ChasePay. So I'm wondering, is there something occurring now between Visa and the banks in terms of the kind of relationship that banks are seeking to have with you in the United States, that's different than in the past? Because it seems like the stance is a little more aggressive in response to some of the dynamics that are making growth so hard to come by in the states."

I think it's -- there are couple of different things going on. I think first of all, part of what you're seeing in the evolving relationships that banks have with the networks, not just in the U.S. but around the world is as the years passed, since we've transitioned from association to public company, networks are kind of sorting out their point of -- I'm sorry, banks are pointing out their point of views on networks and what they want those relationships to look like. And so what you start to see now is at the same time, payments evolving very, very rapidly, driven mostly by digital but by -- but I think also as importantly, the payments businesses broadly, including the debit card business and the credit card businesses, are now very much a part of what a bank does and the way they think about their entire relationships as opposed to 5, 6, 7, 8 years ago, we were transitioning from the majority of the business being done on the credit side by standalone companies. So all of a sudden, being integrated into a bank, but will still be run separately. So as they combine these businesses and really run them as an integrated business, they are now thinking about how -- what -- how they need to have a partnership with a payment network, which is much more strategic as opposed to just a third-party provider services. So what you're seeing is, you're seeing a longer-term contracts whether it's people who use to do in 1 and 2-year contracts, and now you've seen us do 3, 5, 7 and 10 in some cases. And that's because it is a different kind of relationship. I think the other thing that's going on in the marketplace is you start to see, especially here in the United States, banks have become very, very good at understanding the different segments, the different opportunities that they have to use payment products to serve their clients. And they're able to compete with the likes of other names out there that they didn't necessarily focus on before, and are having great success in that. And when you have success, it gives you confidence to go get more aggressive and some of these co-brands and some of these other things that you see. So what we want to do is to leave the payment partner of choice to be the one that helps them think strategically as well as to be the best natural provider of network services. And you're seeing people make choices relative to who their network partner is, and what that means for the aggressiveness in the marketplace is it's a more competitive marketplace. But again to me, that's something that we've seen increasing over a period of time and it's because there are more people -- there are more people that have better abilities in the payment space today than there were 3 years ago, 5 years ago or 10 years ago."

Certainly question marks about whether there's benefits from gas prices floating into -- we've seen a little bit of that on the debit side, we said that earlier. Yes, there is a small benefit as we look at January with the impact of gas prices declining. But the gas prices are still below where they were last year. So we had a 2 percentage point impact on debit, 1 on credit. That will moderate, but it won't go away completely. So most of it, we will ascribe to that. Wouldn't read too much into 3 weeks of January, we did had some awful weather in the last few weeks -- last few days, but that definitely will affect some of the commerce.

The dollar begins to show some signs of weakness, clearly it has a big impact on our business, not immediately, but over time on 2 fronts, one, the translation impact, which you can all estimate. But then there is the other impact, which will play out overtime, which is commerce into the U.S. which is a big part of our business. And then the second half, certainly Europe will be part of Visa.

W",1673,"Thank you, Jack. I'm going to start with a series of comments both about the quarter and a little bit about what we're seeing in the world, and then I will pass it over to Vasant before we take questions.
First a few comments about the overall results. We continue to be pleased with the performance of the company, given the ongoing macroeconomic headwinds that we have discussed before. Operating revenue grew 5% nominally or 8% on a constant currency basis, reflecting a negative 3 percentage point impact from FX. Adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 10%. Volume growth continued at a healthy pace growing 11.5% in constant dollars only down slightly from September's 12% growth. U.S. payments volume growth was essentially flat at about 10%, again, healthy growth. International payments volume growth was 14%, down 1 point from last quarter, but we continue to see weakness in cross-border volume.
U.S. outbound spend is strong, but it is offset by continued weakness from Canada, Brazil and Russia and more recently, we're seeing increasing weakness in the Middle East and China. We do see some areas of strength such as Mexico, Japan and New Zealand, but they're obviously smaller markets for us.
Now a couple of words about the U.S. holiday season. Overall, consumer spending by our Visa cardholders during the season was similar to last year, but spending patterns are changing. E-commerce continues to grow at a much higher rate than the spending at physical stores. We saw mid-teens e-commerce growth during the holiday period versus mid-single digits growth in the physical world.
More than 25% of all spending on Visa cards during November and December was online, up from less than 20% just 3 years ago. Also, the pattern of spending during the holidays has changed. While Black Friday and Cyber Monday remain important shopping days, less spending is consolidated on these 2 days than recent years and more people delay their spending to later in the season this year.
We move on and say a couple of words about Visa Europe. We're making very good progress. We continue to work towards a projected second calendar quarter closing. We've received 2 of 3 required regulatory approvals with the third one that's required from the European Commission. Vasant will discuss it, but we feel very good about the execution of our $16 billion debt financing. And most importantly, we feel as good about the transaction today as the day we made our announcement.
We've had great interactions with our Visa European colleagues. We've had a series of very positive conversations with European financial institutions and we remain confident that we're creating value and are focused on execution at this point.
Move on to China now. We continue to work towards the ability to make a formal application. We're waiting for final regulations to be released. We have a clear path to have a compliant operating environment, so we can compete domestically if we are awarded a license. I was in China last week and participated in the signing of 2 MOUs. They involved Visa working with 2 Chinese groups on driving financial inclusion as a means to support poverty alleviation. The strategic partnership and programs we announced underscore our long-term commitment to China and to fulfilling the Chinese government's goal of reducing poverty and promoting inclusive finance.
We also continued to collaborate with government institutions, industry organizations and NGOs to support the global goals of a leading -- of alleviating poverty, promoting transparency and fostering inclusive social and economic development. As we work through our plans for entry into the domestic Chinese marketplace, we continue to feel good about our ability to help expand the rate of growth of the Chinese economy and increase the Chinese bank's ability to compete domestically, especially in the e-commerce space.
Talk for a second about some client activity. In the United States, we expanded our relationship with Fidelity and U.S. Bank, where we are now the exclusive payment network for their co-brand card. Card members can earn cash back with the Fidelity rewards Visa Signature Card and the Fidelity investments 529 College Rewards Visa Signature Card. The new cards on the program will be issued with chip technology for security and give access to the payment industry's leading digital wallets, including Apple Pay, Samsung Pay and Android Pay.
Visa and Walmart announced an acceptance agreement with Sam's Club. Beginning next Monday, more than 650 Sam's Clubs across the United States and Puerto Rico will begin accepting Visa credit cards in store. Walmart.com and SamsClub.com will also begin supporting Visa Checkout this year. And we continue to expand our relationships with clients around the world as well.
Just a few notable highlights. We've seen very strong renewal activity across the world in places such as New Zealand, India, China and Latin America. Some names include ANZ in New Zealand, ICICI, Bank of China and the Agricultural Bank of China. In Latin America, we renewed a multiyear credit, debit and commercial agreement with BBVA, one of the largest issuers within our Latin American region. The deal covers 7 markets, including: Chile, Peru, Venezuela, Uruguay, Paraguay, Argentina and Colombia. And we renewed a multiyear credit and debit agreement with Bradesco, another one of our largest issuers in Latin America.
We'll say a few words about Visa Checkout. We continue to be encouraged by the growth that we see since it was launched 18 months ago. We have more than 10 million registered users in 16 countries and over 600 financial institution partners participating globally. More than 250,000 merchants, including some of our largest global retailers have signed on to accept Visa Checkout, representing 100 billion in addressable volume. Starbucks, Walgreens, NFL Shop, HSN and Match are among the new merchants taking advantage of Visa Checkout's ability to deliver seamless digital payments. And as I mentioned earlier, Walmart.com and SamsClub.com will also begin supporting it this year. 
Our confidence in Visa Checkout is based upon independent research that supports the notion that it makes commerce easier for consumers and ultimately results in increased sales for merchants. According to new independent research from comScore, Visa Checkout significantly increases sales conversion. Visa Checkout customers completed 86% of transactions compared to 73% for PayPal Express Checkout and 57% for the traditional merchant checkout. Visa Checkout customers are more active online shoppers in general, completing 30% more transactions per person than the overall population of online shoppers and 95% of Visa Checkout customers say sign up was easy and 96% feel secure making purchases with Visa Checkout.
We recently launched a new platform called Visa Commerce Network, built on the TrialPay platform, which we acquired in 2015. Visa Commerce Network enables our merchants to deliver targeted discounts and benefits to Visa cardholders in order to acquire new customers and increase sales. Visa cardholders receive these benefits seamlessly by simply using their Visa cards to make purchases. No coupons or codes are required. To date, more than a dozen leading merchants including Dunkin' Donuts, Real Entertainment Group, Shake Shack and others have successfully used Visa Commerce Network, and we recently entered into a partnership with Uber. Uber riders have started receiving discounted rides when they use their Visa card at certain local retailers.
I'll say a couple of words about the migration to EMV in the United States. We've reached an important milestone on October 1, which was the official kickoff to chip in the U.S. We're optimistic about the progress and momentum we're seeing as banks issue more cards, merchants activate chip terminals and consumers increasingly make secure chip transactions. Already, there are more Visa chip cards issued in the U.S. than in any other country in the world. More than 200 million Visa chip cards were issued as of December 2015. 43% of all credit cards representing 72% of purchase volume, 21% of all debit cards representing 45% of purchase volume. Over 750,000 merchant locations have enabled EMV, representing 17% of the total face-to-face locations in the U.S. Based on our recent client surveys, we expect 50% of locations to be enabled by the end of this year.
While we know we have a long way to go over the next few years to reach the critical mass of adoption that we desire, we feel very good about the progress to date.
Now before I turn it over to Vasant, just a few comments about the environment. It's clearly a mix bag, but certainly creating some short-term pressures for us. The headwinds we discussed last quarter continue and are probably slightly worse with little relief in sight in the short-term. As a reminder, they are the translation impact of the strong U.S. dollar; reduced cross-border volume, driven by the strong dollar; continuing drag from lower oil prices; and while we are believers in China for the long-term, the domestic volatility is creating increased headwinds for us.
These headwinds are muting our growth today both through the translation FX as well as reduced business volumes and will likely continue for the foreseeable future, but our ability to grow over the long-term will be driven by our continued strong underlying payment volume growth. So our mindset is that we have to be cautious in the short-term due to the headwinds, but the long-term fundamentals of our business volume growth remain strong.
And as I've said before, our business volumes can change quickly. With changes in the U.S. dollar and domestic consumer confidence around the world, it's just hard to predict the timing. Vasant will cover it in more detail. But even though there's been much talk over the past few weeks of slowdown in the U.S., our business volumes in January have been strong.
So given all of this, our results are reasonably good, which speaks to the strength of our business model, our brand, our people, but do not reflect the long-term value of the franchise. But the pressures we have seen will likely continue for the foreseeable future before abating.
Now over to Vasant."

In a turbulent and uncertain global environment, we're pleased to report that our business performed well in the first quarter with results modestly ahead of our expectations.A few highlights. Net operating revenues increased 8% in c",1633,"Thank you, Charlie. In a turbulent and uncertain global environment, we're pleased to report that our business performed well in the first quarter with results modestly ahead of our expectations.
A few highlights. Net operating revenues increased 8% in constant dollars. The exchange rate drag was 3 percentage points, both in line with expectations. Weaker-than-anticipated cross-border revenue was offset by lower-than-expected client incentives. Client incentives were lower due to softer volumes in international markets and some deal delays.
Expenses only grew 2%, well below the high single-digit rate we had indicated. We have focused hard on prioritizing and phasing our spending program given the uncertain macroeconomic environment. As the year progresses, we will continue to look at opportunities to moderate expense growth while ensuring critical initiatives that are adequately funded. We mark down the value of the Visa Europe put from $255 million to 0, since the VE Board, Visa Europe Board amended the put in connection with our proposed acquisition.
We are required to revalue the put each quarter. We're still awaiting regulatory clearance, but expect to close the transaction in line with the transaction agreement, leaving us to lower the value of the put. This noncash, nonoperating gain added $0.10 to our reported earning.
As a reminder, should the deal not close, the put will be reinstated in its unamended form and we will need to value this liability based on all available information at that point.
In December, we issued $16 billion in debt with maturities ranging from 2 to 30 years. The weighted average interest rate was 3.08% with a weighted average maturity of 13.1 years. This was the low end of the 3% to 3.5% interest rates range we indicated last year. We are pleased with this outcome. We will, of course, use the proceeds to fund the upfront cash consideration for the Visa Europe acquisition as well as to step up stock buybacks over the next 5 to 6 quarters to offset the dilutive impact of preferred stock that will be issued to VE members.
With the debt structure now in place, we will have interest expenses of $125 million each quarter, almost $0.04 per share. In the first quarter, we recorded interest expense of $24 million. We will incur the full $125 million interest expense in the second quarter with no offsetting benefit from Visa Europe operating income.
Finally, we repurchased 25.7 million shares during the quarter at an average price of $78.52 per share for a total of $2 billion. As we had indicated, we stepped up the pace of our buybacks to make up for stock not purchased in the fourth quarter last year due to the impending Visa Europe transaction. At the end of the quarter, we had remaining authorization of $5.8 billion for stock repurchases. We have continued to be buyers of our stock in January under our 10B5 program.
Moving onto the quarter's business drivers. Global payment volume growth in constant dollars for the December quarter continue to be strong at 11%. U.S. credit grew 9%, moderating 1 percentage point compared to the September quarter as a positive effects of the Chase conversion have lapsed. U.S. debit grew 10%, up 1 percentage point, benefiting from some IntelliLink gains. Adjusted for conversions and the impact of gas prices, underlying growth in U.S. payment volumes for both debit and credit have stayed very stable over the past several quarters.
In the quarter, the gas price drag was around 1 percentage point on credit and 2 percentage points on debit. In December, we lapsed the inflection point for gas price declines, which should help reported growth rates going forward, although gas prices will remain a modest drag since pricing is still below last year. This is already evident in January U.S. aggregate payment volume numbers, which show a modest uptick of 1 percentage point to 11% through January 21. To date, macroeconomic weakness is not evident in U.S. consumer spending, but this could change as the year progresses.
International payment volume constant dollar growth of 14% was down 1 percentage point from the prior quarter. While 14% is a healthy level of growth, we have seen a step down in growth rates in Brazil, Russia and the Middle East as a result of the oil price collapse and weakness in commodity markets. Growth has remained strong across Mexico and other parts of Latin America as well as parts of Asia like India. Of course, the impact of the strong dollar on international payment volumes has been significant with growth flat in nominal terms.
Cross-border volumes have been slowing for several quarters now. Cross-border growth continued to decelerate, dropping to 4% in the December quarter from 5% in the prior quarter. In the past quarter, we saw a sharp slowdown in outbound commerce from China and the Middle East, and a strong dollar continues to hurt commerce into the U.S. You might recall that we had expected cross-border trends to remain weak in the first half and I hope for some improvement in the second half of our fiscal year as comparisons became easier and/or the dollar stabilized.
Given recent trends that appears less likely due to the deceleration from oil-linked and China-linked economies. Through January 21, cross-border volume growth in constant dollars is running at 5%. On the positive front, inbound commerce into Europe remains the strongest corridor, though this has also slowed due to China and the Middle East.
Post-closing of the Visa Europe transaction, we will begin to benefit from growth of commerce into Europe. Transactions processed over VisaNet totaled $19 billion in the first quarter, an 8% increase over the prior period and unchanged from the September quarter.
The U.S. delivered 11% growth and international growth was flat, both unchanged from the prior quarter. As a reminder, the international growth rate is negatively impacted by the transfer of domestic processing in Russia that started at the end of April. Through January 21, process transaction growth was 8% with the U.S. rate of 11% and flat international growth.
Turning to our financial results. Service revenues grew 7% in excess of nominal payment volume growth of 4%, helped by the pricing actions we took last year. Data processing revenues also grew 7%, [ph] both were in line with our expectations. International revenue growth dropped to 6% from 16% in the prior quarter. Currency volatility moderated substantially in the quarter, reverting to the long-term mean. This drives most of the decline in the reported rate of growth. The impact of the pricing actions we took last year was largely offset by the significant negative impact from exchange rates.
While this sharp decline in the growth rate of international revenues was mostly expected, cross-border volumes were weaker as I mentioned earlier due to China and the Middle East. Exchange rates and revenues from currency volatility will continue to be a drag on reported international revenue growth through the year. Other revenues were down 3%, primarily as a result of lower license fees generated outside the U.S. due to slowing payment volume growth.
As it became clear that the global economy was going to experience a period of turbulence and uncertainty, we focused hard on prioritizing and phasing our spending plans for the year. As such, we were able to limit our expense growth to 2%. We held the line on personnel costs and professional fees, marketing programs have been reprioritized and faced in the context of the uncertain revenue outlook for the year. Network and processing expenses grew due to the NSPK transaction in Russia.
Reported G&A expenses are up, driven by a variety of factors, including exchange rate adjustments and caused product enhancements. Our adjusted effective tax rate was 29.3%, modestly lower than our full-year expectation on low 30s. This was largely due to the recognition of certain benefits earlier than we had anticipated. Our full year tax rate projection remains unchanged.
Looking ahead to the second quarter. Service and transaction processing revenue trends remain unchanged. International revenues remain weak. Currency volatilities are high going into the quarter, but could revert to the mean as they did last quarter and leave a lap high volatilities from last year. The exchange rate drag remains approximately 3 percentage points. Net-net, mid-single-digit nominal revenue growth appears likely to be sustained.
Expense growth rates will step up to the mid-single-digit range with increases in personnel costs and the growth in network and processing expenses due to Russia. One big change between the 2 quarters, which is important to note, is interest expense. We will have a full quarter interest expense starting in the second quarter of $125 million, almost $0.04 per share. We want to make sure you all incorporate this into your models going forward.
As we look ahead to the second half of the year, our primary concern is the economic weakness in the international markets and the risk that will impact the U.S. As you may recall from our commentary last quarter, our outlook assumed some second half acceleration in U.S. growth and higher cross-border growth due to easier comparisons. Current trends create some uncertainty around our revenue outlook for the year.
As the year progresses, we will continue to look at opportunities to moderate expense growth while ensuring critical initiatives are adequately funded. At this point, there is not much more we can tell you about the back half. In terms of Visa Europe, we do not have any financial updates at this time. As a reminder, our outlook for the full year excludes Visa Europe. Assuming things proceed as planned, we will provide more detail on our second half expectations, inclusive of Visa Europe, when we talk to you again at the end of April.
With that, I'll turn this back to Jack."

Domestically across the world, there are local networks that we compete with. And there are emerging global competitors such as Chinese UnionPay in the traditional space as well as a series of people in the e-com space whose names you know that we continue to compete with. I think when we think about what we have at Visa and the quality of the network, the safety, the security, the global acceptance and now the capabilities that we built in the world of digital commerce and the value-added services, we feel terrific about our ability to continue to compete. And we're very, very clear that we know that we have to continue to add value to transactions that run over our network in order to sustain the kind of margins that make such an attractive business. And we think that there are a couple of us, with us leading the pack who are uniquely qualified to do that. And so those views, I think, are very consistent with where they were last quarter, last year and a couple of years ago."

So let me take a stab at and then Vasant, you can add anything you want to add. I think -- so first of all, it's -- I just want to be really -- just clear for a second, is we are not building a business which is consumer direct and we're not building a business which is merchant direct. There are occasional times when we will do something directly with the consumer or directly with the merchant. But it's in a way that supports the four-party module in a way that we believe is ultimately good for issuers and acquirers. We're just acting as a facilitator. So we still very, very much believe that the model that we have is an amazing model and we continue to -- most of what we do to work through those people. But the fact is, we are consumer brand. And we have a role that we've got to play there. When it comes to the comments on expenses, I think -- I guess what you should take away is that nothing that we have done when it comes to rephasing, delaying or reducing any of the expense dollars that we contemplated, in our minds, relate to anything which is going to help build the business for the future. I mean if you asked us, are we as efficient as we should be, are we spending every last dollar wisely across the place. The answer is no, and the answer is still no today. And so what this environment does is it gives us the ability to take a harder look at we're not as efficient as we should be and attack those dollars. So we've not cut back on anything that relates to building our digital business, the APIs and SDKs that are part of the developer center, the things that we're doing on behalf of the merchants, the things that we're doing on behalf of issuers to build our consulting services. We're still very, very committed to building that. And as we think about what this environment does is, it's just  creating extra focus for us. We certainly don't think that the slowdown that we're seeing that's affecting the business is something that changes the business model for the long-term. So we're not going to change the things that we think really build the business for the long-term as we sit here."

When we're able to quote the kind of numbers that we're able to quote on ComScore for what it actually does to merchant sites, and the merchants themselves actually share those experiences, nothing is -- nothing changes the sales discussion more than that. And so I think it's fair to say when we first started these discussions, it could be 6 to 9 months in terms of a calling process, if not longer. I'll tell you, I saw a note today on the way down here that we got an incoming call from a sizable merchant, which was very surprising to me, saying that they would like to implement Visa Checkout. So it really is -- I mean, the game is changing. But we also -- in our minds, we know -- I mean, this is merchant by merchant. It's a long-term build and we just have to continue to show the kinds of progress that we're seeing with these, both the numbers of merchants and the size of merchants. The implementation piece, I forgot what it was. But it's dramatically quicker and easier for merchant to implement. If they can fit us into their queue, it's literally weeks at this point as opposed to when we had the first incarnation, it was multiple months. So the real issue is just making sure they understand why it's good for them and just having a merchant decide that it's a priority for them and that's what we're starting to see."

The thing to point out is, if you look at international payment volumes as we said in our comments, in constant dollars, they're actually up 14%. So it's still incredibly healthy growth and then in nominal terms, it comes down to 0, so you can see what a huge impact exchange rates have had. And U.S. payment volumes both credit and debit, if you adjust for conversion and gas, have been remarkably stable so that's what makes us optimistic about the long-term. In the short run, as Charlie said, I mean, these 2 issues, the strong dollar is hurting commerce into the U.S., which is a very sizable business for us and has been a big drag now for multiple years. The dollar also affects translation, you saw that from 14% constant dollar growth to 0. It's huge. And then cross-border trends, clearly are being hurt by both the strong dollar as well as what's happening in commodity markets, China, et cetera. So we see all these as not really reflecting the long-term trends in our business. And so we really don't want to change anything in terms of our longtime profile of investment. But we are also mindful of the fact that the next few quarters, we will face the same pressures. So all we're really doing is being prudent and prioritizing, we're not fundamentally changing anything in our investment posture.

And so I wonder -- is there something occurring now between Visa and the banks in terms of the kind of relationship that banks are seeking to have with you in the United States, that's different than in the past? Because it seems like the stance is a little more aggressive in response to some of the dynamics that are making growth so hard to come by in the states."

I think it's -- there are couple of different things going on. I think first of all, part of what you're seeing in the evolving relationships that banks have with the networks, not just in the U.S. but around the world is as the years passed, since we've transitioned from association to public company, networks are kind of sorting out their point of -- I'm sorry, banks are sorting out their point of views on networks and what they want those relationships to look like. And so what you start to see now is at the same time, payments evolving very, very rapidly, driven mostly by digital but by -- but I think also as importantly, the payments businesses broadly, including the debit card business and the credit card businesses, are now very much a part of what a bank does and the way they think about their entire relationships as opposed to 5, 6, 7, 8 years ago, we were transitioning from the majority of the business being done on the credit side by standalone companies. So all of a sudden, being integrated into a bank, but will still be run separately. So as they combine these businesses and really run them as an integrated business, they are now thinking about how -- what -- how they need to have a partnership with a payment network, which is much more strategic as opposed to just a third-party provider services. So what you're seeing is, you're seeing longer-term contracts whether it's people who used to do 1 and 2-year contracts, and now you've seen us do 3, 5, 7 and 10 in some cases. And that's because it is a different kind of relationship. I think the other thing that's going on in the marketplace is you start to see, especially here in the United States, banks have become very, very good at understanding the different segments, the different opportunities that they have to use payment products to serve their clients. And they're able to compete with the likes of other names out there that they didn't necessarily focus on before, and are having great success in that. And when you have success, it gives you confidence to go get more aggressive and some of these co-brands and some of these other things that you see. So what we want to do is to leave the payment partner of choice to be the one that helps them think strategically as well as to be the best actual provider of network services. And you're seeing people make choices relative to who their network partner is, and what that means for the aggressiveness in the marketplace is it's a more competitive marketplace. But again to me, that's something we've seen it increasing over a period of time and it's because there are people -- there are more people that have better abilities in the payment space today than there were 3 years ago, 5 years ago or 10 years ago."

Certainly question marks about whether there's benefits from gas prices floating into, we've seen a little bit of that on the debit side, we said that earlier. Yes, there is a small benefit as you look at January from the impact of gas prices declining. But gas prices are still below where they were last year. So we had a 2 percentage point impact on debit, 1 on credit. That will moderate, but it won't go away completely. So most of it, we would ascribe to that. Wouldn't read too much into 3 weeks of January, we then had some awful weather in the last few weeks -- last few days, and that definitely will affect some of the commerce.

So what we try and do is be as transparent as we can about what we do know. And we recognize that it's hard sometimes to figure out what a trend is, and it's hard to know what the triggers will be to either see an uptick or a downtick. So we've tried to be very clear in our remarks that we're not changing guidance. But if we don't see improvement, then the guidance will come under pressure."

It was travel out of China and it was travel out of oil-linked economies. What could cause -- what is the most significant variable that would cause chain trends to change in a positive way, do we know its going to happen? We don't. But it's the dollar. The dollar begins to show some signs of weakness, clearly it has a big impact on our business, not immediately, but over time on 2 fronts, one, the translation impact, which you can all estimate. But then there is the other impact, which will play out overtime, which is commerce into the U.S. which is a big part of our business. And then in the second half, certainly Europe will be part of Visa. And the travel into Europe has been better than traveling to other geographies. So hopefully, that will help us and some of that, we knew going into the year and giving you some of our perspectives, we incorporated some of that."

W",1676,"Thank you, Jack. I'm going to start with a series of comments both about the quarter and a little bit about what we're seeing in the world, and then I will pass it over to Vasant before we take questions.
First a few comments about the overall results. We continue to be pleased with the performance of the company, given the ongoing macroeconomic headwinds that we have discussed before. Operating revenue grew 5% nominally or 8% on a constant currency basis, reflecting a negative 3 percentage point impact from FX. Adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 10%. Volume growth continued at a healthy pace growing 11.5% in constant dollars only down slightly from September's 12% growth. U.S. payments volume growth was essentially flat at about 10%, again, healthy growth. International payments volume growth was 14%, down 1 point from last quarter, but we continue to see weakness in cross-border volume.
U.S. outbound spend is strong, but it is offset by continued weakness from Canada, Brazil and Russia and more recently, we're seeing increasing weakness in the Middle East and China. We do see some areas of strength such as Mexico, Japan and New Zealand, but they're obviously smaller markets for us.
Now a couple of words about the U.S. holiday season. Overall, consumer spending by our Visa cardholders during the season was similar to last year, but spending patterns are changing. E-commerce continues to grow at a much higher rate than the spending at physical stores. We saw mid-teens e-commerce growth during the holiday period versus mid-single digits growth in the physical world.
More than 25% of all spending on Visa cards during November and December was online, up from less than 20% just 3 years ago. Also, the pattern of spending during the holidays has changed. While Black Friday and Cyber Monday remain important shopping days, less spending is consolidated on these 2 days than recent years and more people delayed their spending to later in the season this year.
Let me move on and say a couple of words about Visa Europe. We're making very good progress. We continue to work towards a projected second calendar quarter closing. We've received 2 of 3 required regulatory approvals with the third one that's required from the European Commission. Vasant will discuss it, but we feel very good about the execution of our $16 billion debt financing. And most importantly, we feel as good about the transaction today as the day we made our announcement.
We've had great interactions with our Visa European colleagues. We've had a series of very positive conversations with European financial institutions and we remain confident that we're creating value and are focused on execution at this point.
Move on to China now. We continue to work towards the ability to make a formal application. We're waiting for final regulations to be released. We have a clear path to have a compliant operating environment, so we can compete domestically if we are awarded a license. I was in China last week and participated in the signing of 2 MOUs. They involve Visa working with 2 Chinese groups on driving financial inclusion as a means to support poverty alleviation. The strategic partnership and programs we announced underscore our long-term commitment to China and to fulfilling the Chinese government's goal of reducing poverty and promoting inclusive finance.
We also continue to collaborate with government institutions, industry organizations and NGOs to support the global goals of a leading -- of alleviating poverty, promoting transparency and fostering inclusive social and economic development. As we work through our plans for entry into the domestic Chinese marketplace, we continue to feel good about our ability to help expand the rate of growth of the Chinese economy and increase the Chinese bank's ability to compete domestically, especially in the e-commerce space.
Talk for a second about some client activity. In the United States, we expanded our relationship with Fidelity and U.S. Bank, where we are now the exclusive payment network for their co-brand card. Card members can earn cash back with the Fidelity rewards Visa Signature Card and the Fidelity investments 529 College Rewards Visa Signature Card. The new cards on the program will be issued with chip technology for security and give access to the payment industry's leading digital wallets, including Apple Pay, Samsung Pay and Android Pay.
Visa and Walmart announced an acceptance agreement with Sam's Club. Beginning next Monday, more than 650 Sam's Clubs across the United States and Puerto Rico will begin accepting Visa credit cards in store. Walmart.com and SamsClub.com will also begin supporting Visa Checkout this year. And we continue to expand our relationships with clients around the world as well.
Just a few notable highlights. We've seen very strong renewal activity across the world in places such as New Zealand, India, China and Latin America. Some names include ANZ in New Zealand, ICICI, Bank of China and the Agricultural Bank of China. In Latin America, we renewed a multiyear credit, debit and commercial agreement with BBVA, one of the largest issuers within our Latin American region. The deal covers 7 markets, including: Chile, Peru, Venezuela, Uruguay, Paraguay, Argentina and Colombia. And we renewed a multiyear credit and debit agreement with Bradesco, another one of our largest issuers in Latin America.
Let me say a few words about Visa Checkout. We continue to be encouraged by the growth that we see since it was launched 18 months ago. We have more than 10 million registered users in 16 countries and over 600 financial institution partners participating globally. More than 250,000 merchants, including some of our largest global retailers have signed on to accept Visa Checkout, representing 100 billion in addressable volume. Starbucks, Walgreens, NFL Shop, HSN and Match are among the new merchants taking advantage of Visa Checkout's ability to deliver seamless digital payments. And as I mentioned earlier, Walmart.com and SamsClub.com will also begin supporting it this year. 
Our confidence in Visa Checkout is based upon independent research that supports the notion that it makes commerce easier for consumers and ultimately results in increased sales for merchants. According to new independent research from comScore, Visa Checkout significantly increases sales conversion. Visa Checkout customers completed 86% of transactions compared to 73% for PayPal Express Checkout and 57% for the traditional merchant checkout. Visa Checkout customers are more active online shoppers in general, completing 30% more transactions per person than the overall population of online shoppers and 95% of Visa Checkout customers say sign up was easy and 96% feel secure making purchases with Visa Checkout.
We recently launched a new platform called Visa Commerce Network, built on the TrialPay platform, which we acquired in 2015. Visa Commerce Network enables our merchants to deliver targeted discounts and benefits to Visa cardholders in order to acquire new customers and increase sales. Visa cardholders receive these benefits seamlessly by simply using their Visa card to make purchases. No coupons or codes are required. To date, more than a dozen leading merchants including Dunkin' Donuts, Real Entertainment Group, Shake Shack and others have successfully used Visa Commerce Network, and we recently entered into a partnership with Uber. Uber riders have started receiving discounted rides when they use their Visa card at certain local retailers.
I'll say a couple of words about the migration to EMV in the United States. We reached an important milestone on October 1, which was the official kickoff to chip in the U.S. We're optimistic about the progress and momentum we're seeing as banks issue more cards, merchants activate chip terminals and consumers increasingly make secure chip transactions. Already, there are more Visa chip cards issued in the U.S. than in any other country in the world. More than 200 million Visa chip cards were issued as of December 2015: 43% of all credit cards representing 72% of purchase volume; 21% of all debit cards representing 45% of purchase volume. Over 750,000 merchant locations have enabled EMV, representing 17% of the total face-to-face locations in the U.S. Based on our recent client surveys, we expect 50% of locations to be enabled by the end of this year.
While we know we have a long way to go over the next few years to reach the critical mass of adoption that we desire, we feel very good about the progress to date.
Now before I turn it over to Vasant, just a few comments about the environment. It's clearly a mixed bag, but certainly creating some short-term pressures for us. The headwinds we discussed last quarter continue and are probably slightly worse with little relief in sight in the short-term. As a reminder, they are the translation impact of the strong U.S. dollar; reduced cross-border volume, driven by the strong dollar; continuing drag from lower oil prices; and while we are believers in China for the long-term, the domestic volatility is creating increased headwinds for us.
These headwinds are muting our growth today both through the translation effects as well as reduced business volumes and will likely continue for the foreseeable future. But our ability to grow over the long-term will be driven by our continued strong underlying payment volume growth. So our mindset is that we have to be cautious in the short-term due to the headwinds, but the long-term fundamentals of our business volume growth remain strong.
And as I've said before, our business volumes can change quickly with changes in the U.S. dollar and domestic consumer confidence around the world. It's just hard to predict the timing. Vasant will cover it in more detail. But even though there's been much talk over the past few weeks of a slowdown in the U.S., our business volumes in January have been strong.
So given all of this, our results are reasonably good, which speaks to the strength of our business model, our brand, our people, but do not reflect the long-term value of the franchise. But the pressures we have seen will likely continue for the foreseeable future before abating.
Now over to Vasant."

In a turbulent and uncertain global environment, we're pleased to report that our business performed well in the first quarter with results modestly ahead of our expectations.A few highlights. Net operating revenues increased 8% in cons",1634,"Thanks, Charlie. In a turbulent and uncertain global environment, we're pleased to report that our business performed well in the first quarter with results modestly ahead of our expectations.
A few highlights. Net operating revenues increased 8% in constant dollars. The exchange rate drag was 3 percentage points, both in line with expectations. Weaker-than-anticipated cross-border revenue was offset by lower-than-expected client incentives. Client incentives were lower due to softer volumes in international markets and some deal delays.
Expenses only grew 2%, well below the high single-digit rate we had indicated. We have focused hard on prioritizing and phasing our spending program given the uncertain macroeconomic environment. As the year progresses, we will continue to look at opportunities to moderate expense growth while ensuring critical initiatives are adequately funded. We marked down the value of the Visa Europe put from $255 million to 0, since the VE Board, Visa Europe Board, amended the put in connection with our proposed acquisition.
We are required to revalue the put each quarter. We're still awaiting regulatory clearance, but expect to close the transaction in line with the transaction agreement, leading us to lower the value of the put. This noncash, nonoperating gain added $0.10 to our reported earnings.
As a reminder, should the deal not close, the put will be reinstated in its unamended form and we will need to value this liability based on all available information at that point.
In December, we issued $16 billion in debt with maturities ranging from 2 to 30 years. The weighted average interest rate was 3.08% with a weighted average maturity of 13.1 years. This was the low end of the 3% to 3.5% interest rate range we indicated last year. We are pleased with this outcome. We will, of course, use the proceeds to fund the upfront cash consideration for the Visa Europe acquisition as well as to step up stock buybacks over the next 5 to 6 quarters to offset the dilutive impact of preferred stock that will be issued to VE members.
With the debt structure now in place, we will have interest expenses of $125 million each quarter, almost $0.04 per share. In the first quarter, we recorded interest expense of $24 million. We will incur the full $125 million interest expense in the second quarter with no offsetting benefit from Visa Europe operating income.
Finally, we repurchased 25.7 million shares during the quarter at an average price of $78.52 per share for a total of $2 billion. As we had indicated, we stepped up the pace of our buybacks to make up for stock not purchased in the fourth quarter last year due to the impending Visa Europe transaction. At the end of the quarter, we had remaining authorization of $5.8 billion for stock repurchases. We have continued to be buyers of our stock in January under our 10B5 program.
Moving onto the quarter's business drivers. Global payment volume growth in constant dollars for the December quarter continued to be strong at 11%. U.S. credit grew 9%, moderating 1 percentage point compared to the September quarter as the positive effects of the Chase conversion have lapsed. U.S. debit grew 10%, up 1 percentage point, benefiting from some IntelliLink gains. Adjusted for conversions and the impact of gas prices, underlying growth in U.S. payment volumes for both debit and credit have stayed very stable over the past several quarters.
In the quarter, the gas price drag was around 1 percentage point on credit and 2 percentage points on debit. In December, we lapsed the inflection point for gas price declines, which should help reported growth rates going forward, although gas prices will remain a modest drag since pricing is still below last year. This is already evident in January U.S. aggregate payment volume numbers, which show a modest uptick of 1 percentage point to 11% through January 21. To date, macroeconomic weakness is not evident in U.S. consumer spending, but this could change as the year progresses.
International payment volume constant dollar growth of 14% was down 1 percentage point from the prior quarter. While 14% is a healthy level of growth, we have seen a step down in growth rates in Brazil, Russia and the Middle East as a result of the oil price collapse and weakness in commodity markets. Growth has remained strong across Mexico and other parts of Latin America as well as parts of Asia like India. Of course, the impact of the strong dollar on international payment volumes has been significant with growth flat in nominal terms.
Cross-border volumes have been slowing for several quarters now. Cross-border growth continued to decelerate, dropping to 4% in the December quarter from 5% in the prior quarter. In the past quarter, we saw a sharp slowdown in outbound commerce from China and the Middle East, and a strong dollar continues to hurt commerce into the U.S. You might recall that we had expected cross-border trends to remain weak in the first half and had hoped for some improvement in the second half of our fiscal year as comparisons became easier and/or the dollar stabilized.
Given recent trends that appears less likely due to the deceleration from oil-linked and China-linked economies. Through January 21, cross-border volume growth in constant dollars is running at 5%. On the positive front, inbound commerce into Europe remains the strongest corridor, though this has also slowed due to China and the Middle East.
Post the closing of the Visa Europe transaction, we will begin to benefit from growth of commerce into Europe. Transactions processed over VisaNet totaled $19 billion in the first quarter, an 8% increase over the prior period and unchanged from the September quarter.
The U.S. delivered 11% growth and international growth was flat, both unchanged from the prior quarter. As a reminder, the international growth rate is negatively impacted by the transfer of domestic processing in Russia that started at the end of April. Through January 21, process transaction growth was 8% with a U.S. rate of 11% and flat international growth.
Turning to our financial results. Service revenues grew 7% in excess of nominal payment volume growth of 4%, helped by the pricing actions we took last year. Data processing revenues also grew 7%. Both were in line with our expectations. International revenue growth dropped to 6% from 16% in the prior quarter. Currency volatility moderated substantially in the quarter, reverting to the long-term mean. This drives most of the decline in the reported rate of growth. The impact of the pricing actions we took last year was largely offset by the significant negative impact from exchange rates.
While this sharp decline in the growth rate of international revenues was mostly expected, cross-border volumes were weaker as I mentioned earlier due to China and the Middle East. Exchange rates and revenues from currency volatility will continue to be a drag on reported international revenue growth through the year. Other revenues were down 3%, primarily as a result of lower license fees generated outside the U.S. due to slowing payment volume growth.
As it became clear that the global economy was going to experience a period of turbulence and uncertainty, we focused hard on prioritizing and phasing our spending plans for the year. As such, we were able to limit our expense growth to 2%. We held the line on personnel costs and professional fees, marketing programs have been reprioritized and phased in the context of the uncertain revenue outlook for the year. Network and processing expenses grew due to the NSP card transition in Russia.
Reported G&A expenses were up, driven by a variety of factors, including exchange rate adjustments and cost of product enhancements. Our adjusted effective tax rate was 29.3%, modestly lower than our full-year expectation on low 30s. This was largely due to the recognition of certain benefits earlier than we had anticipated. Our full year tax rate projection remains unchanged.
Looking ahead to the second quarter. Service and transaction processing revenue trends remain unchanged. International revenues remain weak. Currency volatilities are high going into the quarter, but could revert to the mean as they did last quarter and we will lap high volatilities from last year. The exchange rate drag remains approximately 3 percentage points. Net-net, mid-single-digit nominal revenue growth appears likely to be sustained.
Expense growth rate will step up to the mid-single-digit range with increases in personnel costs and the growth in network and processing expenses due to Russia. One big change between the 2 quarters, which is important to note, is interest expense. We will have a full quarter interest expense starting in the second quarter of $125 million, almost $0.04 per share. We want to make sure you all incorporate this into your models going forward.
As we look ahead to the second half of the year, our primary concern is the economic weakness in international markets and the risk that it will impact the U.S. As you may recall from our commentary last quarter, our outlook assumed some second half acceleration in U.S. growth and higher cross-border growth due to easier comparisons. Current trends create some uncertainty around our revenue outlook for the year.
As the year progresses, we will continue to look at opportunities to moderate expense growth while ensuring critical initiatives are adequately funded. At this point, there is not much more we can tell you about the back half. In terms of Visa Europe, we do not have any financial updates at this time. As a reminder, our outlook for the full year excludes Visa Europe. Assuming things proceed as planned, we will provide more detail on our second half expectations, inclusive of Visa Europe, when we talk to you again at the end of April.
With that, I'll turn this back to Jack."

Domestically across the world, there are local networks that we compete with. And there are emerging global competitors such as Chinese UnionPay in the traditional space as well as a series of people in the e-com space whose names you know that we continue to compete with. I think when we think about what we have at Visa in the quality of the network, the safety, the security, the global acceptance and now the capabilities that we built in the world of digital commerce and the value-added services, we feel terrific about our ability to continue to compete. And we're very, very clear that we know that we have to continue to add value to transactions that run over our network in order to sustain the kind of margins that make this such an attractive business.

So let me take a stab at it and then Vasant, you can add anything you want to add.

So let me take a stab at it and then Vasant, you can add anything you want to add. I think -- so first of all, it's -- I just want to be really just clear for a second, is we are not building a business which is consumer direct and we're not building a business which is merchant direct. There are occasional times when we will do something directly with the consumer or directly with the merchant. But it's in a way that supports the 4-party model in a way that we believe is ultimately good for issuers and acquirers. We're just acting as the facilitator. So we still very, very much believe that the model that we have is an amazing model and we continue to -- most of what we do to work through those people. But the fact is, we are a consumer brand. And we have a role that we've got to play there. When it comes to the comments on expenses, I think -- I guess what you should take away is that nothing that we have done when it comes to rephasing, delaying or reducing any of the expense dollars that we contemplated, in our minds, relate to anything which is going to help build the business for the future. I mean if you asked us, are we as efficient as we should be, are we spending every last dollar wisely across the place. The answer is no, and the answer is still no today. And so what this environment does is it gives us the ability to take a harder look at where we're not as efficient as we should be and attack those dollars. So we've not cut back on anything that relates to building our digital business, the APIs and SDKs that are part of the developer center, the things that we're doing on behalf of merchants, the things that we're doing on behalf of issuers to build our consulting services. We're still very, very committed to building that. And as we think about what this environment does is, it's just creating extra focus for us. We certainly don't think that the slowdown that we're seeing that's affecting the business is something that changes the business model for the long-term. So we're not going to change the things that we think really build the business for the long-term as we sit here."

The implementation piece, I forgot what it was. But it's dramatically quicker and easier for a merchant to implement. If they can fit us into their queue, it's literally weeks at this point as opposed to when we had the first incarnation, it was multiple months. So the real issue is just making sure they understand why it's good for them and just having a merchant decide that it's a priority for them and that's what we're starting to see."

So we see all these as not really reflecting the long-term trends in our business. And so we really don't want to change anything in terms of our long-term profile of investment. But we are also mindful of the fact that the next few quarters we will face the same pressures. So all we're really doing is being prudent and prioritizing. We're not fundamentally changing anything in our investment posture. And I guess the next question was on Visa Checkout numbers, I think you provided some in your comments."

And of course, there is the evolving relationship with JPMorgan and what they're doing there on ChasePay. And so I wonder, is there something occurring now between Visa and the banks in terms of the kind of relationship that banks are seeking to have with you in the United States that's different than in the past? Because it seems like the stance is a little more aggressive in response to some of the dynamics that are making growth so hard to come by in the states."

I think it's -- there are couple of different things going on. I think first of all, part of what you're seeing in the evolving relationships that banks have with the networks, not just in the U.S. but around the world is as the years passed since we've transitioned from association to public company, networks are kind of sorting out their point of -- I'm sorry, banks are sorting out their point of views on networks and what they want those relationships to look like. And so what you start to see now is, at the same time, payments evolving very, very rapidly, driven mostly by digital. But by -- but I think also as importantly, the payments businesses, broadly, including the debit card business and the credit card businesses, are now very much a part of what a bank does and the way they think about their entire relationships as opposed to 5, 6, 7, 8 years ago, we were transitioning from the majority of the business being done on the credit side by standalone companies. So all of a sudden, being integrated into a bank but still being run separately. So as they combine these businesses and really run them as an integrated business, they are now thinking about how -- what -- how they need to have a partnership with a payment network, which is much more strategic as opposed to just a third-party provider services. So what you're seeing is, you're seeing longer-term contracts whether it's people who used to do 1 and 2-year contracts, and now you've seen us do 3, 5, 7 and 10 in some cases. And that's because it is a different kind of relationship. I think the other thing that's going on in the marketplace is you start to see, especially here in the United States, banks have become very, very good at understanding the different segments, the different opportunities that they have to use payment products to serve their clients. And they're able to compete with the likes of other names out there that they didn't necessarily focus on before, and are having great success in that. And when you have success, it gives you confidence to go get more aggressive in some of these co-brands and some of these other things that you see. So what we want to do is to be the payment partner of choice, to be the one that helps them think strategically as well as to be the best actual provider of network services. And you're seeing people make choices relative to who their network partner is, and what that means for the aggressiveness in the marketplace is it's a more competitive marketplace. But again to me, that's something we've seen it increasing over a period of time and it's because there are people -- there are more people that have better abilities in the payment space today than there were 3 years ago, 5 years ago or 10 years ago."

If you look at multiple quarters all the way through last year and into this year, and you adjust for, as we said conversions and gas prices, it's been very stable. Certainly question marks about whether there's benefits from gas prices floating in, too. We've seen a little bit of that on the debit side. We said that earlier. Yes, there is a small benefit as you look at January from the impact of gas prices declining. But gas prices are still below where they were last year. So we had a 2 percentage point impact on debit, 1 on credit. That will moderate, but it won't go away completely. So most of it, we would ascribe to that. Wouldn't read too much into 3 weeks of January, we then had some awful weather in the last few weeks -- last few days, and that definitely will affect some of the commerce.

But then there is the other impact, which will play out overtime, which is commerce into the U.S. which is a big part of our business. And then in the second half, certainly Europe will be part of Visa. And the travel into Europe has been better than travel into other geographies. So hopefully, that will help us.

W",1676,"Thank you, Jack. I'm going to start with a series of comments both about the quarter and a little bit about what we're seeing in the world, and then I will pass it over to Vasant before we take questions.
First a few comments about the overall results. We continue to be pleased with the performance of the company, given the ongoing macroeconomic headwinds that we have discussed before. Operating revenue grew 5% nominally or 8% on a constant currency basis, reflecting a negative 3 percentage point impact from FX. Adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 10%. Volume growth continued at a healthy pace growing 11.5% in constant dollars only down slightly from September's 12% growth. U.S. payments volume growth was essentially flat at about 10%, again, healthy growth. International payments volume growth was 14%, down 1 point from last quarter, but we continue to see weakness in cross-border volume.
U.S. outbound spend is strong, but it is offset by continued weakness from Canada, Brazil and Russia and more recently, we're seeing increasing weakness in the Middle East and China. We do see some areas of strength such as Mexico, Japan and New Zealand, but they're obviously smaller markets for us.
Now a couple of words about the U.S. holiday season. Overall, consumer spending by our Visa cardholders during the season was similar to last year, but spending patterns are changing. E-commerce continues to grow at a much higher rate than the spending at physical stores. We saw mid-teens e-commerce growth during the holiday period versus mid-single digits growth in the physical world.
More than 25% of all spending on Visa cards during November and December was online, up from less than 20% just 3 years ago. Also, the pattern of spending during the holidays has changed. While Black Friday and Cyber Monday remain important shopping days, less spending is consolidated on these 2 days than recent years and more people delayed their spending to later in the season this year.
Let me move on and say a couple of words about Visa Europe. We're making very good progress. We continue to work towards a projected second calendar quarter closing. We've received 2 of 3 required regulatory approvals with the third one that's required from the European Commission. Vasant will discuss it, but we feel very good about the execution of our $16 billion debt financing. And most importantly, we feel as good about the transaction today as the day we made our announcement.
We've had great interactions with our Visa European colleagues. We've had a series of very positive conversations with European financial institutions and we remain confident that we're creating value and are focused on execution at this point.
Move on to China now. We continue to work towards the ability to make a formal application. We're waiting for final regulations to be released. We have a clear path to have a compliant operating environment, so we can compete domestically if we are awarded a license. I was in China last week and participated in the signing of 2 MOUs. They involve Visa working with 2 Chinese groups on driving financial inclusion as a means to support poverty alleviation. The strategic partnership and programs we announced underscore our long-term commitment to China and to fulfilling the Chinese government's goal of reducing poverty and promoting inclusive finance.
We also continue to collaborate with government institutions, industry organizations and NGOs to support the global goals of a leading -- of alleviating poverty, promoting transparency and fostering inclusive social and economic development. As we work through our plans for entry into the domestic Chinese marketplace, we continue to feel good about our ability to help expand the rate of growth of the Chinese economy and increase the Chinese bank's ability to compete domestically, especially in the e-commerce space.
Talk for a second about some client activity. In the United States, we expanded our relationship with Fidelity and U.S. Bank, where we are now the exclusive payment network for their co-brand card. Card members can earn cash back with the Fidelity rewards Visa Signature Card and the Fidelity investments 529 College Rewards Visa Signature Card. The new cards on the program will be issued with chip technology for security and give access to the payment industry's leading digital wallets, including Apple Pay, Samsung Pay and Android Pay.
Visa and Walmart announced an acceptance agreement with Sam's Club. Beginning next Monday, more than 650 Sam's Clubs across the United States and Puerto Rico will begin accepting Visa credit cards in store. Walmart.com and SamsClub.com will also begin supporting Visa Checkout this year. And we continue to expand our relationships with clients around the world as well.
Just a few notable highlights. We've seen very strong renewal activity across the world in places such as New Zealand, India, China and Latin America. Some names include ANZ in New Zealand, ICICI, Bank of China and the Agricultural Bank of China. In Latin America, we renewed a multiyear credit, debit and commercial agreement with BBVA, one of the largest issuers within our Latin American region. The deal covers 7 markets, including: Chile, Peru, Venezuela, Uruguay, Paraguay, Argentina and Colombia. And we renewed a multiyear credit and debit agreement with Bradesco, another one of our largest issuers in Latin America.
Let me say a few words about Visa Checkout. We continue to be encouraged by the growth that we see since it was launched 18 months ago. We have more than 10 million registered users in 16 countries and over 600 financial institution partners participating globally. More than 250,000 merchants, including some of our largest global retailers have signed on to accept Visa Checkout, representing 100 billion in addressable volume. Starbucks, Walgreens, NFL Shop, HSN and Match are among the new merchants taking advantage of Visa Checkout's ability to deliver seamless digital payments. And as I mentioned earlier, Walmart.com and SamsClub.com will also begin supporting it this year. 
Our confidence in Visa Checkout is based upon independent research that supports the notion that it makes commerce easier for consumers and ultimately results in increased sales for merchants. According to new independent research from comScore, Visa Checkout significantly increases sales conversion. Visa Checkout customers completed 86% of transactions compared to 73% for PayPal Express Checkout and 57% for the traditional merchant checkout. Visa Checkout customers are more active online shoppers in general, completing 30% more transactions per person than the overall population of online shoppers and 95% of Visa Checkout customers say sign up was easy and 96% feel secure making purchases with Visa Checkout.
We recently launched a new platform called Visa Commerce Network, built on the TrialPay platform, which we acquired in 2015. Visa Commerce Network enables our merchants to deliver targeted discounts and benefits to Visa cardholders in order to acquire new customers and increase sales. Visa cardholders receive these benefits seamlessly by simply using their Visa card to make purchases. No coupons or codes are required. To date, more than a dozen leading merchants including Dunkin' Donuts, Real Entertainment Group, Shake Shack and others have successfully used Visa Commerce Network, and we recently entered into a partnership with Uber. Uber riders have started receiving discounted rides when they use their Visa card at certain local retailers.
I'll say a couple of words about the migration to EMV in the United States. We reached an important milestone on October 1, which was the official kickoff to chip in the U.S. We're optimistic about the progress and momentum we're seeing as banks issue more cards, merchants activate chip terminals and consumers increasingly make secure chip transactions. Already, there are more Visa chip cards issued in the U.S. than in any other country in the world. More than 200 million Visa chip cards were issued as of December 2015: 43% of all credit cards representing 72% of purchase volume; 21% of all debit cards representing 45% of purchase volume. Over 750,000 merchant locations have enabled EMV, representing 17% of the total face-to-face locations in the U.S. Based on our recent client surveys, we expect 50% of locations to be enabled by the end of this year.
While we know we have a long way to go over the next few years to reach the critical mass of adoption that we desire, we feel very good about the progress to date.
Now before I turn it over to Vasant, just a few comments about the environment. It's clearly a mixed bag, but certainly creating some short-term pressures for us. The headwinds we discussed last quarter continue and are probably slightly worse with little relief in sight in the short-term. As a reminder, they are the translation impact of the strong U.S. dollar; reduced cross-border volume, driven by the strong dollar; continuing drag from lower oil prices; and while we are believers in China for the long-term, the domestic volatility is creating increased headwinds for us.
These headwinds are muting our growth today both through the translation effects as well as reduced business volumes and will likely continue for the foreseeable future. But our ability to grow over the long-term will be driven by our continued strong underlying payment volume growth. So our mindset is that we have to be cautious in the short-term due to the headwinds, but the long-term fundamentals of our business volume growth remain strong.
And as I've said before, our business volumes can change quickly with changes in the U.S. dollar and domestic consumer confidence around the world. It's just hard to predict the timing. Vasant will cover it in more detail. But even though there's been much talk over the past few weeks of a slowdown in the U.S., our business volumes in January have been strong.
So given all of this, our results are reasonably good, which speaks to the strength of our business model, our brand, our people, but do not reflect the long-term value of the franchise. But the pressures we have seen will likely continue for the foreseeable future before abating.
Now over to Vasant."

In a turbulent and uncertain global environment, we're pleased to report that our business performed well in the first quarter with results modestly ahead of our expectations.A few highlights. Net operating revenues increased 8% in cons",1634,"Thanks, Charlie. In a turbulent and uncertain global environment, we're pleased to report that our business performed well in the first quarter with results modestly ahead of our expectations.
A few highlights. Net operating revenues increased 8% in constant dollars. The exchange rate drag was 3 percentage points, both in line with expectations. Weaker-than-anticipated cross-border revenue was offset by lower-than-expected client incentives. Client incentives were lower due to softer volumes in international markets and some deal delays.
Expenses only grew 2%, well below the high single-digit rate we had indicated. We have focused hard on prioritizing and phasing our spending program given the uncertain macroeconomic environment. As the year progresses, we will continue to look at opportunities to moderate expense growth while ensuring critical initiatives are adequately funded. We marked down the value of the Visa Europe put from $255 million to 0, since the VE Board, Visa Europe Board, amended the put in connection with our proposed acquisition.
We are required to revalue the put each quarter. We're still awaiting regulatory clearance, but expect to close the transaction in line with the transaction agreement, leading us to lower the value of the put. This noncash, nonoperating gain added $0.10 to our reported earnings.
As a reminder, should the deal not close, the put will be reinstated in its unamended form and we will need to value this liability based on all available information at that point.
In December, we issued $16 billion in debt with maturities ranging from 2 to 30 years. The weighted average interest rate was 3.08% with a weighted average maturity of 13.1 years. This was the low end of the 3% to 3.5% interest rate range we indicated last year. We are pleased with this outcome. We will, of course, use the proceeds to fund the upfront cash consideration for the Visa Europe acquisition as well as to step up stock buybacks over the next 5 to 6 quarters to offset the dilutive impact of preferred stock that will be issued to VE members.
With the debt structure now in place, we will have interest expenses of $125 million each quarter, almost $0.04 per share. In the first quarter, we recorded interest expense of $24 million. We will incur the full $125 million interest expense in the second quarter with no offsetting benefit from Visa Europe operating income.
Finally, we repurchased 25.7 million shares during the quarter at an average price of $78.52 per share for a total of $2 billion. As we had indicated, we stepped up the pace of our buybacks to make up for stock not purchased in the fourth quarter last year due to the impending Visa Europe transaction. At the end of the quarter, we had remaining authorization of $5.8 billion for stock repurchases. We have continued to be buyers of our stock in January under our 10B5 program.
Moving onto the quarter's business drivers. Global payment volume growth in constant dollars for the December quarter continued to be strong at 11%. U.S. credit grew 9%, moderating 1 percentage point compared to the September quarter as the positive effects of the Chase conversion have lapsed. U.S. debit grew 10%, up 1 percentage point, benefiting from some IntelliLink gains. Adjusted for conversions and the impact of gas prices, underlying growth in U.S. payment volumes for both debit and credit have stayed very stable over the past several quarters.
In the quarter, the gas price drag was around 1 percentage point on credit and 2 percentage points on debit. In December, we lapsed the inflection point for gas price declines, which should help reported growth rates going forward, although gas prices will remain a modest drag since pricing is still below last year. This is already evident in January U.S. aggregate payment volume numbers, which show a modest uptick of 1 percentage point to 11% through January 21. To date, macroeconomic weakness is not evident in U.S. consumer spending, but this could change as the year progresses.
International payment volume constant dollar growth of 14% was down 1 percentage point from the prior quarter. While 14% is a healthy level of growth, we have seen a step down in growth rates in Brazil, Russia and the Middle East as a result of the oil price collapse and weakness in commodity markets. Growth has remained strong across Mexico and other parts of Latin America as well as parts of Asia like India. Of course, the impact of the strong dollar on international payment volumes has been significant with growth flat in nominal terms.
Cross-border volumes have been slowing for several quarters now. Cross-border growth continued to decelerate, dropping to 4% in the December quarter from 5% in the prior quarter. In the past quarter, we saw a sharp slowdown in outbound commerce from China and the Middle East, and a strong dollar continues to hurt commerce into the U.S. You might recall that we had expected cross-border trends to remain weak in the first half and had hoped for some improvement in the second half of our fiscal year as comparisons became easier and/or the dollar stabilized.
Given recent trends that appears less likely due to the deceleration from oil-linked and China-linked economies. Through January 21, cross-border volume growth in constant dollars is running at 5%. On the positive front, inbound commerce into Europe remains the strongest corridor, though this has also slowed due to China and the Middle East.
Post the closing of the Visa Europe transaction, we will begin to benefit from growth of commerce into Europe. Transactions processed over VisaNet totaled $19 billion in the first quarter, an 8% increase over the prior period and unchanged from the September quarter.
The U.S. delivered 11% growth and international growth was flat, both unchanged from the prior quarter. As a reminder, the international growth rate is negatively impacted by the transfer of domestic processing in Russia that started at the end of April. Through January 21, process transaction growth was 8% with a U.S. rate of 11% and flat international growth.
Turning to our financial results. Service revenues grew 7% in excess of nominal payment volume growth of 4%, helped by the pricing actions we took last year. Data processing revenues also grew 7%. Both were in line with our expectations. International revenue growth dropped to 6% from 16% in the prior quarter. Currency volatility moderated substantially in the quarter, reverting to the long-term mean. This drives most of the decline in the reported rate of growth. The impact of the pricing actions we took last year was largely offset by the significant negative impact from exchange rates.
While this sharp decline in the growth rate of international revenues was mostly expected, cross-border volumes were weaker as I mentioned earlier due to China and the Middle East. Exchange rates and revenues from currency volatility will continue to be a drag on reported international revenue growth through the year. Other revenues were down 3%, primarily as a result of lower license fees generated outside the U.S. due to slowing payment volume growth.
As it became clear that the global economy was going to experience a period of turbulence and uncertainty, we focused hard on prioritizing and phasing our spending plans for the year. As such, we were able to limit our expense growth to 2%. We held the line on personnel costs and professional fees, marketing programs have been reprioritized and phased in the context of the uncertain revenue outlook for the year. Network and processing expenses grew due to the NSP card transition in Russia.
Reported G&A expenses were up, driven by a variety of factors, including exchange rate adjustments and cost of product enhancements. Our adjusted effective tax rate was 29.3%, modestly lower than our full-year expectation on low 30s. This was largely due to the recognition of certain benefits earlier than we had anticipated. Our full year tax rate projection remains unchanged.
Looking ahead to the second quarter. Service and transaction processing revenue trends remain unchanged. International revenues remain weak. Currency volatilities are high going into the quarter, but could revert to the mean as they did last quarter and we will lap high volatilities from last year. The exchange rate drag remains approximately 3 percentage points. Net-net, mid-single-digit nominal revenue growth appears likely to be sustained.
Expense growth rate will step up to the mid-single-digit range with increases in personnel costs and the growth in network and processing expenses due to Russia. One big change between the 2 quarters, which is important to note, is interest expense. We will have a full quarter interest expense starting in the second quarter of $125 million, almost $0.04 per share. We want to make sure you all incorporate this into your models going forward.
As we look ahead to the second half of the year, our primary concern is the economic weakness in international markets and the risk that it will impact the U.S. As you may recall from our commentary last quarter, our outlook assumed some second half acceleration in U.S. growth and higher cross-border growth due to easier comparisons. Current trends create some uncertainty around our revenue outlook for the year.
As the year progresses, we will continue to look at opportunities to moderate expense growth while ensuring critical initiatives are adequately funded. At this point, there is not much more we can tell you about the back half. In terms of Visa Europe, we do not have any financial updates at this time. As a reminder, our outlook for the full year excludes Visa Europe. Assuming things proceed as planned, we will provide more detail on our second half expectations, inclusive of Visa Europe, when we talk to you again at the end of April.
With that, I'll turn this back to Jack."

Domestically across the world, there are local networks that we compete with. And there are emerging global competitors such as Chinese UnionPay in the traditional space as well as a series of people in the e-com space whose names you know that we continue to compete with. I think when we think about what we have at Visa in the quality of the network, the safety, the security, the global acceptance and now the capabilities that we built in the world of digital commerce and the value-added services, we feel terrific about our ability to continue to compete. And we're very, very clear that we know that we have to continue to add value to transactions that run over our network in order to sustain the kind of margins that make this such an attractive business.

So let me take a stab at it and then Vasant, you can add anything you want to add.

So let me take a stab at it and then Vasant, you can add anything you want to add. I think -- so first of all, it's -- I just want to be really just clear for a second, is we are not building a business which is consumer direct and we're not building a business which is merchant direct. There are occasional times when we will do something directly with the consumer or directly with the merchant. But it's in a way that supports the 4-party model in a way that we believe is ultimately good for issuers and acquirers. We're just acting as the facilitator. So we still very, very much believe that the model that we have is an amazing model and we continue to -- most of what we do to work through those people. But the fact is, we are a consumer brand. And we have a role that we've got to play there. When it comes to the comments on expenses, I think -- I guess what you should take away is that nothing that we have done when it comes to rephasing, delaying or reducing any of the expense dollars that we contemplated, in our minds, relate to anything which is going to help build the business for the future. I mean if you asked us, are we as efficient as we should be, are we spending every last dollar wisely across the place. The answer is no, and the answer is still no today. And so what this environment does is it gives us the ability to take a harder look at where we're not as efficient as we should be and attack those dollars. So we've not cut back on anything that relates to building our digital business, the APIs and SDKs that are part of the developer center, the things that we're doing on behalf of merchants, the things that we're doing on behalf of issuers to build our consulting services. We're still very, very committed to building that. And as we think about what this environment does is, it's just creating extra focus for us.

When we're able to quote the kind of numbers that we're able to quote on comScore for what it actually does to merchant sites, and the merchants themselves actually share those experiences, nothing is -- nothing changes the sales discussion more than that. And so I think it's fair to say when we first started these discussions, it could be 6 to 9 months in terms of a calling process, if not longer. I'll tell you, I saw a note today on the way down here that we got an incoming call from a sizable merchant, which was very surprising to me, saying that they would like to implement Visa Checkout. So it really is -- I mean, the game is changing. But we also -- in our minds we know, I mean, this is merchant by merchant. It's a long-term build and we just have to continue to show the kinds of progress that we're seeing with these, both the numbers of merchants and the size of merchants. The implementation piece, I forgot what it was. But it's dramatically quicker and easier for a merchant to implement. If they can fit us into their queue, it's literally weeks at this point as opposed to when we had the first incarnation, it was multiple months. So the real issue is just making sure they understand why it's good for them and just having a merchant decide that it's a priority for them and that's what we're starting to see."

The thing to point out is, if you look at international payment volumes as we said in our comments, in constant dollars they were actually up 14%. So it's still incredibly healthy growth. And then in nominal terms, it comes down to 0, so you can see what a huge impact exchange rates have had. And U.S. payment volumes both credit and debit, if you adjust for conversion and gas, have been remarkably stable. So that's what makes us optimistic about the long-term. In the short run, as Charlie said, I mean, there's 2 issues, the strong dollar is hurting commerce into the U.S., which is a very sizable business for us and has been a big drag now for multiple years. The dollar also affects translation, you saw that from 14% constant dollar growth to 0. It's huge. And then cross-border trends, clearly, are being hurt by both the strong dollar as well as what's happening in commodity markets, China, et cetera. So we see all these as not really reflecting the long-term trends in our business. And so we really don't want to change anything in terms of our long-term profile of investment. But we are also mindful of the fact that the next few quarters we will face the same pressures. So all we're really doing is being prudent and prioritizing.

I think it's -- there are couple of different things going on. I think first of all, part of what you're seeing in the evolving relationships that banks have with the networks, not just in the U.S. but around the world is as the years passed since we've transitioned from association to public company, networks are kind of sorting out their point of -- I'm sorry, banks are sorting out their point of views on networks and what they want those relationships to look like. And so what you start to see now is, at the same time, payments evolving very, very rapidly, driven mostly by digital. But by -- but I think also as importantly, the payments businesses, broadly, including the debit card business and the credit card businesses, are now very much a part of what a bank does and the way they think about their entire relationships as opposed to 5, 6, 7, 8 years ago, we were transitioning from the majority of the business being done on the credit side by standalone companies. So all of a sudden, being integrated into a bank but still being run separately. So as they combine these businesses and really run them as an integrated business, they are now thinking about how -- what -- how they need to have a partnership with a payment network, which is much more strategic as opposed to just a third-party provider services. So what you're seeing is, you're seeing longer-term contracts whether it's people who used to do 1 and 2-year contracts, and now you've seen us do 3, 5, 7 and 10 in some cases. And that's because it is a different kind of relationship. I think the other thing that's going on in the marketplace is you start to see, especially here in the United States, banks have become very, very good at understanding the different segments, the different opportunities that they have to use payment products to serve their clients. And they're able to compete with the likes of other names out there that they didn't necessarily focus on before, and are having great success in that. And when you have success, it gives you confidence to go get more aggressive in some of these co-brands and some of these other things that you see. So what we want to do is to be the payment partner of choice, to be the one that helps them think strategically as well as to be the best actual provider of network services. And you're seeing people make choices relative to who their network partner is, and what that means for the aggressiveness in the marketplace is it's a more competitive marketplace. But again to me, that's something we've seen it increasing over a period of time and it's because there are people -- there are more people that have better abilities in the payment space today than there were 3 years ago, 5 years ago or 10 years ago."

Certainly question marks about whether there's benefits from gas prices floating in, too. We've seen a little bit of that on the debit side. We said that earlier. Yes, there is a small benefit as you look at January from the impact of gas prices declining. But gas prices are still below where they were last year. So we had a 2 percentage point impact on debit, 1 on credit. That will moderate, but it won't go away completely. So most of it, we would ascribe to that. Wouldn't read too much into 3 weeks of January, we then had some awful weather in the last few weeks -- last few days, and that definitely will affect some of the commerce.

I'm going to start with a series of comments both about the quarter and a little bit about what we're seeing in the world, and then I will pass it over to Vasant before we take questions.
First a few comments about the overall results. We continue to be pleased with the performance of the company, given the ongoing macroeconomic headwinds that we have discussed before. Operating revenue grew 5% nominally or 8% on a constant currency basis, reflecting a negative 3 percentage point impact from FX. Adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 10%. Volume growth continued at a healthy pace growing 11.5% in constant dollars only down slightly from September's 12% growth. U.S. payments volume growth was essentially flat at about 10%, again, healthy growth. International payments volume growth was 14%, down 1 point from last quarter, but we continue to see weakness in cross-border volume.
U.S. outbound spend is strong, but it is offset by continued weakness from Canada, Brazil and Russia and more recently, we're seeing increasing weakness in the Middle East and China. We do see some areas of strength such as Mexico, Japan and New Zealand, but they're obviously smaller markets for us.
Now a couple of words about the U.S. holiday season. Overall, consumer spending by our Visa cardholders during the season was similar to last year, but spending patterns are changing. E-commerce continues to grow at a much higher rate than the spending at physical stores. We saw mid-teens e-commerce growth during the holiday period versus mid-single digits growth in the physical world.
More than 25% of all spending on Visa cards during November and December was online, up from less than 20% just 3 years ago. Also, the pattern of spending during the holidays has changed. While Black Friday and Cyber Monday remain important shopping days, less spending is consolidated on these 2 days than recent years and more people delayed their spending to later in the season this year.
We move on and say a couple of words about Visa Europe. We're making very good progress. We continue to work towards a projected second calendar quarter closing. We've received 2 of 3 required regulatory approvals with the third one that's required from the European Commission. Vasant will discuss it, but we feel very good about the execution of our $16 billion debt financing. And most importantly, we feel as good about the transaction today as the day we made our announcement.
We've had great interactions with our Visa European colleagues. We've had a series of very positive conversations with European financial institutions and we remain confident that we're creating value and are focused on execution at this point.
Move on to China now. We continue to work towards the ability to make a formal application. We're waiting for final regulations to be released. We have a clear path to have a compliant operating environment, so we can compete domestically if we are awarded a license. I was in China last week and participated in the signing of 2 MOUs. They involve Visa working with 2 Chinese groups on driving financial inclusion as a means to support poverty alleviation. The strategic partnership and programs we announced underscore our long-term commitment to China and to fulfilling the Chinese government's goal of reducing poverty and promoting inclusive finance.
We also continue to collaborate with government institutions, industry organizations and NGOs to support the global goals of a leading -- of alleviating poverty, promoting transparency and fostering inclusive social and economic development. As we work through our plans for entry into the domestic Chinese marketplace, we continue to feel good about our ability to help expand the rate of growth of the Chinese economy and increase the Chinese banks' ability to compete domestically, especially in the e-commerce space.
Talk for a second about some client activity. In the United States, we expanded our relationship with Fidelity and U.S. Bank, where we are now the exclusive payment network for their co-brand card. Card members can earn cash back with the Fidelity rewards Visa Signature Card and the Fidelity Investments 529 College Rewards Visa Signature Card. The new cards on the program will be issued with chip technology for security and give access to the payment industry's leading digital wallets, including Apple Pay, Samsung Pay and Android Pay.
Visa and Walmart announced an acceptance agreement with Sam's Club. Beginning next Monday, more than 650 Sam's Clubs across the United States and Puerto Rico will begin accepting Visa credit cards in store. Walmart.com and SamsClub.com will also begin supporting Visa Checkout this year. And we continue to expand our relationships with clients around the world as well.
Just a few notable highlights. We've seen very strong renewal activity across the world in places such as New Zealand, India, China and Latin America. Some names include ANZ in New Zealand, ICICI, Bank of China and the Agricultural Bank of China. In Latin America, we renewed a multiyear credit, debit and commercial agreement with BBVA, one of the largest issuers within our Latin American region. The deal covers 7 markets, including Chile, Peru, Venezuela, Uruguay, Paraguay, Argentina and Colombia. And we renewed a multiyear credit and debit agreement with Bradesco, another one of our largest issuers in Latin America.
We say a few words about Visa Checkout. We continue to be encouraged by the growth that we see since it was launched 18 months ago. We have more than 10 million registered users in 16 countries and over 600 financial institution partners participating globally. More than 250,000 merchants, including some of our largest global retailers, have signed on to accept Visa Checkout, representing $100 billion in addressable volume. Starbucks, Walgreens, NFL Shop, HSN and Match are among the new merchants taking advantage of Visa Checkout's ability to deliver seamless digital payments. And as I mentioned earlier, Walmart.com and SamsClub.com will also begin supporting it this year. 
Our confidence in Visa Checkout is based upon independent research that supports the notion that it makes commerce easier for consumers and ultimately results in increased sales for merchants. According to new independent research from comScore, Visa Checkout significantly increases sales conversion. Visa Checkout customers completed 86% of transactions compared to 73% for PayPal Express Checkout and 57% for the traditional merchant checkout. Visa Checkout customers are more active online shoppers in general, completing 30% more transactions per person than the overall population of online shoppers and 95% of Visa Checkout customers say sign up was easy and 96% feel secure making purchases with Visa Checkout.
We recently launched a new platform called Visa Commerce Network, built on the TrialPay platform, which we acquired in 2015. Visa Commerce Network enables our merchants to deliver targeted discounts and benefits to Visa cardholders in order to acquire new customers and increase sales. Visa cardholders receive these benefits seamlessly by simply using their Visa card to make purchases. No coupons or codes are required. To date, more than a dozen leading merchants including Dunkin' Donuts, Regal Entertainment Group, Shake Shack and others have successfully used Visa Commerce Network, and we recently entered into a partnership with Uber. Uber riders have started receiving discounted rides when they use their Visa card at certain local retailers.
We say a couple of words about the migration to EMV in the United States. We reached an important milestone on October 1, which was the official kickoff to chip in the U.S. We're optimistic about the progress and momentum we're seeing as banks issue more cards, merchants activate chip terminals and consumers increasingly make secure chip transactions. Already, there are more Visa chip cards issued in the U.S. than in any other country in the world. More than 200 million Visa chip cards were issued as of December 2015: 43% of all credit cards representing 72% of purchase volume, 21% of all debit cards representing 45% of purchase volume. Over 750,000 merchant locations have enabled EMV, representing 17% of the total face-to-face locations in the U.S. Based on our recent client surveys, we expect 50% of locations to be enabled by the end of this year.
While we know we have a long way to go over the next few years to reach the critical mass of adoption that we desire, we feel very good about the progress to date.
Now before I turn it over to Vasant, just a few comments about the environment. It's clearly a mixed bag, but certainly creating some short-term pressures for us. The headwinds we discussed last quarter continue and are probably slightly worse with little relief in sight in the short-term. As a reminder, they are the translation impact of the strong U.S. dollar; reduced cross-border volume, driven by the strong dollar; continuing drag from lower oil prices; and while we are believers in China for the long-term, the domestic volatility is creating increased headwinds for us.
These headwinds are muting our growth today both through the translation effects as well as reduced business volumes and will likely continue for the seeable future. But our ability to grow over the long term will be driven by our continued strong underlying payment volume growth. So our mindset is that we have to be cautious in the short term due to the headwinds, but the long-term fundamentals of our business volume growth remain strong.
And as I've said before, our business volumes can change quickly. With changes in the U.S. dollar and domestic consumer confidence around the world, it's just hard to predict the timing. Vasant will cover it in more detail. But even though there's been much talk over the past few weeks of a slowdown in the U.S., our business volumes in January have been strong.
So given all of this, our results are reasonably good, which speaks to the strength of our business model, our brand, our people, but do not reflect the long-term value of the franchise. But the pressures we have seen will likely continue for the foreseeable future before abating.
Now over to Vasant."

Net operating revenues increased 8% in cons",1636,"Thanks, Charlie. In a turbulent and uncertain global environment, we're pleased to report that our business performed well in the first quarter with results modestly ahead of our expectations.
A few highlights. Net operating revenues increased 8% in constant dollars. The exchange rate drag was 3 percentage points, both in line with expectations. Weaker-than-anticipated cross-border revenue was offset by lower-than-expected client incentives. Client incentives were lower due to softer volumes in international markets and some deal delays.
Expenses only grew 2%, well below the high single-digit rate we had indicated. We have focused hard on prioritizing and phasing our spending program given the uncertain macroeconomic environment. As the year progresses, we will continue to look at opportunities to moderate expense growth while ensuring critical initiatives are adequately funded. We marked down the value of the Visa Europe put from $255 million to 0, since the VE Board, Visa Europe Board, amended the put in connection with our proposed acquisition.
We are required to revalue the put each quarter. We're still awaiting regulatory clearance, but expect to close the transaction in line with the transaction agreement, leading us to lower the value of the put. This noncash, nonoperating gain added $0.10 to our reported earning.
As a reminder, should the deal not close, the put will be reinstated in its unamended form and we will need to value this liability based on all available information at that point.
In December, we issued $16 billion in debt with maturities ranging from 2 to 30 years. The weighted average interest rate was 3.08% with a weighted average maturity of 13.1 years. This was the low end of the 3% to 3.5% interest rate range we indicated last year. We are pleased with this outcome. We will, of course, use the proceeds to fund the upfront cash consideration for the Visa Europe acquisition as well as to step up stock buybacks over the next 5 to 6 quarters to offset the dilutive impact of preferred stock that will be issued to VE members.
With the debt structure now in place, we will have interest expenses of $125 million each quarter, almost $0.04 per share. In the first quarter, we recorded interest expense of $24 million. We will incur the full $125 million interest expense in the second quarter with no offsetting benefit from Visa Europe operating income.
Finally, we repurchased 25.7 million shares during the quarter at an average price of $78.52 per share for a total of $2 billion. As we had indicated, we stepped up the pace of our buybacks to make up for stock not purchased in the fourth quarter last year due to the impending Visa Europe transaction. At the end of the quarter, we had remaining authorization of $5.8 billion for stock repurchases. We have continued to be buyers of our stock in January under our 10b5 program.
Moving onto the quarter's business drivers. Global payment volume growth in constant dollars for the December quarter continued to be strong at 11%. U.S. credit grew 9%, moderating 1 percentage point compared to the September quarter as the positive effects of the Chase conversion have lapsed. U.S. debit grew 10%, up 1 percentage point, benefiting from some IntelliLink gains. Adjusted for conversions and the impact of gas prices, underlying growth in U.S. payment volumes for both debit and credit has stayed very stable over the past several quarters.
In the quarter, the gas price drag was around 1 percentage point on credit and 2 percentage points on debit. In December, we lapsed the inflection point for gas price declines, which should help reported growth rates going forward, although gas prices will remain a modest drag since pricing is still below last year. This is already evident in January U.S. aggregate payment volume numbers, which show a modest uptick of 1 percentage point to 11% through January 21. To date, macroeconomic weakness is not evident in U.S. consumer spending, but this could change as the year progresses.
International payment volume constant dollar growth of 14% was down 1 percentage point from the prior quarter. While 14% is a healthy level of growth, we have seen a step down in growth rate in Brazil, Russia and the Middle East as a result of the oil price collapse and weakness in commodity markets. Growth has remained strong across Mexico and other parts of Latin America as well as parts of Asia like India. Of course, the impact of the strong dollar on international payment volumes has been significant with growth flat in nominal terms.
Cross-border volumes have been slowing for several quarters now. Cross-border growth continued to decelerate, dropping to 4% in the December quarter from 5% in the prior quarter. In the past quarter, we saw a sharp slowdown in outbound commerce from China and the Middle East, and the strong dollar continues to hurt commerce into the U.S. You might recall that we had expected cross-border trends to remain weak in the first half and had hoped for some improvement in the second half of our fiscal year as comparisons became easier and/or the dollar stabilized.
Given recent trends that appears less likely due to the deceleration from oil-linked and China-linked economies. Through January 21, cross-border volume growth in constant dollars is running at 5%. On the positive front, inbound commerce into Europe remains the strongest corridor, though this has also slowed due to China and the Middle East.
Post the closing of the Visa Europe transaction, we will begin to benefit from growth of commerce into Europe. Transactions processed over VisaNet totaled $19 billion in the first quarter, an 8% increase over the prior period and unchanged from the September quarter.
The U.S. delivered 11% growth and international growth was flat, both unchanged from the prior quarter. As a reminder, the international growth rate is negatively impacted by the transfer of domestic processing in Russia that started at the end of April. Through January 21, process transaction growth was 8% with a U.S. rate of 11% and flat international growth.
Turning to our financial results. Service revenues grew 7% in excess of nominal payment volume growth of 4%, helped by the pricing actions we took last year. Data processing revenues also grew 7%. Both were in line with our expectations. International revenue growth dropped to 6% from 16% in the prior quarter. Currency volatility moderated substantially in the quarter, reverting to the long-term mean. This drives most of the decline in the reported rate of growth. The impact of the pricing actions we took last year was largely offset by the significant negative impact from exchange rates.
While this sharp decline in the growth rate of international revenues was mostly expected, cross-border volumes were weaker as I mentioned earlier due to China and the Middle East. Exchange rates and revenues from currency volatility will continue to be a drag on reported international revenue growth through the year. Other revenues were down 3%, primarily as a result of lower license fees generated outside the U.S. due to slowing payment volume growth.
As it became clear that the global economy was going to experience a period of turbulence and uncertainty, we focused hard on prioritizing and phasing our spending plans for the year. As such, we were able to limit our expense growth to 2%. We held the line on personnel costs and professional fees, marketing programs have been reprioritized and phased in the context of the uncertain revenue outlook for the year. Network and processing expenses grew due to the NSB cash transition in Russia.
Reported G&A expenses were up, driven by a variety of factors, including exchange rate adjustments and cost of product enhancements. Our adjusted effective tax rate was 29.3%, modestly lower than our full year expectation of low 30s. This was largely due to the recognition of certain benefits earlier than we had anticipated. Our full year tax rate projection remains unchanged.
Looking ahead to the second quarter. Service and transaction processing revenue trends remain unchanged. International revenues remain weak. Currency volatilities are high going into the quarter, but could revert to the mean as they did last quarter and we will lap high volatilities from last year. The exchange rate drag remains approximately 3 percentage points. Net-net, mid-single-digit nominal revenue growth appears likely to be sustained.
Expense growth rate will step up to the mid-single-digit range with increases in personnel costs and the growth in network and processing expenses due to Russia. One big change between the 2 quarters, which is important to note, is interest expense. We will have a full quarter interest expense starting in the second quarter of $125 million, almost $0.04 per share. We want to make sure you all incorporate this into your models going forward.
As we look ahead to the second half of the year, our primary concern is the economic weakness in the international markets and the risk that it will impact the U.S. As you may recall from our commentary last quarter, our outlook assumed some second half acceleration in U.S. growth and higher cross-border growth due to easier comparisons. Current trends create some uncertainty around our revenue outlook for the year.
As the year progresses, we will continue to look at opportunities to moderate expense growth while ensuring critical initiatives are adequately funded. At this point, there is not much more we can tell you about the back half. In terms of Visa Europe, we do not have any financial updates at this time. As a reminder, our outlook for the full year excludes Visa Europe. Assuming things proceed as planned, we will provide more detail on our second half expectations, inclusive of Visa Europe, when we talk to you again at the end of April.
With that, I'll turn this back to Jack."

I think when we think about what we have at Visa in the quality of the network, the safety, the security, the global acceptance and now the capabilities that we built in the world of digital commerce and the value-added services, we feel terrific about our ability to continue to compete. And we're very, very clear that we know that we have to continue to add value to transactions that run over our network in order to sustain the kind of margins that make this such an attractive business.

I think -- so first of all, it's -- I just want to be really just clear for a second, is we are not building a business which is consumer direct and we're not building a business which is merchant direct. There are occasional times when we will do something directly with the consumer or directly with the merchant. But it's in a way that supports the 4-party model in a way that we believe is ultimately good for issuers and acquirers. We're just acting as the facilitator. So we still very, very much believe that the model that we have is an amazing model and we continue to -- most of what we do to work through those people. But the fact is, we are a consumer brand, and we have a role that we've got to play there. When it comes to the comments on expenses, I think -- I guess what you should take away is that nothing that we have done when it comes to rephasing, delaying or reducing any of the expense dollars that we contemplated, in our minds, relate to anything which is going to help build the business for the future. I mean if you asked us, are we as efficient as we should be? Are we spending every last dollar wisely across the place? The answer is no, and the answer is still no today. And so what this environment does is it gives us the ability to take a harder look at where we're not as efficient as we should be and attack those dollars. So we've not cut back on anything that relates to building our digital business, the APIs and SDKs that are part of the developer center, the things that we're doing on behalf of merchants, the things that we're doing on behalf of issuers to build our consulting services. We're still very, very committed to building that. And as we think about what this environment does is, it's just creating extra focus for us. We certainly don't think that the slowdown that we're seeing that's affecting the business is something that changes the business model for the long term. So we're not going to change the things that we think really build the business for the long term as we sit here."

And so I think it's fair to say when we first started these discussions, it could be 6 to 9 months in terms of a calling process, if not longer. I'll tell you, I saw a note today on the way down here that we got an incoming call from a sizable merchant, which was very surprising to me, saying that they would like to implement Visa Checkout. So it really is -- I mean, the game is changing. But we also -- in our minds we know -- I mean, this is merchant by merchant. It's a long-term build and we just have to continue to show the kinds of progress that we're seeing with these, both the numbers of merchants and the size of merchants. The implementation piece, I forgot what it was. But it's dramatically quicker and easier for merchant to implement. If they can fit us into their queue, it's literally weeks at this point as opposed to when we had the first incarnation, it was multiple months.

And then in nominal terms, it comes down to 0, so you can see what a huge impact exchange rates have had. And U.S. payment volumes both credit and debit, if you adjust for conversion and GAAP, have been remarkably stable. So that's what makes us optimistic about the long term. In the short run, as Charlie said, I mean, there's 2 issues. It's the strong dollar is hurting commerce into the U.S., which is a very sizable business for us and has been a big drag now for multiple years. The dollar also affects translation. You saw that from 14% constant dollar growth to 0. It's huge. And then cross-border trends clearly are being hurt by both the strong dollar as well as what's happening in commodity markets, China, et cetera. So we see all these as not really reflecting the long-term trends in our business. And so we really don't want to change anything in terms of our long-term profile of investment.

I think it's -- and I think there are couple of different things going on. I think first of all, part of what you're seeing in the evolving relationships that banks have with the networks, not just in the U.S. but around the world is as the years passed since we've transitioned from association to public company, networks are kind of sorting out their point of -- I'm sorry, banks are sorting out their point of views on networks and what they want those relationships to look like. And so what you start to see now is, at the same time, payments evolving very, very rapidly, driven mostly by digital. But by -- but I think also as importantly, the payments businesses, broadly, including the debit card business and the credit card businesses, are now very much a part of what a bank does and the way they think about their entire relationships as opposed to 5, 6, 7, 8 years ago, we were transitioning from the majority of the business being done on the credit side by stand-alone companies to all of a sudden being integrated into a bank but still being run separately. So as they combine these businesses and really run them as an integrated business, they are now thinking about how -- what -- how they need to have a partnership with a payment network, which is much more strategic as opposed to just a third-party provider services. So what you're seeing is, you're seeing longer-term contracts whether it's people who used to do 1 and 2-year contracts, and now you've seen us do 3, 5, 7 and 10 in some cases. And that's because it is a different kind of relationship. I think the other thing that's going on in the marketplace is you start to see, especially here in the United States, banks have become very, very good at understanding the different segments, the different opportunities that they have to use payment products to serve their clients. And they're able to compete with the likes of other names out there that they didn't necessarily focus on before, and are having great success in that. And when you have success, it gives you confidence to go get more aggressive in some of these co-brands and some of these other things that you see. So what we want to do is to be the payment partner of choice, to be the one that helps them think strategically as well as to be the best actual provider of network services. And you're start -- and you're seeing people make choices relative to who their network partner is, and what that means for the aggressiveness in the marketplace is it's a more competitive marketplace. But again to me, that's something we've seen it increasing over a period of time, and it's because there are people -- there are more people that have better abilities in the payment space today than there were 3 years ago, 5 years ago or 10 years ago."

If you look at multiple quarters all the way through last year and into this year, and you adjust for, as we said conversions and gas prices, it's been very stable. Certainly question marks about whether there's benefits from gas prices floating in, too. We've seen a little bit of that on the debit side. We said that earlier. Yes, there is a small benefit as you look at January from the impact of gas prices declining. But gas prices are still below where they were last year. So we had a 2 percentage point impact on debit, 1 on credit. That will moderate, but it won't go away completely. So most of it, we would ascribe to that. Wouldn't read too much into 3 weeks of January. We did had some awful weather in the last few weeks -- last few days, and that definitely will affect some of the commerce. But overall, I don't think there's a whole lot more we have to add than what Charlie gave you in terms of holiday spend, a shift to e-commerce channels. I don't know if there's anything else you can add."

Since your guidance was provided last quarter, I mean we've had further deterioration on some macro areas, like you mentioned gas prices and definitely some of the emerging oil based economies. But again, you maintained your guidance for now and did pretty well in the quarter. So I guess as of now, I mean do you include similar trends on the slower areas like Brazil, Russia, Middle East as persisting at these similar rates throughout the year? Then what, if anything, would you say has been a surprise to the upside since last quarter on revenue that might offset the slower macro? Maybe it was cross-border versus the 3% rate. But if you could just give us more color on that."

So asking people to give precision in terms of what's going to happen effectively to the dollar, consumer confidence and things like that, we really don't know. So what we try and do is be as transparent as we can about what we do know. And we recognize that it's hard sometimes to figure out what a trend is, and it's hard to know what the triggers will be to either see an uptick or a downtick. So we've tried to be very clear in our remarks that we're not changing guidance. But if we don't see improvement, then the guidance will come under pressure."

It was travel out of China and it was travel out of oil-linked economies. What could cause -- what is the most significant variable that could cause chain trends to change in a positive way? Do we know it's going to happen? We don't, but it's the dollar. The dollar begins to show some signs of weakness, clearly it has a big impact on our business, not immediately, but over time on 2 fronts: one, the translation impact, which you can all estimate; but then there is the other impact, which will play out over time, which is commerce into the U.S. which is a big part of our business. And then in the second half, certainly Europe will be part of Visa. And the travel into Europe has been better than travel into other geographies. So hopefully, that will help us. Now some of that we knew going into the year, and in giving you some of our perspectives, we incorporated some of that."

There's a series of things that I'm going to cover before I do hand it over to Vasant. I'm going to talk a little bit about our second quarter results at a high level. I'm going to make some comments about the press release we put out about Visa Europe, some general business updates and then some further comments on how we see the year playing out from here. 
So first, let me start with our overall results. We reported earnings per share of $0.71, but this includes a onetime gain on currency forward contracts used to mitigate some of the foreign exchange risks associated with the cash portion of the VE purchase. Vasant will cover that in a little bit more detail in his remarks. If you exclude that gain, adjusted earnings per share of $0.68 grew 7% on a nominal basis and 12% on a constant dollar basis. If you remember, we raised $16 billion in long-term debt in December of last year in anticipation of the VE acquisition and we absorbed $125 million in interest expense during this quarter, a $0.03 drag on our EPS growth for the quarter. 
This negative impact -- this negatively impacted our EPS growth rate in the quarter by 5 points. After we close the VE transaction, we will obviously, have VE operating income to offset this expense. As we talk about the quarter, you're going to hear some themes, which will sound very much the same as those we discussed on our last earnings call, reasonable underlying domestic growth offset by some headwinds. 
Our results adjusting for the leap year were very consistent with the prior quarter and our growth continues to be subdued by the strength of the dollar on both translation and cross-border business volumes, continued low oil prices and weakness in China, oil-based economies and Brazil. But importantly, the U.S. consumer remains strong. 
Operating revenue grew 6% nominally or 9% on a constant currency basis, reflecting a negative 3 percentage point impact from FX. Adjusting for the leap year, growth was basically the same as the prior quarter. Overall, payments volume, cross-border volume growth and processed transaction growth were consistent with last quarter, excluding the 1 percentage point growth benefit from the leap year. Cross-border continuous at extremely low levels. 
Reported U.S. payments volume growth was 11%. International payments volume growth was 14%. Cross-border volume growth was 5%. Processed transactions grew 9%. And more recently in April, through the 14th, so recognize, this is a short period of time, we're seeing similar trends with U.S. payments volume growth at 10%; cross-border volume growth of 5%; and processed transactions growth of 8%. The bottom line is we continue to see reasonable growth rates that are well below what we can produce in more favorable macroeconomic environment.
We issued a press release today regarding the Visa Europe transaction. As we discussed the transaction with the European Commission, we received feedback from them regarding the earnout. Based on that feedback, we and Visa Europe have reached preliminary agreement to eliminate the entire earn out. Instead of an earn out, we will pay an additional EUR 750 million at closing and EUR 1 billion plus 4% interest payable on the third anniversary of the closing for a total consideration of EUR 1,750,000,000 plus interest. 
Transactions remains subject to negotiation of definitive document and approval of the European Commission. It's possible that we could close the transaction towards the end of the quarter, but it could slip past the end of our third fiscal quarter. We think this is a good outcome for both parties. We've had many months now to work with the VE team up close and feel terrific about our future together and we obviously, know more now than we knew when we first agreed to the deal. Transition planning is well underway and we have great confidence in our ability to execute this well. 
Given the delay in closing, we won't be providing more detailed information on this call, the basic thesis still stands, low single-digit accretion in the first full year growing to high single digits by 2020. These numbers exclude transaction -- transition costs. Next quarter, we will provide more detail on what to expect after we close. 
A couple words on China. There's no real update regarding the timing regarding our ability to apply for a domestic license, but we have been making preparations to both make our application as well as be in a position to compete domestically. China continues to be a very important market for us. We're committed to having a broader business in China that will build over long-term and we continue to invest locally in the country. 
We announced several important partnerships this past quarter, which are great representations of our commitment to create local Chinese partnerships. First, we signed an MOU with China UnionPay where we both agreed to collaborate on payment security, innovation and financial inclusion. We're excited to work in partnership with CUP to lead the industry forward. The agreement provides an important platform for the 2 of us to work together to strengthen and create new value for the bank card ecosystem, benefiting consumers, merchants, financial institutions and technology partners. 
We've also been active committing Visa resources to support the Chinese government's efforts to reduce poverty and promote inclusive finance. We've announced a partnership with the China foundation for development of financial education and the China foundation for poverty alleviation helps support progress against these goals. And at the end of March, we signed a cooperation plan with the China national tourism administration, establishing Visa as a strategic partner of the U.S. China tourism year. This collaboration between CNTA, the U.S. Department of Commerce and Visa will result in a year-long series of events designed to enhance tourism, trade cooperation and cultural understanding between China and the United States. 
On to some updates on client activity. In the United States, Navy Federal Credit Union, the world's largest credit union and one of our most important clients in the U.S., renewed a multi-year credit and debit agreement with Visa. We're very proud with our association with this great institution. Beginning June 20, Visa cards will be exclusively accepted at Costco U.S. and Puerto Rico warehouse locations and fuel stations. And we continue to expand our relationships with clients across the globe. Banco do Brasil, the oldest and largest brand in South America renewed a multiyear credit agreement. And in India, SBI card, the state bank of India's credit card venture renewed a multi-year credit card agreement as well. 
We continue to be encouraged by the growth we see with Visa Checkout. We have nearly 12 million registered users in 16 countries and over 675 financial institution partners participating globally. Later this year, the Visa Checkout will be available to merchants and consumers in 6 additional markets, including France, India, Ireland, Poland, Spain and the United Kingdom. More than 250,000 merchants, including some of the largest global retailers have signed on to accept Visa Checkout representing 113 billion in addressable volume. Visa Checkout customers are also more active online shoppers in general completing 30% more transaction per person than the overall population of online shoppers. 
In February, we launch Visa developer platform. An open platform that provides access to hundreds of Visa's APIs and software development kits to some of Visa's most popular payments products and capabilities. It's still very early days, but we've had strong interest early on in the Visa development platform with thousands of new users building and testing new applications in our sandbox. 
We have a small number of clients in the near production launch in the platform and we expect to see more soon. Let me just give you a simple example of how the platform changes the way we work with our clients. Earlier this year, one of our largest clients outside the U.S. sent a small team to our office in San Francisco with an idea. They wanted to give their cardholders complete control over when and where their cards work via their mobile app. The ability to turn their Visa card on or off for certain types of merchants or transactions. Working with our team and our new APIs, they designed, built and launched a working prototype in 3 days and we're ready to be in market in a few weeks. Before Visa developer platform, this would've taken months.
Move on to talk about EMV for a second. 6 months out from the official kickoff to chip in the U.S., we continue on the journey of moving from stripe to chip. More than 265 million Visa chip cards were issued as of March 2016, making the U.S. the largest chip card market in the world and larger than the U.K. and Brazil combined. 47% of credit cards and 30% of debit cards have a chip on them today. More than 1 million merchants now have chip-enabled terminals, roughly 20% of all merchants. Based on client surveys, we expect 50% of merchant will be enabled with EMV by the end of calendar year 2016. 
Our of the main pain points in moving to chip is the additional time it takes to complete a transaction due to the time the card spends in the terminal. Earlier this week, Visa announced the launch of quick chip for EMV. The upgrade streamlines the processing of a chip card transaction to enable customers to dip and remove their EMV chip card from the terminal without waiting for the transactions to be finalized, allowing the consumer to put away their card in typically 2 seconds or less. 
The enhancement requires only a simple software update in the merchants card terminal or point-of-sale system. Quick chip is available free of charge to payment processors, acquiring banks and other networks to offer to merchants. Several merchant processors and vendors plan to offer quick chip in the merchant clients in the coming months, including Thesis, Jenna Cho, VeriFone, Equinox and V2. 
Before I turn the call back to Vasant, I'd like to say a few words about the back half of the year and our guidance. Vasant will walk through the specifics of the changes in our guidance, but a few quick comments. We've not seen improvement in the global economic environment, relative strength of currency compares is still unfavorable to us and the price of oil has remained at low levels. 
As we discussed last quarter on our earnings call, our guidance assumed that these things would improve. Since we're now in the third quarter, we're far less comfortable that volumes will meaningfully change, so we're officially reducing some pieces of our guidance especially the third quarter. We could be wrong, we don't know what the global economy will look like beyond tomorrow. It could improve and when things improve, we will be the beneficiaries. But as of today with a few exceptions, our business volume growth is not accelerating or decelerating, but we're obviously, still seeing meaningful growth. 
We do know that there will be a turn at some point for the better. We just don't know when. So our mindset continues to be cautious in the short-term due to the headwinds discussed earlier, but the long-term fundamentals of our business model remains strong and our focus is on accelerating global electronic payments. Globally, an estimated 43% of all consumer payments today are still made with cash, which leaves us an enormous opportunity in addition to the growth that we see due to regular economic growth for PCE. 
Last week, Visa published a white paper located on our website, discussing the opportunities to accelerate the growth of global acceptance and I encourage you to take a look at that paper. That's why we feel good about the work we've done, there's still a great opportunity in front of us. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Vasant"
38043467,330162332,961381,"Visa Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2016",2016-04-21,"Earnings Calls","Visa Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Charlie. Much like our first fiscal quarter, the global macroeconomic environment remained uncertain, but our business performed well. A few points to highlight. First, net revenues grew 9% in constant dollars with an expected 3-point drag from",1910,"Thank you, Charlie. Much like our first fiscal quarter, the global macroeconomic environment remained uncertain, but our business performed well. A few points to highlight. First, net revenues grew 9% in constant dollars with an expected 3-point drag from the strong dollar. Nominal revenue grew 6%. The 1 point step up in the growth rates relative to the first quarter was mostly due to the leap year effect. 
Cross model business was once again very weak, but in line with the first quarter's growth rate. The deceleration of outbound commerce from China continues. Cross-border commerce out of commodity-based economies remained anemic. This is added to the negative effects of the strong dollar especially on our large inbound U.S. business. 
However, currency volatility were higher than the first quarter, offsetting some cross-border weakness. Through the first 6 months, we managed our expense growth to 4% in nominal terms, well below the high single-digit rate we had planned in the first half. We have continued to hold the line on expenses while funding all our key growth initiatives such as Visa Checkout, Visa token service, Visa development platform and others. 
During the quarter, we entered into currency forward contracts to mitigate the exchange rate risk associated with the upfront cash payments of Visa Europe. As these contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting, they are marked to market with gains and losses recorded in nonoperating income. We recorded $116 million gain, which we had excluded from our reported EPS as a non-GAAP adjustment. These contracts are expiring in late April. 
When it became apparent that the Visa Europe transaction would not close before then, we entered into fully offsetting contracts at the end of March, locking in this gain. Coincidentally, this gain is almost equal to our interest expense in the quarter. Lastly, we repurchased 24.2 million shares during the quarter, at an average price of $72.23 per share for a total of $1.8 billion. 
Year-to-date, we have bought back 49.9 million shares at an average price of $75.47 or $3.8 billion. At the end of the quarter, we had remaining stock buyback authorization of $4 billion. Now a quick review of the quarter's business drivers. Note that all growth rates are about a point higher due to the leap year effect. 
Global payments while in constant dollars grew 12%. Despite considerable uncertainty and turbulence in the global economy, payments volume growth globally has been remarkably stable. U.S. payments volume grew 11% with both credit and debit growing at the same rate. Accounting for conversions and the leap date, U.S. payments volume growth was slightly lower than the first quarter. International payments volume grew 14% in constant dollars, consistent with the last quarter. Once again, the impact of the strong dollar reduced nominal growth in international payments volumes to [indiscernible] 3.4% [ph].  
Cross-border volumes grew 5% in constant dollars and were flat in nominal dollars. Manufacturing the leap year, the trend was unchanged from the first quarter. Cross-border growth rates in constant dollars have decelerated from 9% in fiscal year 2014 to 17% last year, down to 4% so far this year. As we mentioned on our call last quarter, the first leg down was driven by the strong dollar and then starting in September last year, growth decelerated sharply due to China and the commodity price collapsed. Cross-border commerce outbound from China has dropped from growth rates about 40% a year ago to single-digit levels in the second quarter. 
Commodity-based economies across Latin America, the Middle East and Africa, have also experienced sharp declines. This has hit our large U.S. cross-border acquiring business hard. Commerce into Europe has been strong though we do not benefit fully from it yet. More recently, we have seen commerce outbound from Europe into the U.S. pickup. 
Process transactions totaled $18.5 billion in the quarter, up 9%. Both U.S. and international growth at 12% and 1%, respectively was stable. Process transaction growth rates will step up in the back half of the year as they begin to lap last year's transfer of domestic processing in Russia to NSPK. Service revenues grew 8% in excess of normal payments growth of 5%. The pricing we took last year contributed 3 points to the growth rate. Next quarter, we will lap the price increases and this 3-point tailwind will no longer help us. 
Data processing revenue grew 10% in line with process transactions. International revenues grew 8%. Constant dollar cross-border volume growth of 5% was almost entirely offset by the currency translation drag. The year-over-year increase was largely driven by the pricing actions from last year. Currency volatility was high in the last year but only contributed modestly to growth as we are now beginning to lap high volatilities from last year. 
Next quarter, our reported international revenue growth rate will no longer benefit from the price increases and as I mentioned, currency volatilities were unusually high in the second half of 2015. As such going forward, reported international revenue growth will depend on the interplay between volume growth and the currency translation drag. Other revenues were down 3%, primarily as a result of lower license fees generated outside the U.S. due to slowing payments volume. 
Incentives were generally in line with our expectations, at the midpoint of our guidance range. Higher U.S. incentives due to acceleration of deals into the quarter were offset by lower incentives outside the U.S. due to lower volumes. With the expense growth in the mid-single digits, a tax rate of 31%, EPS of $0.68 after adjusting for the gain from our currency forward contracts, grew by 12% in constant dollars and by a healthy 17% when you account for the interest on the debt we issued to finance the Visa Europe transaction. 
With that, let me turn to our outlook for the fiscal third quarter and the balance of the year, which excludes the impact from Visa Europe. We now expect net revenue growth in fiscal 2016 to come in at 7% to 8% in constant dollars, a couple of points below our expectations from last October. This was driven by 3 factors. First, no improvement in cross-border volume growth from current levels. Second, somewhat weaker domestic payment volumes due to gas prices as well as weakness in large commodity-based like Brazil. Third, client incentives likely to come in at the high-end of our 17.5% to 18.5% range. 
In October last year, as we told you on our call, we had hoped that cross-border trends would improve as we lap the weakening of the dollar in the second half of fiscal 2015. However, cross-border growth dropped from the 8% range to the 4% range in the past 6 to 9 months as outbound commerce from China and commodity economies slowed sharply. This trend continues. As such, we're resuming little improvement in the cross-border growth rate in the second half. Recent weakness in the dollar should help over time, but it's too early to tell. 
We have now lapped the sharp gas declines from last year. Last October, we had hoped that this would provide a tailwind for U.S. domestic volume in the second half of fiscal 2016. This has not happen as gas prices remained below the lows of last year. Given the recent failure of OPEC to agree on production caps, low gas prices could persist. As such, we're assuming that U.S. payment volume growth will not improve from current trends in the second half. 
In addition, payments volumes remain soft in large commodity economies like Brazil and the Middle East. Client incentives are projected to come in at the high-end of our guidance range. In the first half, client incentives were around 18% of gross revenues. In the second half, they are likely to run at around 19%. Significant renewals and conversions are driving this trend, particularly in the U.S. Costco and USAA add more than 50 basis points to incentives as a percent of gross revenue in the second half. 
A few other factors to highlight. These are not new but will impact reported revenue growth numbers in the second half. As I mentioned earlier, we will no longer benefit from the uplift in our growth rate we got from the price increases last year. We will lap the currency volatility peaks of the second half of 2015. There have been some delays in the rollout of USAA and Costco conversions. 
Given the quarter lag in recording service revenues, these Costco and USAA conversions are a drag on net revenues in the second half of 2016. In other words, incentives expense exceed revenue recognized. This will of course, not be the case in fiscal 2017. On the positive front, if the recent weakness in the dollar continues, the currency translation drag of 3 points could moderate. Given softer-than-expected revenues, we will continue to hold the line of expenses on expenses funding key strategic that while maintaining and reducing cost in other areas. 
As we had indicated previously, expense growth will be lower in the second half relative to the first half rate. We expect a modestly lower tax rate of about 30% versus the low 30s, which will also help mitigate impact on net income. As we look at the fiscal third quarter, net revenue growth in nominal terms could come in as low as 2% to 3%. In addition to the factors I just mentioned, we will lap an unusually low quarter for incentives in Q3 last year. Incentives were 16% of gross revenues due to deal delays versus an anticipated 19% this year. 
As we have told you before, incentive shifts from quarter-to-quarter and impact year-over-year comparisons. Nominal net revenue growth should revert back to the first half growth rate in Q4. With the lower revenue growth range and including interest expense from the dollar, $16 billion in debt we issued last September, we now expect constant currency EPS growth in the low double-digit. 
Interest expense will cost us over $0.09 this year or almost 4 points of EPS growth. If you account for the interest expense, it puts constant currency EPS growth at the low end of the mid-teens range. The currency translation drag is approximately 4 points. In terms of the impact of Visa Europe, for modeling purposes, we think it is best to assume the transaction does not close in our fiscal third quarter. As such, we will have interest expense in the third quarter but no operating income from Visa Europe to offset it. 
Should we close on the acquisition sooner, we will of course break out the impact. If Visa Europe is in our numbers for the full fourth quarter, in rough terms, it will offset interest costs in the quarter. There will of course, be a variety of nonrecurring transaction-related costs, which we will also break out. We hope to give you a more precise perspective when we talk again in July. 
As we look ahead to 2017, we remain optimistic that revenue growth rates will step up from current levels. We will begin to see the impact of Costco and USAA conversions kick in and hopefully, we will see some recovery in the cross-border business and gas prices helped by a weakening dollar. Nominal dollar growth could also tick up as the dollar drags a bit. Visa Europe will provide additional balance, driving EPS growth back to levels you expect us to deliver. 
With that, I'll turn this back to Jack."

And that dropped the run rate down to the single digits and it's rounded about 8%, 9% in constant dollar terms for a while. And then in October or so last year, we saw that sharp decline to 4% and it stayed there. The biggest driver are significant declines coming out of China and that has not changed. In other words, the second derivative on that is still negative. It is continuing to decelerate, but still positive. Canada, a major source of business for us in the U.S. has been declining from several years now, come from a growth rate to meaningful negative levels. Then we saw significant change in trend in the past few months coming out of the commodity economies whether those are the African economies or the Middle East. Big declines in those areas and then layer on top of that are specific large economies like Brazil, which for a while was a major source of outbound business to the U.S. and elsewhere. And other economies like Russia, which you saw really slow -- go down significantly last year. So you've got sort of 3 things going on at the same time, which may not happen often. One is a strong dollar, which helps the largest part of our cross-border business, which is the acquired business into the U.S. Second is a significant growth engine called China's slowing down. And third is, large chunks of the global economy having trouble like Brazil, like Russia for a variety of different reasons. So you've got all 3 things happening at the same time right now."

But the conversation really is, it's not even necessarily -- it's not the typical conversation that either we or an acquire have with the merchant with -- we we're talking about acceptance, we were talking about an Assistant Treasurer.

I think, I just want to make sure that we were just making sure that people understood that this year, we had 2 big things going on that hopefully we won't have to deal with next year. One, is that we have this interest expense, which clearly did not have offsetting operating income in the time frame that we expected. And that was a meaningful drag on our earnings this year, and clearly once the Visa Europe deals closes, we will have the offset, that was the intent of the debt issuance. So that was clearly almost a 4-point drag on growth. And we just want to make sure people are aware of that. Second, we have seen the headwinds that we talked about coming into the year. We are hopeful that they will moderate as they go into next year. And then third, the conversions that we believe will add some additional ballots so to speak to revenues, really aren't helping in the drag this year because of this lag issue. So all I was doing was pointing to those things. We'll talk about next year at the appropriate time and give you our best sense of next year.

There is series of things that I'm going to cover before I do hand it over to Vasant. I'm going to talk a little bit about our second quarter results at a high level. We'll make some comments about the press release we put out about Visa Europe, some general business updates and then some further comments on how we see the year playing out from here.
So first, let me start with our overall results. We reported earnings per share of $0.71, but this includes a onetime gain on currency forward contracts used to mitigate some of the foreign exchange risk associated with the cash portion of the VE purchase. Vasant will cover that in a little bit more detail in his remarks. If you exclude that gain, adjusted earnings per share of $0.68 grew 7% on a nominal basis and 12% on a constant dollar basis. If you remember, we raised $16 billion in long-term debt in December of last year in anticipation of the VE acquisition, and we absorbed $125 million in interest expense during this quarter, a $0.03 drag on our EPS growth for the quarter.
This negative impact -- this negatively impacted our EPS growth rate in the quarter by 5 points. After we close the VE transaction, we will, obviously, have VE operating income to offset this expense. As we talk about the quarter, you're going to hear some themes, which will sound very much the same as those we discussed on our last earnings call, reasonable underlying domestic growth offset by some headwinds.
Our results adjusting for the leap year were very consistent with the prior quarter and our growth continues to be subdued by the strength of the dollar on both translation and cross-border business volumes, continued low oil prices and weakness in China, oil-based economies and Brazil. But importantly, the U.S. consumer remains strong. 
Operating revenue grew 6% nominally or 9% on a constant currency basis, reflecting a negative 3 percentage point impact from FX. Adjusting for the leap year, growth was basically the same as the prior quarter. Overall, payments volume, cross-border volume growth and process transaction growth were consistent with last quarter, excluding the 1 percentage point growth benefit from the leap year. Cross-border continuous at extremely low levels.
Reported U.S. payments volume growth was 11%; international payments volume growth was 14%; cross-border volume growth was 5%; processed transactions grew 9%.
And more recently in April, through the 14th, so recognize, this is a short period of time, we're seeing similar trends with U.S. payments volume growth at 10%; cross-border volume growth of 5%; and processed transactions growth of 8%. The bottom line is we continue to see reasonable growth rates, but well below what we can produce in more favorable macroeconomic environment.
We issued a press release today regarding the Visa Europe transaction. As we discussed the transaction with the European Commission, we received feedback from them regarding the earn-out. Based on that feedback, we and Visa Europe have reached preliminary agreement to eliminate the entire earn-out. Instead of an earn-out, we will pay an additional EUR 750 million at closing and EUR 1 billion plus 4% interest payable on the third anniversary of the closing for a total consideration of EUR 1,750,000,000 plus interest.
Transaction remains subject to negotiation of definitive document and approval of the European Commission. It's possible that we could close the transaction towards the end of the quarter, but it could slip past the end of our third fiscal quarter. We think this is a good outcome for both parties. We've had many months now to work with the VE team up close and feel terrific about our future together. And we obviously, know more now than we knew when we first agreed to the deal. Transition planning is well underway, and we have great confidence in our ability to execute this well.
Given the delay in closing, we won't be providing more detailed information on this call, the basic thesis still stands, low single-digit accretion in the first full year growing to high single digits by 2020. These numbers exclude transaction -- transition costs. Next quarter, we will provide more detail on what to expect after we close.
A couple of words on China. There's no real update regarding the timing, regarding of our ability to apply for a domestic license, but we have been making preparations to both make our application as well as be in a position to compete domestically. China continues to be a very important market for us. We're committed to having a broader business in China that we'll build over a long-term, and we continue to invest locally in the country.
We announced several important partnerships this past quarter, which are great representations of our commitment to create local Chinese partnerships. First, we signed an MOU with China UnionPay where we both agreed to collaborate on payment security, innovation and financial inclusion. We're excited to work in partnership with CUP to lead the industry forward. The agreement provides an important platform for the 2 of us to work together to strengthen and create new value for the bank card ecosystem, benefiting consumers, merchants, financial institutions and technology partners.
We've also been active committing Visa resources to support the Chinese government's efforts to reduce poverty and promote inclusive finance. We announced a partnership with the China Foundation for Development of Financial Education and the China Foundation for Poverty Alleviation to help to support progress against these goals.
And at the end of March, we signed a cooperation plan with the China national tourism administration, establishing Visa as a strategic partner of the U.S. China tourism year. This collaboration between CNTA, the U.S. Department of Commerce and Visa will result in a year-long series of events designed to enhance tourism, trade cooperation and cultural understanding between China and the United States.
On to some updates on client activity. In the United States, Navy Federal Credit Union, the world's largest credit union and one of our most important clients in the U.S., renewed a multi-year credit and debit agreement with Visa. We're very proud of our association with this great institution. Beginning June 20, Visa cards will be exclusively accepted at Costco U.S. and Puerto Rico warehouse locations and fuel stations. And we continue to expand our relationships with clients across the globe. Banco do Brasil, the oldest and largest brand in South America renewed a multi-year credit agreement. And in India, SBI card, the State Bank of India's credit card venture renewed a multi-year credit card agreement as well.
We continue to be encouraged by the growth we see with Visa Checkout. We have nearly 12 million registered users in 16 countries and over 675 financial institution partners participating globally. Later this year, Visa Checkout will be available to merchants and consumers in 6 additional markets, including France, India, Ireland, Poland, Spain and the United Kingdom. More than 250,000 merchants, including some of the largest global retailers have signed on to accept Visa Checkout representing 113 billion in addressable volume. Visa Checkout customers are also more active online shoppers in general, completing 30% more transaction per person than the overall population of online shoppers.
In February, we launch Visa developer platform. An open platform that provides access to hundreds of Visa APIs and software development kits to some of Visa's most popular payments products and capabilities. It's still very early days, but we've had strong interest early on in the Visa development platform with thousands of new users building and testing new applications in our sandbox.
We have a small number of clients in the near production launch on the platform, and we expect to see more soon. Let me just give you a simple example of how the platform changes the way we work with our clients. Earlier this year, one of our largest clients outside the U.S. sent a small team to our office in San Francisco with an idea. They wanted to give their cardholders complete control over when and where their cards worked via their mobile app. The ability to turn their Visa card on or off for certain types of merchants or transactions. Working with our team and our new APIs, they designed, built and launched a working prototype in 3 days. And we're ready to be in market in a few weeks. Before Visa developer platform, this would have taken months.
Move on to talk about EMV for a second. Six months out from the official kickoff to chip in the U.S., we continue on the journey of moving from magnetic stripe to chip. More than 265 million Visa chip cards were issued as of March 2016, making the U.S. the largest chip card market in the world and larger than the U.K. and Brazil combined. 47% of credit cards and 30% of debit cards have a chip on them today. More than 1 million merchants now have chip-enabled terminals, roughly 20% of all merchants. Based on client surveys, we expect 50% of merchant locations will be enabled with EMV by the end of calendar year 2016.
One of the main pain points in moving to chip is the additional time it takes to complete a transaction due to the time the card spends in the terminal. Earlier this week, Visa announced the launch of quick chip for EMV. The upgrade streamlines the processing of a chip card transaction to enable customers to dip and remove their EMV chip card from the terminal without waiting for the transactions to be finalized, allowing the consumer to put away their card in typically 2 seconds or less.
The enhancement requires only a simple software update to the merchants' card terminal or point-of-sale system. Quick chip is available free-of-charge to payment processors, acquiring banks and other networks to offer to merchants. Several merchant processors and vendors plan to offer quick chip to their merchant clients in the coming months, including TSYS, Ingenico, VeriFone, Equinox and B2.
Before I turn the call back to Vasant, I want to say a few words about the back half of the year and our guidance. Vasant will walk through the specifics of the changes in our guidance, but a few quick comments. We've not seen improvement in the global economic environment, relative strength of currency compares is still unfavorable for us, and the price of oil has remained at low levels.
As we discussed last quarter on our earnings call, our guidance assumed that these things would improve. Since we're now in the third quarter, we're far less comfortable that volumes will meaningfully change, so we're officially reducing some pieces of our guidance, especially the third quarter. We could be wrong, we don't know what the global economy will look like beyond tomorrow. It could improve. And when things improve, we will be the beneficiaries. But as of today, with a few exceptions, our business volume growth is not accelerating or decelerating, but we're obviously, still seeing meaningful growth.
We do know that there will be a turn at some point for the better. We just don't know when. So our mindset continues to be cautious in the short-term due to the headwinds discussed earlier, but the long-term fundamentals of our business model remains strong and our focus is on accelerating global electronic payments. Globally, an estimated 43% of all consumer payments today are still made with cash, which leaves us an enormous opportunity in addition to the growth that we see due to regular economic growth for PCE.
Last week, Visa published a white paper located on our website, discussing the opportunities to accelerate the growth of global acceptance, and I encourage you to take a look at that paper. So why we feel good about the work we've done, there's still a great opportunity in front of us.
With that, I'll turn it over to Vasant"

The 1-point step up in the growth rates relative to the first quarter was mostly due to the leap year effect.
Cross-border business was once again very weak, but in line with the first quarter's growth rate. The deceleration of outbound commerce from China continues. Cross-border commerce out of commodity-based economies remained anemic. This is added to the negative effects of the strong dollar, especially on our large inbound U.S. business.
However, currency volatility were higher than the first quarter, offsetting some cross-border weakness. Through the first 6 months, we managed our expense growth to 4% in nominal terms, well below the high single-digit rate we had planned in the first half. We have continued to hold the line on expenses while funding all our key growth initiatives such as Visa Checkout, Visa Token Service, Visa Development platform and others.
During the quarter, we entered into currency forward contracts to mitigate the exchange rate risk associated with the upfront cash payments of Visa Europe. As these contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting, they are mark-to-market with gains and losses recorded in nonoperating income. We recorded $116 million gain, which we have excluded from our reported EPS as a non-GAAP adjustment. These contracts are expiring in late April.
When it became apparent that the Visa Europe transaction would not close before then, we entered into fully offsetting contracts at the end of March, locking in this gain. Coincidentally, this gain is almost equal to our interest expense in the quarter. Lastly, we've repurchased 24.2 million shares during the quarter, at an average price of $72.23 per share for a total of $1.8 billion.
Year-to-date, we have bought back 49.9 million shares at an average price of $75.47 or $3.8 billion. At the end of the quarter, we had remaining stock buyback authorization of $4 billion. Now a quick review of the quarter's business drivers. Note that all growth rates are about a point higher due to the leap year effect. 
Global payments volume in constant dollars grew 12%. Despite considerable uncertainty and turbulence in the global economy, payments volume growth globally has been remarkably stable. U.S. payments volume grew 11%, with both credit and debit growing at the same rate. Accounting for conversions and the leap date, U.S. payments volume growth was slightly lower than the first quarter. International payments volume grew 14% in constant dollars, consistent with the last quarter. Once again, the impact of the strong dollar reduced nominal growth in international payments volumes to a paltry 4%.
Cross-border volumes grew 5% in constant dollars and were flat in nominal dollars. Manufacturing the leap year, the trend was unchanged from the first quarter. Cross-border growth rates in constant dollars have decelerated from 9% in fiscal year 2014 to 17% last year, down to 4% so far this year.
As we mentioned on our call, last quarter, the first leg down was driven by the strong dollar and then starting in September last year, growth decelerated sharply due to China and the commodity price collapsed. Cross-border commerce outbound from China has dropped from growth rates above 40% a year ago to single-digit levels in the second quarter.
Commodity-based economies across Latin America, the Middle East and Africa, have also experienced sharp declines. This has hit our large U.S. cross-border acquiring business hard. Commerce into Europe has been strong though we do not benefit fully from it yet. More recently, we have seen commerce outbound from Europe into the U.S. pickup.
Process transactions totaled $18.5 billion in the quarter, up 9%. Both U.S. and international growth at 12% and 1%, respectively was stable. Process transaction growth rates will step up in the back half of the year as they begin to lap last year's transfer of domestic processing in Russia to NSPK. Service revenues grew 8% in excess of normal payments volume growth of 5%. The pricing we took last year contributed 3 points to the growth rate. Next quarter, we will lap the price increases and this 3-point tailwind will no longer help us.
Data processing revenue grew 10% in line with process transactions. International revenues grew 8%. Constant dollar cross-border volume growth of 5% was almost entirely offset by the currency translation drag. The year-over-year increase was largely driven by the pricing actions from last year. Currency volatilities were high in the quarter, but only contributed modestly to growth as we are now beginning to lap high volatilities from last year.
Next quarter, our reported international revenue growth rates will no longer benefit from the price increases. And as I mentioned, currency volatilities were unusually high in the second half of 2015. As such going forward, reported international revenue growth will depend on the interplay between volume growth and the currency translation drag. Other revenues were down 3%, primarily as a result of lower license fees generated outside the U.S. due to slowing payments volume.
Incentives were generally in line with our expectations, at the midpoint of our guidance range. Higher U.S. incentives due to acceleration of deals into the quarter were offset by lower incentives outside the U.S. due to lower volumes. With the expense growth in the mid-single digits, a tax rate of 30.1%, EPS of $0.68 after adjusting for the gain from our currency forward contracts, grew by 12% in constant dollars. And by a healthy 17%, when you account for the interest on the debt we issued to finance the Visa Europe transaction.
With that, let me turn to our outlook for the fiscal third quarter and the balance of the year, which excludes the impact from Visa Europe. We now expect net revenue growth in fiscal 2016 to come in at 7% to 8% in constant dollars, a couple of points below our expectations from last October. This was driven by 3 factors: first, no improvement in cross-border volume growth from current levels; second, somewhat weaker domestic payment volumes due to gas prices as well as weakness in large commodity-based like Brazil; third, client incentives likely to come in at the high-end of our 17.5% to 18.5% range.
In October last year, as we told you on our call, we had hoped that cross-border trends would improve as we lap the weakening of the dollar in the second half of fiscal 2015. However, cross-border growth dropped from the 8% range to the 4% range in the past 6 to 9 months as outbound commerce from China and commodity economies slowed sharply. This trend continues. As such, we're assuming little improvement in the cross-border growth rate in the second half. Recent weakness in the dollar should help over time, but it is too early to tell.
We have now lapped the sharp gas declines from last year. Last October, we had hoped that this would provide a tailwind for U.S. domestic volume in the second half of fiscal 2016. This has not happened as gas prices remained below the lows of last year. Given the recent failure of OPEC to agree on production caps, low gas prices could persist. As such, we're assuming that U.S. payment volume growth will not improve from current trends in the second half.
In addition, payments volumes remain soft in large commodity economies like Brazil and the Middle East. Client incentives are projected to come in at the high-end of our guidance range. In the first half, client incentives were around 18% of gross revenues. In the second half, they are likely to run at around 19%. Significant renewals and conversions are driving this trend, particularly in the U.S. Costco and USAA add more than 50 basis points to incentives as a percent of gross revenue in the second half.
A few other factors to highlight. These are not new but will impact reported revenue growth numbers in the second half. As I mentioned earlier, we will no longer benefit from the uplift in our growth rate we got from the price increases last year. We will lap the currency volatility peaks of the second half of 2015. There have been some delays in the rollout of USAA and Costco conversions.
Given the quarter lag in recording service revenues, these Costco and USAA conversions are a drag on net revenues in the second half of 2016. In other words, incentives expensed exceed revenue recognized. This will of course, not be the case in fiscal 2017. On the positive front, if the recent weakness in the dollar continues, the currency translation drag of 3 points could moderate. Given softer-than-expected revenues, we will continue to hold the line of expenses -- on expenses funding key strategic and growth programs while maintaining or reducing costs in other areas.
As we had indicated previously, expense growth will be lower in the second half relative to the first half rate. We expect a modestly lower tax rate of about 30% versus the low 30s, which will also help mitigate impact on net income. As we look at the fiscal third quarter, net revenue growth in nominal terms could come in as low as 2% to 3%. In addition to the factors I just mentioned, we will lap an unusually low quarter for incentives in Q3 last year. Incentives were 16% of gross revenues due to deal delays versus an anticipated 19% this year.
As we have told you before, incentive shifts from quarter-to-quarter and impact year-over-year comparisons. Nominal net revenue growth should revert back to the first half growth rate in Q4. With the lower revenue growth range and including interest expense from the dollar, $16 billion in debt we issued last December, we now expect constant currency EPS growth in the low double-digit.
Interest expense will cost us over $0.09 this year or almost 4 points of EPS growth. If you account for the interest expense, it puts constant currency EPS growth at the low end of the mid-teens range. The currency translation drag is approximately 4 points. In terms of the impact of Visa Europe, for modeling purposes, we think it is best to assume the transaction does not close in our fiscal third quarter. As such, we will have interest expense in the third quarter but no operating income from Visa Europe to offset it.
Should we close on the acquisition sooner, we will of course break out the impact. If Visa Europe is in our numbers for the full fourth quarter, in rough terms, it will offset interest costs in the quarter. There will of course, be a variety of nonrecurring transaction-related costs, which we will also break out. We hope to give you a more precise perspective when we talk again in July. 
As we look ahead to 2017, we remain optimistic that revenue growth rates will step up from current levels. We will begin to see the impact of Costco and USAA conversions kick-in. And hopefully, we will see some recovery in the cross-border business and gas prices helped by a weakening dollar. Nominal dollar growth could also tick up as the dollar drags a bit. Visa Europe will provide additional balance, driving EPS growth back to levels you expect us to deliver. 
With that, I'll turn this back to Jack."

There is a lot of work that Citi, the issuer and Costco are working as well as us. And so given the complexity of unwinding an old agreement and moving forward on a new agreement is just complex. And in the USAA's business, it's -- there's nothing specific other than I think it's them just wanting to do it in a time frame, which brings about the least amount of potential issues for their members, which we respect."

And so we want to ensure is that we continue to have the best solutions to pay in the physical world, that we've got the best solutions to pay in the eCom world, and the best solutions to pay -- to play in the M commerce world.

And quite frankly, the consumers and the merchants are going to be the one to drive the adoption of these different forms of payment. And so we're there to support them. We're there to be their partner. We're there to provide options, so the work we did on tokenization enabled a lot of the things that you're seeing out there. But we don't prefer one versus the other.

And that dropped the run rate down to the single digits and it's rounded about 8%, 9% in constant dollar terms for a while. And then in October or so last year, we saw that sharp decline to 4% and it stayed there. The biggest drivers are significant declines coming out of China and that has not changed. In other words, the second derivative on that is still negative. It is continuing to decelerate, but still positive. Canada, a major source of business for us in the U.S. has been declining from several years now, gone from a growth rate to meaningful negative levels. Then we saw a significant change in trend in the past few months coming out of the commodity economies whether those are the African economies or the Middle East. Big declines in those areas and then layered on top of that are specific large economies like Brazil, which for a while was a major source of outbound business to the U.S. and elsewhere. And other economies like Russia, which you saw really slow -- go down significantly last year. So you've got sort of 3 things going on at the same time, which may not happen often. One is a strong dollar, which hurts the largest part of our cross-border business, which is the acquired business into the U.S. Second is a significant growth engine called China's slowing down. And third is, large chunks of the global economy having trouble like Brazil, like Russia for a variety of different reasons. So you've got all 3 things happening at the same time right now."

In fact, what we want to see is we want to ensure that there is continued growth on both sides of the equation. So not just the increase in the user base, but the increase in the merchant locations as well. And any time, if those growth rates get way out of line, then we live somewhat in fear of one side of the network getting ahead of the other. So we have Bank of America, who is very actively promoting Visa Checkout that has just begun. So it's hard to draw any conclusions to what it means, but we love what they're doing. It is very simple. It's very creative, and we're excited about it. Beyond that, we're very focused on growing the merchant side. And the reality of the merchant side, Lisa, is it really is -- it's merchant by merchant. So we can certainly -- we've done everything that we can to make it a simple integration for merchants.  But the conversation really is, it's not even necessarily -- it's not the typical conversation that either we or an acquire have with the merchant with -- we we're talking about acceptance, we were talking about an Assistant Treasurer. The conversations with Visa Checkout are much more about the marketing areas. And so that is where we are focused on is getting the conversation to a different level of merchants.

So that's another thing that I guess, most people might have expected coming in but you would get to see some kind of a tailwind, it isn't there. But if anybody's guess though, the gas prices go."

There is series of things that I'm going to cover before I do hand it over to Vasant. I'm going to talk a little bit about our second quarter results at a high level. We'll make some comments about the press release we put out about Visa Europe, some general business updates and then some further comments on how we see the year playing out from here.
So first, let me start with our overall results. We reported earnings per share of $0.71, but this includes a onetime gain on currency forward contracts used to mitigate some of the foreign exchange risk associated with the cash portion of the VE purchase. Vasant will cover that in a little bit more detail in his remarks. If you exclude that gain, adjusted earnings per share of $0.68 grew 7% on a nominal basis and 12% on a constant dollar basis. If you remember, we raised $16 billion in long-term debt in December of last year in anticipation of the VE acquisition, and we absorbed $125 million in interest expense during this quarter, a $0.03 drag on our EPS growth for the quarter.
This negative impact -- this negatively impacted our EPS growth rate in the quarter by 5 points. After we close the VE transaction, we will, obviously, have VE operating income to offset this expense. As we talk about the quarter, you're going to hear some themes, which will sound very much the same as those we discussed on our last earnings call, reasonable underlying domestic growth offset by some headwinds.
Our results adjusting for the leap year were very consistent with the prior quarter and our growth continues to be subdued by the strength of the dollar on both translation and cross-border business volumes, continued low oil prices and weakness in China, oil-based economies and Brazil. But importantly, the U.S. consumer remains strong. 
Operating revenue grew 6% nominally or 9% on a constant currency basis, reflecting a negative 3 percentage point impact from FX. Adjusting for the leap year, growth was basically the same as the prior quarter. Overall, payments volume, cross-border volume growth and process transaction growth were consistent with last quarter, excluding the 1 percentage point growth benefit from the leap year. Cross-border continuous at extremely low levels.
Reported U.S. payments volume growth was 11%; international payments volume growth was 14%; cross-border volume growth was 5%; processed transactions grew 9%.
And more recently in April, through the 14th, so recognize, this is a short period of time, we're seeing similar trends with U.S. payments volume growth at 10%; cross-border volume growth of 5%; and processed transactions growth of 8%. The bottom line is we continue to see reasonable growth rates, but well below what we can produce in more favorable macroeconomic environment.
We issued a press release today regarding the Visa Europe transaction. As we discussed the transaction with the European Commission, we received feedback from them regarding the earn-out. Based on that feedback, we and Visa Europe have reached preliminary agreement to eliminate the entire earn-out. Instead of an earn-out, we will pay an additional EUR 750 million at closing and EUR 1 billion plus 4% interest payable on the third anniversary of the closing for a total consideration of EUR 1,750,000,000 plus interest.
Transaction remains subject to negotiation of definitive document and approval of the European Commission. It's possible that we could close the transaction towards the end of the quarter, but it could slip past the end of our third fiscal quarter. We think this is a good outcome for both parties. We've had many months now to work with the VE team up close and feel terrific about our future together. And we obviously know more now than we knew when we first agreed to the deal. Transition planning is well underway, and we have great confidence in our ability to execute this well.
Given the delay in closing, we won't be providing more detailed information on this call, the basic thesis still stands, low single-digit accretion in the first full year growing to high single digits by 2020. These numbers exclude transaction -- transition costs. Next quarter, we will provide more detail on what to expect after we close.
A couple of words on China. There's no real update regarding the timing, regarding of our ability to apply for a domestic license, but we have been making preparations to both make our application as well as be in a position to compete domestically. China continues to be a very important market for us. We're committed to having a broader business in China that we'll build over a long-term, and we continue to invest locally in the country.
We announced several important partnerships this past quarter, which are great representations of our commitment to create local Chinese partnerships. First, we signed an MOU with China UnionPay where we both agreed to collaborate on payment security, innovation and financial inclusion. We're excited to work in partnership with CUP to lead the industry forward. The agreement provides an important platform for the 2 of us to work together to strengthen and create new value for the bank card ecosystem, benefiting consumers, merchants, financial institutions and technology partners.
We've also been active committing Visa resources to support the Chinese government's efforts to reduce poverty and promote inclusive finance. We announced a partnership with the China Foundation for Development of Financial Education and the China Foundation for Poverty Alleviation to help to support progress against these goals.
And at the end of March, we signed a cooperation plan with the China national tourism administration, establishing Visa as a strategic partner of the U.S. China tourism year. This collaboration between CNTA, the U.S. Department of Commerce and Visa will result in a year-long series of events designed to enhance tourism, trade cooperation and cultural understanding between China and the United States.
On to some updates on client activity. In the United States, Navy Federal Credit Union, the world's largest credit union and one of our most important clients in the U.S., renewed a multi-year credit and debit agreement with Visa. We're very proud of our association with this great institution. Beginning June 20, Visa cards will be exclusively accepted at Costco U.S. and Puerto Rico warehouse locations and fuel stations. And we continue to expand our relationships with clients across the globe. Banco do Brasil, the oldest and largest brand in South America renewed a multi-year credit agreement. And in India, SBI card, the State Bank of India's credit card venture renewed a multi-year credit card agreement as well.
We continue to be encouraged by the growth we see with Visa Checkout. We have nearly 12 million registered users in 16 countries and over 675 financial institution partners participating globally. Later this year, Visa Checkout will be available to merchants and consumers in 6 additional markets, including France, India, Ireland, Poland, Spain and the United Kingdom. More than 250,000 merchants, including some of the largest global retailers have signed on to accept Visa Checkout representing 113 billion in addressable volume. Visa Checkout customers are also more active online shoppers in general, completing 30% more transaction per person than the overall population of online shoppers.
In February, we launched Visa developer platform, an open platform that provides access to hundreds of Visa APIs and software development kits to some of Visa's most popular payments products and capabilities. It's still very early days, but we've had strong interest early on in the Visa development platform with thousands of new users building and testing new applications in our sandbox.
We have a small number of clients enter near production launch on the platform, and we expect to see more soon. Let me just give you a simple example of how the platform changes the way we work with our clients. Earlier this year, one of our largest clients outside the U.S. sent a small team to our office in San Francisco with an idea. They wanted to give their cardholders complete control over when and where their cards worked via their mobile app. The ability to turn their Visa card on or off for certain types of merchants or transactions. Working with our team and our new APIs, they designed, built and launched a working prototype in 3 days. And we're ready to be in market in a few weeks. Before Visa developer platform, this would have taken months.
Move on to talk about EMV for a second. Six months out from the official kickoff to chip in the U.S., we continue on the journey of moving from magnetic stripe to chip. More than 265 million Visa chip cards were issued as of March 2016, making the U.S. the largest chip card market in the world and larger than the U.K. and Brazil combined. 47% of credit cards and 30% of debit cards have a chip on them today. More than 1 million merchants now have chip-enabled terminals, roughly 20% of all merchants. Based on client surveys, we expect 50% of merchant locations will be enabled with EMV by the end of calendar year 2016.
One of the main pain points in moving to chip is the additional time it takes to complete a transaction due to the time the card spends in the terminal. Earlier this week, Visa announced the launch of quick chip for EMV. The upgrade streamlines the processing of a chip card transaction to enable customers to dip and remove their EMV chip card from the terminal without waiting for the transactions to be finalized, allowing the consumer to put away their card in typically 2 seconds or less.
The enhancement requires only a simple software update to the merchants' card terminal or point-of-sale system. Quick chip is available free-of-charge to payment processors, acquiring banks and other networks to offer to merchants. Several merchant processors and vendors plan to offer quick chip to their merchant clients in the coming months, including TSYS, Ingenico, VeriFone, Equinox and B2.
Before I turn the call back to Vasant, I want to say a few words about the back half of the year and our guidance. Vasant will walk through the specifics of the changes in our guidance, but a few quick comments. We've not seen improvement in the global economic environment, relative strength of currency payers is still unfavorable for us, and the price of oil has remained at low levels.
As we discussed last quarter on our earnings call, our guidance assumed that these things would improve. Since we're now in the third quarter, we're far less comfortable that volumes will meaningfully change, so we're officially reducing some pieces of our guidance, especially the third quarter. We could be wrong, we don't know what the global economy will look like beyond tomorrow. It could improve. And when things improve, we will be the beneficiaries. But as of today, with a few exceptions, our business volume growth is not accelerating or decelerating, but we're obviously, still seeing meaningful growth.
We do know that there will be a turn at some point for the better. We just don't know when. So our mindset continues to be cautious in the short-term due to the headwinds discussed earlier, but the long-term fundamentals of our business model remains strong and our focus is on accelerating global electronic payments. Globally, an estimated 43% of all consumer payments today are still made with cash, which leaves us an enormous opportunity, in addition to the growth that we see due to regular economic growth for PCE.
Last week, Visa published a white paper located on our website, discussing the opportunities to accelerate the growth of global acceptance, and I encourage you to take a look at that paper. So why we feel good about the work we've done, there's still a great opportunity in front of us.
With that, I'll turn it over to Vasant"

Much like our first fiscal quarter, the global macroeconomic environment remained uncertain, but our business performed well. A few points to highlight.

Much like our first fiscal quarter, the global macroeconomic environment remained uncertain, but our business performed well. A few points to highlight. First, net revenues grew 9% in constant dollars with an expected 3-point drag from the strong dollar. Nominal revenue grew 6%. The 1-point step up in the growth rates relative to the first quarter was mostly due to the leap year effect.
Cross-border business was once again very weak, but in line with the first quarter's growth rate. The deceleration of outbound commerce from China continues. Cross-border commerce out of commodity-based economies remained anemic. This is added to the negative effects of the strong dollar, especially on our large inbound U.S. business.
However, currency volatility were higher than the first quarter, offsetting some cross-border weakness. Through the first 6 months, we managed our expense growth to 4% in nominal terms, well below the high single-digit rate we had planned in the first half. We have continued to hold the line on expenses while funding all our key growth initiatives such as Visa Checkout, Visa Token Service, Visa Development platform and others.
During the quarter, we entered into currency forward contracts to mitigate the exchange rate risk associated with the upfront cash payments of Visa Europe. As these contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting, they are mark-to-market with gains and losses recorded in nonoperating income. We recorded $116 million gain, which we have excluded from our reported EPS as a non-GAAP adjustment. These contracts are expiring in late April.
When it became apparent that the Visa Europe transaction would not close before then, we entered into fully offsetting contracts at the end of March, locking in this gain. Coincidentally, this gain is almost equal to our interest expense in the quarter. Lastly, we've repurchased 24.2 million shares during the quarter, at an average price of $72.23 per share for a total of $1.8 billion.
Year-to-date, we have bought back 49.9 million shares at an average price of $75.47 or $3.8 billion. At the end of the quarter, we had remaining stock buyback authorization of $4 billion. Now a quick review of the quarter's business drivers. Note that all growth rates are about a point higher due to the leap year effect. 
Global payments volume in constant dollars grew 12%. Despite considerable uncertainty and turbulence in the global economy, payments volume growth globally has been remarkably stable. U.S. payments volume grew 11%, with both credit and debit growing at the same rate. Accounting for conversions and the leap date, U.S. payments volume growth was slightly lower than the first quarter. International payments volume grew 14% in constant dollars, consistent with the last quarter. Once again, the impact of the strong dollar reduced nominal growth in international payments volumes to a paltry 4%.
Cross-border volumes grew 5% in constant dollars and were flat in nominal dollars. When you factor in the leap year, the trend was unchanged from the first quarter. Cross-border growth rates in constant dollars have decelerated from 9% in fiscal year 2014 to 17% last year, down to 4% so far this year.
As we mentioned on our call last quarter, the first leg down was driven by the strong dollar and then starting in September last year, growth decelerated sharply due to China and the commodity price collapse. Cross-border commerce outbound from China has dropped from growth rates about 40% a year ago to single-digit levels in the second quarter.
Commodity-based economies across Latin America, the Middle East and Africa, have also experienced sharp declines. This has hit our large U.S. cross-border acquiring business hard. Commerce into Europe has been strong though we do not benefit fully from it yet. More recently, we have seen commerce outbound from Europe into the U.S. pick up.
Process transactions totaled $18.5 billion in the quarter, up 9%. Both U.S. and international growth at 12% and 1%, respectively, was stable. Process transaction growth rates will step up in the back half of the year as they begin to lap last year's transfer of domestic processing in Russia to NSPK. Service revenues grew 8% in excess of normal payments volume growth of 5%. The pricing we took last year contributed 3 points to the growth rate. Next quarter, we will lap the price increases and this 3-point tailwind will no longer help us.
Data processing revenue grew 10% in line with process transactions. International revenues grew 8%. Constant dollar cross-border volume growth of 5% was almost entirely offset by the currency translation drag. The year-over-year increase was largely driven by the pricing actions from last year. Currency volatilities were high in the quarter, but only contributed modestly to growth as we are now beginning to lap high volatilities from last year.
Next quarter, our reported international revenue growth rates will no longer benefit from the price increases. And as I mentioned, currency volatilities were unusually high in the second half of 2015. As such going forward, reported international revenue growth will depend on the interplay between volume growth and the currency translation drag. Other revenues were down 3%, primarily as a result of lower license fees generated outside the U.S. due to slowing payments volume.
Incentives were generally in line with our expectations, at the midpoint of our guidance range. Higher U.S. incentives due to acceleration of deals into the quarter were offset by lower incentives outside the U.S. due to lower volumes. With the expense growth in the mid-single digits, a tax rate of 30.1%, EPS of $0.68 after adjusting for the gain from our currency forward contracts, grew by 12% in constant dollars. And by a healthy 17%, when you account for the interest on the debt we issued to finance the Visa Europe acquisition.
With that, let me turn to our outlook for the fiscal third quarter and the balance of the year, which excludes the impact from Visa Europe. We now expect net revenue growth in fiscal 2016 to come in at 7% to 8% in constant dollars, a couple of points below our expectations from last October. This was driven by 3 factors: first, no improvement in cross-border volume growth from current levels; second, somewhat weaker domestic payment volumes due to gas prices as well as weakness in large commodity-based economies like Brazil; third, client incentives likely to come in at the high-end of our 17.5% to 18.5% range.
In October last year, as we told you on our call, we had hoped that cross-border trends would improve as we lap the weakening of the dollar in the second half of fiscal 2015. However, cross-border growth dropped from the 8% range to the 4% range in the past 6 to 9 months as outbound commerce from China and commodity economies slowed sharply. This trend continues. As such, we're assuming little improvement in the cross-border growth rate in the second half. Recent weakness in the dollar should help over time, but it is too early to tell.
We have now lapped the sharp gas declines from last year. Last October, we had hoped that this would provide a tailwind for U.S. domestic volume in the second half of fiscal 2016. This has not happened as gas prices remained below the lows of last year. Given the recent failure of OPEC to agree on production caps, low gas prices could persist. As such, we're assuming that U.S. payment volume growth will not improve from current trends in the second half.
In addition, payments volumes remain soft in large commodity economies like Brazil and the Middle East. Client incentives are projected to come in at the high-end of our guidance range. In the first half, client incentives were around 18% of gross revenues. In the second half, they are likely to run at around 19%. Significant renewals and conversions are driving this trend, particularly in the U.S. Costco and USAA add more than 50 basis points to incentives as a percent of gross revenue in the second half.
A few other factors to highlight. These are not new but will impact reported revenue growth numbers in the second half. As I mentioned earlier, we will no longer benefit from the uplift in our growth rate we got from the price increases last year. We will lap the currency volatility peaks of the second half of 2015. There have been some delays in the rollout of USAA and Costco conversions.
Given the quarter lag in recording service revenues, these Costco and USAA conversions are a drag on net revenues in the second half of 2016. In other words, incentives expensed exceed revenue recognized. This will of course, not be the case in fiscal 2017. On the positive front, if the recent weakness in the dollar continues, the currency translation drag of 3 points could moderate. Given softer-than-expected revenues, we will continue to hold the line of expenses -- on expenses funding key strategic and growth programs while maintaining or reducing costs in other areas.
As we had indicated previously, expense growth will be lower in the second half relative to the first half rate. We expect a modestly lower tax rate of about 30% versus the low 30s, which will also help mitigate impact on net income. As we look at the fiscal third quarter, net revenue growth in nominal terms could come in as low as 2% to 3%. In addition to the factors I just mentioned, we will lap an unusually low quarter for incentives in Q3 last year. Incentives were 16% of gross revenues due to deal delays versus an anticipated 19% this year.
As we have told you before, incentive shifts from quarter-to-quarter can impact year-over-year comparisons. Nominal net revenue growth should revert back to the first half growth rate in Q4. With the lower revenue growth range and including interest expense from the dollar, $16 billion in debt we issued last December, we now expect constant currency EPS growth in the low double-digit.
Interest expense will cost us over $0.09 this year or almost 4 points of EPS growth. If you account for the interest expense, it puts constant currency EPS growth at the low end of the mid-teens range. The currency translation drag is approximately 4 points. In terms of the impact of Visa Europe, for modeling purposes, we think it is best to assume the transaction does not close in our fiscal third quarter. As such, we will have interest expense in the third quarter but no operating income from Visa Europe to offset it.
Should we close on the acquisition sooner, we will of course break out the impact. If Visa Europe is in our numbers for the full fourth quarter, in rough terms, it will offset interest costs in the quarter. There will of course, be a variety of nonrecurring transaction-related costs, which we will also break out. We hope to give you a more precise perspective when we talk again in July. 
As we look ahead to 2017, we remain optimistic that revenue growth rates will step up from current levels. We will begin to see the impact of Costco and USAA conversions kick-in. And hopefully, we will see some recovery in the cross-border business and gas prices helped by a weakening dollar. Nominal dollar growth could also tick up as the dollar drag abates. Visa Europe will provide additional ballast, driving EPS growth back to levels you expect us to deliver. 
With that, I'll turn this back to Jack."

It has -- as you can see, run below that in the first half, and we said that the rate will be even lower in the second half. So clearly, we are trying to mitigate some of the revenue softness with expense management. And then the tax rate is modestly lower than we might have expected last year. So those 2 things are mitigating the impact on EPS, but not completely. But other than that really, those are the main sort of pluses and minuses.

In other words, the second derivative on that is still negative. It is continuing to decelerate, but still positive. Canada, a major source of business for us in the U.S. has been declining from several years now, gone from a growth rate to meaningful negative levels. Then we saw a significant change in trend in the past few months coming out of the commodity economies whether those are the African economies or the Middle East. Big declines in those areas and then layered on top of that are specific large economies like Brazil, which for a while was a major source of outbound business to the U.S. and elsewhere. And other economies like Russia, which you saw really slow -- go down significantly last year. So you've got sort of 3 things going on at the same time, which may not happen often.

So the first effect will be at some point, these things get lapped, assuming it doesn't continue to get worse. And normal business grows at a reasonable level. And then if there is any kind of weakening in the dollar, then you start to see the spending pattern shift back to once they were and that changes the growth dynamics significantly."

Well, first I think to the last question first, I think it's -- we don't -- when we think about what the adoption curves look like, we're not looking for anything that looks exponential necessarily at this point. In fact, what we want to see is we want to ensure that there is continued growth on both sides of the equation. So not just the increase in the user base, but the increase in the merchant locations as well. And any time, if those growth rates get way out of line, then we live somewhat in fear of one side of the network getting ahead of the other. So we have Bank of America, who is very actively promoting Visa Checkout that has just begun. So it's hard to draw any conclusions to what it means, but we love what they're doing. It is very simple. It's very creative, and we're excited about it. Beyond that, we're very focused on growing the merchant side. And the reality of the merchant side, Lisa, is it really is -- it's merchant by merchant. So we can certainly -- we've done everything that we can to make it a simple integration for merchants.  But the conversation really is, it's not even necessarily -- it's not the typical conversation that either we or an acquirer have with the merchant with -- we we're talking about acceptance, we were talking about an Assistant Treasurer. The conversations with Visa Checkout are much more about the marketing areas. And so that is where we are focused on is getting the conversation to a different level with merchants. And we are focused on the top merchants, not necessarily the number of merchants or the size of the merchants."

And as we pointed out on these calls many times, these are financial decisions about the network that they're choosing, but they're also far greater strategic alliances that they're thinking through. And what we bring is just a tremendous amount more to the banks in terms of capabilities. So the relationships that Visa Europe has are very, very strong and what we have is additive to that.

Yes, I think, I just want to make sure that we were just making sure people understood that this year, we had 2 big things going on that hopefully we won't have to deal with next year. One, is we have this interest expense, which clearly did not have offsetting operating income in the time frame that we expected. And that was a meaningful drag on our earnings this year, and clearly once the Visa Europe deal closes, we will have the offset, that was the intent of the debt issuance. So that was clearly almost a 4-point drag on growth. And we just want to make sure people are aware of that. Second, we have seen the headwinds that we talked about coming into the year. We are hopeful that they will moderate as we go into next year. And then third, the conversions that we believe will add some additional ballast so to speak to revenues, really aren't helping us and are in fact a drag this year because of this lag issue. So all I was doing was pointing to those things. We'll talk about next year at the appropriate time and give you our best sense for the next year.

I have a series of business updates that I'm going to walk through and then just a few sentences on the future before I turn it over to Vasant. 
First of all, with the closing of our Visa Europe acquisition. As you can see if you look to the numbers, the quarter is somewhat complicated, but we try to be as clear as we can in explaining the results. I want to start by saying that we're pleased with our continued consistent and predictable results in the face of an unchanged economic environment and increased geopolitical risks. To that point, the consumer has remained remarkably steadfast in the face of significant global instability. 
Getting onto the results. We reported GAAP EPS of $0.17 per share and adjusted EPS of $0.69 per share. This includes several special items related to the acquisition of Visa Europe. Vasant will discuss in further detail. But we view these as nonrecurring items and are not a reflection of business performance. 
On an adjusted basis. Net operating revenue grew 3% nominally or 6% on a constant currency basis, reflecting a continued negative 3 percentage point impact from FX and in line with expectations we discussed last quarter. Our growth continues to be subdued by similar themes we have previously spoken about, such as the strength of the U.S. dollar on translation and cross-border volumes, continued low oil prices and weakness in China and oil-based economies. 
However, U.S. spend remains steady as do -- as does other domestic spend. Overall, payments volume, cross-border volume growth and process transaction growth was similar to last quarter. The following numbers do not include Europe. U.S. payments volume growth was 10%, basically unchanged from last quarter after adjusting for a leap year; international payments volume growth was 11%, down from 14% last quarter, driven almost entirely by lower domestic transactions in China that yielded very little revenue; cross-border volume growth was 5% unchanged; process transaction growth was 10%, an acceleration of 1 point due to lapping of Russia's NSP Hub migration. 
More recently though, through July 14, U.S. payment volume growth was 11%. U.S. credit grew 18%, driven almost entirely by the positive impact of Costco and USAA. Debit growth on the other hand, moderated considerably following from 8% in fiscal Q3 to 3% through July 14. The decline was driven primarily by Interlink, about 1/3 of the decline is due to the lapping of very high growth at one of our large issuers who added Interlink to their cards last year and the remainder is due to dynamic routing positions. The decline due to the lapping will continue for another 3 quarters while the remainder is volatile as merchants require routing decisions dynamically. 
Cross-border growth through July 14 is up 156%, but that's inclusive of Europe in the July 14 period. For comparability. If you include Europe in both periods through July 14, growth is 12% versus 8% in the third quarter. The increase is driven by the timing of Ramadan and improvements that we see in the U.S. and Asia. And processed transactions rose 32%, including Europe. If you include Europe in both periods, then process transactions are flat at 11%. 
Moving on to Europe. Just a couple of comments. We're very happy to have closed the acquisition on June 21. We are well into the integration process. We have a management team in place, which provides a great deal of consistency. We've developed an integrated management approach and the teams are working extremely well together. We hosted 500 clients the week after the close in Europe where we showcased the benefits of a combined Visa to those clients. We've implemented and integrated approach to global and multi-region clients. And we're working through product and digital roadmaps ensuring Europe is appropriately prioritized within Visa. 
Regarding Brexit. Just make a couple of comments. First of all, with Brexit or without Brexit, it does not change our long-term view that the strategic rationale for putting these 2 companies together makes extraordinary sense. Also, I just want to remind people that they had a put. And in that scenario, a negotiated transaction is a far better approach than having someone exercise a put at a time, which is out of your control.
Certainly in the short-term, currency weakness and reduced economic growth are factors. We haven't seen much impact yet, but time will tell. We still feel good about our ability to deliver the accretion that we discussed and Vasant will review that in more detail in his comments. 
Let me quickly touch on legal matters now. The recent decision by the second circuit court of appeals to reverse the approval of our multi-district litigation class settlement is certainly disappointing. These cases were originally filed in 2005, and we continue to believe that the settlement was fair and reasonable for all stakeholders. However, the appeals court found that there were conflicts of interest between the 2 merchant settlement classes, a class that would have received money for alleged past damages and a class that would receive the benefit of certain changes to our network rules going forward. 
The court concluded that the conflict of interest between these classes meant that the classes were inadequately represented for purposes of settlement. It will take some time for the impact of this ruling to be determined and there may be further appeals. Meanwhile, Visa continues to honor the terms of the class settlement agreement, which remains in effect and did not terminate automatically because of the court's ruling. So for example, Visa has not reversed its rule change, permitting U.S. merchants to surcharge credit transactions. And the funds that Visa paid pursuant to the class settlement remain in court supervised escrow accounts. 
If the Court of Appeals decision remains after any further appeals, the matter will resume in the lower Federal Court where we will defend the case and in time, likely make a renewed effort to settle with the merchant classes. It is too early to speculate what shape that might take. However, I note that the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan continues to provide protection against monetary claims in the class litigation. 
As you know, a number of merchants have opted out of the class and filed their own complaints and we're continuing to defend those claims, which have not yet already been settled. The District Court has set a status conference on August 11 where we hope to obtain further clarity about next steps in both the class action and opt-out cases. But this will likely go on for some time. Finally, I should note that all the individual settlements we've entered into with opt out merchants remain in effect despite the court's ruling and regardless of the direction of any further appeals. The only exception is our settlement with Walmart, which was contingent upon the class settlement being affirmed. Its status will be determined after we have a final nonappealable decision in the class settlement.
We move on to talk about PayPal now. Earlier, we announced a new strategic partnership with PayPal. The partnership will result in significantly improved payment experience for Visa cardholders in the PayPal and wallets. The partnership is designed to deliver significant benefits for Visa's issuing national institutions, including a significantly better experience for their customers, more spending volume on their credit and debit cards, lower operational costs and improved security. Merchants will also benefit from improved customer experiences, efficiency and security, which together, should help drive increased sales. 
The details include the following:. First of all, enhanced consumer choice and improved experience for Visa cardholders. PayPal will make it easier for new and existing customers to choose to pay with their Visa cards and ensure a more seamless experience. Visa cards will be presented as a clear and equal payment option during enrollment and subsequent payments with an easy ability for consumers to set as their preferred payment method. Visa digital card images will be incorporated into payment flows. PayPal will not encourage Visa cardholders to link to a bank account via ACH. PayPal will also support and work with issuers to identify consumers who choose to migrate existing ACH payment flows to their Visa cards. 
Consumers will also be able to instantly withdraw and move money from their PayPal and accounts to their bank account by other Visa debit cards, leveraging Visa Direct, providing experience that offers speed, security and convenience. An important aspect of our agreement is enhanced data quality. PayPal will ensure that the data provided to issuers and their cardholders for Visa funded transactions will be consistent with the information that is received with the traditional Visa card transactions. This will ensure better consumer experience, reduced cardholder confusion, ensure proper application of rewards and reduce costly and time-consuming disputes.
PayPal will join the Visa Digital enablement program, what we referred to as VDEP, to enable them to expand their point of sale acceptance. This is a commercial framework for Visa partners to access our token services and other digital capabilities in the United States. Consistent with VDEP, issuers will be able to choose whether to participate or not. The agreement affords PayPal certain economic incentives, including Visa incentives for increased volume and greater long-term Visa fee certainty. 
Importantly, Visa issuers will have a 12-month period of exclusivity for promoting their cards that are within PayPal's wallets. The partnership puts PayPal and Visa on a new constructive path forward and provides a framework for our companies to work together collaboratively. A couple of notes about some client activity. We're pleased to announce that we renewed a multiyear agreement with TD in the United States and Canada for continued Visa credit and debit issuance. Regions Bank, a long time Visa client renewed a multi-year credit and debt agreement. Chevron, one of the world's leading energy companies renewed a multiyear credit co-brand with Visa. And as I'm sure you know, on June 20, Visa credit cards became exclusively accepted at Costco U.S. and Puerto Rico warehouse locations and fuel stations, and the new Costco Anywhere Visa Card by Citi launched.
This has been a long, complex process. But we're very encouraged by the results so far. And outside of North America. Phone plus, the second-largest retailer in South Korea with branch and home delivery services were due to multi-year co-brand program across multiple issuers supporting Pay Wave. According to in Taiwan, we renewed a multiyear credit co-brand agreement with Taishan Bank, one of the largest co-brand programs in the market. And in Indonesia, we renewed a multi-agreement with debit agreement, with Manderi who is the largest state-owned bank in the country.
Moving on to EMV in the U.S. Nine months out from the official kick off to chip in the U.S., we continue on the journey of moving magstripe to chip and the U.S. is now the largest chip market in the world. More than 326 million Visa chip cards were issued as of June 2016, making the U.S., as I said, largest in the world and larger than the U.K. and Brazil combined. 58% of credit cards and 37% of debit cards have a chip on them today. 
More than 1.3 million merchants now have chip-enabled terminals or roughly 28% of all merchant locations. Based on client surveys, we expect 75% of credit cards, 55% of debit cards, representing 96% and 73% of volume, respectively, and roughly 45% to 50% of merchant locations will be enabled with EMV by the end of calendar 2016. 
Having said all of this, this is a huge effort and we're doing a series of things to help make this process move more quickly and more smoothly. To that end, Visa announced a series of initiatives to help accelerate EMV chip migration for merchants. We streamlined our tester requirements. We amended and simplified the terminal certification process. We committed to investing further resources and technical expertise in a manner that reduced time frames by as much as 50%. We're also making policy changes to help limit exposure to counterfeit fraud liability for merchants who are not yet chip-ready. We want to say a few things about our relationship with U.S. merchants. We continue to invest in people, products and solutions, to help our merchant clients grow their business and reduce their costs. 
We've made good progress on this front with many of our merchant clients. Though it's early days, and this is a long-term commitment on our part. You have read surely about some of the disputes we have with some merchants. We're committed to doing everything reasonable to resolve these issues and we're committed to continue strengthening our relationship with all merchants.
As we continue to expand Visa Checkout around the world, we're constantly working to perfect the user experience and to deliver on our promise to make payment with Visa in the digital world as easy as it's been to pay in the physical world for more than 50 years. We rolled out the new Visa Checkout experience to all of our merchants globally. Working with dozens of our top U.S. merchants, we updated the Checkout experience to simplify the sign-up process for consumers to enroll, add cards and manage information with more fluid interactions and smart auto fill capabilities. 
We also begun to roll out an interactive Checkout button, allowing customers to enter their password buy in to the checkout button and confirm checkout with a single tap. Most of these features will be automatically available, which means merchants do not have to make any adjustments to their existing online Checkout processes payment systems. As we head into the Rio Olympics, we used the global sponsorship platform to highlight Visa Checkout and its merchants, including Best Buy in United Airlines, with whom we've created Olympic theme ads that you'll likely see on TV in the U.S. in the coming weeks.
As we continue to look forward and drive new technologies in the payment space, as you know, we opened an innovation center in our San Francisco headquarters, which has served as a destination for client, partners and developers to see our new payments technologies and work alongside us and our experts, and jointly create the next generation of payment and commerce applications. We've had great success and we committed to expand a number of facilities so we can be closer to our clients. 
To that end, in April, we opened our Singapore innovation center. In May, we opened one in Dubai. And in June, we opened one in Miami, all of which will serve our clients, partners and developers in that region and act as a hub to jointly create the next-generation of payment commerce applications. Accessible to both local and global clients, all these innovation centers will provide our partners with access to Visa APIs and software development kits available through our Visa developer platform. We also have an innovation center in London and have plans to open others in 2017. We announced yesterday that we will be opening a new facility in Palo Alto later this year. The office will house work that we do around data, business intelligence, technology research and merchant solutions. We decided to open this facility following on the great success that we've seen with our San Francisco and Bangalore facilities. We found that the combination of location, physical design and coworker colocation concentration are critical in our quest to continue to lead and innovate. All of these new locations provide opportunities to draw talent from the communities that have concentrations of skills different from each other and allows Visa to benefit from the diversity of people and ideas in these very different communities. 
We announce a new $5 billion share repurchase program. This brings the total available for share repurchases to $7.3 billion. This is a reflection of our confidence in our business, our commitment to offset the dilution from the preferred stock issued to these Europe members and our continuing commitment to return excess capital to shareholders. 
Before I turn the call over to Vasant, just a few words about the future. You can see that we provided full year guidance on a GAAP and an adjusted GAAP basis as required. And we've tried to give you a clear indication of the impact of Europe in the fourth quarter. On an adjusted basis and without the effect of Europe, we reaffirmed all of our 2016 guidance metrics. You will hear from Vasant but we're still confident in our ability to achieve the accretion from European transaction we shared at the time of the announcement. 
Looking ahead, we expect next quarter's results to improve modestly, similar to first half of the year's results. We'll provide more commentary on 2017 in October. But our underlying business is strong and with the lapping effect of several items based on what we know today and assuming similar consumer spending patterns, we feel good about our ability to produce stronger revenue and earnings growth. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Vasant"
38043467,371688513,1010930,"Visa Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2016",2016-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Visa Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Charlie. In the world that's both from a macroeconomic and a geopolitical standpoint, our business remains steady and resilient. A few points to note. Net revenues grew 6% in constant dollars and 3% in nominal dollars at the high end of the ran",2247,"Thank you, Charlie. In the world that's both from a macroeconomic and a geopolitical standpoint, our business remains steady and resilient. A few points to note. Net revenues grew 6% in constant dollars and 3% in nominal dollars at the high end of the range we had given you. Key business trends, even volumes, processed transactions and cross-border transactions remain stable. Currency volatility stayed high especially post the Brexit vote. As expected, client incentives are almost 19% of gross revenue. 
Once again, we had good expense management. Expenses declined 7% in the quarter on an adjusted basis and are flat year-to-date versus 2015. Lower personnel and marketing costs contributed from lower than projected expenses in the quarter. Non-GAAP EPS in Q3 was $0.69, after you adjust for our GAAP EPS of $0.17 for 4 significant Visa Europe related nonrecurring items. 
First, a $1.9 billion loss related to the settlement of the Visa Europe Framework Agreement as part of our acquisition of Visa Europe. Second, a $92 million staff duty paid to the U.K. treasury recorded in general and administrative expenses. Third, $60 [ph] million in transaction-related expenses recorded in professional fees. Fourth, a net gain of $103 [ph] million as we accumulated euros, leading up to the closing of the transaction, which is recorded in nonoperating income. 
You might recall we had a similar gain of $116 million last quarter, which we also excluded from our reported EPS as a non-GAAP adjustment. Now a quick review of the quarter's business drivers. Global payments volume in constant dollars grew 10%, roughly in line with the prior quarter when you adjust for the leap day. U.S. payments volumes picked up modestly, adjusting for the leap day as we start to benefit from USAA and Costco conversions, which helps credit growth to exceed debit growth in the U.S. 
International payment volume growth of 11% ticked down modestly. The strong dollar continued to weigh on international payment volumes, nominal growth was 5%. Despite Brexit and oil price collapse, commodity market weakness, a slowdown in China, terrorism and other destabilizing forces, payment volumes have remain stable for most of this year. Cross-border volumes grew 5% in constant dollars, a modest step up from a leap day adjusted second quarter. 
As the strengthening trend in the dollar has moderated, we have seen a reduction in the rate of decline in our large U.S. acquired business and in outbound commerce from Canada. However, this improvement is largely offset by a continuing slowdown of outbound commerce from China, down from 50% growth rates in Q3 last year to barely positive right now. Cross-border commerce from oil and commodity-based economies remain sluggish. 
Processed transactions totaled $19.8 billion in the quarter, up 10%. U.S. growth was 11% and international growth was 7%. As expected, international processed transaction growth rates are stepping up as we lap the transfer of domestic processing to NSPK in Russia. As you know, these numbers are not inclusive of Visa Europe. In our operational package this quarter, we have included a schedule that provides you with a 5-quarter history of the European geographies payment volume and transaction statistics. 
If we add these to our Q3 metrics, both to this year and last, constant dollar global payment volume growth would be 9%, cross-border volume constant growth calculated based on merchant currencies -- merchant country currencies would be 8% and process transaction growth would be 11%. Of course, starting next quarter, we will incorporate Europe as a new region in our operational performance data package. 
Moving on to our financial metrics. First, revenue grew 6% roughly in line with nominal payments volume growth. The reduction in the growth rate from the last quarter was anticipated as we lapped pricing increases from last year. Data processing revenue grew 10%, in line with process transaction growth. International revenues grew 4%, generally in line with volume growth as we lap our price increases and the drag of the strong dollar moderates. 
Fortunately, currency volatility stayed high and comparable to the high reach last year. Post the Brexit vote, volatilities reached levels we have not experienced in recent years. Incentives were in line with our expectations. As we indicated, the significant year-over-year increase was driven by an unusually low level of incentives in the third quarter of 2015. Incentive as a percentage of gross revenues approached 19% and will stick up further in Q4 as Costco incentives kick in. 
This will bring full year client incentives as a percentage of gross revenue to around 18.5%, the high end of the 17.5% to 18.5% range that we have provided you. With expense growth down 7% and a tax rate of 30.4%, our run rate EPS was $0.69 after making the 4 Visa Europe-related adjustments I described. As a reminder, there is no Visa Europe revenue, expense or income in our Q3 numbers. Had we included Visa Europe results for the 9 days we owned it in the quarter, it would have added a de minimus $12 million to our net income. 
Some Visa Europe-related consideration. The Europe leadership team is in place as Charlie said and running the business. The business is performing as expected and integration activities have commenced. The employee consultation process, which is required by law before any restructuring or operation, is underway in the U.K. The technology harmonization program has also been launched. We're moving fast to bringing Visa's global capabilities to European customers, including Visa Checkout, Visa token service, Visa Direct as well as our consulting resources. Significant customer relationships have already been renewed and others are in process. We believe our customers are excited by what a global Visa can offer them. 
Visa Europe members have been informed that rebates will be terminated at the end of September 2016. We are working with our customers to transition to commercial relationships with competitive client incentive programs as we have elsewhere in the world. This will be a multi-year process. But the early results have been positive. The longer-term impact of Brexit on Visa Europe's business is too early to determine. The immediate impact has been on exchange rates. The weaker pound and euro will hurt revenues as reported in dollars. However, a significant portion of Visa Europe's expenses are currently denominated in pounds, which offsets the negative revenue impact. 
Given the relative values of the pound and the euro at this point, the net impact of Visa Europe's earnings as reported in dollars is roughly neutral right now. Brexit has also introduced significant uncertainty, which is never good for business sentiment. Most economic prognosticators are expecting an economic slowdown in Europe. Beyond this, it is too early to know what the broader and longer-term implication of Brexit are for our business. 
Assuming exchange rates stay where they are today, and there are no major economic dislocation as a result of Brexit, we accept Visa Europe earnings to offset interest expense from debt in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 as we told you last quarter. Visa Europe is expected to add 2% to 3% to EPS accretion in fiscal year 2017, in line with the low single digit accretion we had anticipated. 
Our accretion estimate assumes the current tax structure stays in place through fiscal year 2017. Under this structure, Visa Europe is a U.S. taxpayer. This tax structure is favorable from a cash tax standpoint. However, the current tax structure results in a higher reported on book tax rate for Visa Europe's earnings. This will add approximately 1 percentage point to Visa's reported tax rate in fiscal year 2017. As always, we will be working on plans to improve both our cash and reported tax rates over time. 
Visa Europe has over $2 billion of cash on its balance sheet. Based on discussions with our regulator in the U.K., we will leave this cash within the Visa Europe legal entity. As a result of this action and due to the higher upfront cash consideration after we eliminated the earn-out provision, we will issue additional debt later this year to fund stock buybacks to offset dilution from preferred stock issued in the transaction. Our current plan is to issue at least $2 billion in debt before the end of this calendar year. 
As we indicated, we plan to offset the dilutive impact of the preferred share issued by buying stock in excess of our normal buyback program. We have been buying stock back as a step up base for the past 2 quarters in anticipation of the closing of the transaction. We plan to continue buying at this pace until we have bought back sufficient stock to offset the impact of the shares issued. We expect that we will be done by the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. 
In the third quarter, we recognized a $1.9 billion loss related to the Visa Europe Framework Agreement. Under U.S. GAAP as part of our accounting for the Visa Europe acquisition, we are required to assess all pre-existing contractual relationships between Visa Europe and the sell. If the terms of these agreements are determined to not be at fair value at the time of the close, a portion of the purchase price paid in the transaction is deemed to relate to the effective settlement of these arrangements between the parties. The Visa Europe Framework Agreement was established in October 2007 between Visa and Visa Europe as part of our 2007 reorganization. This agreement provides Visa Europe with a perpetual and exclusive right to operate the Visa business in the European Union in exchange for a license we paid to Visa. 
Under the terms of the Framework Agreement, the license fee paid by Visa Europe has increased modestly since 2007 however, the value of the Visa business has increased at a greater rate. As such, management concluded that the terms of the Framework Agreement were not at fair value as determined under U.S. GAAP at the time of the close. We estimated the value of settling the same framework agreement at $1.9 million. The size of this settlement value was driven by the fact that the agreement was perpetual in nature and would have continued indefinitely had the acquisition not occurred. 
Under U.S. GAAP, $1.9 billion of total consideration transferred to VE in the transaction was charged to the income statement as a onetime nonrecurring operating expense representing the cost of settling this arrangement. Had this arrangement not existed, or its terms been at fair value, this amounts would've been allocated to net asset required. This would have resulted in $1.9 billion additional goodwill recorded in the transaction. Our third quarter balance sheet includes Visa Europe. In a few days, we'll be filing our 10-Q, which will provide considerable detail on all aspects of the accounting for the Visa Europe transaction. Allocation of the purchase price to net tangible assets and liabilities, and to intangible assets and goodwill as well as the impact of Visa Europe on cash and working capital balances. 
We would of course, be happy to answer any questions you have after you review the 10-Q. Moving to our outlook for the fourth quarter and the impact of Visa Europe. We expect nominal net revenue growth in Q4 for the legacy Visa business not including Visa Europe, of around 5% to 6% in line with the first half trend. Q3 growth rates were depressed by unfavorable year-over-year comparisons on client incentives, which will normalize. We're also projecting a modest uptick in cross-border growth rates as dollar spend moderates and we lap the slow down from last year. 
Visa Europe will add 13 to 14 points to fourth quarter net revenue growth. We expect to leap a set of expense growth for legacy in Q4 from real related marketing and higher technology project spend. Visa Europe allowed as much as 15 to 16 points of expense growth. As I mentioned earlier, and in line with what we told you last quarter, Visa Europe income should offset that interest expense in the fourth quarter. For the year, our key guidance metrics for legacy Visa remain largely unchanged. 
Visa Europe will add 3 to 4 points of growth to both revenue and expenses. The concentration process is underway in Europe. We're also looking at adjustments to our global cost base as we integrate Europe. Assuming our plans are finalized, we expect to take a restructuring charge in the fourth quarter to resize our global cost structure as a result of the Visa Europe acquisition. As we've said previously, the technology integration will happen later. We will regularly update you on progress.
A quick word on fiscal year 2017. As we normally do, we will provide our comprehensive perspective on 2017 when we talk to you in late October. As we look ahead, we feel good about our business and what Visa Europe will add to it. There are as always, tailwinds and headwinds. In the tailwinds column, payments volume uplift from USAA and Costco, 2 significant drags looked likely to ease gas prices and the dollar translation impact. Cross-border growth could improve as dollar strength moderates. And last but not least, accretion from Visa Europe. 
In the headwinds column. Continuing global uncertainty both economic and geopolitical, the impact of Brexit on Europe, China slowdown in market entry costs. On balance. We anticipate 2017 will be a year with healthy top and bottom line growth for Visa. 
With that, I'll turn this back to Jack."

And Jack can chime in here. Relative to what we make up of a PayPal wallet, you really have to ask PayPal that question because we know what we know, and we have some general thoughts, but they really can be the ones -- and should be the ones. And just generally, what we've always thought is that roughly half the transactions that run through PayPal, run through a network and we're roughly half or so of that, split between credit and debit. But those are what I would call gross approximations and directional. And it's -- you really need to talk to them. Relative to what happens in terms of the flows. Again, if you go through what they said, what we really are interested in doing is to ensure that Visa cards are on a level playing field. And if they're on a level playing field, we feel great about our ability to increase the amount of volume that run over Visa cards and ultimately, benefit our clients. And so with the agreement does is it enables that to occur. And there's also a period of time where we can work actively together and exclusively to move volume from the ACH back onto Visa cards that that's what the client wants to do. And so to the extent that, that happens, net-net, that's a financial plus for us. As part of this agreement, as we've said, there are incentives that we will pay. Visa incentives that he will pay to PayPal. And if those numbers aren't reached, then those incentives don't get paid. But the last -- I do want to say is partnership agreements work when there's alignment for everyone. And so we've had extensive conversations over a long period of time with PayPal with our issuers and other members of the payments community. And what we've tried to do here is come up with something that really does work for everyone. And so where we can sit here and say, this is all about driving growth in the electronic payments universe. Because we're creating better customer experiences where they're allowed to use products that they want to use, where they get all the benefits of those products are, it is seamless experience through PayPal, these products become a better alternative to cash and check and other alternatives out there.

But I'd say the following things. I think as we go through the conversion to EMV, there are just -- there are lots of moving pieces especially in the debit world. With terminals having to be reprogrammed, new terminals out there, multiple applications embedded on chips and things think that and merchants turning on PIN pads from different times from times rather than actually turned on the EMV reader. So there's a lot of movement between Signature and PIN, which is somewhat different than we would've seen in a steady-state environment. And that'll play itself out. And that's not a plus or minus. There's just movement there. And that's just the reality of what happens during a conversion like this. What we see is ultimately, we just want our consumers to have the ability to use the cards. Merchants how whatever abilities that Durbin has given them. And we've -- and they've had those capabilities ever since Durbin was passed. And a big part of that is they have the ability to choose the routing preference. And so as we've seen since Durbin came into place, quarter by quarter, there are just a whole series of things that impact where our merchant wants to route to. People give them incentives when they -- whose incentives they think they're going to hit are not hit, help them decide where they want to route to our out the way from. And so the Interlink volumes that we see and we look at it regularly, are very volatile. And so just keep in mind at the numbers that I talked about, which have that decrease, they're 2 weeks. And so someone can make a change in the routing table we can see a very big impact. That can also change 2 or 3 weeks from now, based upon what we do relative to incentives and things like that. And that's just -- that is the way the business works. And they think that's the way Durbin a -- the Durbin Amendment intended it to work."

Listen, I think I put it is, so first of all, it's completely up to the issuers on whether or not they want to proactively work with ourselves and or PayPal. Again, we're not telling an issuer they have to do anything. But what we've heard consistent the firm issuers, and I certainly experienced it is when I was at one, is that ACH is a really bad thing. Your disintermediate it, it's a by the customer experience. They don't understand the process to dispute things. Call centers don't understand information and things like that. And so given a choice, you'd rather have a transaction run over a Visa debit or credit product rather than ACH. So I would assume that most issuers would choose to want to actively engage to try and move those runs actions onto cards which quite frankly, consumers know, love, understand and are very comfortable about how those products work. So during the spirit of time, PayPal wants to work actively with us because to the extent that consumers want to do this, it's -- again, I can't speak for them but consumer choice was an important part of the discussion in the press release. And that's what this actually provides. So again, the way we look at as a network, the way we look at what we've done in this agreement is we've taken -- we've tried to work with PayPal and partnership to take away the things that discourage people from working together, and take away the things that create bad customer experiences. And just -- when you do that than anything, hopefully, you wind up with a position where people actually work together. And if you don't even just get back to -- it should produce a higher level of growth coming from someplace else. And whether that comes from other networks, cash, check, any alternatives out there, we don't know. But that's what this agreement is. It's about taking those bad things out, providing a better customer experience and in the consumers will ultimately choose what they want to use. And as I said, we feel very comfortable that we'll do quite well in an environment like that as our clients will."

Is the exact opposite of that.

All those things, that's ultimately why people choose networks. And as I've said, that something that we need to deliver both not just a issuers, but ultimately, to merchants either directly or through the acquiring community. And so to the extent that we do that, whoever we compete with -- because remember, we competed -- as you've seen, we competed with PayPal, which has another way of doing business here and in the physical world, we've done quite well and felt very comfortable to our ability to compete in the online world as you develop the solutions. So for us, it's about creating that value, delivering on innovation. And I wouldn't underestimate the work that we have done at Visa on fast funds, push payments and things that we're doing both in developed parts of the world in the emerging parts of the world.

I give you some historical date on Visa Europe's performance. So if you're talking about volume, payment volume over the past let's see, the last quarter, constant dollar payment volume growth was 6.6%. And then over the last year, constant dollar payment volume growth was a little over 7%. So it has been fairly stable if you look at the numbers for the past several quarters. Those swings up and down a bit along the way. We're not expecting anything different. I mean, you're clearly monitoring the impact of Brexit it's really not them evident at this point, will have to keep watching it but as far as it relates to the fourth quarter, we're not assuming any change in trend. But in terms of its specific impact on us, you see that in the guidance we provided where we told you that the revenue impact of Visa Europe on the quarter if you go to the table we have, was 13 to 14 points up additional dollar revenue growth that would be added to our reported numbers because of Visa Europe, 3 to 4 points of additional revenue growth on the full-year basis. And as far as the impact, we told you last quarter and we're regrading that Visa Europe's income will offset the debt interest we had. So essentially, it'll make up for the debt interest in the quarter. So that's pretty much it."

We feel like we've addressed everything that we wanted to address. And it was a great conversation. We were both trying to get -- again, as I said earlier, what we both wanted to get to was a point that PayPal, ourselves and the issuers would look at it and say, it's something that makes sense for all of us to work together. And that's based upon the fact that we're providing a better experience and the opportunities are greater than ever for consumers and merchants. So keep -- having everyone aligned is what everyone was after. And that's what we think we've done here. And so, we feel very good that we're in a position, as I said, we're -- this is a framework where we can work happily together hopefully for a very long period of time. Because it's going to drive more growth. That's what it's all about. It does not change our Visa Checkout strategy. Here too, I've been very consistent in saying that one of the things that we don't know is we don't know ultimately what experiences are going to win at the point of sale either online or at the physical point of sale. And so given the fact that we are the global acceptance markets recognize more than any in the world, that something where we should have a solution that leverages debt acceptance and allows consumers to pay quickly and easily and securely in a manner that they're accustomed. And that's what Visa Checkout is designed to be. But there are other payment solutions out there. We've talked about them a bunch in this call as is PayPal. And so what you want to do is to ensure that if we're working together on their principles that we're happy with, which is what we've achieved here and what we have in the other roles that we support, then we want to enable multiple experiences and ultimately, consumers and merchants will choose which will win in the marketplace. And so we're happy with the progress that we're making in Visa Checkout. We're glad we're doing it. Ultimately, what we're going to look at for success is how Visa usage is doing in the physical point of the world, online and in mobile. Secondarily, where it's coming from. And ultimately, that will help us make resource allocations. But we want to be the enabler. We want the volume. We're doing lots of different things and Visa Checkout is one of those things, but it's not the only thing."

Thanks for taking the time. There's a series of topics that I'm going to discuss today. We'll talk a little bit about third quarter results, a few comments about our European acquisition and talk about litigation. I'm going to make some comments about the agreement we signed with PayPal today. I have a series of business updates that I'm going to walk through and then just a few sentences on the future before I turn it over to Vasant. 
First of all, with the closing of our Visa Europe acquisition. As you can see, if you look to the numbers, the quarter is somewhat complicated but we try to be as clear as we can in explaining the results. I want to start by saying that we're pleased with our continued consistent and predictable results in the face of an unchanged economic environment and increased geopolitical risks. To that point, the consumer has remained remarkably steadfast in the face of significant global instability. 
Getting on to the results. We reported GAAP EPS of $0.17 per share and adjusted EPS of $0.69 per share. This includes several special items related to the acquisition of Visa Europe. Vasant will discuss in further detail, but we view these as nonrecurring items and are not a reflection of business performance. 
On an adjusted basis. Net operating revenue grew 3% nominally or 6% on a constant currency basis, reflecting a continued negative 3 percentage point impact from FX and in line with expectations we discussed last quarter. Our growth continues to be subdued by similar themes we have previously spoken about, such as the strength of the U.S. dollar on translation and cross-border volumes, continued low oil prices and weakness in China and oil-based economies. 
However, U.S. spend remains steady as do -- as does other domestic spend. Overall, payments volume, cross-border volume growth and process transaction growth was similar to last quarter. The following numbers do not include Europe. U.S. payments volume growth was 10%, basically unchanged from last quarter after adjusting for a leap year; international payments volume growth was 11%, down from 14% last quarter, driven almost entirely by lower domestic transactions in China that yield very little revenue; cross-border volume growth was 5%, unchanged; process transaction growth was 10%, an acceleration of 1 point due to lapping of Russia's NSPK migration. 
More recently, though, through July 14, U.S. payment volume growth was 11%. U.S. credit grew 18%, driven almost entirely by the positive impact of Costco and USAA. Debit growth, on the other hand, moderated considerably, falling from 8% in fiscal Q3 to 3% through July 14. The decline was driven primarily by Interlink. About 1/3 of the decline is due to the lapping of very high growth at one of our large issuers who added Interlink to their cards last year and the remainder is due to dynamic routing decisions. The decline due to the lapping will continue for another 3 quarters while the remainder is volatile as merchants and acquirers make routing decisions dynamically. 
Cross-border growth through July 14 is up 156%, but that's inclusive of Europe in the July 14 period. For comparability, if you include Europe in both periods through July 14, growth is 12% versus 8% in the third quarter. The increase is driven by the timing of Ramadan and improvements that we see in the U.S. and Asia. And processed transactions rose 42%, including Europe. If you include Europe in both periods, then process transactions are flat at 11%. 
Moving on to Europe. Just a couple of comments. We're very happy to have closed the acquisition on June 21. We are well into the integration process. We have a management team in place, which provides a great deal of consistency. We've developed an integrated management approach, and the teams are working extremely well together. We hosted 500 clients the week after the close in Europe where we showcased the benefits of a combined Visa to those clients. We've implemented an integrated approach to global and multi-region clients. And we're working through product and digital roadmaps ensuring Europe is appropriately prioritized within Visa. 
Regarding Brexit. Just make a couple of comments. First of all, with Brexit or without Brexit, it does not change our long-term view that the strategic rationale for putting these 2 companies together makes extraordinary sense. Also, I want to just remind people that they had a put. And in that scenario, a negotiated transaction is a far better approach than having someone exercise a put at a time which is out of your control.
Certainly, in the short-term, currency weakness and reduced economic growth are factors. We haven't seen much impact yet, but time will tell. We still feel good about our ability to deliver the accretion that we discussed, and Vasant will review that in more detail in his comments. 
Let me quickly touch on legal matters now. The recent decision by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals to reverse the approval of our multi-district litigation class settlement is certainly disappointing. These cases were originally filed in 2005, and we continue to believe that the settlement was fair and reasonable for all stakeholders. However, the appeals court found that there were conflicts of interest between the 2 merchant settlement classes, a class that would have received money for alleged past damages and a class that would receive the benefit of certain changes to our network rules going forward. 
The court concluded that the conflict of interest between these classes meant that the classes were inadequately represented for purposes of settlement. It will take some time for the impact of this ruling to be determined and there may be further appeals. Meanwhile, Visa continues to honor the terms of the class settlement agreement, which remains in effect and did not terminate automatically because of the court's ruling. So for example, Visa has not reversed its rule change permitting U.S. merchants to surcharge credit transactions. And the funds that Visa paid pursuant to the class settlement remain in court-supervised escrow accounts. 
If the Court of Appeals decision remains after any further appeals, the matter will resume in the lower federal court, where we will defend the case and, in time, likely make a renewed effort to settle with the merchant classes. It is too early to speculate what shape that might take. However, I note that the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan continues to provide protection against monetary claims in the class litigation. 
As you know, a number of merchants have opted out of the class and filed their own complaints and we're continuing to defend those claims, which have not yet already been settled. The District Court has set a status conference on August 11, where we hope to obtain further clarity about next steps in both the class action and the opt-out cases. But this will likely go on for some time. 
Finally, I should note that all the individual settlements we've entered into with opt-out merchants remain in effect despite the court's ruling and regardless of the direction of any further appeals. The only exception is our settlement with Walmart, which was contingent upon the class settlement being affirmed. Its status will be determined after we have a final nonappealable decision in the class settlement.
We move on to talk about PayPal now. Earlier, we announced a new strategic partnership with PayPal. The partnership will result in significantly improved payment experiences for Visa cardholders in the PayPal and Venmo wallets. The partnership is designed to deliver significant benefits for Visa's issuing national institutions, including a significantly better experience for their customers, more spending volume on their credit and debit cards, lower operational costs and improved security. Merchants will also benefit from improved customer experiences, efficiency and security, which together should help drive increased sales. 
The details include the following. First of all, enhanced consumer choice and improved experience for Visa cardholders. PayPal will make it easier for new and existing customers to choose to pay with their Visa cards and ensure a more seamless experience. Visa cards will be presented as a clear and equal payment option during enrollment and subsequent payments with an easy ability for consumers to set as their preferred payment method. Visa digital card images will be incorporated into payment flows. PayPal will not encourage Visa cardholders to link to a bank account via ACH. PayPal will also support and work with issuers to identify consumers who choose to migrate existing ACH payment flows to their Visa cards. 
Consumers will also be able to instantly withdraw and move money from their PayPal and Venmo accounts to their bank account via their Visa debit cards, leveraging Visa Direct, providing experience that offers speed, security and convenience. An important aspect of our agreement is enhanced data quality. PayPal will ensure that the data provided to issuers and their cardholders for Visa-funded transactions will be consistent with the information that is received with traditional Visa card transactions. This will ensure better consumer experience, reduced cardholder confusion, ensure proper application of rewards and reduce costly and time-consuming disputes.
PayPal will join the Visa Digital Enablement Program, what we refer to as VDEP, to enable them to expand their point-of-sale acceptance. This is a commercial framework for Visa partners to access our token services and other digital capabilities in the United States. Consistent with VDEP, issuers will be able to choose whether to participate or not. The agreement affords PayPal certain economic incentives, including Visa incentives for increased volume and greater long-term Visa fee certainty. 
Importantly, Visa issuers will have a 12-month period of exclusivity for promoting their cards that are within PayPal's wallets. The partnership puts PayPal and Visa on a new, constructive path forward and provides a framework for our companies to work together collaboratively. A couple of notes about some client activity. We're pleased to announce that we renewed a multiyear agreement with TD in the United States and Canada for continued Visa credit and debit issuance. Regions Bank, a long time Visa client, renewed a multi-year credit and debt agreement. Chevron, one of the world's leading energy companies renewed a multiyear credit co-brand with Visa. And as I'm sure you know, on June 20, Visa credit cards became exclusively accepted at Costco U.S. and Puerto Rico warehouse locations and fuel stations, and the new Costco Anywhere Visa Card by Citi launched.
This has been a long, complex process. But we're very encouraged by the results so far. And outside of North America, Homeplus, the second-largest retailer in South Korea with branch and home delivery services, we did a multi-year co-brand program across multiple issuers supporting payWave. In Taiwan, we renewed a multiyear credit co-brand agreement with Taishin Bank, one of the largest co-brand programs in the market. And in Indonesia, we renewed a multi-year debit agreement with Mandiri who is the largest state-owned bank in the country.
Moving on to EMV in the U.S. Nine months out from the official kick-off to chip in the U.S., we continue on the journey of moving from magstripe to chip, and the U.S. is now the largest chip market in the world. More than 326 million Visa chip cards were issued as of June 2016, making the U.S., as I said, the largest in the world and larger than the U.K. and Brazil combined. 58% of credit cards and 37% of debit cards have a chip on them today. 
More than 1.3 million merchants now have chip-enabled terminals or roughly 28% of all merchant locations. Based on client surveys, we expect 75% of credit cards, 55% of debit cards, representing 96% and 73% of volume, respectively, and roughly 45% to 50% of merchant locations will be enabled with EMV by the end of calendar 2016. 
Having said all of this, this is a huge effort and we're doing a series of things to help make this process move more quickly and more smoothly. To that end, Visa announced a series of initiatives to help accelerate EMV chip migration for merchants. We streamlined our test and requirements. We amended and simplified the terminal certification process. We committed to investing further resources and technical expertise in a manner that reduce time frames by as much as 50%. We're also making policy changes to help limit exposure to counterfeit fraud liability for merchants who are not yet chip ready. We want to say a few things about our relationship with U.S. merchants. We continue to invest in people, products and solutions, to help our merchant clients grow their business and reduce their costs. 
We've made good progress on this front with many of our merchant clients, though it's early days, and this is a long-term commitment on our part. You have read surely about some of the disputes we have with some merchants. We're committed to doing everything reasonable to resolve these issues and we're committed to continue strengthening our relationship with all merchants.
As we continue to expand Visa Checkout around the world, we're constantly working to perfect the user experience and to deliver on our promise to make paying with Visa in the digital world as easy as it's been to pay in the physical world for more than 50 years. We rolled out the new Visa Checkout experience to all of our merchants globally. Working with dozens of our top U.S. merchants, we updated the Checkout experience to simplify the sign-up process for consumers to enroll, add cards and manage their information with more fluid interactions and smart auto-fill capabilities. 
We also begun to roll out an interactive checkout button, allowing customers to enter their password right in to the checkout button and confirm checkout with a single tap. Most of these features will be automatically available, which means merchants do not have to make any adjustments to their existing online checkout processes or payment systems. As we head into the Rio Olympics, we used the global sponsorship platform to highlight Visa Checkout and its merchants, including Best Buy in United Airlines, with whom we've created Olympic theme ads that you'll likely see on TV in the U.S. in the coming weeks.
As we continue to look forward and drive new technologies in the payment space, as you know, we opened an innovation center in our San Francisco headquarters, which has served as a destination for clients, partners and developers to see our new payments technologies and work alongside us and our experts, and jointly create the next generation of payment and commerce applications. We've had great success and we committed to expand the number of facilities so we can be closer to our clients. 
To that end, in April, we opened our Singapore innovation center. In May, we opened one in Dubai; and in June, we opened one in Miami, all of which will serve our clients, partners and developers in that region and act as a hub to jointly create the next generation of payment commerce applications. Accessible to both local and global clients, all these innovation centers will provide our partners with access to Visa APIs and software development kits available through our Visa developer platform. We also have an innovation center in London and have plans to open others in 2017. We announced yesterday that we'll be opening a new facility in Palo Alto later this year. The office will house work that we do around data, business intelligence, technology research and merchant solutions. We decided to open this facility following on the great success that we've seen with our San Francisco and Bangalore facilities. We found that the combination of location, physical design and coworker colocation concentration are critical in our quest to continue to lead and innovate. All of these new locations provide opportunities to draw talent from the communities that have concentrations of skills different from each other and allows Visa to benefit from the diversity of people and ideas in these very different communities. 
We announce a new $5 billion share repurchase program. This brings the total available for share repurchases to $7.3 billion. This is a reflection of our confidence in our business, our commitment to offset the dilution from the preferred stock issued to Visa Europe members and our continuing commitment to return excess capital to shareholders. 
Before I turn the call over to Vasant, just a few words about the future. You can see that we provided full year guidance on a GAAP and an adjusted GAAP basis as required. And we've tried to give you a clear indication of the impact of Europe in the fourth quarter. On an adjusted basis and without the impact of Europe, we reaffirmed all of our 2016 guidance metrics. You will hear from Vasant, but we're still confident in our ability to achieve the accretion from the European transaction we shared at the time of the announcement. 
Looking ahead, we expect next quarter's results to improve modestly, similar to first half of the year's results. We'll provide more commentary on 2017 in October. But our underlying business is strong and with the lapping effect of several items, based on what we know today and assuming similar consumer spending patterns, we feel good about our ability to produce stronger revenue and earnings growth. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Vasant"

In a world that's turbulent both from a macroeconomic and a geopolitical standpoint, our business remained steady and resilient. A few points to note. Net revenues grew 6% in constant dollars and 3% in nominal dollars at the high end of the range we had given you. Key business trends, payment volumes, processed transactions and cross-border transactions remained stable. Currency volatility stayed high, especially post the Brexit vote. As expected, client incentives are almost 19% of gross revenue. 
Once again, we had good expense management. Expenses declined 7% in the quarter on an adjusted basis and are flat year-to-date versus 2015. Lower personnel and marketing costs contributed to lower-than-projected expenses in the quarter. Non-GAAP EPS in Q3 was $0.69, after you adjust for our GAAP EPS of $0.17 for 4 significant Visa Europe-related nonrecurring items. 
First, a $1.9 billion loss related to the settlement of the Visa Europe Framework Agreement as part of our acquisition of Visa Europe. Second, a $92 million staff duty paid to the U.K. treasury recorded in general and administrative expenses. Third, $60 million in transaction-related expenses recorded in professional fees. Fourth, a net gain of $103 million as we accumulated euros, leading up to the closing of the transaction, which is recorded in nonoperating income. 
You might recall we had a similar gain of $116 million last quarter, which we also excluded from our reported EPS as a non-GAAP adjustment. Now a quick review of the quarter's business drivers. Global payments volume in constant dollars grew 10%, roughly in line with the prior quarter when you adjust for the leap day. U.S. payments volume picked up modestly, adjusting for the leap day, as we start to benefit from USAA and Costco conversions, which helps credit growth to exceed debit growth in the U.S. 
International payment volume growth of 11% ticked down modestly. The strong dollar continued to weigh on international payment volumes, nominal growth was 5%. Despite Brexit and oil price collapse, commodity market weakness, a slowdown in China, terrorism and other destabilizing forces, payment volumes have remained stable for most of this year. Cross-border volumes grew 5% in constant dollars, a modest step-up from a leap day-adjusted second quarter. 
As the strengthening trend in the dollar has moderated, we have seen a reduction in the rate of decline in our large U.S. acquired business and in outbound commerce from Canada. However, this improvement is largely offset by a continuing slowdown of outbound commerce from China, down from 50% growth rates in Q3 last year to barely positive right now. Cross-border commerce from oil and commodity-based economies remained sluggish. 
Processed transactions totaled $19.8 billion in the quarter, up 10%. U.S. growth was 11% and international growth was 7%. As expected, international processed transaction growth rates are stepping up as we lap the transfer of domestic processing to NSPK in Russia. As you know, these numbers are not inclusive of Visa Europe. In our operational package this quarter, we have included a schedule that provides you with a 5-quarter history of the European geographies' payment volume and transaction statistics. 
If we add these to our Q3 metrics, both to this year and last, constant dollar global payment volume growth would be 9%, cross-border volume constant growth calculated based on merchant currencies -- merchant country currencies would be 8% and process transaction growth would be 11%. Of course, starting next quarter, we will incorporate Europe as a new region in our operational performance data package. 
Moving on to our financial metrics. Service revenues grew 6%, roughly in line with nominal payments volume growth. The reduction in the growth rate from the last quarter was anticipated as we lapped pricing increases from last year. Data processing revenue grew 10%, in line with process transaction growth. International revenues grew 4%, generally in line with volume growth as we lap our price increases and the drag of the strong dollar moderates. 
Fortunately, currency volatility stayed high and comparable to the highs reached last year. Post the Brexit vote, volatilities reached levels we have not experienced in recent years. Incentives were in line with our expectations. As we indicated, the significant year-over-year increase was driven by an unusually low level of incentives in the third quarter of 2015. Incentive as a percentage of gross revenues approached 19% and will tick up further in Q4 as Costco incentives kick in. 
This will bring full year client incentives as a percent of gross revenues to around 18.5%, the high end of the 17.5% to 18.5% range that we had provided you. With expense growth down 7% and a tax rate of 30.4%, our run rate EPS was $0.69 after making the 4 Visa Europe-related adjustments I described. As a reminder, there is no Visa Europe revenue, expense or income in our Q3 numbers. Had we included Visa Europe results for the 9 days we owned it in the quarter, it would have added a de minimis $12 million to our net income. 
Some Visa Europe-related consideration. The European leadership team is in place, as Charlie said, and running the business. The business is performing as expected and integration activities have commenced. The employee consultation process, which is required by law before any restructuring of operations, is under way in the U.K. The technology harmonization program has also been launched. We're moving fast to bringing Visa's global capabilities to European customers, including Visa Checkout, Visa Token Service, Visa Direct as well as our consulting resources. Significant customer relationships have already been renewed and others are in process. We believe our customers are excited by what a global Visa can offer them. 
Visa Europe members have been informed that rebates will be terminated at the end of September 2016. We are working with our customers to transition to commercial relationships with competitive client incentive programs, as we have elsewhere in the world. This will be a multi-year process, but the early results have been positive. The longer-term impact of Brexit on Visa Europe's business is too early to determine. The immediate impact has been on exchange rates. The weaker pound and euro will hurt revenues as reported in dollars. However, a significant portion of Visa Europe's expenses are currently denominated in pounds, which offsets the negative revenue impact. 
Given the relative values of the pound and the euro at this point, the net impact of Visa Europe earnings as reported in dollars is roughly neutral right now. Brexit has also introduced significant uncertainty, which is never good for business sentiment. Most economic prognosticators are expecting an economic slowdown in Europe. Beyond this, it is too early to know what the broader and longer-term implications of Brexit are for our businesses. 
Assuming exchange rates stay where they are today, and there are no major economic dislocations as a result of Brexit, we expect Visa Europe earnings to offset interest expense from debt in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 as we told you last quarter. Visa Europe is expected to add 2% to 3% to EPS accretion in fiscal year 2017, in line with the low single-digit accretion we had anticipated. 
Our accretion estimate assumes the current tax structure stays in place through fiscal year 2017. Under this structure, Visa Europe is a U.S. taxpayer. This tax structure is favorable from a cash tax standpoint. However, the current tax structure results in a higher reported or booked tax rate for Visa Europe's earnings. This will add approximately 1 percentage point to Visa's reported tax rate in fiscal year 2017. As always, we will be working on plans to improve both our cash and reported tax rates over time. 
Visa Europe has over $2 billion of cash on its balance sheet. Based on discussions with our regulator in the U.K., we will leave this cash within the Visa Europe legal entity. As a result of this action and due to the higher upfront cash consideration after we eliminated the earnout provision, we will issue additional debt later this year to fund stock buybacks to offset dilution from preferred stock issued in the transaction. Our current plan is to issue at least $2 billion in debt before the end of this calendar year. 
As we indicated, we plan to offset the dilutive impact of the preferred share issued by buying stock in excess of our normal buyback program. We have been buying stock back at a stepped-up pace for the past 2 quarters in anticipation of the closing of the transaction. We plan to continue buying at this pace until we have bought back sufficient stock to offset the impact of the shares issued. We expect that we will be done by the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. 
In the third quarter, we recognized a $1.9 billion loss related to the Visa Europe Framework Agreement. Under U.S. GAAP, as part of our accounting for the Visa Europe acquisition, we are required to assess all pre-existing contractual relationships between Visa Europe and Visa. If the terms of those agreements are determined to not be at fair value at the time of the close, a portion of the purchase price paid in the transaction is deemed to relate to the effective settlement of these arrangements between the parties. The Visa Europe Framework Agreement was established in October 2007 between Visa and Visa Europe as part of our 2007 reorganization. This agreement provides Visa Europe with a perpetual exclusive right to operate the Visa business in the European Union in exchange for a license fee paid to Visa. 
Under the terms of the Framework Agreement, the license fee paid by Visa Europe has increased modestly since 2007 however, the value of the Visa Europe business has increased at a greater rate. As such, management concluded that the terms of the Framework Agreement were not at fair value as determined under U.S. GAAP at the time of the close. We estimated the value of settling the same Framework Agreement at $1.9 billion. The size of this settlement value was driven by the fact that the agreement was perpetual in nature and would have continued indefinitely had the acquisition not occurred. 
Under U.S. GAAP, $1.9 billion of total consideration transferred to VE in the transaction is initially charged to the income statement as a onetime nonrecurring operating expense representing the cost of settling this arrangement. Had this arrangement not existed, or its terms been at fair value, this amount would've been allocated to net assets acquired. This would have resulted in $1.9 billion additional goodwill recorded in the transaction. Our third quarter balance sheet includes Visa Europe. In a few days, we'll be filing our 10-Q, which will provide considerable detail on all aspects of the accounting for the Visa Europe transaction: allocation of the purchase price to net tangible assets and liabilities and to intangible assets and goodwill as well as the impact of Visa Europe on cash and working capital balances. 
We would, of course, be happy to answer any questions you have after you review the 10-Q. Moving to our outlook for the fourth quarter and the impact of Visa Europe. We expect nominal net revenue growth in Q4 for the legacy Visa business, not including Visa Europe, of around 5% to 6%, in line with the first half trend. Q3 growth rates were depressed by unfavorable year-over-year comparisons on client incentives, which will normalize. We're also projecting a modest uptick in cross-border growth rates, as dollar spend moderates and we lap the slowdown from last year. 
Visa Europe will add 13 to 14 points to fourth quarter net revenue growth. We expect 2% to 3% expense growth for legacy Visa in Q4 from Rio-related marketing and higher technology project spend. Visa Europe will add as much as 15 to 16 points to expense growth. As I mentioned earlier, and in line with what we told you last quarter, Visa Europe income should offset debt interest expense in the fourth quarter. For the year, our key guidance metrics for legacy Visa remain largely unchanged. 
Visa Europe will add 3 to 4 points of growth to both revenue and expenses. The consultation  process is under way in Europe. We're also looking at adjustments to our global cost base as we integrate Europe. Assuming our plans are finalized, we expect to take a restructuring charge in the fourth quarter to resize our global cost structure as a result of the Visa Europe acquisition. As we've said previously, the technology integration will happen later. We will regularly update you on progress.
A quick word on fiscal year 2017. As we normally do, we will provide our comprehensive perspective on 2017 when we talk to you in late October. As we look ahead, we feel good about our business and what Visa Europe will add to it. There are, as always, tailwinds and headwinds. 
In the tailwinds column: payments volume uplift from USAA and Costco; 2 significant drags look likely to ease, gas prices and the dollar translation impact; cross-border growth could improve as dollar strength moderates; and last but not least, accretion from Visa Europe. 
In the headwinds column: continuing global uncertainty, both economic and geopolitical; the impact of Brexit on Europe; China slowdown; and market entry costs. On balance. We anticipate 2017 will be a year with healthy top and bottom line growth for Visa. 
With that, I'll turn this back to Jack."

And Jack can chime in here. Relative to what we make up of a PayPal wallet, you really have to ask PayPal that question because we know what we know and we have some general thoughts, but they really can be the ones and should be the ones. I just -- generally, what we've always thought is that roughly half the transactions that run through PayPal run through a network and we're roughly half or so of that, split between credit and debit. But those are -- I would call those gross approximations and directional. And it's -- you really need to talk to them. Relative to what happens in terms of the flows. Again, if you go through what I said, what we really are interested in doing is to ensure that Visa cards are on a level playing field. And if they're on a level playing field, we feel great about our ability to increase the amount of volume that run over Visa cards and, ultimately, benefit our clients. And so what the agreement does is it enables that to occur. And there' also a period of time where we can -- we will work actively together and exclusively to move volume from ACH back onto Visa cards, if that's what the client wants to do. And so to the extent that, that happens, net-net, that's a financial plus for us. As part of this agreement, as we've said, there are incentives that we will pay -- Visa incentives that we will pay to PayPal. And if those numbers aren't reached, then the incentives don't get paid. But the last thing I just -- I do want to say is partnership agreements work when there's alignment for everyone. And so we've had extensive conversations over a long period of time with PayPal, with our issuers and other members of the payments community. And what we've tried to do here is to come up with something that really does work for everyone. And so where we can sit here and say this is all about driving growth in the electronic payments universe. Because we're creating better customer experiences, where they're allowed to use products that they want to use, where they get all the benefits of those products are, in a seamless experience through PayPal, these products become a better alternative to cash and check and other alternatives out there. So the way we see it, we've given ourselves an opportunity to grow. We've given PayPal an opportunity to grow. And most importantly we've given, from our perspective at Visa, our clients an ability and opportunity to grow and provide a better experience for their consumers."

But I'd say the following things. I think as we go through the conversion to EMV, there are just -- there are a lot of moving pieces especially in the debit world. With terminals having to be reprogrammed, new terminals out there, multiple applications embedded on chips and things like that and merchants turning on PIN pads at different times from times when they've actually turned on the EMV reader. And so there's a lot of movement between signature and PIN, which is somewhat different than we would've seen in a steady-state environment. And that'll play itself out. And that's not a plus or minus. There's just movement there, and that's just the reality of what happens during a conversion like this. What we see is, ultimately, we just want our consumers to have the ability to use the cards. Merchants have whatever abilities that Durbin has given them. And we've -- and they've had those capabilities ever since Durbin was passed. And a big part of that is they have the ability to choose the routing preference. And so as we've seen since Durbin came into place, quarter-by-quarter, there are just a whole series of things that impact where our merchant wants to route to. People give them incentives when they -- whose incentives they think they're going to hit or not hit, help them decide where they want to route to and route away from. And so the Interlink volumes that we see, and we look at it regularly, are very volatile. And so just keep in mind that the numbers that I talked about, which have that decrease, they're 2 weeks. And so someone can make a change in the routing table, we can see a very big impact. That can also change 2 or 3 weeks from now, based upon what we do relative to incentives and things like that. And that's just -- that is the way the business works and I think that's the way Durbin -- the Durbin Amendment intended it to work."

Do you have a sense for what would lead issuers to want to take advantage of that period of exclusivity? And do you expect -- you touched on this earlier, but maybe a different way of asking the question is, do you expect that the partnership agreement's going to drive a little bit more of a shift in the mix of PayPal volumes funded by Visa products?"

But what w",376,"Yes, listen, I guess the way I'd put it is I think -- so first of all, it's completely up to the issuers on whether or not they want to proactively work with ourselves and/or PayPal. Again, we're not telling any issuer they have to do anything. But what we've heard consistently from issuers, and I certainly experienced it when I was at one, is that ACH is a really bad thing. You're disintermediated. It's a bad customer experience. They don't understand the process to dispute things. Call centers don't understand information and things like that. And so given a choice, you'd rather have a transaction run over a Visa debit or credit product rather than ACH. So I would assume that most issuers would choose to want to actively engage to try and move those transactions onto cards which, quite frankly, consumers know, love, understand and are very comfortable with how those products work. And so during this period of time, PayPal wants to work actively with us because to the extent that consumers want to do this, it's -- again, I can't speak for them, but consumer choice, that was an important part of the discussion in the press release and that's what this actually provides. So again, the way we look at just as the network, but the way we look at what we've done in this agreement is we've taken -- we've tried to work with PayPal in partnership to take away the things that discourage people from working together and take away the things that create bad customer experiences. And just -- when you do that in anything, hopefully, you wind up with a position where people actually work together. And if you don't even just get back to -- it should produce a higher level of growth coming from someplace else. And whether that comes from other networks, cash, check, any alternatives out there, we don't know. But that's what this agreement is, it's about taking those bad things out, providing a better consumer experience and then the consumers will ultimately choose what they want to use. And again, as I said, we feel very comfortable that we'll do quite well in an environment like that, as our clients will."

I just -- so I would say I honestly haven't had a chance to read what they've actually written. But I guess I'll just say a couple of things, and I think the same goes true for PSD2, which is we as a network are successful not because we offer extremely low-priced commodity services with very little value add. Is the exact opposite of that. And the ability for us to have grown the business that we've grown around the world is all about delivering value-added services, whether it's fraud protection, risk scoring, work on marketing, all those things, that's ultimately why people choose networks. And as I've said, that's something that we need to deliver both not just to issuers but, ultimately, to merchants either directly or through the acquiring community. And so to the extent that we do that, whoever we compete with -- because remember, we've competed -- as you've seen, we competed with PayPal, which has had another way of doing business here and in the physical world, we've done quite well and felt very comfortable with our ability to compete in the online world as we've developed these solutions. So for us, it's about creating that value, delivering on innovation. And I wouldn't underestimate the work that we have done at Visa on Fast Funds, push payments and things that we're doing both in developed parts of the world and emerging parts of the world. And so regardless of who buys what out there, those are activities that we had under way because there's tremendous opportunity, and I think those are the things that will allow us to compete not just with an acquisition out there, but the types of people that will be able to insert themselves into the payment flow because of PSD2."

I mean, we're clearly monitoring the impact of Brexit to see if there's any impact. It's really not evident at this point, it's minor. We'll have to keep watching it. But as far as it relates to the fourth quarter, we're not assuming any change in trend. And in terms of its specific impact on us, you see that in the guidance we provided where we told you that the revenue impact of Visa Europe on the quarter, if you go to the table we have, was 13 to 14 points of additional dollar revenue growth that would be added to our reported numbers because of Visa Europe, 3 to 4 points of additional revenue growth on a full-year basis. And as far as the income impact, we told you last quarter and we're reiterating that, that Visa Europe's income will offset the debt interest we had. So essentially, it'll make up for the debt interest in the quarter. So that's pretty much it."

We were both trying to get -- again, as I said earlier, what we both wanted to get to was a point that PayPal, ourselves and the issuers would look at it and say, it's something that makes sense for all of us to work together. And that's based upon the fact that we're providing a better experience, and the opportunities are greater than ever for consumers and merchants. So keeping -- having everyone aligned is what we were after, and that's what we think we've done here. And so we feel very good that we're in a position, as I said, where -- this is a framework where we can work happily together, hopefully, for a very long period of time because it's going to drive more growth. That's what it's all about. It does not change our Visa Checkout strategy. Here, too, I've been very consistent in saying that one of the things that we don't know is we don't know, ultimately, what experiences are going to win at the point-of-sale, either online or at the physical point-of-sale. And so given the fact that we are the global acceptance market that's recognized more than any in the world, that's something where we should have a solution that leverages that acceptance and allows consumers to pay quickly and easily and securely in a manner that they're accustomed. And that's what Visa Checkout is designed to be. But there are other payment solutions out there. We've talked about a bunch of them on this call, as is PayPal. And so what we want to do is ensure that if we're working together under principles that we're happy with, which is what we've achieved here and what we have in the other ones that we support, then we want to enable multiple experiences and, ultimately, consumers and merchants will choose which will win in the marketplace. And so we're happy with the progress that we're making in Visa Checkout. We're glad we're doing it. Ultimately, what we're going to look at for success is how Visa usage is doing in the physical point of the world, online and in mobile. Secondarily, where it's coming from. And ultimately, that'll help us make resource allocation  decisions. But we want to be the enabler. We want the volume. We're doing lots of different things, and Visa Checkout is one of those things, but it's not the only thing."

Thanks for taking the time. There's a series of topics that I'm going to discuss today. We'll talk a little bit about third quarter results, two comments about our European acquisition and talk about litigation. I'm going to make some comments about the agreement we signed with PayPal today. I have a series of business updates that I'm going to walk through and then just a few sentences on the future before I turn it over to Vasant. 
First of all, with the closing of our Visa Europe acquisition. As you can see, if you look to the numbers, the quarter is somewhat complicated but we try to be as clear as we can in explaining the results. I want to start by saying that we're pleased with our continued consistent and predictable results in the face of an unchanged economic environment and increased geopolitical risks. To that point, the consumer has remained remarkably steadfast in the face of significant global instability. 
Getting on to the results. We reported GAAP EPS of $0.17 per share and adjusted EPS of $0.69 per share. This includes several special items related to the acquisition of Visa Europe. Vasant will discuss in further detail, but we view these as nonrecurring items and are not a reflection of business performance. 
On an adjusted basis. Net operating revenue grew 3% nominally or 6% on a constant currency basis, reflecting a continued negative 3 percentage point impact from FX and in line with expectations we discussed last quarter. Our growth continues to be subdued by similar themes we have previously spoken about, such as the strength of the U.S. dollar on translation and cross-border volumes, continued low oil prices and weakness in China and oil-based economies. 
However, U.S. spend remains steady as do -- as does other domestic spend. Overall, payments volume, cross-border volume growth and process transaction growth was similar to last quarter. The following numbers do not include Europe. U.S. payments volume growth was 10%, basically unchanged from last quarter after adjusting for a leap year; international payments volume growth was 11%, down from 14% last quarter, driven almost entirely by lower domestic transactions in China that yield very little revenue; cross-border volume growth was 5%, unchanged; process transaction growth was 10%, an acceleration of 1 point due to lapping of Russia's NSPK migration. 
More recently, though, through July 14, U.S. payment volume growth was 11%. U.S. credit grew 18%, driven almost entirely by the positive impact of Costco and USAA. Debit growth, on the other hand, moderated considerably, falling from 8% in fiscal Q3 to 3% through July 14. The decline was driven primarily by Interlink. About 1/3 of the decline is due to the lapping of very high growth at one of our large issuers who added Interlink to their cards last year and the remainder is due to dynamic routing decisions. The decline due to the lapping will continue for another 3 quarters while the remainder is volatile as merchants and acquirers make routing decisions dynamically. 
Cross-border growth through July 14 is up 156%, but that's inclusive of Europe in the July 14 period. For comparability, if you include Europe in both periods through July 14, growth is 12% versus 8% in the third quarter. The increase is driven by the timing of Ramadan and improvements that we see in the U.S. and Asia. And processed transactions rose 42%, including Europe. If you include Europe in both periods, then process transactions are flat at 11%. 
Moving on to Europe. Just a couple of comments. We're very happy to have closed the acquisition on June 21. We are well into the integration process. We have a management team in place, which provides a great deal of consistency. We've developed an integrated management approach, and the teams are working extremely well together. We hosted 500 clients the week after the close in Europe where we showcased the benefits of a combined Visa to those clients. We've implemented an integrated approach to global and multi-region clients. And we're working through product and digital roadmaps ensuring Europe is appropriately prioritized within Visa. 
Regarding Brexit. Just make a couple of comments. First of all, with Brexit or without Brexit, it does not change our long-term view that the strategic rationale for putting these 2 companies together makes extraordinary sense. Also, I want to just remind people that they had a put. And in that scenario, a negotiated transaction is a far better approach than having someone exercise a put at a time which is out of your control.
Certainly, in the short-term, currency weakness and reduced economic growth are factors. We haven't seen much impact yet, but time will tell. We still feel good about our ability to deliver the accretion that we discussed, and Vasant will review that in more detail in his comments. 
Let me quickly touch on legal matters now. The recent decision by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals to reverse the approval of our multi-district litigation class settlement is certainly disappointing. These cases were originally filed in 2005, and we continue to believe that the settlement was fair and reasonable for all stakeholders. However, the appeals court found that there were conflicts of interest between the 2 merchant settlement classes, a class that would have received money for alleged past damages and a class that would receive the benefit of certain changes to our network rules going forward. 
The court concluded that the conflict of interest between these classes meant that the classes were inadequately represented for purposes of settlement. It will take some time for the impact of this ruling to be determined and there may be further appeals. Meanwhile, Visa continues to honor the terms of the class settlement agreement, which remains in effect and did not terminate automatically because of the court's ruling. So for example, Visa has not reversed its rule change permitting U.S. merchants to surcharge credit transactions. And the funds that Visa paid pursuant to the class settlement remain in court-supervised escrow accounts. 
If the Court of Appeals decision remains after any further appeals, the matter will resume in the lower federal court, where we will defend the case and, in time, likely make a renewed effort to settle with the merchant classes. It is too early to speculate what shape that might take. However, I note that the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan continues to provide protection against monetary claims in the class litigation. 
As you know, a number of merchants have opted out of the class and filed their own complaints and are continuing to defend those claims, which have not yet already been settled. The District Court has set a status conference on August 11, where we hope to obtain further clarity about next steps in both the class action and the opt-out cases. But this will likely go on for some time. 
Finally, I should note that all the individual settlements we've entered into with opt-out merchants remain in effect despite the court's ruling and regardless of the direction of any further appeals. The only exception is our settlement with Walmart, which was contingent upon the class settlement being affirmed. Its status will be determined after we have a final nonappealable decision in the class settlement.
We move on to talk about PayPal now. Earlier, we announced a new strategic partnership with PayPal. The partnership will result in significantly improved payment experiences for Visa cardholders in the PayPal and Venmo wallets. The partnership is designed to deliver significant benefits for Visa's issuing national institutions, including a significantly better experience for their customers, more spending volume on their credit and debit cards, lower operational costs and improved security. Merchants will also benefit from improved customer experiences, efficiency and security, which together should help drive increased sales. 
The details include the following. First of all, enhanced consumer choice and improved experience for Visa cardholders. PayPal will make it easier for new and existing customers to choose to pay with their Visa cards and ensure a more seamless experience. Visa cards will be presented as a clear and equal payment option during enrollment and subsequent payments with an easy ability for consumers to set as their preferred payment method. Visa digital card images will be incorporated into payment flows. PayPal will not encourage Visa cardholders to link to a bank account via ACH. PayPal will also support and work with issuers to identify consumers who choose to migrate existing ACH payment flows to their Visa cards. 
Consumers will also be able to instantly withdraw and move money from their PayPal and Venmo accounts to their bank account via their Visa debit cards, leveraging Visa Direct, providing experience that offers speed, security and convenience. An important aspect of our agreement is enhanced data quality. PayPal will ensure that the data provided to issuers and their cardholders for Visa-funded transactions will be consistent with the information that is received with traditional Visa card transactions. This will ensure better consumer experience, reduced cardholder confusion, ensure proper application of rewards and reduce costly and time-consuming disputes.
PayPal will join the Visa Digital Enablement Program, what we refer to as VDEP, to enable them to expand their point-of-sale acceptance. This is a commercial framework for Visa partners to access our token services and other digital capabilities in the United States. Consistent with VDEP, issuers will be able to choose whether to participate or not. The agreement affords PayPal certain economic incentives, including Visa incentives for increased volume and greater long-term Visa fee certainty. 
Importantly, Visa issuers will have a 12-month period of exclusivity for promoting their cards that are within PayPal's wallets. The partnership puts PayPal and Visa on a new, constructive path forward and provides a framework for our companies to work together collaboratively. A couple of notes about some client activity. We're pleased to announce that we renewed a multiyear agreement with TD in the United States and Canada for continued Visa credit and debit issuance. Regions Bank, a long time Visa client, renewed a multi-year credit and debt agreement. Chevron, one of the world's leading energy companies renewed a multiyear credit co-brand with Visa. And as I'm sure you know, on June 20, Visa credit cards became exclusively accepted at Costco U.S. and Puerto Rico warehouse locations and fuel stations, and the new Costco Anywhere Visa Card by Citi launched.
This has been a long and complex process but we're very encouraged by the results so far. And outside of North America, Homeplus, the second-largest retailer in South Korea with branch and home delivery services, we did a multi-year co-brand program across multiple issuers supporting payWave. In Taiwan, we renewed a multiyear credit co-brand agreement with Taishin Bank, one of the largest co-brand programs in the market. And in Indonesia, we renewed a multi-year debit agreement with Mandiri who is the largest state-owned bank in the country.
Moving on to EMV in the U.S. Nine months out from the official kick-off to chip in the U.S., we continue on the journey of moving from magstripe to chip, and the U.S. is now the largest chip market in the world. More than 326 million Visa chip cards were issued as of June 2016, making the U.S., as I said, the largest in the world and larger than the U.K. and Brazil combined. 58% of credit cards and 37% of debit cards have a chip on them today. 
More than 1.3 million merchants now have chip-enabled terminals or roughly 28% of all merchant locations. Based on client surveys, we expect 75% of credit cards, 55% of debit cards, representing 96% and 73% of volume, respectively, and roughly 45% to 50% of merchant locations will be enabled with EMV by the end of calendar 2016. 
Having said all of this, this is a huge effort and we're doing a series of things to help make this process move more quickly and more smoothly. To that end, Visa announced a series of initiatives to help accelerate EMV chip migration for merchants. We streamlined our testing requirements. We amended and simplified the terminal certification process. We committed to investing further resources and technical expertise in a manner that reduce time frames by as much as 50%. We're also making policy changes to help limit exposure to counterfeit fraud liability for merchants who are not yet chip ready. We want to say a few things about our relationship with U.S. merchants. We continue to invest in people, products and solutions, to help our merchant clients grow their business and reduce their costs. 
We've made good progress on this front with many of our merchant clients, though it's early days, and this is a long-term commitment on our part. You have read surely about some of the disputes we have with some merchants. We're committed to doing everything reasonable to resolve these issues and we're committed to continue strengthening our relationship with all merchants.
As we continue to expand Visa Checkout around the world, we're constantly working to perfect the user experience and to deliver on our promise to make paying with Visa in the digital world as easy as it's been to pay in the physical world for more than 50 years. We rolled out the new Visa Checkout experience to all of our merchants globally. Working with dozens of our top U.S. merchants, we updated the Checkout experience to simplify the sign-up process for consumers to enroll, add cards and manage their information with more fluid interactions and smart auto-fill capabilities. 
We also begun to roll out an interactive checkout button, allowing customers to enter their password right in to the checkout button and confirm checkout with a single tap. Most of these features will be automatically available, which means merchants do not have to make any adjustments to their existing online checkout processes or payment systems. As we head into the Rio Olympics, we used the global sponsorship platform to highlight Visa Checkout and its merchants, including Best Buy and United Airlines, with whom we've created Olympic themed ads that you'll likely see on TV in the U.S. in the coming weeks.
As we continue to look forward and drive new technologies in the payment space, as you know, we opened an innovation center in our San Francisco headquarters, which has served as a destination for clients, partners and developers to see our new payments technologies and work alongside us and our experts, and jointly create the next generation of payment and commerce applications. We've had great success and we committed to expand the number of facilities so we can be close to our clients. 
To that end, in April, we opened our Singapore innovation center. In May, we opened one in Dubai; and in June, we opened one in Miami, all of which will serve our clients, partners and developers in that region and act as a hub to jointly create the next generation of payment commerce applications. Accessible to both local and global clients, all these innovation centers will provide our partners with access to Visa APIs and software development kits available through our Visa developer platform. We also have an innovation center in London and have plans to open others in 2017. We announced yesterday that we'll be opening a new facility in Palo Alto later this year. The office will house work that we do around data, business intelligence, technology research and merchant solutions. We decided to open this facility following on the great success that we've seen with our San Francisco and Bangalore facilities. We found that the combination of location, physical design and coworker colocation concentration are critical in our quest to continue to lead and innovate. All of these new locations provide opportunities to draw talent from the communities that have concentrations of skills different from each other and allows Visa to benefit from the diversity of people and ideas in these very different communities. 
We announce a new $5 billion share repurchase program. This brings the total available for share repurchases to $7.3 billion. This is a reflection of our confidence in our business, our commitment to offset the dilution from the preferred stock issued to Visa Europe members and our continuing commitment to return excess capital to shareholders. 
Before I turn the call over to Vasant, just a few words about the future. You can see that we provided full year guidance on a GAAP and an adjusted GAAP basis as required. And we've tried to give you a clear indication of the impact of Europe in the fourth quarter. On an adjusted basis and without the impact of Europe, we reaffirmed all of our 2016 guidance metrics. You will hear from Vasant, but we're still confident in our ability to achieve the accretion from the European transaction we shared at the time of the announcement. 
Looking ahead, we expect next quarter's results to improve modestly, similar to first half of the year's results. We'll provide more commentary on 2017 in October. But our underlying business is strong and with the lapping effect of several items, based on what we know today and assuming similar consumer spending patterns, we feel good about our ability to produce stronger revenue and earnings growth. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Vasant"
38043467,371688513,1011057,"Visa Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2016",2016-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Visa Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Charlie. In a world that's turbulent both from a macroeconomic and a geopolitical standpoint, our business remained steady and resilient. A few points to note. Net revenues grew 6% in constant dollars and 3% in nominal dollars at the high end o",2239,"Thank you, Charlie. In a world that's turbulent both from a macroeconomic and a geopolitical standpoint, our business remained steady and resilient. A few points to note. Net revenues grew 6% in constant dollars and 3% in nominal dollars at the high end of the range we had given you. Key business trends, payment volumes, processed transactions and cross-border transactions remained stable. Currency volatility stayed high, especially post the Brexit vote. As expected, client incentives are almost 19% of gross revenue. 
Once again, we had good expense management. Expenses declined 7% in the quarter on an adjusted basis and are flat year-to-date versus 2015. Lower personnel and marketing costs contributed to lower-than-projected expenses in the quarter. Non-GAAP EPS in Q3 was $0.69, after you adjust for our GAAP EPS of $0.17 for 4 significant Visa Europe-related nonrecurring items. 
First, a $1.9 billion loss related to the settlement of the Visa Europe Framework Agreement as part of our acquisition of Visa Europe. Second, a $92 million staff duty paid to the U.K. treasury recorded in general and administrative expenses. Third, $60 million in transaction-related expenses recorded in professional fees. Fourth, a net gain of $103 million as we accumulated euros, leading up to the closing of the transaction, which is recorded in nonoperating income. 
You might recall we had a similar gain of $116 million last quarter, which we also excluded from our reported EPS as a non-GAAP adjustment. Now a quick review of the quarter's business drivers. Global payments volume in constant dollars grew 10%, roughly in line with the prior quarter when you adjust for the leap day. U.S. payments volume picked up modestly, adjusting for the leap day, as we start to benefit from USAA and Costco conversions, which helps credit growth to exceed debit growth in the U.S. 
International payment volume growth of 11% ticked down modestly. The strong dollar continued to weigh on international payment volumes, nominal growth was 5%. Despite Brexit and oil price collapse, commodity market weakness, a slowdown in China, terrorism and other destabilizing forces, payment volumes have remained stable for most of this year. Cross-border volumes grew 5% in constant dollars, a modest step-up from a leap day-adjusted second quarter. 
As the strengthening trend in the dollar has moderated, we have seen a reduction in the rate of decline in our large U.S. acquired business and in outbound commerce from Canada. However, this improvement is largely offset by a continuing slowdown of outbound commerce from China, down from 50% growth rates in Q3 last year to barely positive right now. Cross-border commerce from oil and commodity-based economies remained sluggish. 
Processed transactions totaled $19.8 billion in the quarter, up 10%. U.S. growth was 11% and international growth was 7%. As expected, international processed transaction growth rates are stepping up as we lap the transfer of domestic processing to NSPK in Russia. As you know, these numbers are not inclusive of Visa Europe. In our operational package this quarter, we have included a schedule that provides you with a 5-quarter history of the European geographies' payment volume and transaction statistics. 
If we add these to our Q3 metrics, both to this year and last, constant dollar global payment volume growth would be 9%, cross-border volume constant growth calculated based on merchant currencies -- merchant country currencies would be 8% and process transaction growth would be 11%. Of course, starting next quarter, we will incorporate Europe as a new region in our operational performance data package. 
Moving on to our financial metrics. Service revenues grew 6%, roughly in line with nominal payments volume growth. The reduction in the growth rate from the last quarter was anticipated as we lapped pricing increases from last year. Data processing revenue grew 10%, in line with process transaction growth. International revenues grew 4%, generally in line with volume growth as we lap our price increases and the drag of the strong dollar moderates. 
Fortunately, currency volatility stayed high and comparable to the highs reached last year. Post the Brexit vote, volatilities reached levels we have not experienced in recent years. Incentives were in line with our expectations. As we indicated, the significant year-over-year increase was driven by an unusually low level of incentives in the third quarter of 2015. Incentive as a percentage of gross revenues approached 19% and will tick up further in Q4 as Costco incentives kick in. 
This will bring full year client incentives as a percent of gross revenues to around 18.5%, the high end of the 17.5% to 18.5% range that we had provided you. With expense growth down 7% and a tax rate of 30.4%, our run rate EPS was $0.69 after making the 4 Visa Europe-related adjustments I described. As a reminder, there is no Visa Europe revenue, expense or income in our Q3 numbers. Had we included Visa Europe results for the 9 days we owned it in the quarter, it would have added a de minimis $12 million to our net income. 
Some Visa Europe-related consideration. The European leadership team is in place, as Charlie said, and running the business. The business is performing as expected and integration activities have commenced. The employee consultation process, which is required by law before any restructuring of operations, is under way in the U.K. The technology harmonization program has also been launched. We're moving fast to bringing Visa's global capabilities to European customers, including Visa Checkout, Visa Token Service, Visa Direct as well as our consulting resources. Significant customer relationships have already been renewed and others are in process. We believe our customers are excited by what a global Visa can offer them. 
Visa Europe members have been informed that rebates will be terminated at the end of September 2016. We are working with our customers to transition to commercial relationships with competitive client incentive programs, as we have elsewhere in the world. This will be a multi-year process, but the early results have been positive. The longer-term impact of Brexit on Visa Europe's business is too early to determine. The immediate impact has been on exchange rates. The weaker pound and euro will hurt revenues as reported in dollars. However, a significant portion of Visa Europe's expenses are currently denominated in pounds, which offsets the negative revenue impact. 
Given the relative values of the pound and the euro at this point, the net impact of Visa Europe earnings as reported in dollars is roughly neutral right now. Brexit has also introduced significant uncertainty, which is never good for business sentiment. Most economic prognosticators are expecting an economic slowdown in Europe. Beyond this, it is too early to know what the broader and longer-term implications of Brexit are for our businesses. 
Assuming exchange rates stay where they are today, and there are no major economic dislocations as a result of Brexit, we expect Visa Europe earnings to offset interest expense from debt in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 as we told you last quarter. Visa Europe is expected to add 2% to 3% to EPS accretion in fiscal year 2017, in line with the low single-digit accretion we had anticipated. 
Our accretion estimate assumes the current tax structure stays in place through fiscal year 2017. Under this structure, Visa Europe is a U.S. taxpayer. This tax structure is favorable from a cash tax standpoint. However, the current tax structure results in a higher reported or booked tax rate for Visa Europe's earnings. This will add approximately 1 percentage point to Visa's reported tax rate in fiscal year 2017. As always, we will be working on plans to improve both our cash and reported tax rates over time. 
Visa Europe has over $2 billion of cash on its balance sheet. Based on discussions with our regulator in the U.K., we will leave this cash within the Visa Europe legal entity. As a result of this action and due to the higher upfront cash consideration after we eliminated the earn-out provision, we will issue additional debt later this year to fund stock buybacks to offset dilution from preferred stock issued in the transaction. Our current plan is to issue at least $2 billion in debt before the end of this calendar year. 
As we indicated, we plan to offset the dilutive impact of the preferred share issued by buying stock in excess of our normal buyback program. We have been buying stock back at a stepped-up pace for the past 2 quarters in anticipation of the closing of the transaction. We plan to continue buying at this pace until we have bought back sufficient stock to offset the impact of the shares issued. We expect that we will be done by the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. 
In the third quarter, we recognized a $1.9 billion loss related to the Visa Europe Framework Agreement. Under U.S. GAAP, as part of our accounting for the Visa Europe acquisition, we are required to assess all pre-existing contractual relationships between Visa Europe and Visa. If the terms of those agreements are determined to not be at fair value at the time of the close, a portion of the purchase price paid in the transaction is deemed to relate to the effective settlement of these arrangements between the parties. The Visa Europe Framework Agreement was established in October 2007 between Visa and Visa Europe as part of our 2007 reorganization. This agreement provides Visa Europe with a perpetual exclusive right to operate the Visa business in the European Union in exchange for a license fee paid to Visa. 
Under the terms of the Framework Agreement, the license fee paid by Visa Europe has increased modestly since 2007 however, the value of the Visa Europe business has increased at a greater rate. As such, management concluded that the terms of the Framework Agreement were not at fair value as determined under U.S. GAAP at the time of the close. We estimated the value of settling the same Framework Agreement at $1.9 billion. The size of this settlement value was driven by the fact that the agreement was perpetual in nature and would have continued indefinitely had the acquisition not occurred. 
Under U.S. GAAP, $1.9 billion of total consideration transferred to VE in the transaction is initially charged to the income statement as a onetime nonrecurring operating expense representing the cost of settling this arrangement. Had this arrangement not existed, or its terms been at fair value, this amount would've been allocated to net assets acquired. This would have resulted in $1.9 billion additional goodwill recorded in the transaction. Our third quarter balance sheet includes Visa Europe. In a few days, we'll be filing our 10-Q, which will provide considerable detail on all aspects of the accounting for the Visa Europe transaction: allocation of the purchase price to net tangible assets and liabilities and to intangible assets and goodwill as well as the impact of Visa Europe on cash and working capital balances. 
We would, of course, be happy to answer any questions you have after you review the 10-Q. Moving to our outlook for the fourth quarter and the impact of Visa Europe. We expect nominal net revenue growth in Q4 for the legacy Visa business, not including Visa Europe, of around 5% to 6%, in line with the first half trend. Q3 growth rates were depressed by unfavorable year-over-year comparisons on client incentives, which will normalize. We're also projecting a modest uptick in cross-border growth rates, as dollar spend moderates and we lap the slowdown from last year. 
Visa Europe will add 13 to 14 points to fourth quarter net revenue growth. We expect 2% to 3% expense growth for legacy Visa in Q4 from Rio-related marketing and higher technology project spend. Visa Europe will add as much as 15 to 16 points to expense growth. As I mentioned earlier, and in line with what we told you last quarter, Visa Europe income should offset debt interest expense in the fourth quarter. For the year, our key guidance metrics for legacy Visa remain largely unchanged. 
Visa Europe will add 3 to 4 points of growth to both revenue and expenses. The consultation  process is under way in Europe. We're also looking at adjustments to our global cost base as we integrate Europe. Assuming our plans are finalized, we expect to take a restructuring charge in the fourth quarter to resize our global cost structure as a result of the Visa Europe acquisition. As we've said previously, the technology integration will happen later. We will regularly update you on progress.
A quick word on fiscal year 2017. As we normally do, we will provide our comprehensive perspective on 2017 when we talk to you in late October. As we look ahead, we feel good about our business and what Visa Europe will add to it. There are, as always, tailwinds and headwinds. 
In the tailwinds column: payments volume uplift from USAA and Costco; 2 significant drags look likely to ease, gas prices and the dollar translation impact; cross-border growth could improve as dollar strength moderates; and last but not least, accretion from Visa Europe. 
In the headwinds column: continuing global uncertainty, both economic and geopolitical; the impact of Brexit on Europe; China slowdown; and market entry costs. On balance, we anticipate 2017 will be a year with healthy top and bottom line growth for Visa. 
With that, I'll turn this back to Jack."

And Jack can chime in here. Relative to what we make up of a PayPal wallet, you really have to ask PayPal that question because we know what we know and we have some general thoughts, but they really can be the ones and should be the ones. I just -- generally, what we've always thought is that roughly half the transactions that run through PayPal run through a network and we're roughly half or so of that, split between credit and debit. But those are -- I would call those gross approximations and directional. And it's -- you really need to talk to them. Relative to what happens in terms of the flows. Again, if you go through what I said, what we really are interested in doing is to ensure that Visa cards are on a level playing field. And if they're on a level playing field, we feel great about our ability to increase the amount of volume that run over Visa cards and, ultimately, benefit our clients. And so what the agreement does is it enables that to occur. And there' also a period of time where we can -- we will work actively together and exclusively to move volume from ACH back onto Visa cards, if that's what the client wants to do. And so to the extent that, that happens, net-net, that's a financial plus for us. As part of this agreement, as we've said, there are incentives that we will pay -- Visa incentives that we will pay to PayPal. And if those numbers aren't reached, then the incentives don't get paid. But the last thing I just -- I do want to say is partnership agreements work when there's alignment for everyone. And so we've had extensive conversations over a long period of time with PayPal, with our issuers and other members of the payments community. And what we've tried to do here is to come up with something that really does work for everyone. And so where we can sit here and say this is all about driving growth in the electronic payments universe. Because we're creating better customer experiences, where they're allowed to use products that they want to use, where they get all the benefits of those products are, in a seamless experience through PayPal, these products become a better alternative to cash and check and other alternatives out there. So the way we see it, we've given ourselves an opportunity to grow. We've given PayPal an opportunity to grow. And most importantly we've given, from our perspective at Visa, our clients an ability and opportunity to grow and provide a better experience for their consumers."

But I'd say the following things. I think as we go through the conversion to EMV, there are just -- there are a lot of moving pieces especially in the debit world. With terminals having to be reprogrammed, new terminals out there, multiple applications embedded on chips and things like that and merchants turning on PIN pads at different times from times when they've actually turned on the EMV reader. And so there's a lot of movement between signature and PIN, which is somewhat different than we would've seen in a steady-state environment. And that'll play itself out. And that's not a plus or minus. There's just movement there, and that's just the reality of what happens during a conversion like this. What we see is, ultimately, we just want our consumers to have the ability to use the cards. Merchants have whatever abilities that Durbin has given them. And we've -- and they've had those capabilities ever since Durbin was passed. And a big part of that is they have the ability to choose the routing preference. And so as we've seen since Durbin came into place, quarter-by-quarter, there are just a whole series of things that impact where our merchant wants to route to. People give them incentives when they -- whose incentives they think they're going to hit or not hit, help them decide where they want to route to and route away from. And so the Interlink volumes that we see, and we look at it regularly, are very volatile. And so just keep in mind that the numbers that I talked about, which have that decrease, they're 2 weeks. And so someone can make a change in the routing table, we can see a very big impact. That can also change 2 or 3 weeks from now, based upon what we do relative to incentives and things like that. And that's just -- that is the way the business works and I think that's the way Durbin -- the Durbin Amendment intended it to work."

Again, we're not telling any issuer they have to do anything. But what we've heard consistently from issuers, and I certainly experienced it when I was at one, is that ACH is a really bad thing. You're disintermediated. It's a bad customer experience. They don't understand the process to dispute things. Call centers don't understand information and things like that. And so given a choice, you'd rather have a transaction run over a Visa debit or credit product rather than ACH. So I would assume that most issuers would choose to want to actively engage to try and move those transactions onto cards which, quite frankly, consumers know, love, understand and are very comfortable with how those products work. And so during this period of time, PayPal wants to work actively with us because to the extent that consumers want to do this, it's -- again, I can't speak for them, but consumer choice, is an important part of the discussion in the press release and that's what this actually provides. So again, the way we look at just as the network, but the way we look at what we've done in this agreement is we've taken -- we've tried to work with PayPal in partnership to take away the things that discourage people from working together and take away the things that create bad customer experiences. And just -- when you do that in anything, hopefully, you wind up with a position where people actually work together. And if you don't even just get back to -- it should produce a higher level of growth coming from someplace else. And whether that comes from other networks, cash, check, any alternatives out there, we don't know. But that's what this agreement is, it's about taking those bad things out, providing a better consumer experience and then the consumers will ultimately choose what they want to use. And again, as I said, we feel very comfortable that we'll do quite well in an environment like that, as our clients will."

I just -- so I would say I honestly haven't had a chance to read what they've actually written. But I guess I'll just say a couple of things, and I think the same goes true for PSD2, which is we as a network are successful not because we offer extremely low-priced commodity services with very little value add. It's the exact opposite of that. And the ability for us to have grown the business that we've grown around the world is all about delivering value-added services, whether it's fraud protection, risk scoring, work on marketing, all those things, that's ultimately why people choose networks. And as I've said, that's something that we need to deliver both not just to issuers but, ultimately, to merchants either directly or through the acquiring community. And so to the extent that we do that, whoever we compete with -- because remember, we've competed -- as you've seen, we competed with PayPal, which has had another way of doing business here and in the physical world, we've done quite well and felt very comfortable with our ability to compete in the online world as we've developed these solutions. So for us, it's about creating that value, delivering on innovation. And I wouldn't underestimate the work that we have done at Visa on Fast Funds, push payments and things that we're doing both in developed parts of the world and emerging parts of the world. And so regardless of who buys what out there, those are activities that we had under way because there's tremendous opportunity, and I think those are the things that will allow us to compete not just with an acquisition out there, but the types of people that will be able to insert themselves into the payment flow because of PSD2."

But as far as it relates to the fourth quarter, we're not assuming any change in trend. And in terms of its specific impact on us, you see that in the guidance we provided where we told you that the revenue impact of Visa Europe on the quarter, if you go to the table we have, was 13 to 14 points of additional dollar revenue growth that would be added to our reported numbers because of Visa Europe, 3 to 4 points of additional revenue growth on a full-year basis. And as far as the income impact, we told you last quarter and we're reiterating that, that Visa Europe's income will offset the debt interest we had. So essentially, it'll make up for the debt interest in the quarter. So that's pretty much it."

We feel like we've addressed everything that we wanted to address. And it was a great conversation. We were both trying to get -- again, as I said earlier, what we both wanted to get to was a point that PayPal, ourselves and the issuers would look at it and say, it's something that makes sense for all of us to work together. And that's based upon the fact that we're providing a better experience, and the opportunities are greater than ever for consumers and merchants. So keeping -- having everyone aligned is what we were after, and that's what we think we've done here. And so we feel very good that we're in a position, as I said, where -- this is a framework where we can work happily together, hopefully, for a very long period of time because it's going to drive more growth. That's what it's all about. It does not change our Visa Checkout strategy. Here, too, I've been very consistent in saying that one of the things that we don't know is we don't know, ultimately, what experiences are going to win at the point-of-sale, either online or at the physical point-of-sale. And so given the fact that we are the global acceptance market that's recognized more than any in the world, that's something where we should have a solution that leverages that acceptance and allows consumers to pay quickly and easily and securely in a manner that they're accustomed. And that's what Visa Checkout is designed to be. But there are other payment solutions out there. We've talked about a bunch of them on this call, as is PayPal. And so what we want to do is ensure that if we're working together under principles that we're happy with, which is what we've achieved here and what we have in the other ones that we support, then we want to enable multiple experiences and, ultimately, consumers and merchants will choose which will win in the marketplace. And so we're happy with the progress that we're making in Visa Checkout. We're glad we're doing it. Ultimately, what we're going to look at for success is how Visa usage is doing in the physical point of world, online and in mobile. Secondarily, where it's coming from. And ultimately, that'll help us make resource allocation decisions. But we want to be the enabler. We want the volume. We're doing lots of different things, and Visa Checkout is one of those things, but it's not the only thing."

Thanks for taking the time. There's a series of topics that I'm going to discuss today. We'll talk a little bit about third quarter results, two comments about our European acquisition and talk about litigation. I'm going to make some comments about the agreement we signed with PayPal today. I have a series of business updates that I'm going to walk through and then just a few sentences on the future before I turn it over to Vasant. 
First of all, with the closing of our Visa Europe acquisition. As you can see, if you look to the numbers, the quarter is somewhat complicated but we try to be as clear as we can in explaining the results. I want to start by saying that we're pleased with our continued consistent and predictable results in the face of an unchanged economic environment and increased geopolitical risks. To that point, the consumer has remained remarkably steadfast in the face of significant global instability. 
Getting on to the results. We reported GAAP EPS of $0.17 per share and adjusted EPS of $0.69 per share. This includes several special items related to the acquisition of Visa Europe. Vasant will discuss in further detail, but we view these as nonrecurring items and are not a reflection of business performance. 
On an adjusted basis. Net operating revenue grew 3% nominally or 6% on a constant currency basis, reflecting a continued negative 3 percentage point impact from FX and in line with expectations we discussed last quarter. Our growth continues to be subdued by similar themes we have previously spoken about, such as the strength of the U.S. dollar on translation and cross-border volumes, continued low oil prices and weakness in China and oil-based economies. 
However, U.S. spend remains steady as do -- as does other domestic spend. Overall, payments volume, cross-border volume growth and process transaction growth was similar to last quarter. The following numbers do not include Europe. U.S. payments volume growth was 10%, basically unchanged from last quarter after adjusting for a leap year; international payments volume growth was 11%, down from 14% last quarter, driven almost entirely by lower domestic transactions in China that yield very little revenue; cross-border volume growth was 5%, unchanged; process transaction growth was 10%, an acceleration of 1 point due to lapping of Russia's NSPK migration. 
More recently, though, through July 14, U.S. payment volume growth was 11%. U.S. credit grew 18%, driven almost entirely by the positive impact of Costco and USAA. Debit growth, on the other hand, moderated considerably, falling from 8% in fiscal Q3 to 3% through July 14. The decline was driven primarily by Interlink. About 1/3 of the decline is due to the lapping of very high growth at one of our large issuers who added Interlink to their cards last year and the remainder is due to dynamic routing decisions. The decline due to the lapping will continue for another 3 quarters while the remainder is volatile as merchants and acquirers make routing decisions dynamically. 
Cross-border growth through July 14 is up 156%, but that's inclusive of Europe in the July 14 period. For comparability, if you include Europe in both periods through July 14, growth is 12% versus 8% in the third quarter. The increase is driven by the timing of Ramadan and improvements that we see in the U.S. and Asia. And processed transactions rose 42%, including Europe. If you include Europe in both periods, then process transactions are flat at 11%. 
Moving on to Europe. Just a couple of comments. We're very happy to have closed the acquisition on June 21. We are well into the integration process. We have a management team in place, which provides a great deal of consistency. We've developed an integrated management approach, and the teams are working extremely well together. We hosted 500 clients the week after the close in Europe where we showcased the benefits of a combined Visa to those clients. We've implemented an integrated approach to global and multi-region clients. And we're working through product and digital roadmaps ensuring Europe is appropriately prioritized within Visa. 
Regarding Brexit. Just make a couple of comments. First of all, with Brexit or without Brexit, it does not change our long-term view that the strategic rationale for putting these 2 companies together makes extraordinary sense. Also, I want to just remind people that they had a put. And in that scenario, a negotiated transaction is a far better approach than having someone exercise a put at a time which is out of your control.
Certainly, in the short-term, currency weakness and reduced economic growth are factors. We haven't seen much impact yet, but time will tell. We still feel good about our ability to deliver the accretion that we discussed, and Vasant will review that in more detail in his comments. 
Let me quickly touch on legal matters now. The recent decision by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals to reverse the approval of our multi-district litigation class settlement is certainly disappointing. These cases were originally filed in 2005, and we continue to believe that the settlement was fair and reasonable for all stakeholders. However, the appeals court found that there were conflicts of interest between the 2 merchant settlement classes, a class that would have received money for alleged past damages and a class that would receive the benefit of certain changes to our network rules going forward. 
The court concluded that the conflict of interest between these classes meant that the classes were inadequately represented for purposes of settlement. It will take some time for the impact of this ruling to be determined and there may be further appeals. Meanwhile, Visa continues to honor the terms of the class settlement agreement, which remains in effect and did not terminate automatically because of the court's ruling. So for example, Visa has not reversed its rule change permitting U.S. merchants to surcharge credit transactions. And the funds that Visa paid pursuant to the class settlement remain in court-supervised escrow accounts. 
If the Court of Appeals decision remains after any further appeals, the matter will resume in the lower federal court, where we will defend the case and, in time, likely make a renewed effort to settle with the merchant classes. It is too early to speculate what shape that might take. However, I note that the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan continues to provide protection against monetary claims in the class litigation. 
As you know, a number of merchants have opted out of the class and filed their own complaints and are continuing to defend those claims, which have not yet already been settled. The District Court has set a status conference on August 11, where we hope to obtain further clarity about next steps in both the class action and the opt-out cases. But this will likely go on for some time. 
Finally, I should note that all the individual settlements we've entered into with opt-out merchants remain in effect despite the court's ruling and regardless of the direction of any further appeals. The only exception is our settlement with Walmart, which was contingent upon the class settlement being affirmed. Its status will be determined after we have a final nonappealable decision in the class settlement.
We move on to talk about PayPal now. Earlier, we announced a new strategic partnership with PayPal. The partnership will result in significantly improved payment experiences for Visa cardholders in the PayPal and Venmo wallets. The partnership is designed to deliver significant benefits for Visa's issuing national institutions, including a significantly better experience for their customers, more spending volume on their credit and debit cards, lower operational costs and improved security. Merchants will also benefit from improved customer experiences, efficiency and security, which together should help drive increased sales. 
The details include the following. First of all, enhanced consumer choice and improved experience for Visa cardholders. PayPal will make it easier for new and existing customers to choose to pay with their Visa cards and ensure a more seamless experience. Visa cards will be presented as a clear and equal payment option during enrollment and subsequent payments with an easy ability for consumers to set as their preferred payment method. Visa digital card images will be incorporated into payment flows. PayPal will not encourage Visa cardholders to link to a bank account via ACH. PayPal will also support and work with issuers to identify consumers who choose to migrate existing ACH payment flows to their Visa cards. 
Consumers will also be able to instantly withdraw and move money from their PayPal and Venmo accounts to their bank account via their Visa debit cards, leveraging Visa Direct, providing experience that offers speed, security and convenience. An important aspect of our agreement is enhanced data quality. PayPal will ensure that the data provided to issuers and their cardholders for Visa-funded transactions will be consistent with the information that is received with traditional Visa card transactions. This will ensure better consumer experience, reduced cardholder confusion, ensure proper application of rewards and reduce costly and time-consuming disputes.
PayPal will join the Visa Digital Enablement Program, what we refer to as VDEP, to enable them to expand their point-of-sale acceptance. This is a commercial framework for Visa partners to access our token services and other digital capabilities in the United States. Consistent with VDEP, issuers will be able to choose whether to participate or not. The agreement affords PayPal certain economic incentives, including Visa incentives for increased volume and greater long-term Visa fee certainty. 
Importantly, Visa issuers will have a 12-month period of exclusivity for promoting their cards that are within PayPal's wallets. The partnership puts PayPal and Visa on a new, constructive path forward and provides a framework for our companies to work together collaboratively. A couple of notes about some client activity. We're pleased to announce that we renewed a multiyear agreement with TD in the United States and Canada for continued Visa credit and debit issuance. Regions Bank, a long time Visa client, renewed a multi-year credit and debt agreement. Chevron, one of the world's leading energy companies renewed a multiyear credit co-brand with Visa. And as I'm sure you know, on June 20, Visa credit cards became exclusively accepted at Costco U.S. and Puerto Rico warehouse locations and fuel stations, and the new Costco Anywhere Visa Card by Citi launched.
This has been a long and complex process but we're very encouraged by the results so far. And outside of North America, Homeplus, the second-largest retailer in South Korea with branch and home delivery services, we did a multi-year co-brand program across multiple issuers supporting payWave. In Taiwan, we renewed a multiyear credit co-brand agreement with Taishin Bank, one of the largest co-brand programs in the market. And in Indonesia, we renewed a multi-year debit agreement with Mandiri who is the largest state-owned bank in the country.
Moving on to EMV in the U.S. Nine months out from the official kick-off to chip in the U.S., we continue on the journey of moving from magstripe to chip, and the U.S. is now the largest chip market in the world. More than 326 million Visa chip cards were issued as of June 2016, making the U.S., as I said, the largest in the world and larger than the U.K. and Brazil combined. 58% of credit cards and 37% of debit cards have a chip on them today. 
More than 1.3 million merchants now have chip-enabled terminals or roughly 28% of all merchant locations. Based on client surveys, we expect 75% of credit cards, 55% of debit cards, representing 96% and 73% of volume, respectively, and roughly 45% to 50% of merchant locations will be enabled with EMV by the end of calendar 2016. 
Having said all of this, this is a huge effort and we're doing a series of things to help make this process move more quickly and more smoothly. To that end, Visa announced a series of initiatives to help accelerate EMV chip migration for merchants. We streamlined our testing requirements. We amended and simplified the terminal certification process. We committed to investing further resources and technical expertise in a manner that reduce time frames by as much as 50%. We're also making policy changes to help limit exposure to counterfeit fraud liability for merchants who are not yet chip ready. We want to say a few things about our relationship with U.S. merchants. We continue to invest in people, products and solutions, to help our merchant clients grow their business and reduce their costs. 
We've made good progress on this front with many of our merchant clients, though it's early days, and this is a long-term commitment on our part. You have read surely about some of the disputes we have with some merchants. We're committed to doing everything reasonable to resolve these issues and we're committed to continue strengthening our relationship with all merchants.
As we continue to expand Visa Checkout around the world, we're constantly working to perfect the user experience and to deliver on our promise to make paying with Visa in the digital world as easy as it's been to pay in the physical world for more than 50 years. We rolled out the new Visa Checkout experience to all of our merchants globally. Working with dozens of our top U.S. merchants, we updated the Checkout experience to simplify the sign-up process for consumers to enroll, add cards and manage their information with more fluid interactions and smart auto-fill capabilities. 
We also begun to roll out an interactive checkout button, allowing customers to enter their password right in to the checkout button and confirm checkout with a single tap. Most of these features will be automatically available, which means merchants do not have to make any adjustments to their existing online checkout processes or payment systems. As we head into the Rio Olympics, we used the global sponsorship platform to highlight Visa Checkout and its merchants, including Best Buy and United Airlines, with whom we've created Olympic themed ads that you'll likely see on TV in the U.S. in the coming weeks.
As we continue to look forward and drive new technologies in the payment space, as you know, we opened an innovation center in our San Francisco headquarters, which has served as a destination for clients, partners and developers to see our new payments technologies and work alongside us and our experts, and jointly create the next generation of payment and commerce applications. We've had great success and we committed to expand the number of facilities so we can be close to our clients. 
To that end, in April, we opened our Singapore innovation center. In May, we opened one in Dubai; and in June, we opened one in Miami, all of which will serve our clients, partners and developers in that region and act as a hub to jointly create the next generation of payment commerce applications. Accessible to both local and global clients, all these innovation centers will provide our partners with access to Visa APIs and software development kits available through our Visa developer platform. We also have an innovation center in London and have plans to open others in 2017. We announced yesterday that we'll be opening a new facility in Palo Alto later this year. The office will house work that we do around data, business intelligence, technology research and merchant solutions. We decided to open this facility following on the great success that we've seen with our San Francisco and Bangalore facilities. We found that the combination of location, physical design and coworker colocation concentration are critical in our quest to continue to lead and innovate. All of these new locations provide opportunities to draw talent from the communities that have concentrations of skills different from each other and allows Visa to benefit from the diversity of people and ideas in these very different communities. 
We announce a new $5 billion share repurchase program. This brings the total available for share repurchases to $7.3 billion. This is a reflection of our confidence in our business, our commitment to offset the dilution from the preferred stock issued to Visa Europe members and our continuing commitment to return excess capital to shareholders. 
Before I turn the call over to Vasant, just a few words about the future. You can see that we provided full year guidance on a GAAP and an adjusted GAAP basis as required. And we've tried to give you a clear indication of the impact of Europe in the fourth quarter. On an adjusted basis and without the impact of Europe, we reaffirmed all of our 2016 guidance metrics. You will hear from Vasant, but we're still confident in our ability to achieve the accretion from the European transaction we shared at the time of the announcement. 
Looking ahead, we expect next quarter's results to improve modestly, similar to first half of the year's results. We'll provide more commentary on 2017 in October. But our underlying business is strong and with the lapping effect of several items, based on what we know today and assuming similar consumer spending patterns, we feel good about our ability to produce stronger revenue and earnings growth. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Vasant"
38043467,371688513,1011261,"Visa Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2016",2016-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Visa Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Charlie.

In a world that's turbulent both from a macroeconomic and a geopolitical standpoint, our business remained steady and resilient. A few points to note. Net revenues grew 6% in constant dollars and 3% in nominal dollars at the high end of the range we had given you. Key business trends, payment volumes, processed transactions and cross-border transactions remained stable. Currency volatility stayed high, especially post the Brexit vote. As expected, client incentives are almost 19% of gross revenue. 
Once again, we had good expense management. Expenses declined 7% in the quarter on an adjusted basis and are flat year-to-date versus 2015. Lower personnel and marketing costs contributed to lower-than-projected expenses in the quarter. Non-GAAP EPS in Q3 was $0.69, after you adjust for our GAAP EPS of $0.17 for 4 significant Visa Europe-related nonrecurring items. 
First, a $1.9 billion loss related to the settlement of the Visa Europe Framework Agreement as part of our acquisition of Visa Europe. Second, a $92 million staff duty paid to the U.K. treasury recorded in general and administrative expenses. Third, $60 million in transaction-related expenses recorded in professional fees. Fourth, a net gain of $103 million as we accumulated euros, leading up to the closing of the transaction, which is recorded in nonoperating income. 
You might recall we had a similar gain of $116 million last quarter, which we also excluded from our reported EPS as a non-GAAP adjustment. Now a quick review of the quarter's business drivers. Global payments volume in constant dollars grew 10%, roughly in line with the prior quarter when you adjust for the leap day. U.S. payments volume picked up modestly, adjusting for the leap day, as we start to benefit from USAA and Costco conversions, which helps credit growth to exceed debit growth in the U.S. 
International payment volume growth of 11% ticked down modestly. The strong dollar continued to weigh on international payment volumes, nominal growth was 5%. Despite Brexit and oil price collapse, commodity market weakness, a slowdown in China, terrorism and other destabilizing forces, payment volumes have remained stable for most of this year. Cross-border volumes grew 5% in constant dollars, a modest step-up from a leap day-adjusted second quarter. 
As the strengthening trend in the dollar has moderated, we have seen a reduction in the rate of decline in our large U.S. acquired business and in outbound commerce from Canada. However, this improvement is largely offset by a continuing slowdown of outbound commerce from China, down from 50% growth rates in Q3 last year to barely positive right now. Cross-border commerce from oil and commodity-based economies remained sluggish. 
Processed transactions totaled $19.8 billion in the quarter, up 10%. U.S. growth was 11% and international growth was 7%. As expected, international processed transaction growth rates are stepping up as we lap the transfer of domestic processing to NSPK in Russia. As you know, these numbers are not inclusive of Visa Europe. In our operational package this quarter, we have included a schedule that provides you with a 5-quarter history of the European geographies' payment volume and transaction statistics. 
If we add these to our Q3 metrics, both to this year and last, constant dollar global payment volume growth would be 9%, cross-border volume constant growth calculated based on merchant currencies -- merchant country currencies would be 8% and process transaction growth would be 11%. Of course, starting next quarter, we will incorporate Europe as a new region in our operational performance data package. 
Moving on to our financial metrics. Service revenues grew 6%, roughly in line with nominal payments volume growth. The reduction in the growth rate from the last quarter was anticipated as we lapped pricing increases from last year. Data processing revenue grew 10%, in line with process transaction growth. International revenues grew 4%, generally in line with volume growth as we lap our price increases and the drag of the strong dollar moderates. 
Fortunately, currency volatility stayed high and comparable to the highs reached last year. Post the Brexit vote, volatilities reached levels we have not experienced in recent years. Incentives were in line with our expectations. As we indicated, the significant year-over-year increase was driven by an unusually low level of incentives in the third quarter of 2015. Incentive as a percentage of gross revenues approached 19% and will tick up further in Q4 as Costco incentives kick in. 
This will bring full year client incentives as a percent of gross revenues to around 18.5%, the high end of the 17.5% to 18.5% range that we had provided you. With expense growth down 7% and a tax rate of 30.4%, our run rate EPS was $0.69 after making the 4 Visa Europe-related adjustments I described. As a reminder, there is no Visa Europe revenue, expense or income in our Q3 numbers. Had we included Visa Europe results for the 9 days we owned it in the quarter, it would have added a de minimis $12 million to our net income. 
Some Visa Europe-related consideration. The European leadership team is in place, as Charlie said, and running the business. The business is performing as expected and integration activities have commenced. The employee consultation process, which is required by law before any restructuring of operations, is under way in the U.K. The technology harmonization program has also been launched. We're moving fast to bringing Visa's global capabilities to European customers, including Visa Checkout, Visa Token Service, Visa Direct as well as our consulting resources. Significant customer relationships have already been renewed and others are in process. We believe our customers are excited by what a global Visa can offer them. 
Visa Europe members have been informed that rebates will be terminated at the end of September 2016. We are working with our customers to transition to commercial relationships with competitive client incentive programs, as we have elsewhere in the world. This will be a multi-year process, but the early results have been positive. The longer-term impact of Brexit on Visa Europe's business is too early to determine. The immediate impact has been on exchange rates. The weaker pound and euro will hurt revenues as reported in dollars. However, a significant portion of Visa Europe's expenses are currently denominated in pounds, which offsets the negative revenue impact. 
Given the relative values of the pound and the euro at this point, the net impact of Visa Europe earnings as reported in dollars is roughly neutral right now. Brexit has also introduced significant uncertainty, which is never good for business sentiment. Most economic prognosticators are expecting an economic slowdown in Europe. Beyond this, it is too early to know what the broader and longer-term implications of Brexit are for our businesses. 
Assuming exchange rates stay where they are today, and there are no major economic dislocations as a result of Brexit, we expect Visa Europe earnings to offset interest expense from debt in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 as we told you last quarter. Visa Europe is expected to add 2% to 3% to EPS accretion in fiscal year 2017, in line with the low single-digit accretion we had anticipated. 
Our accretion estimate assumes the current tax structure stays in place through fiscal year 2017. Under this structure, Visa Europe is a U.S. taxpayer. This tax structure is favorable from a cash tax standpoint. However, the current tax structure results in a higher reported or booked tax rate for Visa Europe's earnings. This will add approximately 1 percentage point to Visa's reported tax rate in fiscal year 2017. As always, we will be working on plans to improve both our cash and reported tax rates over time. 
Visa Europe has over $2 billion of cash on its balance sheet. Based on discussions with our regulator in the U.K., we will leave this cash within the Visa Europe legal entity. As a result of this action and due to the higher upfront cash consideration after we eliminated the earn-out provision, we will issue additional debt later this year to fund stock buybacks to offset dilution from preferred stock issued in the transaction. Our current plan is to issue at least $2 billion in debt before the end of this calendar year. 
As we indicated, we plan to offset the dilutive impact of the preferred share issued by buying stock in excess of our normal buyback program. We have been buying stock back at a stepped-up pace for the past 2 quarters in anticipation of the closing of the transaction. We plan to continue buying at this pace until we have bought back sufficient stock to offset the impact of the shares issued. We expect that we will be done by the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. 
In the third quarter, we recognized a $1.9 billion loss related to the Visa Europe Framework Agreement. Under U.S. GAAP, as part of our accounting for the Visa Europe acquisition, we are required to assess all pre-existing contractual relationships between Visa Europe and Visa. If the terms of those agreements are determined to not be at fair value at the time of the close, a portion of the purchase price paid in the transaction is deemed to relate to the effective settlement of these arrangements between the parties. The Visa Europe Framework Agreement was established in October 2007 between Visa and Visa Europe as part of our 2007 reorganization. This agreement provides Visa Europe with a perpetual exclusive right to operate the Visa business in the European Union in exchange for a license fee paid to Visa. 
Under the terms of the Framework Agreement, the license fee paid by Visa Europe has increased modestly since 2007 however, the value of the Visa Europe business has increased at a greater rate. As such, management concluded that the terms of the Framework Agreement were not at fair value as determined under U.S. GAAP at the time of the close. We estimated the value of settling the same Framework Agreement at $1.9 billion. The size of this settlement value was driven by the fact that the agreement was perpetual in nature and would have continued indefinitely had the acquisition not occurred. 
Under U.S. GAAP, $1.9 billion of total consideration transferred to VE in the transaction is initially charged to the income statement as a onetime nonrecurring operating expense representing the cost of settling this arrangement. Had this arrangement not existed, or its terms been at fair value, this amount would've been allocated to net assets acquired. This would have resulted in $1.9 billion additional goodwill recorded in the transaction. Our third quarter balance sheet includes Visa Europe. In a few days, we'll be filing our 10-Q, which will provide considerable detail on all aspects of the accounting for the Visa Europe transaction: allocation of the purchase price to net tangible assets and liabilities and to intangible assets and goodwill as well as the impact of Visa Europe on cash and working capital balances. 
We would, of course, be happy to answer any questions you have after you review the 10-Q. Moving to our outlook for the fourth quarter and the impact of Visa Europe. We expect nominal net revenue growth in Q4 for the legacy Visa business, not including Visa Europe, of around 5% to 6%, in line with the first half trend. Q3 growth rates were depressed by unfavorable year-over-year comparisons on client incentives, which will normalize. We're also projecting a modest uptick in cross-border growth rates, as dollar spend moderates and we lap the slowdown from last year. 
Visa Europe will add 13 to 14 points to fourth quarter net revenue growth. We expect 2% to 3% expense growth for legacy Visa in Q4 from Rio-related marketing and higher technology project spend. Visa Europe will add as much as 15 to 16 points to expense growth. As I mentioned earlier, and in line with what we told you last quarter, Visa Europe income should offset debt interest expense in the fourth quarter. For the year, our key guidance metrics for legacy Visa remain largely unchanged. 
Visa Europe will add 3 to 4 points of growth to both revenue and expenses. The consultation  process is under way in Europe. We're also looking at adjustments to our global cost base as we integrate Europe. Assuming our plans are finalized, we expect to take a restructuring charge in the fourth quarter to resize our global cost structure as a result of the Visa Europe acquisition. As we've said previously, the technology integration will happen later. We will regularly update you on progress.
A quick word on fiscal year 2017. As we normally do, we will provide our comprehensive perspective on 2017 when we talk to you in late October. As we look ahead, we feel good about our business and what Visa Europe will add to it. There are, as always, tailwinds and headwinds. 
In the tailwinds column: payments volume uplift from USAA and Costco; 2 significant drags look likely to ease, gas prices and the dollar translation impact; cross-border growth could improve as dollar strength moderates; and last but not least, accretion from Visa Europe. 
In the headwinds column: continuing global uncertainty, both economic and geopolitical; the impact of Brexit on Europe; China slowdown; and market entry costs. On balance, we anticipate 2017 will be a year with healthy top and bottom line growth for Visa. 
With that, I'll turn this back to Jack."

And Jack can chime in here. Relative to what we make up of a PayPal wallet, you really have to ask PayPal that question because we know what we know and we have some general thoughts, but they really can be the ones and should be the ones. I just -- generally, what we've always thought is that roughly half the transactions that run through PayPal run through a network and we're roughly half or so of that, split between credit and debit. But those are -- I would call those gross approximations and directional. And it's -- you really need to talk to them. Relative to what happens in terms of the flows. Again, if you go through what I said, what we really are interested in doing is to ensure that Visa cards are on a level playing field. And if they're on a level playing field, we feel great about our ability to increase the amount of volume that run over Visa cards and, ultimately, benefit our clients. And so what the agreement does is it enables that to occur. And there' also a period of time where we can -- we will work actively together and exclusively to move volume from ACH back onto Visa cards, if that's what the client wants to do. And so to the extent that, that happens, net-net, that's a financial plus for us. As part of this agreement, as we've said, there are incentives that we will pay -- Visa incentives that we will pay to PayPal. And if those numbers aren't reached, then the incentives don't get paid. But the last thing I just -- I do want to say is partnership agreements work when there's alignment for everyone. And so we've had extensive conversations over a long period of time with PayPal, with our issuers and other members of the payments community. And what we've tried to do here is to come up with something that really does work for everyone. And so where we can sit here and say this is all about driving growth in the electronic payments universe. Because we're creating better customer experiences, where they're allowed to use products that they want to use, where they get all the benefits of those products are, in a seamless experience through PayPal, these products become a better alternative to cash and check and other alternatives out there. So the way we see it, we've given ourselves an opportunity to grow. We've given PayPal an opportunity to grow. And most importantly we've given, from our perspective at Visa, our clients an ability and opportunity to grow and provide a better experience for their consumers."

But I'd say the following things. I think as we go through the conversion to EMV, there are just -- there are a lot of moving pieces especially in the debit world. With terminals having to be reprogrammed, new terminals out there, multiple applications embedded on chips and things like that and merchants turning on PIN pads at different times from times when they've actually turned on the EMV reader. And so there's a lot of movement between signature and PIN, which is somewhat different than we would've seen in a steady-state environment. And that'll play itself out. And that's not a plus or minus. There's just movement there, and that's just the reality of what happens during a conversion like this. What we see is, ultimately, we just want our consumers to have the ability to use the cards. Merchants have whatever abilities that Durbin has given them. And we've -- and they've had those capabilities ever since Durbin was passed. And a big part of that is they have the ability to choose the routing preference. And so as we've seen since Durbin came into place, quarter-by-quarter, there are just a whole series of things that impact where our merchant wants to route to. People give them incentives when they -- whose incentives they think they're going to hit or not hit, help them decide where they want to route to and route away from. And so the Interlink volumes that we see, and we look at it regularly, are very volatile. And so just keep in mind that the numbers that I talked about, which have that decrease, they're 2 weeks. And so someone can make a change in the routing table, we can see a very big impact. That can also change 2 or 3 weeks from now, based upon what we do relative to incentives and things like that. And that's just -- that is the way the business works and I think that's the way Durbin -- the Durbin Amendment intended it to work."

So I would assume that most issuers would choose to want to actively engage to try and move those transactions onto cards which, quite frankly, consumers know, love, understand and are very comfortable with how those products work. And so during this period of time, PayPal wants to work actively with us because to the extent that consumers want to do this, it's -- again, I can't speak for them, but consumer choice, is an important part of the discussion in the press release and that's what this actually provides. So again, the way we look at just as the network, but the way we look at what we've done in this agreement is we've taken -- we've tried to work with PayPal in partnership to take away the things that discourage people from working together and take away the things that create bad customer experiences. And just -- when you do that in anything, hopefully, you wind up with a position where people actually work together. And if you don't even just get back to -- it should produce a higher level of growth coming from someplace else. And whether that comes from other networks, cash, check, any alternatives out there, we don't know. But that's what this agreement is, it's about taking those bad things out, providing a better consumer experience and then the consumers will ultimately choose what they want to use. And again, as I said, we feel very comfortable that we'll do quite well in an environment like that, as our clients will."

I just -- so I would say I honestly haven't had a chance to read what they've actually written. But I guess I'll just say a couple of things, and I think the same goes true for PSD2, which is we as a network are successful not because we offer extremely low-priced commodity services with very little value add. It's the exact opposite of that. And the ability for us to have grown the business that we've grown around the world is all about delivering value-added services, whether it's fraud protection, risk scoring, work on marketing, all those things, that's ultimately why people choose networks. And as I've said, that's something that we need to deliver both not just to issuers but, ultimately, to merchants either directly or through the acquiring community. And so to the extent that we do that, whoever we compete with -- because remember, we've competed -- as you've seen, we competed with PayPal, which has had another way of doing business here and in the physical world, we've done quite well and felt very comfortable with our ability to compete in the online world as we've developed these solutions. So for us, it's about creating that value, delivering on innovation. And I wouldn't underestimate the work that we have done at Visa on Fast Funds, push payments and things that we're doing both in developed parts of the world and emerging parts of the world. And so regardless of who buys what out there, those are activities that we had under way because there's tremendous opportunity, and I think those are the things that will allow us to compete not just with an acquisition out there, but the types of people that will be able to insert themselves into the payment flow because of PSD2."

We've seen, other than the exchange rate impacts, which I talked to you about earlier, we've seen some modest impacts on the cross-border business, as you would expect. Inbound commerce into Europe, and the U.K. in particular, is picking up as a result of the exchange rate moves, most likely, especially from Asia.

I mean, we're clearly monitoring the impact of Brexit to see if there's any impact. It's really not evident at this point, it's minor. We'll have to keep watching it. But as far as it relates to the fourth quarter, we're not assuming any change in trend. And in terms of its specific impact on us, you see that in the guidance we provided where we told you that the revenue impact of Visa Europe on the quarter, if you go to the table we have, was 13 to 14 points of additional dollar revenue growth that would be added to our reported numbers because of Visa Europe, 3 to 4 points of additional revenue growth on a full-year basis. And as far as the income impact, we told you last quarter and we're reiterating that, that Visa Europe's income will offset the debt interest we had. So essentially, it'll make up for the debt interest in the quarter. So that's pretty much it."

We feel like we've addressed everything that we wanted to address. And it was a great conversation. We were both trying to get -- again, as I said earlier, what we both wanted to get to was a point that PayPal, ourselves and the issuers would look at it and say, it's something that makes sense for all of us to work together. And that's based upon the fact that we're providing a better experience, and the opportunities are greater than ever for consumers and merchants. So keeping -- having everyone aligned is what we were after, and that's what we think we've done here. And so we feel very good that we're in a position, as I said, where -- this is a framework where we can work happily together, hopefully, for a very long period of time because it's going to drive more growth. That's what it's all about. It does not change our Visa Checkout strategy. Here, too, I've been very consistent in saying that one of the things that we don't know is we don't know, ultimately, what experiences are going to win at the point-of-sale, either online or at the physical point-of-sale. And so given the fact that we are the global acceptance market that's recognized more than any in the world, that's something where we should have a solution that leverages that acceptance and allows consumers to pay quickly and easily and securely in a manner that they're accustomed. And that's what Visa Checkout is designed to be. But there are other payment solutions out there. We've talked about a bunch of them on this call, as is PayPal. And so what we want to do is ensure that if we're working together under principles that we're happy with, which is what we've achieved here and what we have in the other ones that we support, then we want to enable multiple experiences and, ultimately, consumers and merchants will choose which will win in the marketplace. And so we're happy with the progress that we're making in Visa Checkout. We're glad we're doing it. Ultimately, what we're going to look at for success is how Visa usage is doing in the physical point of world, online and in mobile. Secondarily, where it's coming from. And ultimately, that'll help us make resource allocation decisions. But we want to be the enabler. We want the volume. We're doing lots of different things, and Visa Checkout is one of those things, but it's not the only thing."

Let me start with a few comments about our fiscal fourth quarter financial results. First of all, as you can see with the inclusion of Visa Europe, the quarter and our thoughts on next year will be somewhat complicated, but we will do our best to provide clarity on what's driving our results, both in my remarks but probably more importantly, in Vasant's remarks as he goes through the detail.
Overall, we feel very good about the solid financial results in the fourth quarter. Results were better than our expectations. GAAP EPS of $0.79 included 2 special items, the $110 million charge for severance cost and $88 million noncash and nonrecurring gain for the remeasurement of a deferred tax liability related to the acquisition of Visa Europe. Excluding these items, fourth quarter adjusted GAAP EPS was $0.78 per share, an increase of 27%.
Net operating revenue grew 19% this quarter, including the full quarter of Visa Europe and a continued negative 3 percentage point impact from FX. While growth continues to be subdued by some of the same items we've spoken about previously, we're starting to see improvements as we expected. And our business model, as you've seen, continues to be resilient.
I would be remiss if I didn't mention last week's 18% dividend increase to $0.165 per quarter. We continue to be consistent in returning excess capital to our shareholders. 
We turn now and talk for a couple of minutes about payments volume. U.S. payments volume growth was 11% in the fourth quarter, up 1 percentage point from Q3. U.S. credit payments volume improved to 19% from 11% in the June quarter, primarily driven by the positive impact of Costco and USAA. U.S. debit payments volume grew at 3% down from 9% in the quarter. The lower growth was primarily driven by Interlink, and remember, the impact to revenue of this is minimal. International payments, constant dollar volume growth ex Europe was 9%. Cross-border volume growth accelerated to 10% when normalized for Europe, up from 9% in the third quarter. Process transaction growth was 12% and accelerated 1 point from the third quarter when normalized for Europe as well. 
More recently, through October 21, U.S. payment volume growth was 12%, up 1 percentage point from the fourth quarter. U.S. credit grew 20%, up 1 point from the September quarter. U.S. debit grew 5%, an improvement from the 3% in the fiscal Q4. Cross-border growth in constant dollars is 11% when normalized through Europe, and process transactions was 12% when normalized for Europe.
Just a few comments about Europe. The integration itself is going extremely well. We just couldn't be happier with the interaction between the 2 companies, and we are well underway to putting all of the functions together and operating seamlessly as 1 global entity.
Importantly, renewal activity continues to be very strong. We've signed multi-year debit agreements with RBS and Lloyds Banking Group and multi-year credit and debit agreements with Barclays and nationwide [ph] . We have very good engagement with clients on our products and digital road map, including Visa Checkout, which is being rolled out as we speak. Vasant will discuss in more detail how we're doing financially, but things are playing out as we would have expected so far.
And around the rest of the globe, client activity continues to remain very strong. To name just a few, we renewed a multi-year debit and credit partnership with BBVA Bancomer Mexico. We renewed our credit partnership with China Merchants Bank and China  CITIC Bank, and in Russia, we renewed multi-year credit partnerships with Alfa Bank and VTB 24.
We turn -- just talk for a couple of minutes about Visa Checkout. We ended fiscal 2016 with over 15 million consumer accounts in 21 countries and over 1,400 financial institution partners across the globe participating. More than 300,000 merchants, including some of the largest global retailers, have signed on to accept Visa Checkout, representing $162 billion in addressable volume. In October, we rolled out a redesigned Visa Checkout experience to all global merchants. This new experience makes it easier for consumers to sign up and complete purchases on mobile devices.
We also announced earlier today that we're opening the Visa Checkout platform to clients and partners, allowing them to integrate their digital wallets into Visa Checkout for streamlined authentication and checkout. Leading Visa financial institutions and partners, such as Google's Android Pay, will take advantage of the new open platform by offering Visa Checkout to their customers for online purchases. Issuers, digital wallets and payment app providers can access a streamlined set of APIs to easily integrate Visa Checkout open platform and immediately begin to offer payments to their customers shopping online on their mobile devices.
For example, an online shopper who uses a digital wallet from participating -- from a participating Visa issuer or Android Pay would simply click the Visa Checkout button on a merchant's checkout page and authentic their identity through biometrics to complete a purchase.
We move on to another topic. We continue to invest in new products and services to help our merchant clients. In September, we announced Visa Advertising Solutions, a new suite of products specifically built to help merchants reach new customers and understand if their digital advertising efforts are influencing consumer purchases -- purchasing decisions online and in-store. 
Visa Ad Measurement and Visa Audiences are products that integrate with ad tech platforms like Oracle Data Cloud, allowing Visa's merchants to easily access valuable insights when executing a digital ad campaign. Top quick service restaurants and retail merchants such as Banana Republic have used Visa Ad Measurement, reports to understand sales impact and optimize their marketing campaigns. Visa Advertising Solutions are available to merchants through leading digital platforms such as Facebook, Google, Twitter, Pinterest and over 200 other media networks.
We've spoken about this before, but I do want to highlight the success that we're seeing in our global network of innovation centers. In addition to 1 Market Street in San Francisco, we've opened innovation centers in Singapore in April, Dubai in May, Miami in June and plans to launch one in New York in January as well as London and São Paulo.
In 2016 alone, we held over 600 client engagements globally with over 200 clients participating. These range from tours and demos to multi-day hackathons and in depth co-creation sessions. These are forms where we can demonstrate where we think payments are going in each geography, but our goal is to develop real-time solutions with clients that they can implement very quickly.
Fast payments continues to be an important opportunity around the world, and we're having good success working with clients and partners to capture the opportunity using our Visa Direct push payment product platform. Annual Visa Direct PV exceeds $29 billion [ph] globally for the period September 16, and annual U.S. Visa Direct volumes topped 5 billion [ph] for the first time ending September 2016. Growth exceeds 250% from the same period last year. Globally, nearly 3 billion Visa cards are enabled to receive push payments. We're working key partners, including EWS, FIS, Fiserv, Jack Henry, Stripe, Ingo money, Square and Green Dot. 
I also want to talk for a minute about how we're using push payments to electronify payments in developing economies. We recently launched a new service called mVisa in India, Kenya and Rwanda, and we plan to expand to several other markets around the world during 2017. mVisa allows consumer to transfer money to a merchant in real time with nothing more than their mobile phone. And merchants are able to start accepting Visa transactions immediately without any additional hardware. We've seen early success in several different categories, including small micro merchants, local transportation such as taxi and bill payment. You'll likely hear much more in the future about these efforts.
Tokenization continues to be very important part of ensuring safe and secure mobile payment solutions. We recently announced new specifications that allow certified third parties to connect directly to our Token Service and become Token Service providers. These TSPs will be able to provide a range of services for Visa tokens, including new account provisioning and life cycle management. By expanding access to the Visa Token Service to new partners, Visa issuers will be able to more quickly and easily offer secured digital payment services across a wide range of devices. 
I'll let Vasant talk in detail about our outlook for 2017 but just a few comments for me. We entered 2017 certainly with fewer headwinds as we did entering 2016, and we do have some tailwinds. On the negative side, the global economy is not improving. Geopolitical tensions are high. The U.S. election is a wildcard, and we continue to watch the impact of Brexit. But Costco and USAA meaningfully improved volumes with USAA being an important contributor to revenues in the U.S. while Costco, far less so. Cross-border volumes are both lapping decreases and have improved, and we will have a full year benefit from Europe, which, as I said, is performing as expected.
Since this is my last call, I do want to make just a few closing comments. I'm so proud to have been associated with Visa, its clients, its partners and its employees. I hope you feel that this is a different company than 4 years ago and that the things we've done have positioned the company well for the future. We focused our work on providing payments leadership and a platform, which will enable our clients, all clients, to grow their franchises.
The competition is strong, and the canvas is still being painted as the industry evolves. But our position is strong, and our assets are exceptional. And always keep in mind as we think about what's going on around the world and we look at the risks and opportunity, this is a very global business. The competitive issues are different geography by geography, but opportunities exist around the world for us to grow our share. While there's always risk and many are trying to figure out how to advantage themselves as commerce moves to digital platforms, there is more opportunity globally than ever before for Visa.

38043467,403990688,1059574,"Visa Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 24, 2016",2016-10-24,"Earnings Calls","Visa Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Charlie. For the full quarter of Visa Europe in our numbers for the first time, we had a strong finish to fiscal year 2016. On a GAAP basis, fiscal fourth quarter revenues are up 19%; operating income, up 15%; and EPS, up 28%. We closed FY '16",3285,"Thank you, Charlie. For the full quarter of Visa Europe in our numbers for the first time, we had a strong finish to fiscal year 2016. On a GAAP basis, fiscal fourth quarter revenues are up 19%; operating income, up 15%; and EPS, up 28%. We closed FY '16 with full year revenues of $15 billion, net income of $6 billion and EPS at $2.48. On an adjusted basis, operating income for the fourth quarter was up 20% and EPS was up 27%. Net income for the full year was $6.9 billion, and EPS was $2.84.
For the remainder of my comments, I will be referring to adjusted results. A few points to note. First, payment volumes on a constant dollar basis continued to grow at double-digit rates globally. The secular shift away from cash continues at a fast clip around the world. Credit growth outstripped debit growth, helped by Costco and USAA.
Second, cross-border constant dollar volume growth recovered to double-digit levels. The dollar has stabilized, helping our large U.S.-acquired business. In addition, oil price stability and a nascent recovery in emerging markets has helped outbound commerce across most regions. Only Europe slowed due to general economic weakness as well as the impact of the Brexit vote on the euro and the pound. Easier year-over-year comparisons are also helping.
Third, we had 2 special items in the quarter that largely offset each other. We took a charge for severance costs associated with actions we are implementing across Visa, including the reductions we are planning to make at Visa Europe. The consultation process is underway in Europe, and we expect it will be completed before the end of 2016, after which we will begin to implement the agreed-upon plan.
As we integrate Europe into the rest of Visa, we have taken the opportunity, as we told you we would, to look at our global cost structure, and we'll make some adjustments. Offsetting this charge was a nonrecurring, noncash tax benefit from the reduction in the U.K. corporate tax rate, which reduced our U.K. deferred tax liability.
Finally, as you know, we issued preferred shares for the Visa Europe acquisition. We also bought back 20.5 million shares in the fourth quarter for $1.66 billion We ended the quarter with a weighted average share count of 2.44 billion, up 54 million from Q3. For the full year fiscal year '16, we bought back 92 million shares for $7.1 billion at an average price of $77.13. This is approximately $2 billion higher than what our normal course buyback would have been last year. The additional buyback reflects our intent to offset the dilutive impact of the preferred shares issued and will continue into early fiscal year '18 as we previously indicated.
I'll quickly review business drivers and financial results for the quarter and fiscal year '16, then spend most of my time on our outlook for FY '17. At least for this quarter, we will highlight the impact of adding in Visa Europe where it is helpful to better understand our results. U.S. payment volumes grew 11% in Q4 as U.S. credit grew 19%, helped by USAA and Costco volumes. U.S. debit grew 3% due to lapping a significant new account win in our Interlink business in Q4 last year and the impact of PIN debit routing this quarter.  Adjusted for Interlink volumes, the U.S. debit growth trend was unchanged from the prior quarter. As merchants make routing decisions based on incentive deals in place with various networks, we expect there will continue to be volatility in our Interlink growth rates. However, given the relative size of this business, the impact on our total revenues will be minimal.
International payment volumes ex Europe grew 9% in constant dollars, but takedown from the prior quarter trend was largely due to the lapping effect of a large Chinese bank, which started including previously unreported domestic volumes in Q3 last year. Ex China, growth rates remained strong in Asia as well as Latin America. The Middle East and Russia was stable, but Sub-Saharan Africa was a soft spot.
In Europe, new regulation that went into effect in June no longer require issuers of co-badged cards to report domestic volumes we do not process. This will distort year-over-year comparisons throughout fiscal '17. Excluding Europe, cross-border constant dollar growth rate stepped up to 10% in Q4. This is the first time we have reported double-digit cross-border volume growth since Q4 fiscal year '14.
The weakening dollar is driving a recovery in our large U.S.-acquired business as well as outbound commerce from Canada. Cross-border growth in North America climbed to 9%, a rate of growth we have not seen since the end of 2013.
Internationally, cross-border growth rates stepped up across all geographies, helped by stabilizing oil prices and recovering emerging markets. Cross-border growth rates in China have stabilized in the mid-single digits. The only region ticking down in growth was Europe as the weak pound post Brexit has hurt outbound commerce from the U.K. Excluding Europe, transactions processed over VisaNet grew 11%. A small step-up from the prior quarter was due to the NSPK effect in Russia. As you know, our reported transactions growth was hurt in the past 5 quarters as we transitioned processing to NSPK starting in the third quarter of fiscal year '15. Transactions processed in Europe grew 15%, in line with the previous quarter.
Net revenues grew 19% in Q4, 6% excluding the impact of Europe. Expenses grew 18%, 5% excluding Europe. We finished the year with adjusted EPS of $2.84. If you exclude the impact of the Visa Europe acquisition, which is interest expense from the debt issued, the shares issued as well as Europe's income and other onetime items, our EPS grew 10% in nominal dollars and 14% in constant dollars. We were able to deliver this growth despite a soft revenue picture caused by the strong dollar, the oil and commodity price collapse impacting many regions as well as a slowdown in China. We were able to hold fiscal year '16 expense growth to 1% ex Europe while continuing to invest heavily in all our critical long-term initiatives such as Visa Checkout, Visa Token Service, Visa Developer platform, our innovation centers, our marketing around the Rio Olympics and other programs.
We enter fiscal year 2017 with some tailwinds. Costco and USAA conversions are now well underway as you saw from our Q4 payment volumes. Cross-border growth rates have recovered as the dollar stabilizes, and we have easier year-over-year comparisons. Two significant drags from prior years is the translational impact of the strong dollar and gas price declines. We begin to benefit from the Visa Europe acquisition with yield improvements, cost reductions and EPS accretion.
Balancing these tailwinds are some headwinds: economic weakness in Europe and Brexit uncertainty, hurting both domestic and cross-border volumes; a global economy that remains generally sluggish; a potential decline in treasury revenues as volatility subsides from the extraordinary high levels we have experienced in the past 2 years; and finally, a step-up in client incentives as we bring on Costco and other major renewals as well as folding in Europe. We'll review how all these factors drive our outlook for 2017 starting with payments volume.
USAA and Costco will drive payments volume growth in the U.S. However, we expect international payments volume growth to slow down modestly due to weakness in Europe and China. Reported European payment volume numbers will be distorted by the change in co-badged volume reporting. If no co-badged volume is included, reported European payment volumes could be down 15% to 20%, dragging reported global payments growth down by as much as 7 to 8 percentage points with a larger impact on the first 3 quarters.
As you saw in Q4, cross-border volumes are recovering, helped by easier comparisons, the stabilizing dollar and oil prices as well as improving emerging market economies. In Europe, cross-border growth rates have been trending through fiscal year '16, and we anticipate that this will continue as the pound remains weak and economies across Europe struggle. Inbound commerce into the U.S. will likely grow after 2 consecutive years of decline. Outbound commerce is expected to recover in the Middle East, Africa and Latin America. In Asia, Chinese cross-border growth appear to have stabilized.
The recovery in cross-border growth may be offset to some degree by a decline in currency volatilities and the revenue we derive from it. Currency volatilities have been extraordinarily high for the past couple of years, well above long-term averages. At some point, there will be a reversion to the mean or even an overcorrection in the other direction like we saw in 2014. For purposes of our outlook, we are resuming what we did last year, a reversion to the mean in fiscal year '17, but as they say, it will be what it will be.
With the NSPK transition behind us in Russia, debit gains in Brazil, Costco and USAA volumes in the U.S., we expect process transactions growth to tick up in FY '17 ex Europe. European process transaction growth rates will slow down as we lap the rapid acceleration of contactless transactions in the U.K. in fiscal year '16.
We finished FY '16 with client incentives as a percent of gross revenues approaching 19% in the second half. Our outlook anticipates a range of 20.5% to 21.5% in fiscal year '17, a 1.5 to 2.5 points increase. There are several factors driving this increase. About half of the year-over-year increase is driven by the inclusion of Visa Europe for the full year and the impact of eliminating rebates and replacing them with performance-based client incentives. In our filings of Visa Europe numbers for the first 3 quarters of FY '16 that you have seen, U.S. GAAP accounting requires that rebates are netted from gross revenues. When we eliminated rebates at the end of September, it has the effect of increasing Visa Europe's gross fiscal year '17 revenues and in parallel, Visa Europe's fiscal year '17 client incentives as we replaced these rebates with appropriate market competitive incentives. The net effect of this change in the European pricing structure and the overall level of client incentives in Europe accounts for about half of the increase from 19% in Q4 to the range we provided for fiscal year '17. The other half of the year-over-year step-up in client incentives as a percentage of gross revenues is driven by a full year of Costco incentives and the impact of several large renewals completed in fiscal year '16, particularly in Asia.
When you put all this together, we expect constant dollar net revenue growth in the high teens in fiscal year '17 moderated to the 16% to 18% range in nominal dollars by an estimated 1 to 1.5 point exchange rate impact. This currency translation impact may be larger than you are anticipating based on dollar spot rates of forward curves. Let me explain why this is the case.
It has to do with our long standing practice of layering on monthly hedges no different than what most global companies do. This approach to hedging is not seeking to make directional bets on currencies but rather, to dampen the effect of changes in the trend of the dollar. When the dollar strengthens, these hedges delay the cost, and when the dollar weakens, they delay the benefit, essentially mitigating volatility. In fiscal year '16, the hedges helped in the first half, and then as the dollar started to weaken, they hurt in the second half. This will continue into fiscal year '17. The hedges in place will be a drag in the first half. If the dollar stabilizes as currency forwards is suggesting, they will be neutral in the second half. The total exchange rate drag on net revenues could be 2 to 2.5 points in the first quarter comparable to Q4 FY '16, moderating through the year to 0.5 in Q4 FY '17.
On the expense front, we will continue to invest as aggressively as we need to on all our key growth initiatives, including the global expansion of Visa Checkout, Visa Token Service and Visa innovation centers. We will continue to build on our Visa Developer platform, our data and analytics capabilities, loyalty and offers, mVisa and other key programs. In parallel, as we have done in fiscal year '17, we will look to gain efficiencies in other parts of our business by enhancing productivity and adding capabilities in lower-cost locations.
Excluding Europe, we expect expense growth to return to the mid-single-digit range in fiscal year '17. In terms of the expense base in Europe, after the consultation process is completed, we will implement our plan. While this will reduce costs in some areas, we will be investing in Europe to roll out Visa Checkout and our other digital services as well as adding to our sales and marketing resources to bring all the benefits of global Visa to our European clients as fast as we can. We will also incur approximately $18 million in Visa Europe integration costs in fiscal year '17. These are costs to harmonize the 2 technology platforms.
Our technology teams are in the process of aligning authorization clearance, clearance [ph] and settlement systems, upgrading network compute and storage infrastructure, implementing next-generation information security systems, preparing to move to common end user and corporate [ph] platform. As you may recall, we had indicated that the technology integration would not be complete until late 2019, early 2020.
We had estimated total integration costs in the $450 million to $500 million range over this time frame. While these are not recurring costs, we will incur these costs for the next 3 years until we complete the full integration of Visa Europe. We will call these costs out as we have in our outlook. However, we do not plan to adjust these costs from our GAAP numbers when we report each quarter. Of course, these integration costs will not be incurred once the technology integration is complete. Also, as we have indicated, additional cost savings will be realized when we combine the technology platform.
It is important to highlight one item that you need to adjust for as you consolidate Visa Europe into Visa Inc. Prior to the acquisition, as you all know, there were inter-company charges that flowed between Visa Europe and Visa Inc. These are expenses for Visa Europe and revenues for Visa Inc.
The largest item was the Visa Europe license fee. The other major charge was to network processing services provided by Visa Inc. For the first 3 quarters of fiscal year '16, these inter-company charges amounted to $191 million. 2/3 were recognized as other revenues in the Visa, Inc. income statement and the remainder in data processing revenues. At Visa Europe, 1/3 of the expense hit the network and processing line, and most of the rest was in G&A with a small amount in personnel.
Post the acquisition, these inter-company revenues and expenses completely offset one another and are eliminated in consolidation. Therefore, none of these revenues and expense amounts are included in the reported fourth quarter numbers. All will be included going forward. If you do not adjust for these changes, your FY '16 baseline for Visa Europe operating expenses would be overstated by $191 million as would your fiscal year '16 baseline for Visa Inc revenues.
In terms of costs related to China market entry, the timing remains uncertain. We had assumed we would be much further along at this point when we talked to you last year. It is our intent to move very fast to set up our processing infrastructure once we have greater clarity from the BPOC around time lines for their decision on granting licenses. At this point, it is difficult to know for sure what costs related to China market entry will be incurred in fiscal year '17. We have made some assumptions in our outlook, and we'll update you as we learn more.
Moving on to interest and taxes. Interest expense will increase almost 40% in fiscal year '17 from a full year of interest on the $16 billion in debt issued in December 2015 as well as the $2 billion in debt we plan to issue before the end of this calendar year, market conditions permitting. Our fiscal year '17 tax rate will increase due to Visa Europe. As you know, under the current structure, Visa Europe is a U.S. tax prayer. The current tax structure affords us some cash tax benefit but has the effect of increasing our book or GAAP tax rate due to restrictions on the credits we can take on taxes we pay in the U.K. As we had indicated previously, this structure increases our reported tax rate by 100 basis points to the low 30s range.
As you estimate our fiscal year '17 EPS, it's important to remember that we issued 79 million preferred shares as part of the consideration for Visa Europe. These shares are now included in our fully diluted share count, which is up 54 million net of buybacks completed in the fourth quarter. We have ramped up our buyback program to offset the dilutive impact of the shares issued. In fiscal year '17, our buyback based in dollars should be roughly at the same level as fiscal year '16. At this pace, by the end of '17, we would have bought back almost 5 billion more than our normal course buyback or offset almost 80% of stock issued. We will maintain the stepped up pace of buybacks until we complete this program in early fiscal year '18.
For the full year of interest expense as well as $2 billion more in debt with a higher GAAP tax rate and with additional shares outstanding, our EPS growth rate in fiscal year '17 will be lower than net revenue growth. In nominal terms, our outlook anticipates mid-teens EPS growth from an adjusted fiscal year '16 baseline of $2.84. This includes a 1.5 to 2-point drag from exchange rates mostly due to the impact of hedging described earlier. As with revenues, the drag from exchange rates will be higher in the first half comparable to fourth quarter '16 levels in Q1 and moderating through the year. 
Our EPS outlook assumes EPS accretion from Visa Europe will be in the 2% to 3% range in fiscal year '17 as expected. The accretive impact of Visa Europe is greater in the second and third quarter when we had interest expense last year from debt issued from the transaction but no impact from Visa Europe till the fourth quarter. Also benefits from our cost-reduction actions start being realized in the second quarter. Visa Europe is tracking well relative to our expectations and we remain confident that accretion will climb with a high single-digit range by 2020 once we have implemented all our plans to improve yield and lower costs. 
In summary, we feel good about fiscal year 2017. Visa Europe's integration is proceeding well and delivering as expected. Payment volume momentum remains robust globally, transaction growth remains healthy. Cross-border volumes are recovering as the dollar stabilizes and comparisons become easier. Gas prices and exchange rate drags are easing. As always, there are risks to watch. The global economy remains sluggish especially in Europe. The cross-border business in Europe is slowing. Currency volatilities could moderate. Balancing these factors, our fiscal year '17 outlook anticipates 16% to 18% net revenue growth and mid-teens EPS growth in nominal dollars. As always, we'll update our views as the year unfolds and share them with you each quarter. 
With that, I'll turn the call back to John."

Anyone has seen the hedging implication in our second half results, I mean our currency impact essentially stayed flat through the year because of hedging help in the first half and hurt a bit in the second half, and all it does really is delay the impact of the moves in the dollar. But if you adjust for the hedging impact, what you're seeing is high teens revenue growth -- net revenue growth. And what you're seeing is mid-teens plus 1.5 to 2 points EPS growth. It's not that different than perhaps what you might have expected of us going into the year. Visa Europe is tracking as we expected, we feel very good about that. What could surprise one way or another, we laid out all the factors. Clearly, the cross-border trends are hardening. And hopefully, if the dollars stays on this track, which is either stable or further weakening, that would be good for us.

In terms of the currency volatility front [indiscernible], a little bit of anybody's guess. We did tell you sort of what we're assuming.

So Visa Europe lands up at a place where their incentives is the center of gross revenues are certainly driving the new level. Beyond that, yes, we have Costco coming in for the full year, that certainly adds to it. And we had some significant renewals in particular, Asian geographies.

We saw improvement in the acquired business in places like Mexico, mostly benefited from the U.S. Those are some of the big growth spots. The good news though was from an issuing standpoint, we saw growth in a lot of places. We saw growth coming out of Brazil, out of Russia, out of many of the commodity and oil-based economies Middle East and parts of Asia also improving. And China beginning to stabilize.

I think we had most people report cobadging in the volumes in the fourth quarter. So the fourth quarter number ended up being their relatively untainted by lack of reporting and I think the payment volumes, if I remember right was somewhere in the 6% range, so as you can see, they are lower than what we see in other parts of the world in terms of growth rates. As you look at next year, the issue on co-badge volumes is that there are a certain number of issuers that have co-badge cards with us who are no longer required to report their co-badge volumes and transactions we do not process. The biggest impact is France, and there's some impact in some Scandinavian country. If they don't all report, which is what we expect. We expect that they will all not report, then payment volumes will decline next year, we said as much as 15% to 20%. So remember, I mean if its plus 6, 10 minus 20, that's the delta of almost 25 or 26. Plus as you know, in the first 3 quarters, Visa Europe payment volumes will show up as all incremental to our payment volume and will have this impact on it. So you will see a fair amount of distortion in payment volume reporting as a result of this. Now the lack of payment volume reporting and its revenue impacts, we factored into our outlook. So that is all factored to what we told you our revenue picture is next year. But the payment volume will look odd, although we report by region, so at least we'll be able to see what it is by region and be able to look at how everybody else is doing it and Europe will just look odd."

There are 13,000 other people here that are going to continue doing what they've done, the day after I go. And with a leader like Al, I would assume will do as well if not better. And so as we think about what we've done over the past 4 years or even what this company has done since it's gone public, it's based upon what an entire management team has done. I think that what I feel very good about when I think about the things that we've done, I think -- you brought up the work on -- that we have really -- how do I scribed this, that we've really begun to do with merchants is an important part of the way we think about what we do. We are not trying to do work for merchants in the lieu of any other client or any other partner, but just recognizing that everyone participates in the payments value chain should get access to the capabilities that we have. And so someone asked me last week, if I were them, how would they evaluate how we're doing at making progress with merchants? And my answer was, I would look to see that we're continuing quarter after quarter, year after year to introduce solutions in the marketplace which helps merchants grow their business and then try and derive some kind of understanding of what the adoption looks like for those products. And don't be confused by a couple of merchants that are always going to be unhappy, that are always going to be doing things in the marketplace. The merchant world is very fragmented across the world. We've got some very, very strong relationships and we've got a bunch of relationships where those merchants are sitting there, very eager to work with us on the solutions that we're developing. And then I think just not -- because I don't want to take up the whole call with the question. I do think just -- when I think about the way we thought about innovation here and the way we thought about our work in digital commerce, I think we just -- the whole organization has just made tremendous progress. We don't talk about -- we don't use the word innovation around here anymore because it becomes part of the way people think about doing their business. We're rooted in supporting our client base and supporting the four-party model, but we are very focused on being a successful and having our clients be successful in the digital world. And whether it's the work in the death center, the APIs that we've made available, all of the things that we've done that position us well in the world of digital converse, including Visa Checkout, those are all part of those thing. So everything we do is about continuing to be strong in the physical world, but recognizing that we need to think very differently in the digital world. There's a tremendous amount more to do, so I don't want to think about it as if we've done it, and it's time for me to move on. I think we've done an awful lot, but I'm confident that those activities and the way people think is the way the organization thinks."

The level of investment remains as steady as it has been, and we'll continue to drive productivity. I mean some of the charge we took is a reflection of that.

Listen, I think what's important is that there is this -- I'll describe it as really a government-sponsored whether its official or not, push towards faster payments. And so when I think about ACH and we think about what's going on, I think that is the predominant driver because certainly, the ACH system her and others around the world haven't been able to provide the same kind of -- the level of service as you get from other products or other networks. And so when we think about what it means for us, we know the capabilities that we have. When we think about what we've done and the way we've positioned ourselves with Visa Direct and getting access on a push payments basis, to 3 billion cards across the world, we feel really good about the position that we have with those capabilities. It doesn't mean that, that's all we're thinking about and all that we're doing, and you've seen us do some work in the -- as you mentioned in the black chain space. Thinking more about where our payments inefficient. And for what we do in our traditional consumer to business world, that's not a problem that needs to get solved today in terms of what blockchain can do. But certainly, in the commercial space, it's a very, very inefficient market. And there are opportunities to use different technologies to bring some efficiency there. So the things that we're doing, they are around doing things to improve something that exists. And for the core business of what we do today between consumers and merchants and it will be through a consumers to consumers in terms of using our push payment capabilities, it's leveraging the core assets that we have that work really well that have access to these 3 billion cards across the world."

Let me start with a few comments about our fiscal fourth quarter financial results. First of all, as you can see with the inclusion of Visa Europe, the quarter and our thoughts on next year will be somewhat complicated, but we will do our best to provide clarity on what's driving our results, both in my remarks but probably more importantly, in Vasant's remarks as he goes through the detail.
Overall, we feel very good about the solid financial results in the fourth quarter. Results were better than our expectations. GAAP EPS of $0.79 included 2 special items, the $110 million charge for severance cost and $88 million noncash and nonrecurring gain for the remeasurement of a deferred tax liability related to the acquisition of Visa Europe. Excluding these items, fourth quarter adjusted GAAP EPS was $0.78 per share, an increase of 27%.
Net operating revenue grew 19% this quarter, including the full quarter of Visa Europe and a continued negative 3 percentage point impact from FX. While growth continues to be subdued by some of the same items we've spoken about previously, we're starting to see improvements as we expected. And our business model, as you've seen, continues to be resilient.
I would be remiss if I didn't mention last week's 18% dividend increase to $0.165 per quarter. We continue to be consistent in returning excess capital to our shareholders. 
We turn now and talk for a couple of minutes about payments volume. U.S. payments volume growth was 11% in the fourth quarter, up 1 percentage point from Q3. U.S. credit payments volume improved to 19% from 11% in the June quarter, primarily driven by the positive impact of Costco and USAA. U.S. debit payments volume grew at 3% down from 9% in the quarter. The lower growth was primarily driven by Interlink, and remember, the impact to revenue of this is minimal. International payments, constant dollar volume growth ex Europe was 9%. Cross-border volume growth accelerated to 10% when normalized for Europe, up from 9% in the third quarter. Process transaction growth was 12% and accelerated 1 point from the third quarter when normalized for Europe as well. 
More recently, through October 21, U.S. payment volume growth was 12%, up 1 percentage point from the fourth quarter. U.S. credit grew 20%, up 1 point from the September quarter. U.S. debit grew 5%, an improvement from the 3% in the fiscal Q4. Cross-border growth in constant dollars is 11% when normalized through Europe, and process transactions was 12% when normalized for Europe.
Just a few comments about Europe. The integration itself is going extremely well. We just couldn't be happier with the interaction between the 2 companies, and we are well underway to putting all of the functions together and operating seamlessly as 1 global entity.
Importantly, renewal activity continues to be very strong. We've signed multi-year debit agreements with RBS and Lloyds Banking Group and multi-year credit and debit agreements with Barclays and Nationwide. We have very good engagement with clients on our products and digital road map, including Visa Checkout, which is being rolled out as we speak. Vasant will discuss in more detail how we're doing financially, but things are playing out as we would have expected so far.
And around the rest of the globe, client activity continues to remain very strong. To name just a few, we renewed a multi-year debit and credit partnership with BBVA Bancomer Mexico. We renewed our credit partnership with China Merchants Bank and China  CITIC Bank, and in Russia, we renewed multi-year credit partnerships with Alfa Bank and VTB 24.
We turn -- just talk for a couple of minutes about Visa Checkout. We ended fiscal 2016 with over 15 million consumer accounts in 21 countries and over 1,400 financial institution partners across the globe participating. More than 300,000 merchants, including some of the largest global retailers, have signed on to accept Visa Checkout, representing $162 billion in addressable volume. In October, we rolled out a redesigned Visa Checkout experience to all global merchants. This new experience makes it easier for consumers to sign up and complete purchases on mobile devices.
We also announced earlier today that we're opening the Visa Checkout platform to clients and partners, allowing them to integrate their digital wallets into Visa Checkout for streamlined authentication and checkout. Leading Visa financial institutions and partners, such as Google's Android Pay, will take advantage of the new open platform by offering Visa Checkout to their customers for online purchases. Issuers, digital wallets and payment app providers can access a streamlined set of APIs to easily integrate Visa Checkout open platform and immediately begin to offer payments to their customers shopping online on their mobile devices.
For example, an online shopper who uses a digital wallet from participating -- from a participating Visa issuer or Android Pay would simply click the Visa Checkout button on a merchant's checkout page and authentic their identity through biometrics to complete a purchase.
We move on to another topic. We continue to invest in new products and services to help our merchant clients. In September, we announced Visa Advertising Solutions, a new suite of products specifically built to help merchants reach new customers and understand if their digital advertising efforts are influencing consumer purchases -- purchasing decisions online and in-store. 
Visa Ad Measurement and Visa Audiences are products that integrate with ad tech platforms like Oracle Data Cloud, allowing Visa's merchants to easily access valuable insights when executing a digital ad campaign. Top quick service restaurants and retail merchants such as Banana Republic have used Visa Ad Measurement, reports to understand sales impact and optimize their marketing campaigns. Visa Advertising Solutions are available to merchants through leading digital platforms such as Facebook, Google, Twitter, Pinterest and over 200 other media networks.
We've spoken about this before, but I do want to highlight the success that we're seeing in our global network of innovation centers. In addition to 1 Market Street in San Francisco, we've opened innovation centers in Singapore in April, Dubai in May, Miami in June and plans to launch one in New York in January as well as London and São Paulo.
In 2016 alone, we held over 600 client engagements globally with over 200 clients participating. These range from tours and demos to multi-day hackathons and in depth co-creation sessions. These are forms where we can demonstrate where we think payments are going in each geography, but our goal is to develop real-time solutions with clients that they can implement very quickly.
Fast payments continues to be an important opportunity around the world, and we're having good success working with clients and partners to capture the opportunity using our Visa Direct push payment product platform. Annual Visa Direct PV exceeds $29 billion globally for the period September 16, and annual U.S. Visa Direct volumes topped $5 billion for the first time ending September 2016. Growth exceeds 250% from the same period last year. Globally, nearly 3 billion Visa cards are enabled to receive push payments. We're working key partners, including EWS, FIS, Fiserv, Jack Henry, Stripe, Ingo money, Square and Green Dot. 
I also want to talk for a minute about how we're using push payments to electronify payments in developing economies. We recently launched a new service called mVisa in India, Kenya and Rwanda, and we plan to expand to several other markets around the world during 2017. mVisa allows consumer to transfer money to a merchant in real time with nothing more than their mobile phone. And merchants are able to start accepting Visa transactions immediately without any additional hardware. We've seen early success in several different categories, including small micro merchants, local transportation such as taxi and bill payment. You'll likely hear much more in the future about these efforts.
Tokenization continues to be very important part of ensuring safe and secure mobile payment solutions. We recently announced new specifications that allow certified third parties to connect directly to our Token Service and become Token Service providers. These TSPs will be able to provide a range of services for Visa tokens, including new account provisioning and life cycle management. By expanding access to the Visa Token Service to new partners, Visa issuers will be able to more quickly and easily offer secured digital payment services across a wide range of devices. 
I'll let Vasant talk in detail about our outlook for 2017 but just a few comments for me. We entered 2017 certainly with fewer headwinds as we did entering 2016, and we do have some tailwinds. On the negative side, the global economy is not improving. Geopolitical tensions are high. The U.S. election is a wildcard, and we continue to watch the impact of Brexit. But Costco and USAA meaningfully improved volumes with USAA being an important contributor to revenues in the U.S. while Costco, far less so. Cross-border volumes are both lapping decreases and have improved, and we will have a full year benefit from Europe, which, as I said, is performing as expected.
Since this is my last call, I do want to make just a few closing comments. I'm so proud to have been associated with Visa, its clients, its partners and its employees. I hope you feel that this is a different company than 4 years ago and that the things we've done have positioned the company well for the future. We focused our work on providing payments leadership and a platform, which will enable our clients, all clients, to grow their franchises.
The competition is strong, and the canvas is still being painted as the industry evolves. But our position is strong, and our assets are exceptional. And always keep in mind as we think about what's going on around the world and we look at the risks and opportunity, this is a very global business. The competitive issues are different geography by geography, but opportunities exist around the world for us to grow our share. While there's always risk and many are trying to figure out how to advantage themselves as commerce moves to digital platforms, there is more opportunity globally than ever before for Visa.
Vasant?"

For the full quarter of Visa Europe in our numbers for the first time, we had a strong finish to fiscal year 2016. On a GAAP basis, fiscal fourth quarter revenues are up 19%; operating income, up 15%; and EPS, up 28%. We closed FY '16",3286,"Thank you, Charlie. For the full quarter of Visa Europe in our numbers for the first time, we had a strong finish to fiscal year 2016. On a GAAP basis, fiscal fourth quarter revenues are up 19%; operating income, up 15%; and EPS, up 28%. We closed FY '16 with full year revenues of $15 billion, net income of $6 billion and EPS at $2.48. On an adjusted basis, operating income for the fourth quarter was up 20% and EPS was up 27%. Net income for the full year was $6.9 billion, and EPS was $2.84.
For the remainder of my comments, I will be referring to adjusted results. A few points to note. First, payment volumes on a constant dollar basis continued to grow at double-digit rates globally. The secular shift away from cash continues at a fast clip around the world. Credit growth outstripped debit growth, helped by Costco and USAA.
Second, cross-border constant dollar volume growth recovered to double-digit levels. The dollar has stabilized, helping our large U.S.-acquired business. In addition, oil price stability and a nascent recovery in emerging markets has helped outbound commerce across most regions. Only Europe slowed due to general economic weakness as well as the impact of the Brexit vote on the euro and the pound. Easier year-over-year comparisons are also helping.
Third, we had 2 special items in the quarter that largely offset each other. We took a charge for severance costs associated with actions we are implementing across Visa, including the reductions we are planning to make at Visa Europe. The consultation process is underway in Europe, and we expect it will be completed before the end of 2016, after which we will begin to implement the agreed-upon plan.
As we integrate Europe into the rest of Visa, we have taken the opportunity, as we told you we would, to look at our global cost structure, and we'll make some adjustments. Offsetting this charge was a nonrecurring, noncash tax benefit from the reduction in the U.K. corporate tax rate, which reduced our U.K. deferred tax liability.
Finally, as you know, we issued preferred shares for the Visa Europe acquisition. We also bought back 20.5 million shares in the fourth quarter for $1.66 billion We ended the quarter with a weighted average share count of 2.44 billion, up 54 million from Q3. For the full year fiscal year '16, we bought back 92 million shares for $7.1 billion at an average price of $77.13. This is approximately $2 billion higher than what our normal course buyback would have been last year. The additional buyback reflects our intent to offset the dilutive impact of the preferred shares issued and will continue into early fiscal year '18 as we previously indicated.
I'll quickly review business drivers and financial results for the quarter and fiscal year '16, then spend most of my time on our outlook for FY '17. At least for this quarter, we will highlight the impact of adding in Visa Europe where it is helpful to better understand our results. U.S. payment volumes grew 11% in Q4 as U.S. credit grew 19%, helped by USAA and Costco volumes. U.S. debit grew 3% due to lapping a significant new account win in our Interlink business in Q4 last year and the impact of PIN debit routing this quarter.  Adjusted for Interlink volumes, the U.S. debit growth trend was unchanged from the prior quarter. As merchants make routing decisions based on incentive deals in place with various networks, we expect there will continue to be volatility in our Interlink growth rates. However, given the relative size of this business, the impact on our total revenues will be minimal.
International payment volumes ex Europe grew 9% in constant dollars, but takedown from the prior quarter trend was largely due to the lapping effect of a large Chinese bank, which started including previously unreported domestic volumes in Q3 last year. Ex China, growth rates remained strong in Asia as well as Latin America. The Middle East and Russia was stable, but Sub-Saharan Africa was a soft spot.
In Europe, new regulation that went into effect in June no longer require issuers of co-badged cards to report domestic volumes we do not process. This will distort year-over-year comparisons throughout fiscal '17. Excluding Europe, cross-border constant dollar growth rate stepped up to 10% in Q4. This is the first time we have reported double-digit cross-border volume growth since Q4 fiscal year '14.
The weakening dollar is driving a recovery in our large U.S.-acquired business as well as outbound commerce from Canada. Cross-border growth in North America climbed to 9%, a rate of growth we have not seen since the end of 2013.
Internationally, cross-border growth rates stepped up across all geographies, helped by stabilizing oil prices and recovering emerging markets. Cross-border growth rates in China have stabilized in the mid-single digits. The only region ticking down in growth was Europe as the weak pound post Brexit has hurt outbound commerce from the U.K. Excluding Europe, transactions processed over VisaNet grew 11%. A small step-up from the prior quarter was due to the NSPK effect in Russia. As you know, our reported transactions growth was hurt in the past 5 quarters as we transitioned processing to NSPK starting in the third quarter of fiscal year '15. Transactions processed in Europe grew 15%, in line with the previous quarter.
Net revenues grew 19% in Q4, 6% excluding the impact of Europe. Expenses grew 18%, 5% excluding Europe. We finished the year with adjusted EPS of $2.84. If you exclude the impact of the Visa Europe acquisition, which is interest expense from the debt issued, the shares issued as well as Europe's income and other onetime items, our EPS grew 10% in nominal dollars and 14% in constant dollars. We were able to deliver this growth despite a soft revenue picture caused by the strong dollar, the oil and commodity price collapse impacting many regions as well as a slowdown in China. We were able to hold fiscal year '16 expense growth to 1% ex Europe while continuing to invest heavily in all our critical long-term initiatives such as Visa Checkout, Visa Token Service, Visa Developer platform, our innovation centers, our marketing around the Rio Olympics and other programs.
We enter fiscal year 2017 with some tailwinds. Costco and USAA conversions are now well underway as you saw from our Q4 payment volumes. Cross-border growth rates have recovered as the dollar stabilizes, and we have easier year-over-year comparisons. Two significant drags from prior years is the translational impact of the strong dollar and gas price declines. We begin to benefit from the Visa Europe acquisition with yield improvements, cost reductions and EPS accretion.
Balancing these tailwinds are some headwinds: economic weakness in Europe and Brexit uncertainty, hurting both domestic and cross-border volumes; a global economy that remains generally sluggish; a potential decline in treasury revenues as volatility subsides from the extraordinary high levels we have experienced in the past 2 years; and finally, a step-up in client incentives as we bring on Costco and other major renewals as well as folding in Europe. We'll review how all these factors drive our outlook for 2017 starting with payments volume.
USAA and Costco will drive payments volume growth in the U.S. However, we expect international payments volume growth to slow down modestly due to weakness in Europe and China. Reported European payment volume numbers will be distorted by the change in co-badged volume reporting. If no co-badged volume is included, reported European payment volumes could be down 15% to 20%, dragging reported global payments growth down by as much as 7 to 8 percentage points with a larger impact on the first 3 quarters.
As you saw in Q4, cross-border volumes are recovering, helped by easier comparisons, the stabilizing dollar and oil prices as well as improving emerging market economies. In Europe, cross-border growth rates have been trending through fiscal year '16, and we anticipate that this will continue as the pound remains weak and economies across Europe struggle. Inbound commerce into the U.S. will likely grow after 2 consecutive years of decline. Outbound commerce is expected to recover in the Middle East, Africa and Latin America. In Asia, Chinese cross-border growth appear to have stabilized.
The recovery in cross-border growth may be offset to some degree by a decline in currency volatilities and the revenue we derive from it. Currency volatilities have been extraordinarily high for the past couple of years, well above long-term averages. At some point, there will be a reversion to the mean or even an overcorrection in the other direction like we saw in 2014. For purposes of our outlook, we are resuming what we did last year, a reversion to the mean in fiscal year '17, but as they say, it will be what it will be.
With the NSPK transition behind us in Russia, debit gains in Brazil, Costco and USAA volumes in the U.S., we expect process transactions growth to tick up in FY '17 ex Europe. European process transaction growth rates will slow down as we lap the rapid acceleration of contactless transactions in the U.K. in fiscal year '16.
We finished FY '16 with client incentives as a percent of gross revenues approaching 19% in the second half. Our outlook anticipates a range of 20.5% to 21.5% in fiscal year '17, a 1.5 to 2.5 points increase. There are several factors driving this increase. About half of the year-over-year increase is driven by the inclusion of Visa Europe for the full year and the impact of eliminating rebates and replacing them with performance-based client incentives. In our filings of Visa Europe numbers for the first 3 quarters of FY '16 that you have seen, U.S. GAAP accounting requires that rebates are netted from gross revenues. When we eliminated rebates at the end of September, it has the effect of increasing Visa Europe's gross fiscal year '17 revenues and in parallel, Visa Europe's fiscal year '17 client incentives as we replaced these rebates with appropriate market competitive incentives. The net effect of this change in the European pricing structure and the overall level of client incentives in Europe accounts for about half of the increase from 19% in Q4 to the range we provided for fiscal year '17. The other half of the year-over-year step-up in client incentives as a percentage of gross revenues is driven by a full year of Costco incentives and the impact of several large renewals completed in fiscal year '16, particularly in Asia.
When you put all this together, we expect constant dollar net revenue growth in the high teens in fiscal year '17 moderated to the 16% to 18% range in nominal dollars by an estimated 1 to 1.5 point exchange rate impact. This currency translation impact may be larger than you are anticipating based on dollar spot rates of forward curves. Let me explain why this is the case.
It has to do with our long standing practice of layering on monthly hedges no different than what most global companies do. This approach to hedging is not seeking to make directional bets on currencies but rather, to dampen the effect of changes in the trend of the dollar. When the dollar strengthens, these hedges delay the cost, and when the dollar weakens, they delay the benefit, essentially mitigating volatility. In fiscal year '16, the hedges helped in the first half, and then as the dollar started to weaken, they hurt in the second half. This will continue into fiscal year '17. The hedges in place will be a drag in the first half. If the dollar stabilizes as currency forwards is suggesting, they will be neutral in the second half. The total exchange rate drag on net revenues could be 2 to 2.5 points in the first quarter comparable to Q4 FY '16, moderating through the year to 0.5 in Q4 FY '17.
On the expense front, we will continue to invest as aggressively as we need to on all our key growth initiatives, including the global expansion of Visa Checkout, Visa Token Service and Visa innovation centers. We will continue to build on our Visa Developer platform, our data and analytics capabilities, loyalty and offers, mVisa and other key programs. In parallel, as we have done in fiscal year '17, we will look to gain efficiencies in other parts of our business by enhancing productivity and adding capabilities in lower-cost locations.
Excluding Europe, we expect expense growth to return to the mid-single-digit range in fiscal year '17. In terms of the expense base in Europe, after the consultation process is completed, we will implement our plan. While this will reduce costs in some areas, we will be investing in Europe to roll out Visa Checkout and our other digital services as well as adding to our sales and marketing resources to bring all the benefits of global Visa to our European clients as fast as we can. We will also incur approximately $18 million in Visa Europe integration costs in fiscal year '17. These are costs to harmonize the 2 technology platforms.
Our technology teams are in the process of aligning authorization clearance, clearance and settlement systems, upgrading network compute and storage infrastructure, implementing next-generation information security systems, preparing to move to common end user and corporate platform. As you may recall, we had indicated that the technology integration would not be complete until late 2019, early 2020.
We had estimated total integration costs in the $450 million to $500 million range over this time frame. While these are not recurring costs, we will incur these costs for the next 3 years until we complete the full integration of Visa Europe. We will call these costs out as we have in our outlook. However, we do not plan to adjust these costs from our GAAP numbers when we report each quarter. Of course, these integration costs will not be incurred once the technology integration is complete. Also, as we have indicated, additional cost savings will be realized when we combine the technology platform.
It is important to highlight one item that you need to adjust for as you consolidate Visa Europe into Visa Inc. Prior to the acquisition, as you all know, there were inter-company charges that flowed between Visa Europe and Visa Inc. These are expenses for Visa Europe and revenues for Visa Inc.
The largest item was the Visa Europe license fee. The other major charge was to network processing services provided by Visa Inc. For the first 3 quarters of fiscal year '16, these inter-company charges amounted to $191 million. 2/3 were recognized as other revenues in the Visa, Inc. income statement and the remainder in data processing revenues. At Visa Europe, 1/3 of the expense hit the network and processing line, and most of the rest was in G&A with a small amount in personnel.
Post the acquisition, these inter-company revenues and expenses completely offset one another and are eliminated in consolidation. Therefore, none of these revenues and expense amounts are included in the reported fourth quarter numbers. All will be included going forward. If you do not adjust for these changes, your FY '16 baseline for Visa Europe operating expenses would be overstated by $191 million as would your fiscal year '16 baseline for Visa Inc. revenues.
In terms of costs related to China market entry, the timing remains uncertain. We had assumed we would be much further along at this point when we talked to you last year. It is our intent to move very fast to set up our processing infrastructure once we have greater clarity from the BPOC around time lines for their decision on granting licenses. At this point, it is difficult to know for sure what costs related to China market entry will be incurred in fiscal year '17. We have made some assumptions in our outlook, and we'll update you as we learn more.
Moving on to interest and taxes. Interest expense will increase almost 40% in fiscal year '17 from a full year of interest on the $16 billion in debt issued in December 2015 as well as the $2 billion in debt we plan to issue before the end of this calendar year, market conditions permitting. Our fiscal year '17 tax rate will increase due to Visa Europe. As you know, under the current structure, Visa Europe is a U.S. tax prayer. The current tax structure affords us some cash tax benefit but has the effect of increasing our book or GAAP tax rate due to restrictions on the credits we can take on taxes we pay in the U.K. As we had indicated previously, this structure increases our reported tax rate by 100 basis points to the low 30s range.
As you estimate our fiscal year '17 EPS, it's important to remember that we issued 79 million preferred shares as part of the consideration for Visa Europe. These shares are now included in our fully diluted share count, which is up 54 million net of buybacks completed in the fourth quarter. We have ramped up our buyback program to offset the dilutive impact of the shares issued. In fiscal year '17, our buyback based in dollars should be roughly at the same level as fiscal year '16. At this pace, by the end of '17, we would have bought back almost 5 billion more than our normal course buyback or offset almost 80% of stock issued. We will maintain the stepped up pace of buybacks until we complete this program in early fiscal year '18.
With a full year of interest expense as well as $2 billion more in debt, with a higher GAAP tax rate and with additional shares outstanding, our EPS growth rate in fiscal year '17 will be lower than net revenue growth. In nominal terms, our outlook anticipates mid-teens EPS growth from an adjusted fiscal year '16 baseline of $2.84. This includes a 1.5 to 2 points drag from exchange rates mostly due to the impact of hedging described earlier. As with revenues, the drag from exchange rates will be higher in the first half comparable to fourth quarter '16 levels in Q1 and moderating through the year.
Our EPS outlook assumes EPS accretion from Visa Europe will be in the 2% to 3% range in fiscal year '17 as expected. The accretive impact of Visa Europe is greater in the second and third quarters when we had interest expense last year from debt issued for the transaction, but no income from Visa Europe till the fourth quarter. Also, benefits from our cost reduction actions start being realized in the second quarter. Visa Europe is tracking well relative to our expectations, and we remain confident that accretion will climb to the high single-digit range by 2020 once we have implemented all our plans to improve yield and lower costs.
In summary, we feel good about fiscal year '17. The Visa Europe integration is proceeding well and delivering as expected. Payment volume momentum remains robust globally. Transactions growth remains healthy. Cross-border volumes are recovering as the dollar stabilizes and comparisons become easier. Gas prices and exchange rate drags are easing.
As always, there are risks to watch. The global economy remains sluggish especially in Europe. The cross-border business in Europe is slowing. Currency volatilities could moderate. Balancing these factors, our fiscal year '17 outlook anticipates 16% to 18% net revenue growth and mid-teens EPS growth in nominal dollars. As always, we'll update our views as the year unfolds and share them with you each quarter.
With that, I'll turn the call back to Jack."

Our revenue growth, if you adjust for the exchange rate drag, which perhaps you would -- you may not have anticipated without thinking about the hedging implications, and you might have seen the hedging implications in our second half results. I mean, our currency impact essentially stayed flat through the year mostly because hedging helped in the first half and hurt a bit in the second half, and all it does really is delay the impact of the moves in the dollar. But if you adjust for the hedging impact, what you're seeing is high-teens revenue growth -- net revenue growth. And what you're seeing is mid-teens plus 1.5 to 2 points EPS growth. It's not that different than perhaps what you might have expected of us going into the year. Visa Europe is tracking as we expected. We feel very good about it. What could surprise one way or another, we laid out all the factors. Clearly, the cross-border trends are hardening, and hopefully, if the dollar stays on this track, which is either stable or further weakening, that would be good for us. I think currency forwards are now expecting more of a flattening of the dollar, which is sort of what we've assumed. In terms of the currency volatility front, that's a little bit of anybody's guess. We did tell you sort of what we are assuming. But overall, I mean, if there is going to be anything on the plus or minus side, we have assumed that the European trends have softened through the year, and we've assumed that those trends will continue into next year. Hopefully, European economies will do better than that, and if that does, that will be great."

We also saw quite a bit of growth in the acquired business in the U.K. from the weakness of the pound. We saw improvement in the acquired business in places like Mexico mostly benefiting from the U.S. Those are some of the big growth spots. The good news though was, from an issuing standpoint, we saw growth in a lot of places. We saw growth coming out of Brazil, out of Russia, out of many of the commodity- and oil-based economies, Middle East and parts of Asia also improving and China beginning to stabilize.

I think we had most people report their co-badged volumes in the fourth quarter. So the fourth quarter number ended up being their relatively untainted by lack of reporting, and I think the payment volumes, if I remember right, was somewhere in the 6% range. So as you can see, they are lower than what we see in other parts of the world in terms of growth rates. As we look at next year, the issue on co-badged volumes is that there are a certain number of issuers that have co-badged cards with us who are no longer required to report their co-badged volumes and transactions we do not process. The biggest impact is in France, and there's some impact in some Scandinavian countries. If they don't all report, which is what we expect, we expect that they will all not report, then payment volumes will decline next year, we said, as much as 15% to 20%. So remember, I mean, if it's plus 6 and minus 20, that's a delta of almost 25 or 26. Plus, as you know, in the first 3 quarters, Visa Europe payment volumes will show up as all incremental to our payment volume and will have this impact on it. So you will see a fair amount of distortion in payment volume reporting as a result of this. Now the lack of payment volume reporting and its revenue impacts, we factored into our outlook. So that is all factored into what we told you our revenue picture is next year. But the payment volumes will look odd. Although, we report by region, so at least, you'll be able to see what it is by region and be able to look at how everybody else is doing. And Europe will just look odd."

Listen, I mean, first of all, I think -- and I really do believe this, which is it's -- and I said this when we did this -- did the call last week, which is, I mean, you all know as well as I do that companies like this are not dependent on any one person, right? There are 13,000 other people here that are going to continue doing what they've done the day after I go. And with a leader like Al, I would assume, will do it as well, if not, better. And so as we think about what we've done over the past 4 years or even what this company has done since it's gone public, it's based upon what an entire management team has done. I think that what I feel very good about when I think about the things that we've done, I think, you brought up the work on -- that we have really -- I would describe as we've really begun to do with merchants, is an important part of the way we think about what we do. We are not trying to do work for merchants in lieu of any other client or any other partner but just recognizing that everyone participates in the payments value chain should get access to the capabilities that we have. And so someone asked me last week, if I were them, how would they evaluate how we're doing at making progress with merchants. And my answer was I would look to see that we're continuing quarter after quarter, year after year to introduce solutions in the marketplace, which help merchants grow their business and then try and derive some kind of understanding of what the adoption looks like for those products. And don't be confused by a couple of merchants that are always going to be unhappy, that are always going to be doing things in the marketplace. The merchant world is very fragmented across the world. We've got some very, very strong relationships, and we've got a bunch of relationships where those merchants are sitting there very eager to work with us on the solutions that we're developing. And then, I think, just not -- because I don't want to take up the whole call with the question. I do think just when I think about the way we thought about innovation here and the way we thought about our work in digital commerce, I think we've just -- the whole organization has just made tremendous progress. We don't talk about -- let me say it differently. We don't use the word innovation around here anymore because it becomes part of the way people think about doing their business. We're rooted in supporting our client base and supporting the 4-party model, but we are very focused on being as successful and having our clients be successful in the digital world. And whether it's the work in the dev center, the APIs that we've made available, all of the things that we've done that position us well in the world of digital commerce, including Visa Checkout, those are all part of those things. So everything we do is about continuing to be strong in the physical world but recognizing that we needed to think very differently in the digital world. There's a tremendous amount more to do, so I don't want to -- I don't think about this as if we've done it, and it's time for me to move on. I think we've done an awful lot. But I'm confident that those activities and the way people think is the way the organization thinks."

The level of investment remains as steady as it has been, and we'll continue to drive productivity. I mean, some of the charge we took is a reflection of that.

And there are also quarter-by-quarter impacts, Visa Europe brand, a relatively higher level of incentives in first half of the year, somewhat lower in the second half if you looked to the filings we had done. So the full impact of Europe was really not as visible in the fourth quarter because the rebates to client incentive shift was not in place in the fourth quarter. Costco, yes, we had some of the incentives then this year. But clearly, it's a full year of Costco, so you'll see the full impact. Plus, there's a whole bunch of renewals I talked about that really start flowing into next year, mostly the ones we did in Asia. So it's all these altogether."

And so when we think about what it means for us, we know the capabilities that we have. When we think about what we've done and the way we've positioned ourselves with Visa Direct and getting access on a push payments basis to 3 billion cards across the world, we feel really good about position that we have with those capabilities. It doesn't mean that, that's all we're thinking about and all that we're doing, and you've seen us do some work in the -- as you've mentioned, in the blockchain space, thinking more about where are payments inefficient. And for what we do in our traditional consumer-to-business world, that's not a problem that needs to get solved today in terms of what blockchain can do. But certainly, in the commercial space, it's a very, very inefficient market, and there are opportunities to use different technologies to bring some efficiency there. So the things that we're doing, they are around doing things to improve something that exists. And for the core business of what we do today between consumers and merchants and it will be through consumers to consumers in terms of using our push payment capabilities, it's leveraging the core assets that we have that work really well that have access to these 3 billion cards across the world."

And I just think the continued 100 basis point range is because we know a bunch of it has been signed, and it's just a question of how those volumes play out. But we do -- as Vasant said, we'll sign some new deals throughout the year that will impact those numbers, and we make assumptions on what that looks like."

So we -- I mean, our team is extraordinarily professional, and I personally -- just, I think I just have every level of confidence that they'll do that well. And to the timing question, I think this is one where someone asked the question about -- before about -- on guidance aggressive or conservative. I think this is one -- we've been very clear about this, which is we could do this quicker. It's not a question of us doing the work to build out those additional capabilities. That will be done relative quickly -- relatively quickly, I'm sorry. The real question is what's the appropriate pace to complete these conversions along with our clients. And what we've said is that we don't intend to rush that. This is the type of thing that we have to do in a way that fits in with things that work for clients. And I think that's just a smart way. I think you would want us to think about it that way. We got -- we'll get plenty of benefits in the next couple of years from Europe. There'll be plenty more beyond that, that we should do this the right way."

Let me start with a few comments about our Fiscal Fourth Quarter Financial Results. First of all, as you can see with the inclusion of Visa Europe, the quarter and our thoughts on next year will be somewhat complicated, but we will do our best to provide clarity on what's driving our results, both in my remarks but probably more importantly, in Vasant's remarks as he goes through the detail.
Overall, we feel very good about the solid financial results in the Fourth Quarter. Results were better than our expectations. GAAP EPS of $0.79 included 2 special items, the $110 million charge for severance cost and $88 million noncash and nonrecurring gain for the remeasurement of a deferred tax liability related to the acquisition of Visa Europe. Excluding these items, Fourth Quarter adjusted GAAP EPS was $0.78 per share, an increase of 27%.
Net operating revenue grew 19% this quarter, including the full quarter of Visa Europe and a continued negative 3 percentage point impact from FX. While growth continues to be subdued by some of the same items we've spoken about previously, we're starting to see improvements as we expected. And our business model, as you've seen, continues to be resilient.
I would be remiss if I didn't mention last week's 18% dividend increase to $0.165 per quarter. We continue to be consistent in returning excess capital to our shareholders. 
We turn now and talk for a couple of minutes about payments volume. U.S. payments volume growth was 11% in the Fourth Quarter, up 1 percentage point from Q3. U.S. credit payments volume improved to 19% from 11% in the June Quarter, primarily driven by the positive impact of Costco and USAA. U.S. debit payments volume grew at 3% down from 9% in the quarter. The lower growth was primarily driven by Interlink, and remember, the impact to revenue of this is minimal. International payments, constant dollar volume growth ex Europe was 9%. Cross-border volume growth accelerated to 10% when normalized for Europe, up from 9% in the Third Quarter. Process transaction growth was 12% and accelerated 1 point from the Third Quarter when normalized for Europe as well. 
More recently, through October 21, U.S. payment volume growth was 12%, up 1 percentage point from the Fourth Quarter. U.S. credit grew 20%, up 1 point from the September quarter. U.S. debit grew 5%, an improvement from the 3% in the fiscal Q4. Cross-border growth in constant dollars is 11% when normalized for Europe, and process transactions was 12% when normalized for Europe.
Just a few comments about Europe. The integration itself is going extremely well. We just couldn't be happier with the interaction between the two companies, and we are well underway to putting all of the functions together and operating seamlessly as one global entity.
Importantly, renewal activity continues to be very strong. We've signed multi-year debit agreements with RBS and Lloyds Banking Group and multi-year credit and debit agreements with Barclays and Nationwide. We have very good engagement with clients on our products and digital road map, including Visa Checkout, which is being rolled out as we speak. Vasant will discuss in more detail how we're doing financially, but things are playing out as we would have expected so far.
And around the rest of the globe, client activity continues to remain very strong. To name just a few, we renewed a multi-year debit and credit partnership with BBVA Bancomer Mexico. We renewed our credit partnership with China Merchants Bank and China  CITIC Bank, and in Russia, we renewed multi-year credit partnerships with Alfa Bank and VTB 24.
We turn -- just talk for a couple of minutes about Visa Checkout. We ended fiscal 2016 with over 15 million consumer accounts in 21 countries and over 1,400 financial institution partners across the globe participating. More than 300,000 merchants, including some of the largest global retailers, have signed on to accept Visa Checkout, representing $162 billion in addressable volume. In October, we rolled out a redesigned Visa Checkout experience to all global merchants. This new experience makes it easier for consumers to sign up and complete purchases on mobile devices.
We also announced earlier today that we're opening the Visa Checkout platform to clients and partners, allowing them to integrate their digital wallets into Visa Checkout for streamlined authentication and checkout. Leading Visa financial institutions and partners, such as Google's Android Pay, will take advantage of the new open platform by offering Visa Checkout to their customers for online purchases. Issuers, digital wallets and payment app providers can access a streamlined set of APIs to easily integrate Visa Checkout open platform and immediately begin to offer payments to their customers shopping online on their mobile devices.
For example, an online shopper who uses a digital wallet from participating -- from a participating Visa issuer or Android Pay would simply click the Visa Checkout button on a merchant's checkout page and authentic their identity through biometrics to complete a purchase.
We move on to another topic. We continue to invest in new products and services to help our merchant clients. In September, we announced Visa Advertising Solutions, a new suite of products specifically built to help merchants reach new customers and understand if their digital advertising efforts are influencing consumer purchases -- purchasing decisions online and in-store. 
Visa Ad Measurement and Visa Audiences are products that integrate with ad tech platforms like Oracle Data Cloud, allowing Visa's merchants to easily access valuable insights when executing a digital ad campaign. Top quick service restaurants and retail merchants such as Banana Republic have used Visa Ad Measurement reports to understand sales impact and optimize their marketing campaigns. Visa Advertising Solutions are available to merchants through leading digital platforms such as Facebook, Google, Twitter, Pinterest and over 200 other media networks.
We've spoken about this before, but I do want to highlight the success that we're seeing in our global network of innovation centers. In addition to [ph] 1 Market Street in San Francisco, we've opened innovation centers in Singapore in April, Dubai in May, Miami in June and plans to launch one in New York in January as well as London and São Paulo.
In 2016 alone, we held over 600 client engagements globally with over 200 clients participating. These range from tours and demos to multi-day hackathons and in depth co-creation sessions. These are forms where we can demonstrate where we think payments are going in each geography, but our goal is to develop real-time solutions with clients that they can implement very quickly.
Fast payments continues to be an important opportunity around the world, and we're having good success working with clients and partners to capture the opportunity, using our Visa Direct push payment product platform. Annual Visa Direct PV exceeds $29 billion globally for the period September 16, and annual U.S. Visa Direct volumes topped $5 billion for the first time ending September 2016. Growth exceeds 250% from the same period last year. Globally, nearly 3 billion Visa cards are enabled to receive push payments. We're working with key partners, including EWS, FIS, Fiserv, Jack Henry, Stripe, Ingo money, Square and Green Dot. 
I also want to talk for a minute about how we're using push payments to electronify payments in developing economies. We recently launched a new service called mVisa in India, Kenya and Rwanda, and we plan to expand to several other markets around the world during 2017. mVisa allows consumer to transfer money to a merchant in real time with nothing more than their mobile phone. And merchants are able to start accepting Visa transactions immediately without any additional hardware. We've seen early success in several different categories, including small micro merchants, local transportation, such as taxi, and bill payment. You'll likely hear much more in the future about these efforts.
Tokenization continues to be very important part of ensuring safe and secure mobile payment solutions. We recently announced new specifications that allow certified third parties to connect directly to our Token Service and become Token Service providers. These TSPs will be able to provide a range of services for Visa tokens, including new account provisioning and life cycle management. By expanding access to the Visa Token Service to new partners, Visa issuers will be able to more quickly and easily offer secured digital payment services across a wide range of devices. 
I'll let Vasant talk in detail about our outlook for 2017 but just a few comments from me. We entered 2017 certainly with fewer headwinds as we did entering 2016, and we do have some tailwinds. On the negative side, the global economy is not improving. Geopolitical tensions are high. The U.S. election is a wildcard, and we continue to watch the impact of Brexit. But Costco and USAA meaningfully improved volumes with USAA being an important contributor to revenues in the U.S. while Costco, far less so. Cross-border volumes are both lapping decreases and have improved, and we will have a full year benefit from Europe, which, as I said, is performing as expected.
Since this is my last call, I do want to make just a few closing comments. I'm so proud to have been associated with Visa, its clients, its partners and its employees. I hope you feel that this is a different company than 4 years ago and that the things we've done have positioned the company well for the future. We focused our work on providing payments leadership and a platform, which will enable our clients, all clients, to grow their franchises.
The competition is strong, and the canvas is still being painted as the industry evolves. But our position is strong, and our assets are exceptional. And always keep in mind as we think about what's going on around the world and we look at the risks and opportunity, this is a very global business. The competitive issues are different geography by geography, but opportunities exist around the world for us to grow our share. While there's always risk and many are trying to figure out how to advantage themselves as commerce moves to digital platforms, there is more opportunity globally than ever before for Visa.
Vasant?"

For the full quarter of Visa Europe in our numbers for the first time, we had a strong finish to fiscal year 2016. On a GAAP basis, fiscal Fourth Quarter revenues are up 19%; operating income, up 15%; and EPS, up 28%. We closed FY '16",3287,"Thank you, Charlie. For the full quarter of Visa Europe in our numbers for the first time, we had a strong finish to fiscal year 2016. On a GAAP basis, fiscal Fourth Quarter revenues are up 19%; operating income, up 15%; and EPS, up 28%. We closed FY '16 with full year revenues of $15 billion, net income of $6 billion and EPS at $2.48. On an adjusted basis, operating income for the Fourth Quarter was up 20% and EPS was up 27%. Net income for the full year was $6.9 billion, and EPS was $2.84.
For the remainder of my comments, I will be referring to adjusted results. A few points to note. First, payment volumes on a constant dollar basis continued to grow at double-digit rates globally. The secular shift away from cash continues at a fast clip around the world. Credit growth outstripped debit growth, helped by Costco and USAA.
Second, cross-border constant dollar volume growth recovered to double-digit levels. The dollar has stabilized, helping our large U.S.-acquired business. In addition, oil price stability and a nascent recovery in emerging markets has helped outbound commerce across most regions. Only Europe slowed due to general economic weakness as well as the impact of the Brexit vote on the euro and the pound. Easier year-over-year comparisons are also helping.
Third, we had 2 special items in the quarter that largely offset each other. We took a charge for severance costs associated with actions we are implementing across Visa, including the reductions we are planning to make at Visa Europe. The consultation process is underway in Europe, and we expect it will be completed before the end of 2016, after which we will begin to implement the agreed-upon plan.
As we integrate Europe into the rest of Visa, we have taken the opportunity, as we told you we would, to look at our global cost structure, and we'll make some adjustments. Offsetting this charge was a nonrecurring, noncash tax benefit from the reduction in the U.K. corporate tax rate, which reduced our U.K. deferred tax liability.
Finally, as you know, we issued preferred shares for the Visa Europe acquisition. We also bought back 20.5 million shares in the Fourth Quarter for $1.66 billion We ended the quarter with a weighted average share count of 2.44 billion, up 54 million from Q3. For the full year fiscal year '16, we bought back 92 million shares for $7.1 billion at an average price of $77.13. This is approximately $2 billion higher than what our normal course buyback would have been last year. The additional buyback reflects our intent to offset the dilutive impact of the preferred shares issued and will continue into early fiscal year '18 as we previously indicated.
I'll quickly review business drivers and financial results for the quarter and fiscal year '16, then spend most of my time on our outlook for FY '17. At least for this quarter, we will highlight the impact of adding in Visa Europe where it is helpful to better understand our results. U.S. payment volumes grew 11% in Q4 as U.S. credit grew 19%, helped by USAA and Costco volumes. U.S. debit grew 3% due to lapping a significant new account win in our Interlink business in Q4 last year and the impact of PIN debit routing this quarter.  Adjusted for Interlink volumes, the U.S. debit growth trend was unchanged from the prior quarter. As merchants make routing decisions based on incentive deals in place with various networks, we expect there will continue to be volatility in our Interlink growth rates. However, given the relative size of this business, the impact on our total revenues will be minimal.
International payment volumes ex Europe grew 9% in constant dollars, but takedown from the prior quarter trend was largely due to the lapping effect of a large Chinese bank, which started including previously unreported domestic volumes in Q3 last year. Ex China, growth rates remained strong in Asia as well as Latin America. The Middle East and Russia was stable, but Sub-Saharan Africa was a soft spot.
In Europe, new regulation that went into effect in June no longer require issuers of co-badged cards to report domestic volumes we do not process. This will distort year-over-year comparisons throughout fiscal '17. Excluding Europe, cross-border constant dollar growth rate stepped up to 10% in Q4. This is the first time we have reported double-digit cross-border volume growth since Q4 fiscal year '14.
The weakening dollar is driving a recovery in our large U.S.-acquired business as well as outbound commerce from Canada. Cross-border growth in North America climbed to 9%, a rate of growth we have not seen since the end of 2013.
Internationally, cross-border growth rates stepped up across all geographies, helped by stabilizing oil prices and recovering emerging markets. Cross-border growth rates in China have stabilized in the mid-single digits. The only region ticking down in growth was Europe as the weak pound post Brexit has hurt outbound commerce from the U.K. Excluding Europe, transactions processed over VisaNet grew 11%. A small step-up from the prior quarter was due to the NSPK effect in Russia. As you know, our reported transactions growth was hurt in the past 5 quarters as we transitioned processing to NSPK starting in the Third Quarter of fiscal year '15. Transactions processed in Europe grew 15%, in line with the previous quarter.
Net revenues grew 19% in Q4, 6% excluding the impact of Europe. Expenses grew 18%, 5% excluding Europe. We finished the year with adjusted EPS of $2.84. If you exclude the impact of the Visa Europe acquisition, which is interest expense from the debt issued, the shares issued as well as Europe's income and other onetime items, our EPS grew 10% in nominal dollars and 14% in constant dollars. We were able to deliver this growth despite a soft revenue picture caused by the strong dollar, the oil and commodity price collapse impacting many regions as well as a slowdown in China. We were able to hold fiscal year '16 expense growth to 1% ex Europe while continuing to invest heavily in all our critical long-term initiatives such as Visa Checkout, Visa Token Service, Visa Developer platform, our innovation centers, our marketing around the Rio Olympics and other programs.
We enter fiscal year 2017 with some tailwinds. Costco and USAA conversions are now well underway as you saw from our Q4 payment volumes. Cross-border growth rates have recovered as the dollar stabilizes, and we have easier year-over-year comparisons. Two significant drags from prior years is the translational impact of the strong dollar and gas price declines. We begin to benefit from the Visa Europe acquisition with yield improvements, cost reductions and EPS accretion.
Balancing these tailwinds are some headwinds: economic weakness in Europe and Brexit uncertainty, hurting both domestic and cross-border volumes; a global economy that remains generally sluggish; a potential decline in treasury revenues as volatility subsides from the extraordinary high levels we have experienced in the past 2 years; and finally, a step-up in client incentives as we bring on Costco and other major renewals as well as folding in Europe. We'll review how all these factors drive our outlook for 2017, starting with payments volume.
USAA and Costco will drive payments volume growth in the U.S. However, we expect international payments volume growth to slow down modestly due to weakness in Europe and China. Reported European payment volume numbers will be distorted by the change in co-badged volume reporting. If no co-badged volume is included, reported European payment volumes could be down 15% to 20%, dragging reported global payments growth down by as much as 7 to 8 percentage points with a larger impact on the first 3 quarters.
As you saw in Q4, cross-border volumes are recovering, helped by easier comparisons, the stabilizing dollar and oil prices as well as improving emerging market economies. In Europe, cross-border growth rates have been trending through fiscal year '16, and we anticipate that this will continue as the pound remains weak and economies across Europe struggle. Inbound commerce into the U.S. will likely grow after 2 consecutive years of decline. Outbound commerce is expected to recover in the Middle East, Africa and Latin America. In Asia, Chinese cross-border growth appears to have stabilized.
The recovery in cross-border growth may be offset to some degree by a decline in currency volatilities and the revenue we derive from it. Currency volatilities have been extraordinarily high for the past couple of years, well above long-term averages. At some point, there will be a reversion to the mean or even an overcorrection in the other direction like we saw in 2014. For purposes of our outlook, we are resuming what we did last year, a reversion to the mean in fiscal year '17, but as they say, it will be what it will be.
With the NSPK transition behind us in Russia, debit gains in Brazil, Costco and USAA volumes in the U.S., we expect process transactions growth to tick up in FY '17 ex Europe. European process transaction growth rates will slow down as we lap the rapid acceleration of contact-less transactions in the U.K. in fiscal year '16.
We finished FY '16 with client incentives as a percent of gross revenues approaching 19% in the second half. Our outlook anticipates a range of 20.5% to 21.5% in fiscal year '17, a 1.5 to 2.5 points increase. There are several factors driving this increase. About half of the year-over-year increase is driven by the inclusion of Visa Europe for the full year and the impact of eliminating rebates and replacing them with performance-based client incentives. In our filings of Visa Europe numbers for the first 3 quarters of FY '16 that you have seen, U.S. GAAP accounting requires that rebates are netted from gross revenues. When we eliminated rebates at the end of September, it has the effect of increasing Visa Europe's gross fiscal year '17 revenues and in parallel, Visa Europe's fiscal year '17 client incentives as we replaced these rebates with appropriate market competitive incentives. The net effect of this change in the European pricing structure and the overall level of client incentives in Europe accounts for about half of the increase from 19% in Q4 to the range we provided for fiscal year '17. The other half of the year-over-year step-up in client incentives as a percentage of gross revenues is driven by a full year of Costco incentives and the impact of several large renewals completed in fiscal year '16, particularly in Asia.
When you put all this together, we expect constant dollar net revenue growth in the high teens in fiscal year '17 moderated to the 16% to 18% range in nominal dollars by an estimated 1 to 1.5 point exchange rate impact. This currency translation impact may be larger than you are anticipating based on dollar spot rates of forward curves. Let me explain why this is the case.
It has to do with our long standing practice of layering on monthly hedges no different than what most global companies do. This approach to hedging is not seeking to make directional bets on currencies but rather, to dampen the effect of changes in the trend of the dollar. When the dollar strengthens, these hedges delay the cost, and when the dollar weakens, they delay the benefit, essentially mitigating volatility. In fiscal year '16, the hedges helped in the first half, and then as the dollar started to weaken, they hurt in the second half. This will continue into fiscal year '17. The hedges in place will be a drag in the first half. If the dollar stabilizes as currency forwards is suggesting, they will be neutral in the second half. The total exchange rate drag on net revenues could be 2 to 2.5 points in the First Quarter comparable to Q4 FY '16, moderating through the year to 0.5 in Q4 FY '17.
On the expense front, we will continue to invest as aggressively as we need to on all our key growth initiatives, including the global expansion of Visa Checkout, Visa Token Service and Visa innovation centers. We will continue to build on our Visa Developer platform, our data and analytics capabilities, loyalty and offers, mVisa and other key programs. In parallel, as we have done in fiscal year '17, we will look to gain efficiencies in other parts of our business by enhancing productivity and adding capabilities in lower-cost locations.
Excluding Europe, we expect expense growth to return to the mid-single-digit range in fiscal year '17. In terms of the expense base in Europe, after the consultation process is completed, we will implement our plan. While this will reduce costs in some areas, we will be investing in Europe to roll out Visa Checkout and our other digital services as well as adding to our sales and marketing resources to bring all the benefits of global Visa to our European clients as fast as we can. We will also incur approximately $18 million in Visa Europe integration costs in fiscal year '17. These are costs to harmonize the 2 technology platforms.
Our technology teams are in the process of aligning authorization clearance, clearance and settlement systems, upgrading network compute and storage infrastructure, implementing next-generation information security systems, preparing to move to common end user and corporate platforms. As you may recall, we had indicated that the technology integration would not be complete until late 2019, early 2020.
We had estimated total integration costs in the $450 million to $500 million range over this time frame. While these are not recurring costs, we will incur these costs for the next 3 years until we complete the full integration of Visa Europe. We will call these costs out, as we have in our outlook. However, we do not plan to adjust these costs from our GAAP numbers when we report each quarter. Of course, these integration costs will not be incurred once the technology integration is complete. Also, as we have indicated, additional cost savings will be realized when we combine the technology platform.
It is important to highlight one item that you need to adjust for as you consolidate Visa Europe into Visa Inc. Prior to the acquisition, as you all know, there were inter-company charges that flowed between Visa Europe and Visa Inc. These were expenses for Visa Europe and revenues for Visa Inc.
The largest item was the Visa Europe license fee. The other major charge was for network processing services provided by Visa Inc. For the first 3 quarters of fiscal year '16, these inter-company charges amounted to $191 million. 2/3 were recognized as other revenues in the Visa, Inc. income statement and the remainder in data processing revenues. At Visa Europe, 1/3 of the expense hit the network and processing line, and most of the rest was in G&A with a small amount in personnel.
Post the acquisition, these inter-company revenues and expenses completely offset one another and are eliminated in consolidation. Therefore, none of these revenues and expense amounts are included in the reported Fourth Quarter numbers. All will be included going forward. If you do not adjust for these changes, your FY '16 baseline for Visa Europe operating expenses would be overstated by $191 million as would your fiscal year '16 baseline for Visa Inc. revenues.
In terms of costs related to China market entry, the timing remains uncertain. We had assumed we would be much further along at this point when we talked to you last year. It is our intent to move very fast to set up our processing infrastructure once we have greater clarity from the BPOC [ph] around time lines for their decision on granting licenses. At this point, it is difficult to know for sure what costs related to China market entry will be incurred in fiscal year '17. We have made some assumptions in our outlook, and we'll update you as we learn more.
Moving on to interest and taxes. Interest expense will increase almost 40% in fiscal year '17 from a full year of interest on the $16 billion in debt issued in December 2015 as well as the $2 billion in debt we plan to issue before the end of this calendar year, market conditions permitting. Our fiscal year '17 tax rate will increase due to Visa Europe. As you know, under the current structure, Visa Europe is a U.S. tax prayer. The current tax structure affords us some cash tax benefit but has the effect of increasing our book or GAAP tax rate due to restrictions on the credits we can take on taxes we pay in the U.K. As we had indicated previously, this structure increases our reported tax rate by 100 basis points to the low 30s range.
As you estimate our fiscal year '17 EPS, it's important to remember that we issued 79 million preferred shares as part of the consideration for Visa Europe. These shares are now included in our fully diluted share count, which is up 54 million net of buybacks completed in the Fourth Quarter. We have ramped up our buyback program to offset the dilutive impact of the shares issued. In fiscal year '17, our buyback based in dollars should be roughly at the same level as fiscal year '16. At this pace, by the end of '17, we would have bought back almost 5 billion more than our normal course buyback or offset almost 80% of stock issued. We will maintain the stepped up pace of buybacks until we complete this program in early fiscal year '18.
With a full year of interest expense as well as $2 billion more in debt, with a higher GAAP tax rate and with additional shares outstanding, our EPS growth rate in fiscal year '17 will be lower than net revenue growth. In nominal terms, our outlook anticipates mid-teens EPS growth from an adjusted fiscal year '16 baseline of $2.84. This includes a 1.5 to 2 points drag from exchange rates mostly due to the impact of hedging described earlier. As with revenues, the drag from exchange rates will be higher in the first half comparable to Fourth Quarter '16 levels in Q1 and moderating through the year.
Our EPS outlook assumes EPS accretion from Visa Europe will be in the 2% to 3% range in fiscal year '17, as expected. The accretive impact of Visa Europe is greater in the Second and Third Quarters when we had interest expense last year from debt issued for the transaction, but no income from Visa Europe till the Fourth Quarter. Also, benefits from our cost reduction actions start being realized in the Second Quarter. Visa Europe is tracking well relative to our expectations, and we remain confident that accretion will climb to the high single-digit range by 2020, once we have implemented all our plans to improve yield and lower costs.
In summary, we feel good about fiscal year '17. The Visa Europe integration is proceeding well and delivering as expected. Payment volume momentum remains robust globally. Transactions growth remains healthy. Cross-border volumes are recovering as the dollar stabilizes and comparisons become easier. Gas prices and exchange rate drags are easing.
As always, there are risks to watch. The global economy remains sluggish especially in Europe. The cross-border business in Europe is slowing. Currency volatilities could moderate. Balancing these factors, our fiscal year '17 outlook anticipates 16% to 18% net revenue growth and mid-teens EPS growth in nominal dollars. As always, we'll update our views as the year unfolds and share them with you each quarter.
With that, I'll turn the call back to Jack."

Our revenue growth, if you adjust for the exchange rate drag, which perhaps you would -- you may not have anticipated without thinking about the hedging implications, and you might have seen the hedging implications in our second half results. I mean, our currency impact essentially stayed flat through the year mostly because hedging helped in the first half and hurt a bit in the second half, and all it does really is delay the impact of the moves in the dollar. But if you adjust for the hedging impact, what you're seeing is high-teens revenue growth -- net revenue growth. And what you're seeing is mid-teens plus 1.5 to 2 points EPS growth. It's not that different than perhaps what you might have expected of us going into the year. Visa Europe is tracking as we expected. We feel very good about it. What could surprise one way or another, we laid out all the factors -- clearly, the cross-border trends are heartening, and hopefully, if the dollar stays on this track, which is either stable or further weakening, that would be good for us. I think currency forwards are now expecting more of a flattening of the dollar, which is sort of what we've assumed. In terms of the currency volatility front, that's a little bit of anybody's guess. We did tell you sort of what we are assuming. But overall, I mean, if there is going to be anything on the plus or minus side, we have assumed that the European trends have softened through the year, and we've assumed that those trends will continue into next year. Hopefully, European economies will do better than that, and if that does, that will be great."

We also saw quite a bit of growth in the acquired business in the U.K. from the weakness of the pound. We saw improvement in the acquired business in places like Mexico mostly benefiting from the U.S. Those are some of the big growth spots. The good news though was, from an issuing standpoint, we saw growth in a lot of places. We saw growth coming out of Brazil, out of Russia, out of many of the commodity- and oil-based economies, Middle East and parts of Asia also improving and China beginning to stabilize. So our expectation going forward is not for a significant change from these trends. You should assume we are hoping that these trends stay roughly about the same."

I think we had most people report their co-badged volumes in the Fourth Quarter. So the Fourth Quarter number ended up being relatively untainted by lack of reporting, and I think the payment volumes, if I remember right, was somewhere in the 6% range. So as you can see, they are lower than what we see in other parts of the world in terms of growth rates. As we look at next year, the issue on co-badged volumes is that there are a certain number of issuers that have co-badged cards with us who are no longer required to report their co-badged volumes and transactions we do not process. The biggest impact is in France, and there's some impact in some Scandinavian countries. If they don't all report, which is what we expect, we expect that they will all not report, then payment volumes will decline next year, we said, as much as 15% to 20%. So remember, I mean, if it's plus 6 and minus 20, that's a delta of almost 25 or 26. Plus, as you know, in the first 3 quarters, Visa Europe payment volumes will show up as all incremental to our payment volume and will have this impact on it. So you will see a fair amount of distortion in payment volume reporting as a result of this. Now the lack of payment volume reporting and its revenue impacts, we factored into our outlook. So that is all factored into what we told you our revenue picture is next year. But the payment volumes will look odd. Although, we report by region, so at least, you'll be able to see what it is by region and be able to look at how everybody else is doing. And Europe will just look odd."

Listen, I mean, first of all, I think -- and I really do believe this, which is it's -- and I said this when we did this -- did the call last week, which is, I mean, you all know as well as I do that companies like this are not dependent on any one person, right? There are 13,000 other people here that are going to continue doing what they've done the day after I go. And with a leader like Al, I would assume, will do it as well, if not, better. And so as we think about what we've done over the past 4 years or even what this company has done since it's gone public, it's based upon what an entire management team has done. I think that what I feel very good about when I think about the things that we've done, I think, you brought up the work on -- that we have really -- I would describe as we've really begun to do with merchants, is an important part of the way we think about what we do. We are not trying to do work for merchants in lieu of any other client or any other partner but just recognizing that everyone who participates in the payments value chain should get access to the capabilities that we have. And so someone asked me last week, if I were them, how would they evaluate how we're doing at making progress with merchants. And my answer was I would look to see that we're continuing quarter after quarter, year after year to introduce solutions in the marketplace, which help merchants grow their business and then try and derive some kind of understanding of what the adoption looks like for those products. And don't be confused by a couple of merchants that are always going to be unhappy, that are always going to be doing things in the marketplace. The merchant world is very fragmented across the world. We've got some very, very strong relationships, and we've got a bunch of relationships where those merchants are sitting there very eager to work with us on the solutions that we're developing. And then, I think, just not -- because I don't want to take up the whole call with the question. I do think just when I think about the way we thought about innovation here and the way we thought about our work in digital commerce, I think we've just -- the whole organization has just made tremendous progress. We don't talk about -- let me say it differently. We don't use the word innovation around here anymore because it becomes part of the way people think about doing their business. We're rooted in supporting our client base and supporting the 4-party model, but we are very focused on being as successful and having our clients be successful in the digital world. And whether it's the work in the dev center, the APIs that we've made available, all of the things that we've done that position us well in the world of digital commerce, including Visa Checkout, those are all part of those things. So everything we do is about continuing to be strong in the physical world but recognizing that we needed to think very differently in the digital world. There's a tremendous amount more to do, so I don't want to -- I don't think about this as if we've done it, and it's time for me to move on. I think we've done an awful lot. But I'm confident that those activities and the way people think is the way the organization thinks."

The level of investment remains as steady as it has been, and we'll continue to drive productivity. I mean, some of the charge we took is a reflection of that. So that was in terms of the expense growth rate.

And there are also quarter-by-quarter impacts, Visa Europe brand, a relatively higher level of incentives in first half of the year, somewhat lower in the second half if you looked to the filings we had done. So the full impact of Europe was really not as visible in the Fourth Quarter because the rebates to client incentive shift was not in place in the Fourth Quarter. Costco, yes, we had some of the incentives then this year. But clearly, it's a full year of Costco, so you'll see the full impact. Plus, there's a whole bunch of renewals I talked about that really start flowing into next year, mostly the ones we did in Asia. So it's all these altogether."

And so when we think about what it means for us, we know the capabilities that we have. When we think about what we've done and the way we've positioned ourselves with Visa Direct and getting access on a push payments basis to 3 billion cards across the world, we feel really good about position that we have with those capabilities. It doesn't mean that, that's all we're thinking about and all that we're doing, and you've seen us do some work in the -- as you've mentioned, in the blockchain space, thinking more about where are payments inefficient. And for what we do in our traditional consumer-to-business world, that's not a problem that needs to get solved today in terms of what blockchain can do. But certainly, in the commercial space, it's a very, very inefficient market, and there are opportunities to use different technologies to bring some efficiency there. So the things that we're doing, they are around doing things to improve something that exists. And for the core business of what we do today between consumers and merchants and it will be through consumers to consumers in terms of using our push payment capabilities, it's leveraging the core assets that we have that work really well that have access to these 3 billion cards across the world."

That will be done relative quickly -- relatively quickly, I'm sorry -- the real question is what's the appropriate pace to complete these conversions along with our clients. And what we've said is that we don't intend to rush that. This is the type of thing that we have to do in a way that fits in with things that work for clients. And I think that's just a smart way. I think you would want us to think about it that way. We got -- we'll get plenty of benefits in the next couple of years from Europe. There'll be plenty more beyond that, that we should do this the right way."

Let me start with a few comments about our fiscal fourth quarter financial results. First of all, as you can see with the inclusion of Visa Europe, the quarter and our thoughts on next year will be somewhat complicated, but we will do our best to provide clarity on what's driving our results, both in my remarks but probably more importantly, in Vasant's remarks as he goes through the detail.
Overall, we feel very good about the solid financial results in the fourth quarter. Results were better than our expectations. GAAP EPS of $0.79 included 2 special items, the $110 million charge for severance cost and $88 million noncash and nonrecurring gain for the remeasurement of a deferred tax liability related to the acquisition of Visa Europe. Excluding these items, fourth quarter adjusted GAAP EPS was $0.78 per share, an increase of 27%.
Net operating revenue grew 19% this quarter, including the full quarter of Visa Europe and a continued negative 3 percentage point impact from FX. While growth continues to be subdued by some of the same items we've spoken about previously, we're starting to see improvements as we expected. And our business model, as you've seen, continues to be resilient.
I would be remiss if I didn't mention last week's 18% dividend increase to $0.165 per quarter. We continue to be consistent in returning excess capital to our shareholders. 
We turn now and talk for a couple of minutes about payments volume. U.S. payments volume growth was 11% in the fourth quarter, up 1 percentage point from Q3. U.S. credit payments volume improved to 19% from 11% in the June quarter, primarily driven by the positive impact of Costco and USAA. U.S. debit payments volume grew at 3% down from 9% in the quarter. The lower growth was primarily driven by Interlink, and remember, the impact to revenue of this is minimal. International payments, constant dollar volume growth ex Europe was 9%. Cross-border volume growth accelerated to 10% when normalized for Europe, up from 9% in the third quarter. Process transaction growth was 12% and accelerated 1 point from the third quarter when normalized for Europe as well. 
More recently, through October 21, U.S. payment volume growth was 12%, up 1 percentage point from the fourth quarter. U.S. credit grew 20%, up 1 point from the September quarter. U.S. debit grew 5%, an improvement from the 3% in the fiscal Q4. Cross-border growth in constant dollars is 11% when normalized for Europe, and process transactions was 12% when normalized for Europe.
Just a few comments about Europe. The integration itself is going extremely well. We just couldn't be happier with the interaction between the 2 companies, and we are well underway to putting all of the functions together and operating seamlessly as one global entity.
Importantly, renewal activity continues to be very strong. We've signed multi-year debit agreements with RBS and Lloyds Banking Group and multi-year credit and debit agreements with Barclays and Nationwide. We have very good engagement with clients on our products and digital road map, including Visa Checkout, which is being rolled out as we speak. Vasant will discuss in more detail how we're doing financially, but things are playing out as we would have expected so far.
And around the rest of the globe, client activity continues to remain very strong. To name just a few, we renewed a multi-year debit and credit partnership with BBVA Bancomer Mexico. We renewed our credit partnership with China Merchants Bank and China CITIC Bank, and in Russia, we renewed multi-year credit partnerships with Alfa Bank and VTB 24.
We turn -- just talk for a couple of minutes about Visa Checkout. We ended fiscal 2016 with over 15 million consumer accounts in 21 countries and over 1,400 financial institution partners across the globe participating. More than 300,000 merchants, including some of the largest global retailers, have signed on to accept Visa Checkout, representing $162 billion in addressable volume. In October, we rolled out a redesigned Visa Checkout experience to all global merchants. This new experience makes it easier for consumers to sign up and complete purchases on mobile devices.
We also announced earlier today that we're opening the Visa Checkout platform to clients and partners, allowing them to integrate their digital wallets into Visa Checkout for streamlined authentication and checkout. Leading Visa financial institutions and partners, such as Google's Android Pay, will take advantage of the new open platform by offering Visa Checkout to their customers for online purchases. Issuers, digital wallets and payment app providers can access a streamlined set of APIs to easily integrate Visa Checkout open platform and immediately begin to offer payments to their customers shopping online on their mobile devices.
For example, an online shopper who uses a digital wallet from participating -- from a participating Visa issuer or Android Pay would simply click the Visa Checkout button on a merchant's checkout page and authentic their identity through biometrics to complete a purchase.
We move on to another topic. We continue to invest in new products and services to help our merchant clients. In September, we announced Visa Advertising Solutions, a new suite of products specifically built to help merchants reach new customers and understand if their digital advertising efforts are influencing consumer purchases -- purchasing decisions online and in-store. 
Visa Ad Measurement and Visa Audiences are products that integrate with ad tech platforms like Oracle Data Cloud, allowing Visa's merchants to easily access valuable insights when executing a digital ad campaign. Top quick service restaurants and retail merchants such as Banana Republic have used Visa Ad Measurement reports to understand sales impact and optimize their marketing campaigns. Visa Advertising Solutions are available to merchants through leading digital platforms such as Facebook, Google, Twitter, Pinterest and over 200 other media networks.
We've spoken about this before, but I do want to highlight the success that we're seeing in our global network of innovation centers. In addition to [ph] 1 Market Street in San Francisco, we've opened innovation centers in Singapore in April, Dubai in May, Miami in June and plans to launch one in New York in January as well as London and São Paulo.
In 2016 alone, we held over 600 client engagements globally with over 200 clients participating. These range from tours and demos to multi-day hackathons and in depth co-creation sessions. These are forms where we can demonstrate where we think payments are going in each geography, but our goal is to develop real-time solutions with clients that they can implement very quickly.
Fast payments continues to be an important opportunity around the world, and we're having good success working with clients and partners to capture the opportunity using our Visa Direct push payment product platform. Annual Visa Direct PV exceeds $29 billion globally for the period September 16, and annual U.S. Visa Direct volumes topped $5 billion for the first time ending September 2016. Growth exceeds 250% from the same period last year. Globally, nearly 3 billion Visa cards are enabled to receive push payments. We're working with key partners, including EWS, FIS, Fiserv, Jack Henry, Stripe, Ingo money, Square and Green Dot. 
I also want to talk for a minute about how we're using push payments to electronify payments in developing economies. We recently launched a new service called mVisa in India, Kenya and Rwanda, and we plan to expand to several other markets around the world during 2017. mVisa allows consumer to transfer money to a merchant in real time with nothing more than their mobile phone. And merchants are able to start accepting Visa transactions immediately without any additional hardware. We've seen early success in several different categories, including small micro merchants, local transportation, such as taxi, and bill payment. You'll likely hear much more in the future about these efforts.
Tokenization continues to be very important part of ensuring safe and secure mobile payment solutions. We recently announced new specifications that allow certified third parties to connect directly to our Token Service and become Token Service providers. These TSPs will be able to provide a range of services for Visa tokens, including new account provisioning and life cycle management. By expanding access to the Visa Token Service to new partners, Visa issuers will be able to more quickly and easily offer secured digital payment services across a wide range of devices. 
I'll let Vasant talk in detail about our outlook for 2017 but just a few comments from me. We entered 2017 certainly with fewer headwinds as we did entering 2016, and we do have some tailwinds. On the negative side, the global economy is not improving. Geopolitical tensions are high. The U.S. election is a wildcard, and we continue to watch the impact of Brexit. But Costco and USAA meaningfully improved volumes with USAA being an important contributor to revenues in the U.S. while Costco, far less so. Cross-border volumes are both lapping decreases and have improved, and we will have a full year benefit from Europe, which, as I said, is performing as expected.
Since this is my last call, I do want to make just a few closing comments. I'm so proud to have been associated with Visa, its clients, its partners and its employees. I hope you feel that this is a different company than 4 years ago and that the things we've done have positioned the company well for the future. We focused our work on providing payments leadership and a platform, which will enable our clients, all clients, to grow their franchises.
The competition is strong, and the canvas is still being painted as the industry evolves. But our position is strong, and our assets are exceptional. And always keep in mind as we think about what's going on around the world and we look at the risks and opportunity, this is a very global business. The competitive issues are different geography by geography, but opportunities exist around the world for us to grow our share. While there's always risk and many are trying to figure out how to advantage themselves as commerce moves to digital platforms, there is more opportunity globally than ever before for Visa.

For the full quarter of Visa Europe in our numbers for the first time, we had a strong finish to fiscal year 2016. On a GAAP basis, fiscal fourth quarter revenues are up 19%; operating income, up 15%; and EPS, up 28%. We closed FY '16",3287,"Thank you, Charlie. For the full quarter of Visa Europe in our numbers for the first time, we had a strong finish to fiscal year 2016. On a GAAP basis, fiscal fourth quarter revenues are up 19%; operating income, up 15%; and EPS, up 28%. We closed FY '16 with full year revenues of $15 billion, net income of $6 billion and EPS at $2.48. On an adjusted basis, operating income for the fourth quarter was up 20% and EPS was up 27%. Net income for the full year was $6.9 billion, and EPS was $2.84.
For the remainder of my comments, I will be referring to adjusted results. A few points to note. First, payment volumes on a constant dollar basis continued to grow at double-digit rates globally. The secular shift away from cash continues at a fast clip around the world. Credit growth outstripped debit growth, helped by Costco and USAA.
Second, cross-border constant dollar volume growth recovered to double-digit levels. The dollar has stabilized, helping our large U.S.-acquired business. In addition, oil price stability and a nascent recovery in emerging markets has helped outbound commerce across most regions. Only Europe slowed due to general economic weakness as well as the impact of the Brexit vote on the euro and the pound. Easier year-over-year comparisons are also helping.
Third, we had 2 special items in the quarter that largely offset each other. We took a charge for severance costs associated with actions we are implementing across Visa, including the reductions we are planning to make at Visa Europe. The consultation process is underway in Europe, and we expect it will be completed before the end of 2016, after which we will begin to implement the agreed-upon plan.
As we integrate Europe into the rest of Visa, we have taken the opportunity, as we told you we would, to look at our global cost structure, and we'll make some adjustments. Offsetting this charge was a nonrecurring, noncash tax benefit from the reduction in the U.K. corporate tax rate, which reduced our U.K. deferred tax liability.
Finally, as you know, we issued preferred shares for the Visa Europe acquisition. We also bought back 20.5 million shares in the fourth quarter for $1.66 billion We ended the quarter with a weighted average share count of 2.44 billion, up 54 million from Q3. For the full year fiscal year '16, we bought back 92 million shares for $7.1 billion at an average price of $77.13. This is approximately $2 billion higher than what our normal course buyback would have been last year. The additional buyback reflects our intent to offset the dilutive impact of the preferred shares issued and will continue into early fiscal year '18 as we previously indicated.
I'll quickly review business drivers and financial results for the quarter and fiscal year '16, then spend most of my time on our outlook for FY '17. At least for this quarter, we will highlight the impact of adding in Visa Europe where it is helpful to better understand our results. U.S. payment volumes grew 11% in Q4 as U.S. credit grew 19%, helped by USAA and Costco volumes. U.S. debit grew 3% due to lapping a significant new account win in our Interlink business in Q4 last year and the impact of PIN debit routing this quarter. Adjusted for Interlink volumes, the U.S. debit growth trend was unchanged from the prior quarter. As merchants make routing decisions based on incentive deals in place with various networks, we expect there will continue to be volatility in our Interlink growth rates. However, given the relative size of this business, the impact on our total revenues will be minimal.
International payment volumes ex Europe grew 9% in constant dollars, but takedown from the prior quarter trend was largely due to the lapping effect of a large Chinese bank, which started including previously unreported domestic volumes in Q3 last year. Ex China, growth rates remained strong in Asia as well as Latin America. The Middle East and Russia was stable, but Sub-Saharan Africa was a soft spot.
In Europe, new regulation that went into effect in June no longer require issuers of co-badged cards to report domestic volumes we do not process. This will distort year-over-year comparisons throughout fiscal '17. Excluding Europe, cross-border constant dollar growth rate stepped up to 10% in Q4. This is the first time we have reported double-digit cross-border volume growth since Q4 fiscal year '14.
The weakening dollar is driving a recovery in our large U.S.-acquired business as well as outbound commerce from Canada. Cross-border growth in North America climbed to 9%, a rate of growth we have not seen since the end of 2013.
Internationally, cross-border growth rates stepped up across all geographies, helped by stabilizing oil prices and recovering emerging markets. Cross-border growth rates in China have stabilized in the mid-single digits. The only region ticking down in growth was Europe as the weak pound post Brexit has hurt outbound commerce from the U.K. Excluding Europe, transactions processed over VisaNet grew 11%. A small step-up from the prior quarter was due to the NSPK effect in Russia. As you know, our reported transactions growth was hurt in the past 5 quarters as we transitioned processing to NSPK starting in the third quarter of fiscal year '15. Transactions processed in Europe grew 15%, in line with the previous quarter.
Net revenues grew 19% in Q4, 6% excluding the impact of Europe. Expenses grew 18%, 5% excluding Europe. We finished the year with adjusted EPS of $2.84. If you exclude the impact of the Visa Europe acquisition, which is interest expense from the debt issued, the shares issued as well as Europe's income and other onetime items, our EPS grew 10% in nominal dollars and 14% in constant dollars. We were able to deliver this growth despite a soft revenue picture caused by the strong dollar, the oil and commodity price collapse impacting many regions as well as a slowdown in China. We were able to hold fiscal year '16 expense growth to 1% ex Europe while continuing to invest heavily in all our critical long-term initiatives such as Visa Checkout, Visa Token Service, Visa Developer platform, our innovation centers, our marketing around the Rio Olympics and other programs.
We enter fiscal year 2017 with some tailwinds. Costco and USAA conversions are now well underway as you saw from our Q4 payment volumes. Cross-border growth rates have recovered as the dollar stabilizes, and we have easier year-over-year comparisons. Two significant drags from prior years is the translational impact of the strong dollar and gas price declines. We begin to benefit from the Visa Europe acquisition with yield improvements, cost reductions and EPS accretion.
Balancing these tailwinds are some headwinds: economic weakness in Europe and Brexit uncertainty, hurting both domestic and cross-border volumes; a global economy that remains generally sluggish; a potential decline in treasury revenues as volatility subsides from the extraordinary high levels we have experienced in the past 2 years; and finally, a step-up in client incentives as we bring on Costco and other major renewals as well as folding in Europe. We'll review how all these factors drive our outlook for 2017, starting with payments volume.
USAA and Costco will drive payments volume growth in the U.S. However, we expect international payments volume growth to slow down modestly due to weakness in Europe and China. Reported European payment volume numbers will be distorted by the change in co-badged volume reporting. If no co-badged volume is included, reported European payment volumes could be down 15% to 20%, dragging reported global payments growth down by as much as 7 to 8 percentage points with a larger impact on the first 3 quarters.
As you saw in Q4, cross-border volumes are recovering, helped by easier comparisons, the stabilizing dollar and oil prices as well as improving emerging market economies. In Europe, cross-border growth rates have been trending through fiscal year '16, and we anticipate that this will continue as the pound remains weak and economies across Europe struggle. Inbound commerce into the U.S. will likely grow after 2 consecutive years of decline. Outbound commerce is expected to recover in the Middle East, Africa and Latin America. In Asia, Chinese cross-border growth appears to have stabilized.
The recovery in cross-border growth may be offset to some degree by a decline in currency volatilities and the revenue we derive from it. Currency volatilities have been extraordinarily high for the past couple of years, well above long-term averages. At some point, there will be a reversion to the mean or even an overcorrection in the other direction like we saw in 2014. For purposes of our outlook, we are resuming what we did last year, a reversion to the mean in fiscal year '17, but as they say, it will be what it will be.
With the NSPK transition behind us in Russia, debit gains in Brazil, Costco and USAA volumes in the U.S., we expect process transactions growth to tick up in FY '17 ex Europe. European process transaction growth rates will slow down as we lap the rapid acceleration of contactless transactions in the U.K. in fiscal year '16.
We finished FY '16 with client incentives as a percent of gross revenues approaching 19% in the second half. Our outlook anticipates a range of 20.5% to 21.5% in fiscal year '17, a 1.5 to 2.5 points increase. There are several factors driving this increase. About half of the year-over-year increase is driven by the inclusion of Visa Europe for the full year and the impact of eliminating rebates and replacing them with performance-based client incentives. In our filings of Visa Europe numbers for the first 3 quarters of FY '16 that you have seen, U.S. GAAP accounting requires that rebates are netted from gross revenues. When we eliminated rebates at the end of September, it has the effect of increasing Visa Europe's gross fiscal year '17 revenues and in parallel, Visa Europe's fiscal year '17 client incentives as we replaced these rebates with appropriate market competitive incentives. The net effect of this change in the European pricing structure and the overall level of client incentives in Europe accounts for about half of the increase from 19% in Q4 to the range we provided for fiscal year '17. The other half of the year-over-year step-up in client incentives as a percentage of gross revenues is driven by a full year of Costco incentives and the impact of several large renewals completed in fiscal year '16, particularly in Asia.
When you put all this together, we expect constant dollar net revenue growth in the high teens in fiscal year '17 moderated to the 16% to 18% range in nominal dollars by an estimated 1 to 1.5 point exchange rate impact. This currency translation impact may be larger than you are anticipating based on dollar spot rates of forward curves. Let me explain why this is the case.
It has to do with our long standing practice of layering on monthly hedges no different than what most global companies do. This approach to hedging is not seeking to make directional bets on currencies but rather, to dampen the effect of changes in the trend of the dollar. When the dollar strengthens, these hedges delay the cost, and when the dollar weakens, they delay the benefit, essentially mitigating volatility. In fiscal year '16, the hedges helped in the first half, and then as the dollar started to weaken, they hurt in the second half. This will continue into fiscal year '17. The hedges in place will be a drag in the first half. If the dollar stabilizes as currency forwards is suggesting, they will be neutral in the second half. The total exchange rate drag on net revenues could be 2 to 2.5 points in the first quarter comparable to Q4 FY '16, moderating through the year to 0.5 in Q4 FY '17.
On the expense front, we will continue to invest as aggressively as we need to on all our key growth initiatives, including the global expansion of Visa Checkout, Visa Token Service and Visa innovation centers. We will continue to build on our Visa Developer platform, our data and analytics capabilities, loyalty and offers, mVisa and other key programs. In parallel, as we have done in fiscal year '17, we will look to gain efficiencies in other parts of our business by enhancing productivity and adding capabilities in lower-cost locations.
Excluding Europe, we expect expense growth to return to the mid-single-digit range in fiscal year '17. In terms of the expense base in Europe, after the consultation process is completed, we will implement our plan. While this will reduce costs in some areas, we will be investing in Europe to roll out Visa Checkout and our other digital services as well as adding to our sales and marketing resources to bring all the benefits of global Visa to our European clients as fast as we can. We will also incur approximately $18 million in Visa Europe integration costs in fiscal year '17. These are costs to harmonize the 2 technology platforms.
Our technology teams are in the process of aligning authorization clearance, clearance and settlement systems, upgrading network compute and storage infrastructure, implementing next-generation information security systems, preparing to move to common end user and corporate platforms. As you may recall, we had indicated that the technology integration would not be complete until late 2019, early 2020.
We had estimated total integration costs in the $450 million to $500 million range over this time frame. While these are not recurring costs, we will incur these costs for the next 3 years until we complete the full integration of Visa Europe. We will call these costs out as we have in our outlook. However, we do not plan to adjust these costs from our GAAP numbers when we report each quarter. Of course, these integration costs will not be incurred once the technology integration is complete. Also, as we have indicated, additional cost savings will be realized when we combine the technology platform.
It is important to highlight one item that you need to adjust for as you consolidate Visa Europe into Visa Inc. Prior to the acquisition, as you all know, there were inter-company charges that flowed between Visa Europe and Visa Inc. These were expenses for Visa Europe and revenues for Visa Inc.
The largest item was the Visa Europe license fee. The other major charge was for network processing services provided by Visa Inc. For the first 3 quarters of fiscal year '16, these inter-company charges amounted to $191 million. 2/3 were recognized as other revenues in the Visa, Inc. income statement and the remainder in data processing revenues. At Visa Europe, 1/3 of the expense hit the network and processing line, and most of the rest was in G&A with a small amount in personnel.
Post the acquisition, these inter-company revenues and expenses completely offset one another and are eliminated in consolidation. Therefore, none of these revenues and expense amounts are included in the reported fourth quarter numbers. All will be included going forward. If you do not adjust for these changes, your FY '16 baseline for Visa Europe operating expenses would be overstated by $191 million as would your fiscal year '16 baseline for Visa Inc. revenues.
In terms of costs related to China market entry, the timing remains uncertain. We had assumed we would be much further along at this point when we talked to you last year. It is our intent to move very fast to set up our processing infrastructure once we have greater clarity from the BPOC [ph] around time lines for their decision on granting licenses. At this point, it is difficult to know for sure what costs related to China market entry will be incurred in fiscal year '17. We have made some assumptions in our outlook, and we'll update you as we learn more.
Moving on to interest and taxes. Interest expense will increase almost 40% in fiscal year '17 from a full year of interest on the $16 billion in debt issued in December 2015 as well as the $2 billion in debt we plan to issue before the end of this calendar year, market conditions permitting. Our fiscal year '17 tax rate will increase due to Visa Europe. As you know, under the current structure, Visa Europe is a U.S. tax prayer. The current tax structure affords us some cash tax benefit but has the effect of increasing our book or GAAP tax rate due to restrictions on the credits we can take on taxes we pay in the U.K. As we had indicated previously, this structure increases our reported tax rate by 100 basis points to the low 30s range.
As you estimate our fiscal year '17 EPS, it's important to remember that we issued 79 million preferred shares as part of the consideration for Visa Europe. These shares are now included in our fully diluted share count, which is up 54 million net of buybacks completed in the fourth quarter. We have ramped up our buyback program to offset the dilutive impact of the shares issued. In fiscal year '17, our buyback based in dollars should be roughly at the same level as fiscal year '16. At this pace, by the end of '17, we would have bought back almost 5 billion more than our normal course buyback or offset almost 80% of stock issued. We will maintain the stepped up pace of buybacks until we complete this program in early fiscal year '18.
With a full year of interest expense as well as $2 billion more in debt, with a higher GAAP tax rate and with additional shares outstanding, our EPS growth rate in fiscal year '17 will be lower than net revenue growth. In nominal terms, our outlook anticipates mid-teens EPS growth from an adjusted fiscal year '16 baseline of $2.84. This includes a 1.5 to 2 points drag from exchange rates mostly due to the impact of hedging described earlier. As with revenues, the drag from exchange rates will be higher in the first half comparable to fourth quarter '16 levels in Q1 and moderating through the year.
Our EPS outlook assumes EPS accretion from Visa Europe will be in the 2% to 3% range in fiscal year '17 as expected. The accretive impact of Visa Europe is greater in the second and third quarters when we had interest expense last year from debt issued for the transaction, but no income from Visa Europe till the fourth quarter. Also, benefits from our cost reduction actions start being realized in the second quarter. Visa Europe is tracking well relative to our expectations, and we remain confident that accretion will climb to the high single-digit range by 2020, once we have implemented all our plans to improve yield and lower costs.
In summary, we feel good about fiscal year '17. The Visa Europe integration is proceeding well and delivering as expected. Payment volume momentum remains robust globally. Transactions growth remains healthy. Cross-border volumes are recovering as the dollar stabilizes and comparisons become easier. Gas prices and exchange rate drags are easing.
As always, there are risks to watch. The global economy remains sluggish especially in Europe. The cross-border business in Europe is slowing. Currency volatilities could moderate. Balancing these factors, our fiscal year '17 outlook anticipates 16% to 18% net revenue growth and mid-teens EPS growth in nominal dollars. As always, we'll update our views as the year unfolds and share them with you each quarter.
With that, I'll turn the call back to Jack."

In terms of yields, yes, yields are assumed to improve. Some of that, we anticipate will happen. Some of the actions, we are in the process of implementing like what we told you, the elimination of rebates and the replacement of client incentives and some other actions we're doing. So you will see yields improve. But as we look ahead, I mean, Visa Europe will be an integral part of Visa, and you will start to see the impact of Visa Europe in the aggregate numbers we report and what happens to our yields from the new baseline you have in yields and so on. So hopefully, that helps.

And just to reiterate sort of what we're expecting and again, I think we tried to give you as factual a point of view as we can. Our revenue growth, if you adjust for the exchange rate drag, which perhaps you would -- you may not have anticipated without thinking about the hedging implications, and you might have seen the hedging implications in our second half results. I mean, our currency impact essentially stayed flat through the year mostly because hedging helped in the first half and hurt a bit in the second half, and all it does really is delay the impact of the moves in the dollar. But if you adjust for the hedging impact, what you're seeing is high-teens revenue growth -- net revenue growth. And what you're seeing is mid-teens plus 1.5 to 2 points EPS growth. It's not that different than perhaps what you might have expected of us going into the year. Visa Europe is tracking as we expected. We feel very good about it. What could surprise one way or another, we laid out all the factors -- clearly, the cross-border trends are heartening, and hopefully, if the dollar stays on this track, which is either stable or further weakening, that would be good for us. I think currency forwards are now expecting more of a flattening of the dollar, which is sort of what we've assumed. In terms of the currency volatility front, that's a little bit of anybody's guess. We did tell you sort of what we are assuming. But overall, I mean, if there is going to be anything on the plus or minus side, we have assumed that the European trends have softened through the year, and we've assumed that those trends will continue into next year. Hopefully, European economies will do better than that, and if that does, that will be great."

So Visa Europe lands up at a place where their incentives as percentage of gross revenues are certainly driving the new level. Beyond that, yes, we have Costco coming in for a full year. That certainly adds to it. And we have some significant renewals in, in particular, Asian geographies. So this -- you should assume that this is a level that is about where we should see it stay.

We saw growth coming out of Brazil, out of Russia, out of many of the commodity- and oil-based economies, Middle East and parts of Asia also improving and China beginning to stabilize.

I believe we -- I think we have reported this. I think we had most people report their co-badged volumes in the fourth quarter. So the fourth quarter number ended up being relatively untainted by lack of reporting",316,"Yes. Let me talk a little bit about that. I believe we -- I think we have reported this. I think we had most people report their co-badged volumes in the fourth quarter. So the fourth quarter number ended up being relatively untainted by lack of reporting, and I think the payment volumes, if I remember right, was somewhere in the 6% range. So as you can see, they are lower than what we see in other parts of the world in terms of growth rates. As we look at next year, the issue on co-badged volumes is that there are a certain number of issuers that have co-badged cards with us who are no longer required to report their co-badged volumes and transactions we do not process. The biggest impact is in France, and there's some impact in some Scandinavian countries. If they don't all report, which is what we expect, we expect that they will all not report, then payment volumes will decline next year, we said, as much as 15% to 20%. So remember, I mean, if it's plus 6 and minus 20, that's a delta of almost 25 or 26. Plus, as you know, in the first 3 quarters, Visa Europe payment volumes will show up as all incremental to our payment volume and will have this impact on it. So you will see a fair amount of distortion in payment volume reporting as a result of this. Now the lack of payment volume reporting and its revenue impacts, we factored into our outlook. So that is all factored into what we told you our revenue picture is next year. But the payment volumes will look odd. Although, we report by region, so at least, you'll be able to see what it is by region and be able to look at how everybody else is doing. And Europe will just look odd."

Listen, I mean, first of all, I think -- and I really do believe this, which is it's -- and I said this when we did this -- did the call last week, which is, I mean, you all know as well as I do that companies like this are not dependent on any one person, right? There are 13,000 other people here that are going to continue doing what they've done the day after I go. And with a leader like Al, I would assume, will do it as well, if not, better. And so as we think about what we've done over the past 4 years or even what this company has done since it's gone public, it's based upon what an entire management team has done. I think that what I feel very good about when I think about the things that we've done, I think, you brought up the work on -- that we have really -- I would describe as we've really begun to do with merchants, is an important part of the way we think about what we do. We are not trying to do work for merchants in lieu of any other client or any other partner but just recognizing that everyone who participates in the payments value chain should get access to the capabilities that we have. And so someone asked me last week, if I were them, how would they evaluate how we're doing at making progress with merchants. And my answer was I would look to see that we're continuing quarter after quarter, year after year to introduce solutions in the marketplace, which help merchants grow their business and then try and derive some kind of understanding of what the adoption looks like for those products. And don't be confused by a couple of merchants that are always going to be unhappy, that are always going to be doing things in the marketplace. The merchant world is very fragmented across the world. We've got some very, very strong relationships, and we've got a bunch of relationships where those merchants are sitting there very eager to work with us on the solutions that we're developing. And then, I think, just not -- because I don't want to take up the whole call with the question. I do think just when I think about the way we thought about innovation here and the way we thought about our work in digital commerce, I think we've just -- the whole organization has just made tremendous progress. We don't talk about -- let me say it differently. We don't use the word innovation around here anymore because it becomes part of the way people think about doing their business. We're rooted in supporting our client base and supporting the 4-party model, but we are very focused on being as successful and having our clients be successful in the digital world. And whether it's the work in the dev center, the APIs that we've made available, all of the things that we've done that position us well in the world of digital commerce, including Visa Checkout, those are all part of those things. So everything we do is about continuing to be strong in the physical world but recognizing that we needed to think very differently in the digital world. There's a tremendous amount more to do, so I don't want to -- I don't think about this as if we've done it, and it's time for me to move on. I think we've done an awful lot. But I'm confident that those activities and the way people think is the way the organization thinks."

What we did this year was to prioritize around all the other things. As we look at next year, the run rate returns to what has been more of a long-term trend. The level of investment remains as steady as it has been, and we'll continue to drive productivity. I mean, some of the charge we took is a reflection of that. So that was in terms of the expense growth rate. So it really is a return back to what has been a very long-term trend into level of investment we need to keep the business focused on all the right things.

Yes. On incentives, we didn't have the impact of Visa Europe in the fourth quarter to the extent that you have it next year because, in the fourth quarter, the rebates were still in place. We eliminated the rebates only as of the end of September. And there are also quarter-by-quarter impacts, Visa Europe brand, a relatively higher level of incentives in first half of the year, somewhat lower in the second half if you looked to the filings we had done. So the full impact of Europe was really not as visible in the fourth quarter because the rebates to client incentive shift was not in place in the fourth quarter. Costco, yes, we had some of the incentives then this year. But clearly, it's a full year of Costco, so you'll see the full impact. Plus, there's a whole bunch of renewals I talked about that really start flowing into next year, mostly the ones we did in Asia. So it's all these altogether."

And so when we think about what it means for us, we know the capabilities that we have. When we think about what we've done and the way we've positioned ourselves with Visa Direct and getting access on a push payments basis to 3 billion cards across the world, we feel really good about position that we have with those capabilities. It doesn't mean that, that's all we're thinking about and all that we're doing, and you've seen us do some work in the -- as you've mentioned, in the blockchain space, thinking more about where are payments inefficient. And for what we do in our traditional consumer-to-business world, that's not a problem that needs to get solved today in terms of what blockchain can do. But certainly, in the commercial space, it's a very, very inefficient market, and there are opportunities to use different technologies to bring some efficiency there. So the things that we're doing, they are around doing things to improve something that exists. And for the core business of what we do today between consumers and merchants and it will be through consumers to consumers in terms of using our push payment capabilities, it's leveraging the core assets that we have that work really well that have access to these 3 billion cards across the world."
