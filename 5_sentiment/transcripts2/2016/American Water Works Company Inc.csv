Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. With me today are Linda Sullivan, our CFO, who will go over the fourth quarter and full year financial results; and Walter Lynch, our COO, who will give key updates on our Regulated Business",765,"Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. With me today are Linda Sullivan, our CFO, who will go over the fourth quarter and full year financial results; and Walter Lynch, our COO, who will give key updates on our Regulated Business. On January 1, Walter assumed additional responsibility for operational and safety best practices across our AWE Market-Based Businesses, so periodically, he'll give you an update on those efforts as well. The employees of American Water delivered strong results in 2015 for both the fourth quarter and the full year. We invested significant capital into needed upgrades for our system to provide reliable and safe water and wastewater services. We continued our focus on managing costs and deploying technology so that our services remain affordable for our customers, and we treated and delivered water that consistently met and surpassed EPA drinking water standards. This includes the lead and copper rule, which has generated a lot of news recently due to the crisis in Flint, Michigan. American Water samples for lead on a routine basis in our water systems continue to be in compliance with that rule. 
We expanded our regulated customer base in 2015 by nearly 42,000 metered customers. About 9,000 customers resulted from organic growth in our existing footprint. 24,000 customers joined our system from acquisitions that closed during the year. An additional 9,000 are from acquisitions where we have written agreements in place and are just awaiting regulatory approval. 
We also continue to grow our Market-Based Businesses through new contracts and new customers. 
As you can see on Slide 7, we reported operating revenues of $783 million, a 7% increase above fourth quarter 2014. For the full year, operating revenues were nearly $3.2 billion, an increase of about 5% over 2014. Earnings from continuing operations were $0.55 per share for the fourth quarter, a 5.8% increase above fourth quarter 2014.
Annual earnings were $2.64 per share, up 8.6% over 2014 adjusted EPS. The fourth quarter includes a $5 million contribution to the American Water Foundation, whose work I'll discuss briefly before our Q&A session.
Turning now to Slide 8, you can see that we delivered on our strategies in both the regulated and the Market-Based Businesses in 2015. We made about $1.4 billion in total annual investment, the highest in our company's history. We invested $1.2 billion in our regulated system, which improves our long-term service reliability and water quality for our customers. We're able to increase our investment at this level because of the expertise of our hardworking employees and our continuous improvement in both O&M and capital deployment efficiency.
We're proud of our ability to deliver on our growth goals and effectively manage every dollar to deliver excellent customer service while we keep our customer build affordable. Even more importantly, we know that our customers need to be able to trust that the water we provide is clean and safe. So while consistently meeting and surpassing all EPA requirements in 2015, we continue our focus on further strengthening our critical assets.
Let me give you a couple of examples. We upgraded 2 of our company's largest water treatment plants, which serve over 300,000 customers in St. Louis County, Missouri. In Champaign, Illinois, we upgraded chemical treatment facilities nearing the end of their useful lives with improvements that included replacing gas chlorine facilities with safer technology.
In addition to these regulated system investments in 2015, we also grew our customer base organically and through regulated acquisitions. Our Market-Based Businesses continue to grow as well. In December, our Contract Services Group was awarded a 10-year O&M contract in Camden, New Jersey, with revenue of approximately $125 million.
Our Military Services Group expanded to 12 basis with a successful 50-year contract bid for Air Force Base with revenue of approximately $300 million. Our homeowner services group expanded to 1.6 million service warranty contracts, and we grew our utility partnerships by adding Realto, California in the Orlando utility commission. As you know, we expanded our business through the acquisition of Keystone Clearwater Solutions.
So in summary, we produced excellent results for the year through our ongoing customer growth, highest annual capital investment in our history, and we continued our O&M and capital efficiency. This continues our progress toward achieving our goal of 7% to 10% EPS growth through 2020. Based on our performance, our board declared a cash dividend of $0.34 per share during the fourth quarter, and we are affirming our 2016 earnings guidance range of $2.75 to $2.85 per share.
And with that, Walter will now give you his update."

As Susan mentioned, our Regulated Business had a strong year all around with historic capital investment, smart and strategic acquisitions and continued O&M efficiency gains while balancing customer 
As you can see on Slide 10, 2015 was a good year for growth. Through acquisitions and organic growth, we added in a pending regulatory approval, nearly 42,000 customers in our Regulated Businesses. In 2015, we completed 14 acquisitions, adding nearly 24,000 customers to our existing footprint. 7 of these transactions closed in the fourth quarter, including our purchase of the municipal wastewater system in Fairview, Pennsylvania. This newly acquired system provides wastewater service to approximately 4,000 customers, including more than 200 businesses and commercial accounts, and it's a perfect fit since Pennsylvania American Water already own the water system. This acquisition provides a long-term wastewater solution and a financial relief in the local community. According to the township's supervisors because of the sale, Township residential received a 50% reduction in real estate taxes in 2016. The proceeds of the sale will also help pay off approximately $21 million in sewer debt and avoid an anticipated $14 million in additional debt that would have been required to complete planned projects. Again, this is a great example of how we can bring solutions to municipalities struggling to finance the water and wastewater improvement while improving their service and keeping rates affordable for our customers. At the end of 2015, we had 12 pending acquisition agreements that were signed and awaiting regulatory approval. These acquisitions would add approximately 9,000 customers to our customer base, if approved and completed. In 2016, we completed the purchase of 4 of these acquisitions, one of which was environmental disposal corporation in New Jersey. This investor on wastewater utility provide service to more than 5300 [ph] customers as well as bulk wastewater treatment services for several nearby communities. Additionally, in December, Pennsylvania American Water signed a memorandum of understanding for the potential acquisition of the wastewater assets of this authority, which serves approximately 31,000 customers. This MOU commits the party to negotiate in good faith toward executing a final purchase agreement.
On the regulatory front, you can see a snapshot of our current activity on Slide 11. Our Illinois and Kentucky subsidiaries filed rate requests in the first month of 2016. In both states, we're seeking to recover a significant amount of needed capital investment offset by reduced or flat O&M expenses. In Illinois, we requested $40 million in additional revenue based on a projected total of $342 million of capital investment between October 2013 and the end of 2017. Our team in Illinois reduced their O&M expenses by about 3% since the last rate case in 2012 continuing the great work by our employees to keep both affordable for our customers. In Kentucky, we requested $13.5 [ph] million in additional revenues, primarily driven by $79 million of capital investment while keeping operating expenses flat since 2012. Again, this focus on expenses allows us to make critical infrastructure investments continuing to trend in keeping affordable for our customers. In Missouri, our case is moving along to the process, and we expect the decision sometime before mid-year.
In West Virginia, we have not yet received the rate orders, so I'll stay at a high level and based my comments from the press release sent out last night for the West Virginia Public Service Commission. The order provides an increase of $18.17 million in water rates and $151,000 in sewer rates. The commission recognized that the company reduced its O&M expenses from the rate case and the adjustment to base rates is driven primarily by the increase investment we made to ensure reliable water service for our customers. And consistent with our normal process, West Virginia American Water will issue a press release once they've had the chance to review the order.
Moving to California. On February 1, we received approval from the California Public Utilities Commission to extend our cost of capital filing by 1 year. This will keep our authorized return on equity at 9.99% through 2017 for our California subsidiary.
Meanwhile, despite some rain fall from the effects of El Niño, the drought continues in California. Our team continues to demonstrate leadership in dealing with the drought, and we're certainly proud of all the reference to help our customers during this time. We also continue to make progress on the Peninsula water supply project. Our test well is operational, and the results are positive. The project is undergoing environmental and regulatory review by the California Public Utilities Commission, and this review is scheduled to be completed by the end of the year.
Moving to Slide 12. We ended the year with a 35.9% O&M efficiency ratio, and we're on track to meet our 34% target by 2020. I know we've talked a lot about this, most recently at our Investor Day in December, but I think it's worth repeating. We've really made tremendous progress year. As you can see, the progress is evident by the amount of revenue requirement attributed to capital expenditures versus operating expenses. The general rate cases we filed last year, we reduced our O&M expenses by $10 million or 17%. This reduction allowed us to invest approximately $65 million into needed infrastructure upgrade without affecting our customers' bills. Our employees are doing a great job in this area through leveraging best practices, improved efficiencies, technology and innovation, and this produces results for our customers as well as our company.
So with that, I'll turn the call over to Linda for more detail on our performance."

In the fourth quarter and for the full year of 2015, American Water continued to deliver strong financial results.

In the fourth quarter and for the full year of 2015, American Water continued to deliver strong financial results. As shown on Slide 14, earnings per share from continuing operations for the fourth quarter was $0.55, up $0.03 or 5.8% over the same period last year. This slide shows the contribution by business line to our quarterly and annual results. Let me walk through the numbers, then I'll discuss the drivers of the key variances on the next 2 pages. 
For the quarter, the Regulated Businesses contributed $0.54 [ph], up a $0.01; the Market-Based Businesses contributed $0.06, flat to the fourth quarter of last year; and the parent, which is primarily interest expense on parent debt was $0.02 better than the fourth quarter of last year. For the full year 2015, earnings per share from continuing operations was $2.64 per share, an increase of $0.21 or 8.6% increase compared to adjusted 2014. The contribution from our Regulated Businesses was $2.63 per share, up $0.18 or 7.3% over adjusted 2014. The Market-Based Businesses contribution was $0.24, up $0.02 or about 9% over last year. And the parent improved $0.01 per share. These annual increases are consistent with our long-term growth triangle.
Turning to Slide 15, let me walk through the components of our quarter-over-quarter increase in earnings per share. The primary driver was higher regulated revenue of $0.09 per share from infrastructure surcharges and other rate increases to support our regulated system investment. This is partially offset by higher O&M expense of $0.03, mainly from the timing of maintenance-related work as well as higher claims and pension-related costs. Depreciation, taxes and other increased $0.05 per share, driven mainly by our investment growth. The improvement at the parent of $0.02 per share was mainly due to lower taxes from state tax benefits, partially offset by the $5 million contribution to the American Water Foundation that Susan mentioned. Also, please note that the Market-Based Businesses were flat for the quarter as higher growth in our military and homeowner services group was offset by a 2014 tax benefit.
Turning to Slide 16, let me walk through the elements of our $0.21 increase in year-over-year adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations. The Regulated Businesses benefited from higher revenue of $0.18 per share from authorized rate increases to support investment growth as well as increases from acquisitions and organic growth. In addition, there was a $0.05 increase due to mild weather during 2014 and an improvement in O&M cost of $0.02 per share. Offsetting these improvements was higher depreciation and taxes of $0.07 per share driven by our investment growth. Overall the Regulated Businesses increased $0.18 year-over-year. The Market-Based Businesses were up $0.02, mainly due to additional construction projects under our military contract and the addition of Hill Air Force Base and the arsenal in 2014 as well as geographic expansion and homeowner services. Parent and other was $0.01 better than 2014, due mainly to lower taxes from state tax proportionate benefits, partially offset by the foundation donation.
Now let me cover the regulatory highlights on Slide 17. As Walter mentioned, we should receive the rate order from the West Virginia rate case soon. And as such, we currently have 4 general rate cases in process: Missouri, Virginia, Illinois and Kentucky for a combined annualized rate request of $87.4 million. For rates effective from January 1, 2015 through today and including the $18.3 million for West Virginia, we received a total of $98.6 million in additional annualized revenue from general rate cases and infrastructure charges. We encourage you to review the footnotes in the appendix of the slide deck for more information. 
Slide 18 highlights our improved financial performance across the board. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we made total investments of $386 million, primarily for regulated system investment. For the year, we invested a total of $1.4 billion. This includes $1.2 billion for regulated system investments, $64 million for regulated acquisitions and $133 million for the acquisition of Keystone. Excluding the Keystone acquisition, capital investment increased about 27% from 2014. Going forward, we expect to invest $6.4 billion over the next 5 years, of which about $5.5 billion will be to improve water and wastewater systems for our customers, $600 million for regulated acquisition and $280 million for strategic capital.
For the full year, cash flow from operations increased $82 million or 7% to about $1.2 billion, mainly due to the increase in net income. And our adjusted return on equity for the past 12 months was 9.43%, an increase of 57 basis points compared to last year from continued execution of our strategy. We also announced in the fourth quarter of 2015 a $0.34 common stock cash dividend payable on March 1, 2016. 
On Slide 19, as many of you will recall, during our Investor Day in New York, we gave 2016 earnings guidance of $2.75 to $2.85 per share. Today, we affirm that guidance range. There are certain important factors that could impact our 2016 results. And as we have done in the past, Slide 19 outlines those factors that we have included in our earnings guidance range. Swings outside of these ranges could cause results to differ from guidance.
Weather is generally the largest variable impacting our earnings. Our range of plus or minus $0.07 represents what we consider to be normal weather variation that we have included in our earnings guidance range. For our Regulated Businesses, we see variations of plus or minus $0.03, primarily from the timing and outcome of rate cases, the timing of completion of capital projects as well as variations in O&M and production cost. American Water Enterprise's variability is driven mostly from the timing of future capital upgrades and Military Services and realization of our expected growth as well as claims cost in homeowner services. Variability for Keystone is primarily driven by natural gas prices and drilling activity in the Marcellus and Utica. I would also like to mention that our 2016 earnings guidance range includes estimated legal defense cost of about $0.03 per share related to the 2014 Freedom Industries chemical spill in West Virginia. As you may recall, we included $0.02 per share of legal cost in 2015. And lastly, I would like to address the expected impact from the 5-year extension of bonus depreciation. From a cash perspective, we are in a federal tax net operating loss position, so we do not receive a current cash benefit from bonus depreciation. We look at electing bonus depreciation on a state-by-state basis. In those cases, where adopting bonus depreciation would be in our customer's best interest and where we expect to be able to utilize our NOL, we will do so. Assuming we elect bonus depreciation in our regulated states, this would increase our NOLs and push out the expected timing of when we will become a cash taxpayer by about 1 year to 2021. From an earnings perspective, while this would be expected to reduce rate base and earnings, we do not see a significant impact to our 2016 earnings guidance range, nor do we see a significant impact to our 7% to 10% compounded annual EPS growth rate for 2016 through 2020 because the rate base impact is largely offset by lower financing needs in 2020. We also have flexibility to mitigate some of the rate base impacts by redirecting a portion of our strategic capital already included in our 5-year plan to our Regulated Businesses as well as accelerating certain investments that continue to strengthen our critical assets for our customers.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Susan."

Before taking your questions let's review the American Water investment thesis that we shared with you at our Investor Day and briefly discuss the American Water foundation. On growth, we affirmed our EPS growth goal of 7% to 10% for the next 5 years. We talked about our unprecedented 2015 capital investment our, continued O&M and capital efficiency and our plans for 2016. We know that reputation operational excellence, reliability and dependable water quality are critical to our growth. Where and how we expanded our customer base in 2015 leveraged this strength, growing through tuck-in, adding wastewater customers where we already serve water and growing our Market-Based Businesses. Our people have deep utility expertise and diversified experience, and they are our biggest competitive advantage. They also care deeply about our customers in the communities in which they live and serve. This was clearly demonstrated by what our employees dealt with in both Missouri and Illinois during the last week in 2015. Record rainfall of up to 12 inches filled during a powerful three-day start across the Midwest, hitting the St. Louis area hard and causing record flooding. Homes and businesses were submerged, highways closed and water and sewer utilities faced extraordinary challenges. Missouri American had 2 plants on the Merrimack River supplying water to about 20% of our customers in the St. Louis County area. Thanks to early planning and the construction of a system of temporary pipes and pump, our customers never lost service agreement, and we maintained excellent water quality throughout the event. Our wastewater teams also worked around the clock during the heavy rains to remove pumps and motors that otherwise would have been lost to flooding. It's not just what our Missouri team did for our own customers, it's what they did for the surrounding communities indeed. A local public water district had a flooded plant and lost the ability to serve its 20,000 customers. By opening a connection between the systems, Missouri American was able to the districts serve many of those without water. Additionally, they worked with the National Guard to fill more than 500 tanker trucks that delivered our water outside of our service area. Which brings me to the American Water foundation funded by American Water's parent company, which keeps the communities we serve and have a better quality of life. One key foundation partnership is with the Union Alliance where we have worked with local union members to build walking trails, public access areas and fishing facilities for communities, including projects for special needs kids. The foundation also has a partnership with the National Recreation and Parks Association in support of building better community. Here we focused on building or enhancing nature-based playgrounds for children and educating people on water and environmental stewardship practices. The foundation also matches employee donations to qualified charitable organizations up to $1,000 per year per employee. Earlier this month, the foundation made a $50,000 donation to the Flint Child Health and Development Fund to help the children of Flint and Michigan get the resources they need to deal with the lead exposure many have experienced. These examples of doing good as we do well demonstrate the dedication, expertise, strong character and the work ethic of the 6,700 people I get the privilege of working with every day. Certainly, our employees' commitment translates into our strong financial performance, but it also lets you know as our investors that we are a company whose people believe not just in what we do, clean water for life, but also in how we do it. And we believe that it is critical for our company who wants to be as successful in the coming decade as we are today.
So with that, we're happy to take your questions."

So we look at growth and the returns we get there. We look at regulated investment. And let me be clear that in our investment plan, the first thing we do is we invest whatever is needed in every one of our states to ensure that we provide safe, clean water that meets all EPA standards. So then beyond that is what we refer to as discretionary, but there is a base amount, which is significant -- well, over half of our capital that we spend to ensure that we provide the services. Then beyond that, we look at our dividend growth which is we have said you want to keep consistent with our EPS growth. So we want those to be correlated, so that's the guidance we've given, and we have a 50% to 60% payout ratio. And currently, we're at the lower end of that range, so there's room there. When you look at things like that and I'll let Linda talk about this more, the question we ask is what is best for our customers and our shareholders with the next dollar that we invest or whether we pay down debt or whether we're able to provide dividend. So as you know, to have -- to get a strong financial position as we are, we have a lot of optionality, and we're always looking at how we optimize that optionality."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. With me today are Linda Sullivan, our CFO, who will go over the fourth quarter and full year financial results; and Walter Lynch, our COO, who will give key updates on our Regulated Business",767,"Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. With me today are Linda Sullivan, our CFO, who will go over the fourth quarter and full year financial results; and Walter Lynch, our COO, who will give key updates on our Regulated Business. On January 1, Walter assumed additional responsibility for operational and safety best practices across our AWE Market-Based Businesses. So periodically, he'll give you an update on those efforts as well. 
The employees of American Water delivered strong results in 2015 for both the fourth quarter and the full year. We invested significant capital into needed upgrades for our systems to provide reliable and safe water and wastewater services. We continued our focus on managing costs and deploying technology so that our services remain affordable for our customers. And we treated and delivered water that consistently met and surpassed EPA drinking water standards. This includes the Lead and Copper Rule, which has generated a lot of news recently due to the crisis in Flint, Michigan. American Water samples for lead on a routine basis and our water systems continue to be in compliance with that rule. 
We expanded our regulated customer base in 2015 by nearly 42,000 metered customers. About 9,000 customers resulted from organic growth in our existing footprint. 24,000 customers joined our system from acquisitions that closed during the year. An additional 9,000 are from acquisitions where we have written agreements in place and are just awaiting regulatory approval. We also continue to grow our Market-Based Businesses through new contracts and new customers. 
As you can see on Slide 7, we reported operating revenues of $783 million, a 7% increase above fourth quarter 2014. For the full year, operating revenues were nearly $3.2 billion, an increase of about 5% over 2014. Earnings from continuing operations were $0.55 per share for the fourth quarter, a 5.8% increase above fourth quarter 2014. Annual earnings were $2.64 per share, up 8.6% over 2014 adjusted EPS. The fourth quarter includes a $5 million contribution to the American Water Foundation, whose work I will discuss briefly before our Q&A session.
Turning now to Slide 8. You can see that we delivered on our strategies in both the Regulated and the Market-Based Businesses in 2015. We made about $1.4 billion in total annual investment, the highest in our company's history. We invested $1.2 billion in our regulated system, which improves our long-term service reliability and water quality for our customers. We're able to increase our investments at this level because of the expertise of our hardworking employees and our continuous improvement in both O&M and capital deployment efficiency. We're proud of our ability to deliver on our growth goals and effectively manage every dollar to deliver excellent customer service while we keep our customer bills affordable. 
Even more importantly, we know that our customers need to be able to trust that the water we provide is clean and safe. So while consistently meeting and surpassing all EPA requirements in 2015, we continued our focus on further strengthening our critical assets. Let me give you a couple of examples. We upgraded 2 of our company's largest water treatment plants, which serve over 300,000 customers in St. Louis County, Missouri. In Champaign, Illinois, we upgraded chemical treatment facilities nearing the end of their useful lives with improvements that included replacing gas chlorine facilities with safer technology.
In addition to these regulated system investments in 2015, we also grew our customer base organically and through regulated acquisitions. Our Market-Based Businesses continued to grow as well. In December, our Contract Services Group was awarded a 10-year O&M contract in Camden, New Jersey with revenue of approximately $125 million. Our Military Services Group expanded to 12 bases with a successful 50-year contract bid for Vandenberg Air Force Base with revenue of approximately $300 million. Our Homeowner Services Group expanded to 1.6 million service warranty contracts and we grew our utility partnerships by adding Rialto, California and the Orlando Utilities Commission. As you know, we expanded our business through the acquisition of Keystone Clearwater Solutions.
So in summary, we produced excellent results for the year through our ongoing customer growth, highest annual capital investment in our history and we continued our O&M and capital efficiency. This continues our progress toward achieving our goal of 7% to 10% EPS growth through 2020. Based on our performance, our board declared a cash dividend of $0.34 per share during the fourth quarter. And we are affirming our 2016 earnings guidance range of $2.75 to $2.85 per share.
And with that, Walter will now give you his update."

Good morning, everyone. As Susan mentioned, our Regulated Businesses had a strong year all around with historic capital investment, smart and strategic acquisitions and continued O&M efficiency gains while balancing customer going-backs [ph].  
 
As you can see on Slide 10, 2015 was a good year for growth. Through acquisitions and organic growth, we added, pending regulatory approval, nearly 42,000 customers in our Regulated Businesses. In 2015, we completed 14 acquisitions, adding nearly 24,000 customers to our existing footprint. 7 of these transactions closed in the fourth quarter, including our purchase of the municipal wastewater system in Fairview Township, Pennsylvania. 
This newly acquired system provides wastewater service to approximately 4,000 customers, including more than 200 businesses and commercial accounts. And it's a perfect fit since Pennsylvania American Water already owns the water system. This acquisition provides a long-term wastewater solution and a financial relief for the local community. According to the township's Board of Supervisors, because of the sale, township residents will receive a 50% reduction in real estate taxes in 2016. The proceeds of this sale will also help pay off approximately $21 million in sewer debt and avoid an anticipated $14 million in additional debt that would have been required to complete planned projects. Again, this is a great example of how we can bring solutions to municipalities struggling to finance the water and wastewater improvements while improving their service and keeping rates affordable for our customers. 
At the end of 2015, we had 12 pending acquisition agreements that were signed and awaiting regulatory approval. These acquisitions would add approximately 9,000 customers to our customer base if approved and completed. In 2016, we completed the purchase of 4 of these acquisitions, one of which was Environmental Disposal Corporation in New Jersey. This investor-owned wastewater utility provides service to more than 5,300 customers as well as bulk wastewater treatment services for several nearby communities. Additionally, in December, Pennsylvania American Water signed a memorandum of understanding for the potential acquisition of the wastewater assets of the Scranton Sewer Authority, which serves approximately 31,000 customers. This MOU commits the party to negotiate in good faith toward executing a final purchase agreement.
On the regulatory front, you can see a snapshot of our current activity on Slide 11. Our Illinois and Kentucky subsidiaries filed rate requests in the first month of 2016. In both states, we're seeking to recover a significant amount of needed capital investments offset by reduced or flat O&M expenses. In Illinois, we requested $40 million in additional revenues based on a projected total of $342 million of capital investment between October 2013 and the end of 2017. Our team in Illinois reduced their O&M expenses by about 3% since the last rate case in 2012, continuing the great work by our employees to keep bills affordable for our customers. In Kentucky, we requested $13.5 million in additional revenues, primarily driven by $79 million of capital investment while keeping operating expenses flat since 2012. Again, this focus on expenses allows us to make critical infrastructure investments, continuing the trend of keeping bills affordable for our customers. 
In Missouri, our case is moving along through the process, and we expect a decision sometime before mid-year. In West Virginia, we have not yet received a rate order, so I'll stay at a high level and base my comments from the press release sent out last night by the West Virginia Public Service Commission. The order provides an increase of $18.17 million in water rates and $151,000 in sewer rates. The commission recognized that the company reduced its O&M expenses from its last rate case and the adjustment to base rates is driven primarily by the increased investment we made to ensure reliable water service for our customers. And consistent with the normal process, West Virginia American Water will issue a press release once they've had a chance to review the order.
Moving to California. On February 1, we received approval from the California Public Utilities Commission to extend our cost of capital filing by 1 year. This will keep our authorized return on equity at 9.99% through 2017 for our California subsidiary. Meanwhile, despite some rainfall from the effects of El Niño, the drought continues in California. Our team continues to demonstrate leadership in dealing with the drought. And we're certainly proud of all their efforts to help our customers during this time. We also continue to make progress on the Monterey Peninsula Water Supply Project. Our test well is operational and the results are positive. The project is undergoing environmental and regulatory review by the California Public Utilities Commission. And this review is scheduled to be completed by the end of the year.
Moving to Slide 12. We ended the year with a 35.9% O&M efficiency ratio and we're on track to meet our 34% target by 2020. I know we've talked a lot about this, most recently at our Investor Day in December. But I think it's worth repeating. We've really made tremendous progress here. As you can see, the progress is evident by the amount of revenue requirement attributed to capital expenditures versus operating expenses. For the general rate cases we filed last year, we reduced our O&M expenses by $10 million or 17%. This reduction allowed us to invest approximately $65 million into needed infrastructure upgrades without affecting our customers' bills. Our employees are doing a great job in this area through leveraging best practices, improved efficiencies, technology and innovation. And this produces results for our customers as well as our company.
So with that, I'll turn the call over to Linda for more detail on our financial performance."

In the fourth quarter and for the full year of 2015, American Water continued to deliver strong financial results.

In the fourth quarter and for the full year of 2015, American Water continued to deliver strong financial results. As shown on Slide 14, earnings per share from continuing operations for the fourth quarter was $0.55, up $0.03 or 5.8% over the same period last year. This slide shows the contribution by business line to our quarterly and annual results. Let me walk through the numbers, then I'll discuss the drivers of the key variances on the next few pages. 
For the quarter, the Regulated Businesses contributed $0.54, up a $0.01; the Market-Based Businesses contributed $0.06, flat to the fourth quarter of last year; and the parent, which is primarily interest expense on parent debt, was $0.02 better than the fourth quarter of last year. For the full year 2015, earnings per share from continuing operations was $2.64 per share, an increase of $0.21 or 8.6% increase compared to adjusted 2014. The contribution from our Regulated Businesses was $2.63 per share, up $0.18 or 7.3% over adjusted 2014. The Market-Based Businesses' contribution was $0.24, up $0.02 or about 9% over last year. And the parent improved $0.01 per share. These annual increases are consistent with our long-term growth triangle.
Turning to Slide 15. Let me walk through the components of our quarter-over-quarter increase in earnings per share. The primary driver was higher regulated revenue of $0.09 per share from infrastructure surcharges and other rate increases to support our regulated system investments. This was partially offset by higher O&M expense of $0.03, mainly from the timing of maintenance-related work as well as higher claims and pension-related costs. Depreciation, taxes and other increased $0.05 per share, driven mainly by our investment growth. The improvement at the parent, up $0.02 per share, was mainly due to lower taxes from state tax apportionment benefits, partially offset by the $5 million contribution to the American Water Foundation that Susan mentioned. Also please note that the Market-Based Businesses were flat for the quarter as higher growth in our Military and Homeowner Services Groups was offset by a 2014 tax benefit.
Turning to Slide 16. Let me walk through the elements of our $0.21 increase in year-over-year adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations. The Regulated Businesses benefited from higher revenue of $0.18 per share, from authorized rate increases to support investment growth as well as increases from acquisitions and organic growth. In addition, there was a $0.05 increase due to mild weather during 2014 and an improvement in O&M costs of $0.02 per share. Offsetting these improvements was higher depreciation and taxes of $0.07 per share, driven by our investment growth. Overall, the Regulated Businesses increased $0.18 year-over-year. The Market-Based Businesses were up $0.02, mainly due to additional construction projects under our military contracts and the addition of Hill Air Force Base and the Picatinny Arsenal in 2014 as well as geographic expansion in homeowner services. Parent and other was $0.01 better than 2014, due mainly to lower taxes from state tax apportionment benefits, partially offset by the foundation donation.
Now let me cover the regulatory highlights on Slide 17. As Walter mentioned, we should receive the rate order from the West Virginia rate case soon. And as such, we currently have 4 general rate cases in process: Missouri, Virginia, Illinois and Kentucky for a combined annualized rate request of $87.4 million. For rates effective from January 1, 2015, through today and including the $18.3 million for West Virginia, we received a total of $98.6 million in additional annualized revenue from general rate cases and infrastructure charges. We encourage you to review the footnotes in the appendix of this slide deck for more information. 
Slide 18 highlights our improved financial performance across the board. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we made total investments of $386 million, primarily for regulated system investment. For the year, we invested a total of $1.4 billion. This includes $1.2 billion for regulated system investments, $64 million for regulated acquisitions and $133 million for the acquisition of Keystone. Excluding the Keystone acquisition, capital investment increased about 27% from 2014. Going forward, we expect to invest $6.4 billion over the next 5 years, of which about $5.5 billion will be to improve water and wastewater systems for our customers, $600 million for regulated acquisitions and $280 million for strategic capital. For the full year, cash flow from operations increased $82 million or 7% to about $1.2 billion, mainly due to the increase in net income. And our adjusted return on equity for the past 12 months was 9.43%, an increase of 57 basis points compared to last year from continued execution of our strategy. We also announced in the fourth quarter of 2015 a $0.34 common stock cash dividend payable on March 1, 2016. 
On Slide 19, as many of you will recall, during our Investor Day in New York, we gave 2016 earnings guidance of $2.75 to $2.85 per share. Today, we affirm that guidance range. There are certain important factors that could impact our 2016 results. And as we have done in the past, Slide 19 outlines those factors that we have included in our earnings guidance range. Swings outside of these ranges could cause results to differ from guidance. Weather is generally the largest variable impacting our earnings. Our range of plus or minus $0.07 represents what we consider to be normal weather variation that we have included in our earnings guidance range. For our Regulated Businesses, we see variations of plus or minus $0.03, primarily from the timing and outcome of rate cases, the timing of completion of capital projects as well as variations in O&M and production costs. American Water Enterprises' variability is driven mostly from the timing of future capital upgrades in military services and realization of our expected growth as well as claims costs in homeowner services. Variability for Keystone is primarily driven by natural gas prices and drilling activity in the Marcellus and Utica. I would also like to mention that our 2016 earnings guidance range includes estimated legal defense costs of about $0.03 per share related to the 2014 Freedom Industries chemical spill in West Virginia. As you may recall, we included $0.02 per share of legal costs in 2015. 
And lastly, I would like to address the expected impact from the 5-year extension of bonus depreciation. From a cash perspective, we are in a federal tax net operating loss position, so we do not receive a current cash benefit from bonus depreciation. We look at electing bonus depreciation on a state-by-state basis. In those cases where adopting bonus depreciation would be in our customers' best interest and where we expect to be able to utilize our NOLs, we will do so. Assuming we elect bonus depreciation in our regulated states, this would increase our NOLs and push out the expected timing of when we would become a cash taxpayer by about 1 year to 2021. From an earnings perspective, while this would be expected to reduce rate base and earnings, we do not see a significant impact to our 2016 earnings guidance range nor do we see a significant impact to our 7% to 10% compounded annual EPS growth rate for 2016 through 2020 because the rate base impact is largely offset by lower financing needs in 2020. We also have flexibility to mitigate some of the rate base impacts by redirecting a portion of our strategic capital already included in our 5-year plan to our Regulated Businesses as well as accelerating certain investments that continue to strengthen our critical assets for our customers.
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Susan."

Before taking your questions, let's review the American Water investment thesis that we shared with you at our Investor Day and briefly discuss the American Water Foundation. 
On growth, we affirmed our EPS growth goal of 7% to 10% for the next 5 years. We talked about our unprecedented 2015 capital investment, our continued O&M and capital efficiency and our plans for 2016. We know that reputation, operational excellence, reliability and dependable water quality are critical to our growth. Where and how we expanded our customer base in 2015 leverages these strengths, growing through tuck-ins, adding wastewater customers where we already serve water and growing our Market-Based Businesses. 
Our people have deep utility expertise and diversified experience. And they are our biggest competitive advantage. They also care deeply about our customers in the communities in which they live and serve. This was clearly demonstrated by what our employees dealt with in both Missouri and Illinois during the last week in 2015. Record rainfall of up to 12 inches fell during a powerful 3-day storm across the Midwest, hitting the St. Louis area hard and causing record flooding. Homes and businesses were submerged, highways closed and water and sewer utilities faced extraordinary challenges. Missouri American has 2 plants on the Meramec River, supplying water to about 20% of our customers in the St. Louis County area. Thanks to early planning and the construction of a system of temporary pipes and pumps, our customers never lost service and we maintained excellent water quality throughout the event. 
Our wastewater teams also worked around the clock during the heavy rain to remove pumps and motors that otherwise would have been lost to flooding. It is not just what our Missouri team did for our own customers, it's what they did for the surrounding communities in need. A local public water district had a flooded plant and lost the ability to serve its 20,000 customers. By opening a connection between the systems, Missouri American was able to help the district to serve many of those without water. Additionally, they worked with the National Guard to fill more than 500 tanker trucks that delivered our water outside of our service area. 
Which brings me to the American Water Foundation, funded by American Water's parent company, which keeps the communities we serve have a better quality of life. One key foundation partnership is with the Union Sportsmen's Alliance, where we have worked with local union members to build walking trails, public access areas and fishing facilities for communities, including projects for special needs kids. The foundation also has a partnership with the National Recreation and Parks Association in support of building better communities. Here, we focus on building or enhancing nature-based playgrounds for children and educating people on water and environmental stewardship practices. The foundation also matches employee donations to qualified charitable organizations up to $1,000 per year per employee. Earlier this month, the foundation made a $50,000 donation to the Flint Child Health & Development Fund to help the children of Flint, Michigan get the resources they need to deal with the lead exposure many have experienced. 
These examples of doing good as we do well demonstrate the dedication, expertise, strong character and the work ethic of the 6,700 people I get the privilege of working with every day. Certainly, our employees' commitment translates into our strong financial performance. But it also lets you know, as our investors, that we are a company whose people believe not just in what we do, Clean Water for Life, but also in how we do it. And we believe that it is critical for a company who wants to be as successful in the coming decades as we are today.
So with that, we're happy to take your questions."

So when we look at all of the different uses of our capital in terms of growth, in terms of raising our dividend, in terms of regulated investment, all of those different things, we look at a balance in optimizing those and also where we get the biggest value from every dollar that we spend. So we look at growth and the returns we get there. We look at regulated investment. And let me be clear that in our investment plan, the first thing we do is we invest whatever is needed in every one of our states to ensure that we provide safe, clean water that meets all EPA standards. So then beyond that is what we refer to as discretionary. But there is a base amount, which is significant -- well, over half of our capital that we spend to ensure that we provide those services. Then beyond that, we look at our dividend growth, which as we have said, we want to keep consistent with our EPS growth. So we want those to be correlated, so that's the guidance we've given. And we have a 50% to 60% payout ratio. And currently, we're at the lower end of that range, so there's room there. When we look at things like debt, and I'll let Linda talk about this more, the question we ask is what is best for our customers and our shareholders with the next dollar that we invest or whether we pay down debt or whether we're able to provide dividend? So as you know, to have -- to be in a strong financial position as we are, we have a lot of optionality and we're always looking at how we optimize that optionality."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. With me today are Linda Sullivan, our CFO, who will go over the fourth quarter and full year financial results; and Walter Lynch, our COO, who will give key updates on our Regulated Business",767,"Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. With me today are Linda Sullivan, our CFO, who will go over the fourth quarter and full year financial results; and Walter Lynch, our COO, who will give key updates on our Regulated Business. On January 1, Walter assumed additional responsibility for operational and safety best practices across our AWE Market-Based Businesses. So periodically, he'll give you an update on those efforts as well. 
The employees of American Water delivered strong results in 2015 for both the fourth quarter and the full year. We invested significant capital into needed upgrades for our systems to provide reliable and safe water and wastewater services. We continued our focus on managing costs and deploying technology so that our services remain affordable for our customers. And we treated and delivered water that consistently met and surpassed EPA drinking water standards. This includes the Lead and Copper Rule, which has generated a lot of news recently due to the crisis in Flint, Michigan. American Water samples for lead on a routine basis, and our water systems continue to be in compliance with that rule. 
We expanded our regulated customer base in 2015 by nearly 42,000 metered customers. About 9,000 customers resulted from organic growth in our existing footprint. 24,000 customers joined our system from acquisitions that closed during the year. An additional 9,000 are from acquisitions where we have written agreements in place and are just awaiting regulatory approval. We also continue to grow our Market-Based Businesses through new contracts and new customers. 
As you can see on Slide 7, we reported operating revenues of $783 million, a 7% increase above fourth quarter 2014. For the full year, operating revenues were nearly $3.2 billion, an increase of about 5% over 2014. Earnings from continuing operations were $0.55 per share for the fourth quarter, a 5.8% increase above fourth quarter 2014. Annual earnings were $2.64 per share, up 8.6% over 2014 adjusted EPS. The fourth quarter includes a $5 million contribution to the American Water Foundation, whose work I will discuss briefly before our Q&A session.
Turning now to Slide 8. You can see that we delivered on our strategies in both the Regulated and the Market-Based Businesses in 2015. We made about $1.4 billion in total annual investment, the highest in our company's history. We invested $1.2 billion in our regulated system, which improves our long-term service reliability and water quality for our customers. We're able to increase our investments at this level because of the expertise of our hardworking employees and our continuous improvement in both O&M and capital deployment efficiency. We're proud of our ability to deliver on our growth goals and effectively manage every dollar to deliver excellent customer service while we keep our customer bills affordable. 
Even more importantly, we know that our customers need to be able to trust that the water we provide is clean and safe. So while consistently meeting and surpassing all EPA requirements in 2015, we continued our focus on further strengthening our critical assets. Let me give you a couple of examples. We upgraded 2 of our company's largest water treatment plants, which serve over 300,000 customers in St. Louis County, Missouri. In Champaign, Illinois, we upgraded chemical treatment facilities nearing the end of their useful lives with improvements that included replacing gas chlorine facilities with safer technology.
In addition to these regulated system investments in 2015, we also grew our customer base organically and through regulated acquisitions. Our Market-Based Businesses continued to grow as well. In December, our Contract Services Group was awarded a 10-year O&M contract in Camden, New Jersey with revenue of approximately $125 million. Our Military Services Group expanded to 12 bases with a successful 50-year contract bid for Vandenberg Air Force Base with revenue of approximately $300 million. Our Homeowner Services Group expanded to 1.6 million service warranty contracts, and we grew our utility partnerships by adding Rialto, California and the Orlando Utilities Commission. As you know, we expanded our business through the acquisition of Keystone Clearwater Solutions.
So in summary, we produced excellent results for the year through our ongoing customer growth, highest annual capital investment in our history and we continued our O&M and capital efficiency. This continues our progress toward achieving our goal of 7% to 10% EPS growth through 2020. Based on our performance, our board declared a cash dividend of $0.34 per share during the fourth quarter. And we are affirming our 2016 earnings guidance range of $2.75 to $2.85 per share.
And with that, Walter will now give you his update."
250885,325256746,941241,"American Water Works Company, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 25, 2016",2016-02-25,"Earnings Calls","American Water Works Company, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Susan. Good morning, everyone. As Susan mentioned, our Regulated Businesses had a strong year all around with historic capital investment, smart and strategic acquisitions and continued O&M efficiency gains while balancing customer going-backs [ph",943,"Thanks, Susan. Good morning, everyone. As Susan mentioned, our Regulated Businesses had a strong year all around with historic capital investment, smart and strategic acquisitions and continued O&M efficiency gains while balancing customer going-backs [ph].  
 
As you can see on Slide 10, 2015 was a good year for growth. Through acquisitions and organic growth, we added, pending regulatory approval, nearly 42,000 customers in our Regulated Businesses. In 2015, we completed 14 acquisitions, adding nearly 24,000 customers to our existing footprint. 7 of these transactions closed in the fourth quarter, including our purchase of the municipal wastewater system in Fairview Township, Pennsylvania. 
This newly acquired system provides wastewater service to approximately 4,000 customers, including more than 200 businesses and commercial accounts. And it's a perfect fit, since Pennsylvania American Water already owns the water system. This acquisition provides a long-term wastewater solution and a financial relief for the local community. According to the township's Board of Supervisors, because of the sale, township residents will receive a 50% reduction in real estate taxes in 2016. The proceeds of this sale will also help pay off approximately $21 million in sewer debt and avoid an anticipated $14 million in additional debt that would have been required to complete planned projects. Again, this is a great example of how we can bring solutions to municipalities struggling to finance the water and wastewater improvements while improving their service and keeping rates affordable for our customers. 
At the end of 2015, we had 12 pending acquisition agreements that were signed and awaiting regulatory approval. These acquisitions would add approximately 9,000 customers to our customer base if approved and completed. In 2016, we completed the purchase of 4 of these acquisitions, one of which was Environmental Disposal Corporation in New Jersey. This investor-owned wastewater utility provides service to more than 5,300 customers as well as bulk wastewater treatment services for several nearby communities. Additionally, in December, Pennsylvania American Water signed a memorandum of understanding for the potential acquisition of the wastewater assets of the Scranton Sewer Authority, which serves approximately 31,000 customers. This MOU commits the party to negotiate in good faith toward executing a final purchase agreement.
On the regulatory front, you can see a snapshot of our current activity on Slide 11. Our Illinois and Kentucky subsidiaries filed rate requests in the first month of 2016. In both states, we're seeking to recover a significant amount of needed capital investments offset by reduced or flat O&M expenses. In Illinois, we requested $40 million in additional revenues based on a projected total of $342 million of capital investment between October 2013 and the end of 2017. Our team in Illinois reduced their O&M expenses by about 3% since the last rate case in 2012, continuing the great work by our employees to keep bills affordable for our customers. In Kentucky, we requested $13.5 million in additional revenues, primarily driven by $79 million of capital investment while keeping operating expenses flat since 2012. Again, this focus on expenses allows us to make critical infrastructure investments, continuing the trend of keeping bills affordable for our customers. 
In Missouri, our case is moving along through the process, and we expect a decision sometime before mid-year. In West Virginia, we have not yet received a rate order, so I'll stay at a high level and base my comments from the press release sent out last night by the West Virginia Public Service Commission. The order provides an increase of $18.17 million in water rates and $151,000 in sewer rates. The commission recognized that the company reduced its O&M expenses from its last rate case and the adjustment to base rates is driven primarily by the increased investment we made to ensure reliable water service for our customers. And consistent with the normal process, West Virginia American Water will issue a press release once they've had a chance to review the order.
Moving to California. On February 1, we received approval from the California Public Utilities Commission to extend our cost of capital filing by 1 year. This will keep our authorized return on equity at 9.99% through 2017 for our California subsidiary. Meanwhile, despite some rainfall from the effects of El Niño, the drought continues in California. Our team continues to demonstrate leadership in dealing with the drought. And we're certainly proud of all their efforts to help our customers during this time. We also continue to make progress on the Monterey Peninsula Water Supply Project. Our test well is operational and the results are positive. The project is undergoing environmental and regulatory review by the California Public Utilities Commission. And this review is scheduled to be completed by the end of the year.
Moving to Slide 12. We ended the year with a 35.9% O&M efficiency ratio, and we're on track to meet our 34% target by 2020. I know we've talked a lot about this, most recently at our Investor Day in December. But I think it's worth repeating. We've really made tremendous progress here. As you can see, the progress is evident by the amount of revenue requirement attributed to capital expenditures versus operating expenses. For the general rate cases we filed last year, we reduced our O&M expenses by $10 million or 17%. This reduction allowed us to invest approximately $65 million into needed infrastructure upgrades without affecting our customers' bills. Our employees are doing a great job in this area through leveraging best practices, improved efficiencies, technology and innovation. And this produces results for our customers as well as our company.
So with that, I'll turn the call over to Linda for more detail on our financial performance."

In the fourth quarter and for the full year of 2015, American Water continued to deliver strong financial results. As shown on Slide 14, earnings per share from continuing operations for the fourth quarter wa",1278,"Thank you, Walter, and good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter and for the full year of 2015, American Water continued to deliver strong financial results. As shown on Slide 14, earnings per share from continuing operations for the fourth quarter was $0.55, up $0.03 or 5.8% over the same period last year. This slide shows the contribution by business line to our quarterly and annual results. Let me walk through the numbers, then I'll discuss the drivers of the key variances on the next few pages. 
For the quarter, the Regulated Businesses contributed $0.54, up $0.01; the Market-Based Businesses contributed $0.06, flat to the fourth quarter of last year; and the parent, which is primarily interest expense on parent debt, was $0.02 better than the fourth quarter of last year. For the full year 2015, earnings per share from continuing operations was $2.64 per share, an increase of $0.21 or 8.6% increase compared to adjusted 2014. The contribution from our Regulated Businesses was $2.63 per share, up $0.18 or 7.3% over adjusted 2014. The Market-Based Businesses' contribution was $0.24, up $0.02 or about 9% over last year. And the parent improved $0.01 per share. These annual increases are consistent with our long-term growth triangle.
Turning to Slide 15. Let me walk through the components of our quarter-over-quarter increase in earnings per share. The primary driver was higher regulated revenue of $0.09 per share from infrastructure surcharges and other rate increases to support our regulated system investments. This was partially offset by higher O&M expense of $0.03, mainly from the timing of maintenance-related work as well as higher claims and pension-related costs. Depreciation, taxes and other increased $0.05 per share, driven mainly by our investment growth. The improvement at the parent, up $0.02 per share, was mainly due to lower taxes from state tax apportionment benefits, partially offset by the $5 million contribution to the American Water Foundation that Susan mentioned. Also please note that the Market-Based Businesses were flat for the quarter as higher growth in our Military and Homeowner Services Groups was offset by a 2014 tax benefit.
Turning to Slide 16. Let me walk through the elements of our $0.21 increase in year-over-year adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations. The Regulated Businesses benefited from higher revenue of $0.18 per share, from authorized rate increases to support investment growth as well as increases from acquisitions and organic growth. In addition, there was a $0.05 increase due to mild weather during 2014 and an improvement in O&M costs of $0.02 per share. Offsetting these improvements was higher depreciation and taxes of $0.07 per share, driven by our investment growth. Overall, the Regulated Businesses increased $0.18 year-over-year. The Market-Based Businesses were up $0.02, mainly due to additional construction projects under our military contracts and the addition of Hill Air Force Base and the Picatinny Arsenal in 2014 as well as geographic expansion in homeowner services. Parent and other was $0.01 better than 2014, due mainly to lower taxes from state tax apportionment benefits, partially offset by the foundation donation.
Now let me cover the regulatory highlights on Slide 17. As Walter mentioned, we should receive the rate order from the West Virginia rate case soon. And as such, we currently have 4 general rate cases in process, Missouri, Virginia, Illinois and Kentucky, for a combined annualized rate request of $87.4 million. For rates effective from January 1, 2015, through today and including the $18.3 million for West Virginia, we received a total of $98.6 million in additional annualized revenue from general rate cases and infrastructure charges. We encourage you to review the footnotes in the appendix of this slide deck for more information. 
Slide 18 highlights our improved financial performance across the board. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we made total investments of $386 million, primarily for regulated system investment. For the year, we invested a total of $1.4 billion. This includes $1.2 billion for regulated system investments, $64 million for regulated acquisitions and $133 million for the acquisition of Keystone. Excluding the Keystone acquisition, capital investment increased about 27% from 2014. Going forward, we expect to invest $6.4 billion over the next 5 years, of which about $5.5 billion will be to improve water and wastewater systems for our customers, $600 million for regulated acquisitions and $280 million for strategic capital. For the full year, cash flow from operations increased $82 million or 7% to about $1.2 billion, mainly due to the increase in net income. And our adjusted return on equity for the past 12 months was 9.43%, an increase of 57 basis points compared to last year from continued execution of our strategy. We also announced in the fourth quarter of 2015 a $0.34 common stock cash dividend payable on March 1, 2016. 
On Slide 19, as many of you will recall, during our Investor Day in New York, we gave 2016 earnings guidance of $2.75 to $2.85 per share. Today, we affirm that guidance range. There are certain important factors that could impact our 2016 results. And as we have done in the past, Slide 19 outlines those factors that we have included in our earnings guidance range. Swings outside of these ranges could cause results to differ from guidance. Weather is generally the largest variable impacting our earnings. Our range of plus or minus $0.07 represents what we consider to be normal weather variation that we have included in our earnings guidance range. For our Regulated Businesses, we see variations of plus or minus $0.03, primarily from the timing and outcome of rate cases, the timing of completion of capital projects as well as variations in O&M and production costs. American Water Enterprises' variability is driven mostly from the timing of future capital upgrades in military services and realization of our expected growth as well as claims costs in homeowner services. Variability for Keystone is primarily driven by natural gas prices and drilling activity in the Marcellus and Utica. I would also like to mention that our 2016 earnings guidance range includes estimated legal defense costs of about $0.03 per share related to the 2014 Freedom Industries chemical spill in West Virginia. As you may recall, we included $0.02 per share of legal costs in 2015. 
And lastly, I would like to address the expected impact from the 5-year extension of bonus depreciation. From a cash perspective, we are in a federal tax net operating loss position, so we do not receive a current cash benefit from bonus depreciation. We look at electing bonus depreciation on a state-by-state basis. In those cases where adopting bonus depreciation would be in our customers' best interest and where we expect to be able to utilize our NOLs, we will do so. Assuming we elect bonus depreciation in our regulated states, this would increase our NOLs and push out the expected timing of when we would become a cash taxpayer by about 1 year to 2021. From an earnings perspective, while this would be expected to reduce rate base and earnings, we do not see a significant impact to our 2016 earnings guidance range nor do we see a significant impact to our 7% to 10% compounded annual EPS growth rate for 2016 through 2020 because the rate base impact is largely offset by lower financing needs in 2020. We also have flexibility to mitigate some of the rate base impacts by redirecting a portion of our strategic capital already included in our 5-year plan to our Regulated Businesses as well as accelerating certain investments that continue to strengthen our critical assets for our customers.
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Susan."

Before taking your questions, let's review the American Water investment thesis we shared with you at our Investor Day and briefly discuss the American Water Foundation. 
On growth, we affirmed our EPS growth goal of 7% to 10% for the next 5 years. We talked about our unprecedented 2015 capital investment, our continued O&M and capital efficiency and our plans for 2016. We know that reputation, operational excellence, reliability and dependable water quality are critical to our growth. Where and how we expanded our customer base in 2015 leverages these strengths, growing through tuck-ins, adding wastewater customers where we already serve water and growing our Market-Based Businesses. 
Our people have deep utility expertise and diversified experience. And they are our biggest competitive advantage. They also care deeply about our customers and the communities in which they live and serve. This was clearly demonstrated by what our employees dealt with in both Missouri and Illinois during the last week in 2015. Record rainfall of up to 12 inches fell during a powerful 3-day storm across the Midwest, hitting the St. Louis area hard and causing record flooding. Homes and businesses were submerged, highways closed and water and sewer utilities faced extraordinary challenges. Missouri American has 2 plants on the Meramec River, supplying water to about 20% of our customers in the St. Louis County area. Thanks to early planning and the construction of a system of temporary pipes and pumps, our customers never lost service, and we maintained excellent water quality throughout the event. 
Our wastewater teams also worked around the clock during the heavy rain to remove pumps and motors that otherwise would have been lost to flooding. It is not just what our Missouri team did for our own customers, it's what they did for the surrounding communities in need. A local public water district had a flooded plant and lost the ability to serve its 20,000 customers. By opening a connection between the systems, Missouri American was able to help the district serve many of those without water. Additionally, they worked with the National Guard to fill more than 500 tanker trucks that delivered our water outside of our service area. 
Which brings me to the American Water Foundation, funded by American Water's parent company, which keeps the communities we serve have a better quality of life. One key foundation partnership is with the Union Sportsmen's Alliance, where we have worked with local union members to build walking trails, public access areas and fishing facilities for communities, including projects for special needs kids. The foundation also has a partnership with the National Recreation and Parks Association in support of building better communities. Here, we focus on building or enhancing nature-based playgrounds for children and educating people on water and environmental stewardship practices. The foundation also matches employee donations to qualified charitable organizations up to $1,000 per year per employee. Earlier this month, the foundation made a $50,000 donation to the Flint Child Health & Development Fund to help the children of Flint, Michigan get the resources they need to deal with the lead exposure many have experienced. 
These examples of doing good as we do well demonstrate the dedication, expertise, strong character and the work ethic of the 6,700 people I get the privilege of working with every day. Certainly, our employees' commitment translates into our strong financial performance. But it also lets you know, as our investors, that we are a company whose people believe not just in what we do, Clean Water for Life, but also in how we do it. And we believe that it is critical for a company who wants to be as successful in the coming decades as we are today.
So with that, we're happy to take your questions."

And thanks for the question. I will start, and then Linda may want to jump in. So when we look at all of the different uses of our capital in terms of growth, in terms of raising our dividend, in terms of regulated investment, all of those different things, we look at a balance in optimizing those and also where we get the biggest value from every dollar that we spend. So we look at growth and the returns we get there. We look at regulated investment. And let me be clear that in our investment plan, the first thing we do is we invest whatever is needed in every one of our states to ensure that we provide safe, clean water that meets all EPA standards. So then beyond that is what we refer to as discretionary. But there is a base amount, which is significant -- well, over half of our capital that we spend to ensure that we provide those services. Then beyond that, we look at our dividend growth, which as we have said, we want to keep consistent with our EPS growth. So we want those to be correlated, so that's the guidance we've given. And we have a 50% to 60% payout ratio. And currently, we're at the lower end of that range, so there's room there. When we look at things like debt, and I'll let Linda talk about this more, the question we ask is what is best for our customers and our shareholders with the next dollar that we invest or whether we pay down debt or whether we're able to provide dividend. So as you know, to have -- to be in a strong financial position as we are, we have a lot of optionality and we're always looking at how we optimize that optionality."

The employees",889,"Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. With me today are Linda Sullivan, our CFO, who will go over the first quarter financial results and Walter Lynch, our COO, who will give key updates on the regulated business. The employees of American Water delivered solid results in the first quarter of 2016 through the continued execution of our strategy. These strategies include, building constructive regulatory relationships through transparency, providing excellent service to our customers, growing our businesses, and continuing to become even more efficient in our operations to ensure affordability for our customers. 
As you can see on Slide 6, we are off to a solid start in 2016. We reported operating revenues of $743 million, a 6.4% increase above first quarter 2015. Earnings from continuing operations were $0.46 per share to the first quarter, a 4.5% increase above first quarter 2015.
Turning now to Slide 7. Let me discuss a few highlights of our strategy execution. As you know, the foundation for our earnings growth is the capital investments we make in our regulated operations to provide clean, safe and reliable service to our customers. Capital investment through March 31, 2016, totaled about $236 million with $202 million in our regulated infrastructure investments. We plan to invest $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion this year, of which $1.2 billion will be dedicated to water and wastewater system improvement. We're able to make these needed investments, while minimizing our customer bill impact by our continued focus on controlling O&M cost and through constructive regulatory mechanisms. Walter will talk more about these in just a moment. We had excellent growth during the first quarter, a special highlight with our announced acquisition agreement with the authority. Our Pennsylvania employees have provided water service to this community for decades and we're excited for the opportunity to be the future wastewater services provider to those 31,000 customers in Scranton and Dunmore. We also closed 7 acquisitions in 6 different states during the quarter, welcoming another 7,000 customers to the American Water footprint. Walter will also share with you an exciting announcement from just last night, which will add 3,100 more new customers. 
Moving to our Market-Based Businesses. In February, we began providing water and wastewater services to the city of Camden, New Jersey through our Contract Services Group. We already serve a portion of Camden through our regulated New Jersey American Water subsidiary and we're excited to serve the rest of that community. Camden will also be the home of our future corporate headquarters later this decade. We continue transition activities at Vandenberg Air Force Base and we look forward to serving our country's fine military men and women and their families there beginning June 1. This is our 12th military contract, which we announced toward the end of last year. We do see a few challenges this year in American Water Enterprises or AWE and Keystone Clearwater. Earnings were flat in AWE compared to the first quarter of last year, mainly because we accelerated $1.5 million in homeowner services marketing cost into the first quarter of this year. The first quarter results in our military services group were up compared to the same period last year, but we expect federal budgetary constrain to impact planned future capital upgrade projects for the remainder of 2016. That said, we are seeing significantly more bases in the RSP pipeline for privatization. We continue to believe in the long-term growth potential of this business segment.
Keystone continues to manage through the current challenging market characterized by low natural gas prices and excess supply. These conditions have persisted longer and been more severe than we originally anticipated and discussed with you at our Investor Day on December 15, when we shared that we believe that Keystone would be accretive to earnings in 2016. However, through a sharp focus on cost management as well as continuing to expand our customer market share in Appalachian Basin, we expect that Keystone will be earnings neutral and cash flow positive for us in 2016.
The energy information administration and many industry experts are predicting decreasing natural gas supply by late fall and increasing prices later this year and into 2017. And our own analysis tracks with these projections. We believe our business model, growing market share and solid balance sheet for the business will be a competitive advantage for us as the market recovers and other water services providers have found it difficult to survive. We're committed to Keystone and still believe is the good strategic trip for us going forward. 
As Slide 8 summarizes, we continue to make progress towards our achieving our near and long-term goals. Based on the results for the quarter, we affirm our 2016 guidance of $2.75 to $2.85 per share. We also continue our progress toward achieving our long-term goal of 7% to 10% EPS growth through 2020. 
Based on our solid performance, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend payment by 10.3% from $0.34 to $0.375 per share in April. This is our fourth consecutive double-digit increase in dividends. This also continues our commitment to provide strong dividend growth aligned with our financial performance, while also providing needed investment in our systems for the benefit of our customers and our community. 
With that, Walter will now give you his updates."

Good morning, everyone. As Susan mentioned, we're off to a solid start in 2016, growing our customer base, continuing our commitment to investing in our infrastructure, while focusing on improved O&M efficiency and cost reductions to mitigate the rate impacts for our customers. In recognition to the investments we make to ensure clean, safe and reliable service, we received a rate order in West Virginia during the quarter reflecting an annual revenue increase of $18.3 million. The main driver of the request was the $167 million we have invested since 2012. Key to this investment is our continued commitment to manage expenses. We've reduced operations and maintenance expenses by $1.1 million compared to our last rate filing, which was about 4 years ago. This past week, we filed a request for DSIC mechanism in West Virginia, known as an infrastructure replacement program or IRP. IRP has modeled after rate mechanisms recently gas utilities in West Virginia. If approved, the IRP would begin on January 1, 2017.
Our commitment to invest in infrastructure while focusing on customer affordability is clear in the cases filed during the first quarter. In Illinois, we invested $342 million, since 2012 and reduced operating expenses by 3%. In Kentucky, we invested almost $79 million since 2012, while keeping operating expenses flat. We also filed 3 of the rates cases since the end of the quarter. In Iowa and New York, we requested an additional $13.6 million in combined annualized revenue. In California, we filed a proposed application to set new rates in each of our service areas for 2018 through 2020. The new rates will take effect in January 1, 2018 earning approval by the California Public Utilities Commission. The application is seeking to raise revenue by approximately $50 million over the next 3 years, beginning with a $34.8 million increase proposed for January 1, 2018. The California Public Utilities Commission, which is the lead agency for the environmental review of the portion of the water supply project has informed the review is delayed for about a year. Our team in California along with public officials and many other stakeholders is working with the commission mitigate the impact of this delay. Falling our request, the commission issued a ruling agreeing to expedite consideration of 2 other portions of the water supply portfolio, which includes groundwater replenishment and storage and recovery. And together these projects will provide nearly half of the water needed in the Monterey Water.
Finally as part of our ongoing investment in our systems, we dedicated a new $18 million dewatering facility in Tennessee. This plant will reduce sludge affluence sent for the local sewage treatment plant by 95%. While the capital across this facility impacted rates about a $1 a month for the typical water customer, the project reduces operating expenses and has added a couple of permanent jobs. It also provided 150 to 200 jobs during construction. As you can see, on Slide 11, those benefits will recognized by city Council Chairman, Moses Freeman, who said, this is proof positive if these rate increases are improving the water for our people. All of this is for the betterment of our water and the community.
On Slide 12, you will see the success we've had in working with state governments and legislation, enabling solutions to water and wastewater challenges. In Pennsylvania, this past April, the Governor signed fair market value legislation into law. This arises water and wastewater companies to pay for and earn on municipal water and wastewater systems at appraised value rather than at the depreciated costs.
In Indiana, the Governor signed 2 pieces of legislation into law. Act 257, the distressed water and wastewater utilities act allows for water and wastewater systems of any size to qualify distress. This opens the appraisal process towards simple agreement between a Mayor of Council and the perspective buyer. And the utility determined to be distressed will not be subject to the existing referendum laws. The second piece of legislation signed into law was the system integrity adjustment act. This act creates the first water and wastewater revenues to building mechanism in state history, allowing for recovery of differences between authorized revenue and actual revenue.
As you can see, on Slide 13, during the first quarter, we closed on 7 acquisitions in 6 states, welcoming approximately 7,000 new water and wastewater customers. As Susan mentioned, we're pleased to reach an agreement with Scranton Sewer authority. This is the perfect example of the type of solution we can bring to communities, with long-term rates stability being one of the most important benefits for our customers. In fact, the cumulative savings in customer sewer bills were total more than $350 million over the next 30 years. This translates to approximately $7,600 per residential customer, a pending military and environmental approval as we anticipate closing this acquisition by September 30.
Additionally, Pennsylvania American Water just announced that we signed an agreement pending regulatory approval to acquire the wastewater system of the new Cumberland. This system serves 3,100 customers. Again, the system is in area where we already provide water services. So we're really excited about the opportunity to be a future provider of wastewater services for our new Cumberland customers. You can also see on slide how legislative efforts are helping us provide water solutions across our footprint.
Moving to Slide 14. We continue to improve our O&M efficiency ratio, achieving 35.6% for the last 12 months. Again, we are on track to meet our O&M them efficiency target of 34% by 2020. Let me give you a couple of examples of what we're doing to drive these results. The first example is in Illinois, where we're using geographic information system or GIS to map key components of our systems. This work improved our and inspection program by removing the overlapping routes and reducing travel time and fuel costs. In one district alone, we're able to cut annual travel distance by more than 5,500 miles. The GIS mapping information is also used to better identify and prioritize areas to invest capital, by locating areas more prone to main breaks, we can maintain our systems while minimizing costs.
The second example is in West Virginia, where our team deployed new technology and practices to reduce unaccounted for water. Investing in new leak detection system and utilizing a number of management tools, such as industrial side audits and district metering area analysis, we identified specific areas for corrective action. These efforts have reduced unaccounted for water from 28% to 22% in the 12-month period, reducing the amount of unaccounted treated water by 1 billion gallons during that period. These are just 2 examples of what we're doing to achieve this target. It's a great effort across the business and it's all about bringing value to our customers. 
And now, I will turn the call over to Linda for more detail on our first quarter financial results."

In the first quarter of 2016, American Water continue to deliver solid financial results. Slide 16 shows the contribution by business segment to our quarterly results. Earnings per share from containing opera",872,"Thank you, Walter, and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter of 2016, American Water continue to deliver solid financial results. Slide 16 shows the contribution by business segment to our quarterly results. Earnings per share from containing operations for the first quarter was $0.46, up $0.02 or 4.5% over the same period last year. The regulated businesses contributed $0.49, up $0.04 compared to the first quarter of 2015. The market-based businesses contributed $0.03, down a $0.01 compared to the same period last year. With AWE coming in flat compared to the prior year and Keystone coming in with a slight loss. Parent, which is primarily interest expense on parent debt was as expected down $0.01 versus the same period last year. 
Turning to Slide 17, let me walk components of our quarter-over-quarter increase in earnings per share. The primary driver was our Regulated Business, which was up $0.04. Regulated revenue was up $0.06 from authorized rate increases, infrastructure surcharges and the new revenue from recently completed acquisition. Depreciation was up about $0.02, primarily from growth associated with our regulated system investment. The market-based businesses were down $0.01 for the quarter. Keystone, which was not included in the first quarter 2015 results, reported a net loss of about $1 million or $0.01 per share. As Susan mentioned, natural gas market conditions are more challenging than we anticipated at the start of this year. The rig count in the Marcellus and Utica is about half of what it was last year. As a result, we are not planning for drilling activity to pick up in 2016 and Keystone has taken measures, which began in early March to position it to be earnings neutral in 2016. And we expect Keystone to generate positive operating cash flow.
AWE was flat for the quarter due to accelerating $1.5 million of pretax marketing expenses in our Homeowner Services Group to the first quarter. We accelerated these expenses because operate planned system implementation in July. Military services results were up for the quarter, but we expect a reduction in the amount of capital upgrade on our existing bases in 2016 due to reduced military base budget. As we have noted previously, these capital upgrades can be lumpy in nature from year-to-year based on the Department of Defense budget cycle. However, we are seeing stronger activity for base private request for proposal and we continue to see the long-term growth potential of our military business consistent with our 5-year plan.
Now let me cover the regulatory highlight on Slide 18. We currently have 6 general rate case in process for a combined annual -- annualized rate request of $110.6 million. This includes 3 cases we filed post quarter in Iowa, New York and the preliminary application in California. Additionally, in April, the Missouri PSC approved the stipulations in our general rate case. These provide for $4.7 million of additional revenue, which excludes infrastructure replacement surcharges of $25.8 million. This case is subject to final order by the Missouri PSC. 
For rates effective from April 1, 2015, through today, we received a total of $82.8 million in additional annualized revenues from general rate cases, infrastructure charges and step increases, including yesterday's approval of our DSIC filing in Indiana of $3 million. More information is included in the footnotes on this slide.
Slide 19 highlights our continued strong financial performance. During the first quarter of 2016, we've made total capital investments of $236 million, primarily for regulated system investments, mainly replacement and renewal of transmission and the distribution infrastructure. We expect capital expenditure to be in the $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion range for 2016. Included in this range, is our agreement to purchase the wastewater system from this Scranton Sewer authority. We are seeking to close this by September 30, 2016, once the necessary approvals are obtained. The purchase price of $195 million includes cash of approximately $38 million and is subject to purchase price adjustments. As part of the acquisition, we has assumed the obligations to comply consent from the EPA and the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, requiring system upgrades of $140 million over 10 years providing future capital growth potential.
For the first quarter 2016, cash flow from operations increased $49 million or 24.7% to about $247 million, mainly due to stronger collection of accounts receivable and the timing of unbilled revenues. Our adjusted return on equity for the past 12 months was 9.41%, an increase of 53 basis points compared to last year from continued execution of our strategy.
We also announced in April, a $0.375 common stock dividend payable on June 1, 2016, to stockholders of record as of May 9, 2016. This represents a 10.3% increase over the previous dividend.
Turning to Slide 20, let me discuss our earnings guidance. The headwinds we're currently facing in our market-based businesses fall within the key variables of the earnings guidance range we shared with you at our Investor Day in December of last year. In addition, we're taking appropriate measures to mitigate some of these headwinds. As such, we're affirming our earnings guidance for the year in the range of $2.75 to $2.85 per share. 
And with that, I will turn it back over to Susan."

We are proud to be the only water utility in the S&P 500, as well as in the Dow Jones utility average, which we joined in 2015. Additionally, in recognition of our environmental and sustainability leadership, we are also very pleased to be part of the Dow Jones sustainability index. To be named to the S&P 500 is a direct reflection of our employee commitment to deliver clean, safe, reliable and affordable water -- water to our customers every day. Our employees put our customers first. This results in a more positive constructive relationship with both customers and regulators. When regulators can trust our efforts to serve customers efficiently and effectively, they have confident in our ability to invest productivity in our water system. Investing more in our water system gives us more reliable service, better satisfied customers and growth. If this virtuous cycles that began with an employee-customer relationship. The successful execution of this equation is what drives our performance. The actions of our employees every day are the reason American Water is part of the S&P 500, the Dow Jones utility average and the Dow Jones sustainability index and I'm proud to be part of their team. 
And with that, we're happy to take any questions you've got."

On AWE, we basically, if you look at the chart that Linda ended with, it's within the ram of plus and minus as we looked last year Investor Day and projected the growth of AWE. So it's -- the business is running well. Also Linda mentioned, if you look at AWE, the year-over-year quarter being flat, we did accelerate some of the homeowner services marketing cost, because we have a system implementation in July and we didn't want to have marketing materials and what we tend to get our extra calls during the period of time when we were doing that.

So let me talk about the water services providers first, because Keystone that we mentioned, they had about 20% of the market share we bought them and due to being affiliated with American Water not owned by a competitor E&P company, but did start seeing market share grow up to now close to 30%. We've picked up several new large customers this year. So while the market has gone down from an E&P, our share of that market for water services has gone up. Just like the industry experts EIA are basically targeting fall to see the supply numbers based on some projections for the summer, going down and having to increase production, we see the same thing based on our discussions with our customers. So we are very conservative in our outlook, in our projections. So as Linda mentioned in the script, we are assuming no increase in production through the year and looking at cost controls for Keystone that include about 80% of our cost can be variable. We are looking at a lot of process improvements. We continue to grow market share. And you're exactly right, we are seeing some of the smaller water services providers who simply can't make it through this year. It's very difficult when you don't have a strong balance sheet as we do nor have a growing customer segment for those water services. So our Keystone management team has done an outstanding job as you noted in the time like this with a market like this, to get a position we're in, and we are very proud of that."

So we don't really have the take-or-pay exposure now. So that's good. But you're right, what we are seeing and you all read the papers everyday, you have bankruptcies as some of the smaller E&Ps and you are seeing a consolidation in the oil and gas industry. Let me remind you that, in the Marcellus and Utica, the Appalachian Basin, basically all of support is for natural gas, it is not for oil. And we are also seeing to that effect, the consolidation of the oil and gas companies, we're also seeing credit worthy partners. So to have a larger water services backed by company like American Water, is very attractive to some of our partners. Also keep in mind that, you have to build an infrastructure for water before you need it or before you actually start producing natural gas. So we are seeing some interest expressed later in the year to start some projects."

And so what's the internal thinking of, let's say, over the next 5 to 10 years non-regulated side, where American Water might dive into that is still part of the core water competency, but expands that non-regulated side or do we intend to grow what we have in the portfolio right now?"

And as we have said that 15% to 20% that's more of a limitation, not a target. So if the Regulated Business, if we see the 2 things that are happening nationally that there isn't acceleration in the number of governmental entities that want to sell their water, wastewater, and people have been seeing this for long term, we see a very steady legislation. If that happens, it doesn't mean we necessarily must ensure that market base is 15% to 20%, it's more of a limiter that from a risk-profile standpoint, it will not be more than that. That does not mean it has to be that percentage. So I will just say that upfront. Now in terms of growing the business, we believe, at American Water, that there is an enough opportunity related very tightly to our core competencies that we like to keep our growth engines related pre-directly to water and wastewater. So I will tell you that as we look at our businesses and market base, we are looking at, of course, homeowner services, military contract, we look at any potential new business and say, does this really playoff our competency, because our market-based business benefit because of the tremendous amount of expertise in our Regulated Business. It also helps our Regulated Business b bringing in a lot of competitive entrepreneurial type ways to look at things. So we think it's a very healthy relationship. We go through a very disciplined process to look at new businesses. Just as one example and this is public, we are very excited about the pilot project we did on geothermal Island at a school where geothermal has been for decades, but it's always utilized ground as the heat transfer agent. And you have to have pipes for example, the vertical 250 feet in the ground or horizontally, you need a lot of land, we're basically using our water main system to be the agent and it's not having effects on the water and it's able to heat and cool buildings to a geothermal system. While we know that our military base, this is another cross connection between our businesses, several of our military bases or all of them under a -- eventually a net zero charge from an energy standpoint. This type of technology can save 30%, 40%, 50% on energy cost. So we're looking at those areas that we have expertise, that we're aligned with that have really good applications as we look at different ways to grow in the market-based business."

We actually are doing some sharing in 2 locations in the Monterey Peninsula where, of course, we have the conservations measures and drought, we have a pilot in Monterey that we are partnering Pacific Gas & Electric to use their backhaul system, use water meters, smart water meters use their backhaul system to actually look at the data. We just announced about 2 months ago, that we are partnering with Commonwealth Edison, ComEd. We serve parts of metro, Chicago and we're actually partnering with them to utilize a different type of smart meter technology to, again, utilize some of their backhaul infrastructure. How this is a win-win is that, in our business as we have said, one of the strong parts of our investment thesis, is that we have years and years of capital investment we need to make because of the system nationally of the water and wastewater infrastructure system. So for us to say, we will put in the meters and the electricity company may already have the backhaul capability there from their smart meters, then where we can partner and utilize some of the infrastructure, it's great for customers and the regulators love it, because it shows directly a reduction in the amount of cost for customers. It benefits the electric utility and it benefits us, because if we're not building the backhaul, we just put that money into more pipes, plants and pumps replacements."

This also goes back to why our ability to not only increase and improve our O&M efficiency, but we have a lot of projects on how we also increased our capital efficiency. What are we doing to ensure that every dollar we spend, is being spent at the highest level of productivity. So it's a one-on-one thing, it's not with the general, but in it our state, our state presidents or staff sit down with the consumer advocates and basically walk through very openly what we need to do, why we need to do it and what we're doing to mitigate cost. And I will tell you, when you go in for DSIC and capital infrastructure, we say this, I don't know if some of you think, we say it too much, but I don't think it can be enough. The ability to manage our O&M cost, so that for every dollar of O&M say, we can put $6 of capital in the ground. When you hear like what Walter said, West Virginia over 4 years or 3.5 years, we've reduced O&M cost $1.1 million. We filed in Illinois, we've reduced our O&M cost by 3%. The ability to show that we are being good of the customer dollars goes long way."

With me today are Linda Sullivan, our CFO, who will go over the first quarter financial results; and Walter Lynch, our COO, who will give key updates on our regulated business. 
The employees of American Water delivered solid results in the first quarter of 2016 through the continued execution of our strategies. These strategies include building constructive regulatory relationships through transparency, providing excellent service to our customers, growing our businesses and continuing to become even more efficient in our operations to ensure affordability for our customers. 
As you can see on Slide 6, we're off to a solid start in 2016. We reported operating revenues of $743 million, a 6.4% increase above first quarter 2015. Earnings from continuing operations were $0.46 per share for the first quarter, a 4.5% increase above first quarter 2015.
Turning now to Slide 7. Let me discuss a few highlights of our strategy execution. As you know, the foundation for our earnings growth is the capital investments we make in our regulated operations to provide clean, safe and reliable service to our customers. 
Capital investment through March 31, 2016 totaled about $236 million, with $202 million in our regulated infrastructure investment. We plan to invest $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion this year, of which $1.2 billion will be dedicated to water and wastewater system improvement. We're able to make these needed investments while minimizing our customer bill impact by our continued focus on controlling O&M cost and through constructive regulatory mechanisms. Walter will talk more about these in just a moment. 
We had excellent growth news during the first quarter, a special highlight with our announced acquisition agreement with the Scranton Sewer Authority. Our Pennsylvania employees have provided water service to this community for decades, and we're excited for the opportunity to be the future wastewater services provider to those 31,000 customers in Scranton and Dunmore. We also closed 7 acquisitions in 6 different states during the quarter, welcoming another 7,000 customers to the American Water footprint. Walter will also share with you an exciting announcement from just last night, which will add 3,100 more new customers. 
Moving to our Market-Based Businesses. In February, we began providing water and wastewater services to the city of Camden, New Jersey through our Contract Services Group. We already serve a portion of Camden through our regulated New Jersey American Water subsidiary, and we're excited to serve the rest of that community. Camden will also be the home of our future corporate headquarters later this decade. 
We continue transition activities at Vandenberg Air Force Base, and we look forward to serving our country's fine military men and women and their families there beginning June 1. This is our 12th military contract, which we announced toward the end of last year. 
We do see a few challenges this year in American Water Enterprises, or AWE, and Keystone Clearwater. Earnings were flat in AWE compared to the first quarter of last year, mainly because we accelerated $1.5 million in homeowner services marketing cost into the first quarter of this year. The first quarter results in our Military Services Group were up compared to the same period last year, but we expect federal budgetary constraint to impact planned future capital upgrade projects for the remainder of 2016. That said, we are seeing significantly more bases in the RFP pipeline for privatization. We continue to believe in the long-term growth potential of this business segment.
Keystone continues to manage through the current challenging market characterized by low natural gas prices and excess supply. These conditions have persisted longer and been more severe than we originally anticipated and discussed with you at our Investor Day on December 15 when we shared that we believe that Keystone would be accretive to earnings in 2016. However, through a sharp focus on cost management as well as continuing to expand our customer market share in the Appalachian Basin, we expect that Keystone will be earnings neutral and cash flow positive for us in 2016.
The energy information administration and many industry experts are predicting decreasing natural gas supply by late fall and increasing prices later this year and into 2017, and our own analysis tracks with these projections. We believe our business model, growing market share and solid balance sheet for the business will be a competitive advantage for us as the market recovers and other water services providers have found it difficult to survive. We're committed to Keystone and still believe is a good strategic trip for us going forward. 
As Slide 8 summarizes, we continue to make progress toward our -- achieving our near- and long-term goals. Based on the results for the quarter, we affirm our 2016 guidance of $2.75 to $2.85 per share. We also continue our progress toward achieving our long-term goal of 7% to 10% EPS growth through 2020. 
Based on our solid performance, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend payment by 10.3% from $0.34 to $0.375 per share in April. This is our fourth consecutive double-digit increase in dividends. This also continues our commitment to provide strong dividend growth, aligned with our financial performance, while also providing needed investment in our system for the benefit of our customers and our community. 
With that, Walter will now give you his updates."

Good morning, everyone. 
As Susan mentioned, we're off to a solid start in 2016, growing our customer base, continuing our commitment to investing in our infrastructure while focusing on improved O&M efficiency and cost reductions to mitigate the rate impacts for our customers. 
In recognition to the investments we make to ensure clean, safe and reliable service, we received a rate order in West Virginia during the quarter, reflecting an annual revenue increase of $18.3 million. The main driver of the request was the $167 million we've invested since 2012. Key to this investment is our continued commitment to manage expenses. We've reduced operations and maintenance expenses by $1.1 million compared to our last rate filing, which was about 4 years ago. This past week, we filed a request for a DSIC-style mechanism in West Virginia known as an Infrastructure Replacement Program or IRP. IRP has modeled after rate mechanisms recently for the gas utilities in West Virginia. If approved, the IRP would begin on January 1, 2017.
Our commitment to invest in infrastructure while focusing on customer affordability is clear in the cases filed during the first quarter. In Illinois, we invested $342 million since 2012 and reduced operating expenses by 3%. In Kentucky, we invested almost $79 million since 2012 while keeping operating expenses flat. We also filed 3 other rates cases since the end of the quarter. In Iowa and New York, we requested an additional $13.6 million in combined annualized revenue. 
In California, we filed a proposed application to set new rates in each of our service areas for 2018 through 2020. The new rates would take effect in January 1, 2018, pending approval by the California Public Utilities Commission. The application is seeking to raise revenue by approximately $50 million over the next 3 years, beginning with a $34.8 million increase proposed for January 1, 2018. The California Public Utilities Commission, which is the lead agency for the environmental review of the desalination portion of the water supply project, has informed us that the review is delayed for about a year. Our team in California, along with public officials and many other stakeholders, is working with the commission mitigate the impacts of this delay. Following our request, the commission issued a ruling agreeing to expedite the consideration of 2 other portions of the water supply portfolio, which includes groundwater replenishment and aquifer storage and recovery. And together, these projects would provide nearly half of the water needed in the Monterey Water district. 
Finally, as part of our ongoing investment in our systems, we dedicated a new $18 million dewatering facility in Tennessee. This plant will reduce sludge affluence sent for the local sewage treatment plant by 95%. While the capital across this facility impacted rates about a $1 a month for the typical Chattanooga water customer, the project reduces operating expenses and has added a couple of permanent jobs. It also provided 150 to 200 jobs during construction. 
As you can see, on Slide 11, those benefits were recognized by City Council Chairman Moses Freeman, who said, ""This is proof positive that these rate increases are improving the water for our people. All of this is for the betterment of our water and the community.""
On Slide 12, you will see the success we've had in working with state governments on legislation, enabling solutions to water and wastewater challenges. In Pennsylvania, this past April, the Governor signed fair market value legislation into law. This authorizes water and wastewater companies to pay for and earn on municipal water and wastewater systems at appraised value rather than at the depreciated costs.
In Indiana, the Governor signed 2 pieces of legislation into law. Act 257, the Distressed Water and Wastewater Utilities Act, allows for water and wastewater systems of any size that qualify as distressed. This opens the appraisal process to a simple agreement between a Mayor of Council and a perspective buyer, and the utility determined to be distressed will not be subject to the existing referendum laws. 
The second piece of legislation signed into law was the System Integrity Adjustment Act. This act creates the first water and wastewater revenues to build a mechanism in state history, allowing for a recovery of differences between authorized revenue and actual revenue.
As you can see, on Slide 13, during the first quarter, we closed on 7 acquisitions in 6 states, welcoming approximately 7,000 new water and wastewater customers. As Susan mentioned, we're pleased to reach an agreement with the Scranton Sewer Authority. This is the perfect example of the type of solution we can bring to communities, with long-term rates stability being one of the most important benefits for our customers. In fact, the cumulative savings in customer sewer bills will total more than $350 million over the next 30 years. This translates to approximately $7,600 per residential customer, a pending regulatory and environmental approval as we anticipate closing this acquisition by September 30.
Additionally, Pennsylvania American Water just announced that we signed an agreement, pending regulatory approval, to acquire the wastewater system of the Borough of New Cumberland. This system serves 3,100 customers. Again, this system is in area where we already provide water services, so we're really excited about the opportunity to be a future provider of wastewater services for our New Cumberland customers. 
You can also see on this slide how legislative efforts are helping us provide water solutions across our footprint.
Moving to Slide 14. We continue to improve our O&M efficiency ratio, achieving 35.6% for the last 12 months. Again, we are on track to meet our O&M efficiency target of 34% by 2020. 
So let me give you a couple of examples of what we're doing to drive these results. The first example is in Illinois, where we're using Geographic Information Systems, or GIS, to map key components of our systems. This work improved our hydrant and valve inspection program by removing the overlapping routes and reducing travel time and fuel costs. In one district alone, we were able to cut annual travel distance by more than 5,500 miles. The GIS mapping information is also used to better identify and prioritize areas to invest capital. By locating areas more prone to main breaks, we can maintain our systems while minimizing costs.
The second example is in West Virginia, where our teams deployed new technology and practices to reduce unaccounted for water. By investing in new leak detection system and utilizing a number of management tools, such as industrial side audits and district metering area analysis, we identified specific areas for corrective action. These efforts have reduced unaccounted for water from 28% to 22% in a 12-month period, reducing the amount of unaccounted treated water by 1 billion gallons during that period. 
These are just 2 examples of what we're doing to achieve this target. It's a great effort across the business, and it's all about bringing value to our customers. 
And now, I'll turn the call over to Linda for more detail on our first quarter financial results."

In the first quarter of 2016, American Water continue to deliver solid financial results. Slide 16 shows the contribution by business segment to our quarterly results. Earnings per share from containing operations for the first quarter was $0.46, up $0.02 or 4.5% over the same period last year. The Regulated Businesses contributed $0.49, up $0.04 compared to the first quarter of 2015. The Market-Based Businesses contributed $0.03, down a $0.01 compared to the same period last year, with AWE coming in flat compared to the prior year and Keystone coming in with a slight loss. Parent, which is primarily interest expense on parent debt, was, as expected, down $0.01 versus the same period last year. 
Turning to Slide 17, let me walk through the components of our quarter-over-quarter increase in earnings per share. The primary driver was our Regulated Business, which was up $0.04. Regulated revenue was up $0.06 from authorized rate increases, infrastructure surcharges and the new revenue from recently completed acquisition. Depreciation was up about $0.02, primarily from growth associated with our regulated system investment. 
The Market-Based Businesses were down $0.01 for the quarter. 
Keystone, which was not included in first quarter 2015 results, reported a net loss of about $1 million or $0.01 per share. As Susan mentioned, natural gas market conditions are more challenging than we anticipated at the start of this year. The rig count in the Marcellus and Utica is about half of what it was last year. As a result, we are not planning for drilling activity to pick up in 2016, and Keystone has taken austerity measures, which began in early March, to position it to be earnings neutral in 2016. And we expect Keystone to generate positive operating cash flow.
AWE was flat for the quarter due to accelerating $1.5 million of pretax marketing expenses in our Homeowner Services Group to the first quarter. We accelerated these expenses because of a planned system implementation in July. 
Military services results were up for the quarter, but we expect a reduction in the amount of capital upgrade on our existing bases in 2016 due to reduced military base budget. As we have noted previously, these capital upgrades can be lumpy in nature from year-to-year based on the Department of Defense budget cycle. However, we are seeing stronger activity for base privatization request for proposal. And we continue to see the long-term growth potential of our military business, consistent with our 5-year plan.
Now let me cover the regulatory highlights on Slide 18. We currently have 6 general rate case in process for a combined annualized rate request of $110.6 million. This includes 3 cases we filed post-quarter in Iowa, New York and the preliminary application in California. Additionally, in April, the Missouri PSC approved the stipulations in our general rate case. These provide for $4.7 million of additional revenue, which excludes infrastructure replacement surcharges of $25.8 million. This case is subject to final order by the Missouri PSC. 
For rates effective from April 1, 2015 through today, we received a total of $82.8 million in additional annualized revenues from general rate cases, infrastructure charges and step increases, including yesterday's approval of our DSIC filing in Indiana of $3 million. More information is included in the footnotes on this slide.
Slide 19 highlights our continued strong financial performance. During the first quarter of 2016, we made total capital investments of $236 million, primarily for regulated system investments, mainly replacement and renewal of transmission and distribution infrastructure. We expect capital expenditures to be in the $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion range for 2016. Included in this range is our agreement to purchase the wastewater system from Scranton Sewer Authority. 
We are seeking to close this by September 30, 2016 once the necessary approvals are obtained. The purchase price of $195 million includes cash of approximately $38 million and is subject to purchase price adjustments. As part of the acquisition, we have assumed the obligations to comply with the consent decree from the EPA and the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, requiring system upgrades of $140 million over 10 years, providing future capital growth potential.
For the first quarter 2016, cash flow from operations increased $49 million or 24.7% to about $247 million, mainly due to stronger collection of accounts receivable and the timing of unbilled revenues. Our adjusted return on equity for the past 12 months was 9.41%, an increase of 53 basis points compared to last year from continued execution of our strategy. We also announced in April, a $0.375 common stock dividend payable on June 1, 2016 to stockholders of record as of May 9, 2016. This represents a 10.3% increase over the previous dividend.
Turning to Slide 20, let me discuss our earnings guidance. The headwinds we are currently facing in our Market-Based businesses fall within the key variables of the earnings guidance range we shared with you at our Investor Day in December of last year. In addition, we're taking appropriate measures to mitigate some of these headwinds. As such, we are affirming our earnings guidance for the year in the range of $2.75 to $2.85 per share.

Before we move on to Q&A, I do want to mention that we were very honored to be named to the S&P 500 on March 4. We're proud to be the only water utility in the S&P 500 as well as in the Dow Jones Utility Average, which we joined in 2015. Additionally, in recognition of our environmental and sustainability leadership, we are also very pleased to be part of the Dow Jones Sustainability Index. 
To be named to the S&P 500 is a direct reflection of our employees' commitment to deliver clean, safe, reliable and affordable water to our customers every day. 
Our employees put our customers first. This results in a more positive constructive relationship with both customers and regulators. When regulators can trust our efforts to serve customers efficiently and effectively, they have confidence in our ability to invest productively in our water systems. Investing more in our water systems gives us more reliable service, better satisfied customers and growth. Its this virtuous cycle that begins and ends with the employee-customer relationship. The successful execution of this equation is what drives our performance. The actions of our employees every day are the reason American Water is part of the S&P 500, the Dow Jones Utility Average and the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, and I'm proud to be part of their team. 
And with that, we're happy to take any questions you've got."

So actually, we're mitigating what happened in the first quarter and moving to earnings neutral for Keystone. On AWE, we basically -- if you look at the chart that Linda ended with, it's within the ram of plus and minus as we looked last year at Investor Day and projected the growth of AWE. So it's -- the business is running well. Also, Linda mentioned, if you look at AWE, being year-over-year quarter, being flat, we did accelerate some of the homeowner services marketing cost because we have a system implementation in July.

Because Keystone, and we mentioned, they had about 20% of the market share when we bought them. And due to being affiliated with American Water not owned by a competitor E&P company, we did start seeing market share grow up to now close to 30%. We've picked up several new large customers this year. So while the market has gone down from an E&P, our share of that market for water services has gone up. Just like the industry experts, EIA, are basically targeting fall to see the supply numbers based on some projections for the summer going down and having to increase production. We see the same thing based on our discussions with our customers. So we are very conservative in our outlook, in our projections. So as Linda mentioned in her script, we are assuming no increase in production through the year. And looking at cost controls for Keystone that include -- that 80% of our cost can be variable. We're looking at a lot of process improvements. We continue to grow market share. And you're exactly right, we're seeing some of the smaller water services providers who simply can't make it through this year. It's very difficult when you don't have a strong of a balance sheet as we do nor have a growing customer segment for those water services. So our Keystone management team has done an outstanding job, as you noted, in the time like this, with a market like this to get us to the position we're in, and we are very proud of them."

So we don't really have the take-or-pay exposure now, so that's good. But you're right, what we are seeing, and you all read the papers every day, you have bankruptcies at some of the smaller E&Ps, and you're seeing a consolidation in the oil and gas industry. And let me remind you that in the Marcellus and Utica, the Appalachian Basin, basically, all of our support is for natural gas. It is not for oil. And we are also seeing to that effect, the consolidation of the oil and gas companies. We're also seeing that they were credit-worthy partners. So to have a larger water services backed by a company like American Water, it's very attractive to some of our partners. Also, keep in mind that you have to build an infrastructure for water before you need it or before you actually start producing natural gas. So we are seeing some interest expressed later in the year to start some projects."

But obviously, with the water thing and the prowess of American Water, that regulated side is going to, at least in our view, meaningfully grow over the next 5 to 10 years. And so that means you're going to probably have to grow the nonregulated side to kind of keep it consistent with its current percentage of overall sales. And so what's the internal thinking of, let's say, over the next 5 to 10 years with the nonregulated side, where American Water might dive into that is still core to the core water competency but expands that nonregulated side?

And as we've said that 15% to 20%, that's more of a limitation, not a target. So if the Regulated Business -- if we see the true things that are happening nationally that there isn't acceleration in the number of governmental entities that want to sell their water and wastewater, and people have been saying this for a long time, we see it very steady, legislation HIP [ph]. If that happens, it doesn't mean we necessarily must ensure that market base is 15% to 20%. It's more of a limiter that, from a risk profile standpoint, it will not be more than that. That does not mean it has to be that percentage. So I'll just say that upfront. Now in terms of growing the business, so we believe at American Water that there is an enough opportunity related very tightly to our core competencies that we like to keep our growth engines related pre-directly to water and wastewater. So I will tell you that as we look at our businesses and market base, we are looking at, of course, our homeowner services, military contract. We look at any potential new business and say, ""Does this really play off our competency?"" Because our Market-Based Business benefits because of the tremendous amount of expertise in our Regulated Business. It also helps our Regulated Business by bringing in a lot of competitive entrepreneurial type ways to look at things. So we think it's a very healthy relationship. We go through a very disciplined process to look at new businesses. Just as one example, and this is public, we're very excited about the pilot project we did on geothermal on Long Island at a school, where geothermal has been around for decades, but it's always utilized ground as the heat transfer agent. And you had to have pipes, for example, if they're vertical, 250 feet in the ground; or horizontally, you need a lot of land. We're basically using our water main system to be the agent. And it's not having effects on the water, and it's able to heat and cool buildings to a geothermal system. Well, we know that our military bases -- this is another cross connection between our businesses. Several of our military bases or all of them are under a -- eventually, a net 0 charge from an energy standpoint. This type of technology can save 30%, 40%, 50% on energy cost. So we're looking at those areas that we have expertise, that we're aligned with that have really good applications as we look at different ways to grow in the Market-Based Business."

We have a pilot in Monterey that we're partnering Pacific Gas and Electric to use their backhaul system, use water meters, smart water meters, use their backhaul system to actually look at the data. We just announced about 2 months ago that we're partnering with Commonwealth Edison, ComEd. We serve parts of Metro Chicago, and we're actually partnering with them to utilize a different type of smart meter technology to, again, utilize some of their backhaul infrastructure. How this is a win-win is that in our business, as we have said, one of the strong parts of our investment thesis is that we have years and years of capital investment we need to make because of the system nationally of the water and wastewater infrastructure system. So for us to say we'll put in the meters, and the electricity company may already have the backhaul capability there from their smart meters, then we -- where we can partner and utilize some of that infrastructure, it's great for customers, and the regulators love it because it shows directly a reduction in the amount of cost for customers.

And in fact, it was very positive that we could continue and work on these other components for half of it before we actually build the desal plant for the other half. So it actually ensures we build part of the project earlier and then hopefully get a -- with everybody's support in the communities and the state, hopefully, then get the extension on the water withdrawal permit for the Carmel River."

Our state presidents, our staff sit down with the consumer advocates and basically walk through very openly what we need to do, why we need to do it and what we're doing to mitigate the cost. And I will tell you, when you go in for DSIC and capital infrastructure, we say this, and I know some of you think we say it too much, but I don't think it can be enough, the ability to manage our O&M cost so that for every dollar of O&M say, we can put $6 of capital in the ground. When you hear like what Walter said, as in West Virginia, over 4 years or 3.5 years, we reduced O&M cost $1.1 million. We filed in Illinois. We've reduced our O&M cost by 3%.

With me today are Linda Sullivan, our CFO, who will go over the first quarter financial results; and Walter Lynch, our COO, who will give key updates on our regulated business. 
The employees of American Water delivered solid results in the first quarter of 2016 through the continued execution of our strategies. These strategies include building constructive regulatory relationships through transparency, providing excellent service to our customers, growing our businesses and continuing to become even more efficient in our operations to ensure affordability for our customers. 
As you can see on Slide 6, we're off to a solid start in 2016. We reported operating revenues of $743 million, a 6.4% increase above first quarter 2015. Earnings from continuing operations were $0.46 per share for the first quarter, a 4.5% increase above first quarter 2015.
Turning now to Slide 7. Let me discuss a few highlights of our strategy execution. As you know, the foundation for our earnings growth is the capital investments we make in our regulated operations to provide clean, safe and reliable service to our customers. 
Capital investment through March 31, 2016 totaled about $236 million, with $202 million in our regulated infrastructure investment. We plan to invest $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion this year, of which $1.2 billion will be dedicated to water and wastewater system improvements. We're able to make these needed investments while minimizing our customer bill impact by our continued focus on controlling O&M cost and through constructive regulatory mechanisms. Walter will talk more about these in just a moment. 
We had excellent growth news during the first quarter, a special highlight with our announced acquisition agreement with the Scranton Sewer Authority. Our Pennsylvania employees have provided water service to this community for decades, and we're excited for the opportunity to be the future wastewater services provider to those 31,000 customers in Scranton and Dunmore. We also closed 7 acquisitions in 6 different states during the quarter, welcoming another 7,000 customers to the American Water footprint. Walter will also share with you an exciting announcement from just last night, which will add 3,100 more new customers. 
Moving to our Market-Based Businesses. In February, we began providing water and wastewater services to the city of Camden, New Jersey through our Contract Services Group. We already serve a portion of Camden through our regulated New Jersey American Water subsidiary, and we're excited to serve the rest of that community. Camden will also be the home of our future corporate headquarters later this decade. 
We continue transition activities at Vandenberg Air Force Base, and we look forward to serving our country's fine military men and women and their families there beginning June 1. This is our 12th military contract, which we announced toward the end of last year. 
We do see a few challenges this year in American Water Enterprises, or AWE, and Keystone Clearwater. Earnings were flat in AWE compared to the first quarter of last year, mainly because we accelerated $1.5 million in homeowner services marketing cost into the first quarter of this year. The first quarter results in our Military Services Group were up compared to the same period last year, but we expect federal budgetary constraint to impact planned future capital upgrade projects for the remainder of 2016. That said, we are seeing significantly more bases in the RFP pipeline for privatization. We continue to believe in the long-term growth potential of this business segment.
Keystone continues to manage through the current challenging market characterized by low natural gas prices and excess supply. These conditions have persisted longer and been more severe than we originally anticipated and discussed with you at our Investor Day on December 15 when we shared that we believe that Keystone would be accretive to earnings in 2016. However, through a sharp focus on cost management as well as continuing to expand our customer market share in the Appalachian Basin, we expect that Keystone will be earnings neutral and cash flow positive for us in 2016.
The energy information administration and many industry experts are predicting decreasing natural gas supply by late fall and increasing prices later this year and into 2017, and our own analysis tracks with these projections. We believe our business model, growing market share and solid balance sheet for the business will be a competitive advantage for us as the market recovers and other water services providers have found it difficult to survive. We're committed to Keystone and still believe it is a good strategic fit for us going forward. 
As Slide 8 summarizes, we continue to make progress toward our -- achieving our near- and long-term goals. Based on the results for the quarter, we affirm our 2016 guidance of $2.75 to $2.85 per share. We also continue our progress toward achieving our long-term goal of 7% to 10% EPS growth through 2020. 
Based on our solid performance, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend payment by 10.3% from $0.34 to $0.375 per share in April. This is our fourth consecutive double-digit increase in dividends. This also continues our commitment to provide strong dividend growth, aligned with our financial performance, while also providing needed investment in our system for the benefit of our customers and our community. 
With that, Walter will now give you his updates."

Good morning, everyone. 
As Susan mentioned, we're off to a solid start in 2016, growing our customer base, continuing our commitment to investing in our infrastructure while focusing on improved O&M efficiency and cost reductions to mitigate the rate impacts for our customers. 
In recognition to the investments we make to ensure clean, safe and reliable service, we received a rate order in West Virginia during the quarter, reflecting an annual revenue increase of $18.3 million. The main driver of the request was the $167 million we've invested since 2012. Key to this investment is our continued commitment to manage expenses. We've reduced operations and maintenance expenses by $1.1 million compared to our last rate filing, which was about 4 years ago. This past week, we filed a request for a DSIC-style mechanism in West Virginia known as an Infrastructure Replacement Program or IRP. IRP is modeled after rate mechanisms recently afforded gas utilities in West Virginia. If approved, the IRP would begin on January 1, 2017.
Our commitment to invest in infrastructure while focusing on customer affordability is clear in the cases filed during the first quarter. In Illinois, we invested $342 million since 2012 and reduced operating expenses by 3%. In Kentucky, we invested almost $79 million since 2012 while keeping operating expenses flat. We also filed 3 other rates cases since the end of the quarter. In Iowa and New York, we requested an additional $13.6 million in combined annualized revenue. 
In California, we filed a proposed application to set new rates in each of our service areas for 2018 through 2020. The new rates would take effect in January 1, 2018, pending approval by the California Public Utilities Commission. The application is seeking to raise revenue by approximately $50 million over the next 3 years, beginning with a $34.8 million increase proposed for January 1, 2018. The California Public Utilities Commission, which is the lead agency for the environmental review of the desalination portion of the water supply project, has informed us that the review is delayed for about a year. Our team in California, along with public officials and many other stakeholders, is working with the commission mitigate the impacts of this delay. Following our request, the commission issued a ruling agreeing to expedite the consideration of 2 other portions of the water supply portfolio, which includes groundwater replenishment and aquifer storage and recovery. And together, these projects would provide nearly half of the water needed in the Monterey Water district. 
Finally, as part of our ongoing investment in our systems, we dedicated a new $18 million dewatering facility in Tennessee. This plant will reduce sludge effluents sent to the local sewage treatment plant by 95%. While the capital cost of this facility impacted rates about a $1 a month for the typical Chattanooga water customer, the project reduces operating expenses and has added a couple of permanent jobs. It also provided 150 to 200 jobs during construction. 
As you can see, on Slide 11, those benefits were recognized by City Council Chairman Moses Freeman, who said, ""This is proof positive that these rate increases are improving the water for our people. All of this is for the betterment of our water and the community.""
On Slide 12, you will see the success we've had in working with state governments on legislation, enabling solutions to water and wastewater challenges. In Pennsylvania, this past April, the Governor signed fair market value legislation into law. This authorizes water and wastewater companies to pay for and earn on municipal water and wastewater systems at appraised value rather than at the depreciated costs.
In Indiana, the Governor signed 2 pieces of legislation into law. Act 257, the Distressed Water and Wastewater Utilities Act, allows for water and wastewater systems of any size to qualify as distressed. This opens the appraisal process to a simple agreement between a Mayoral Council and a perspective buyer, and the utility determined to be distressed will not be subject to the existing referendum laws. 
The second piece of legislation signed into law was the System Integrity Adjustment Act. This act creates the first water and wastewater revenues stability mechanism in state history, allowing for a recovery of differences between authorized revenue and actual revenue.
As you can see, on Slide 13, during the first quarter, we closed on 7 acquisitions in 6 states, welcoming approximately 7,000 new water and wastewater customers. As Susan mentioned, we're pleased to reach an agreement with the Scranton Sewer Authority. This is the perfect example of the type of solution we can bring to communities, with long-term rates stability being one of the most important benefits for our customers. In fact, the cumulative savings in customer sewer bills will total more than $350 million over the next 30 years. This translates to approximately $7,600 per residential customer, pending regulatory and environmental approval as we anticipate closing this acquisition by September 30.
Additionally, Pennsylvania American Water just announced that we signed an agreement, pending regulatory approval, to acquire the wastewater system of the Borough of New Cumberland. This system serves 3,100 customers. Again, this system is in an area where we already provide water services, so we're really excited about the opportunity to be a future provider of wastewater services for our New Cumberland customers. 
You can also see on this slide how legislative efforts are helping us provide water solutions across our footprint.
Moving to Slide 14. We continue to improve our O&M efficiency ratio, achieving 35.6% over the last 12 months. Again, we are on track to meet our O&M efficiency target of 34% by 2020. 
So let me give you a couple of examples of what we're doing to drive these results. The first example is in Illinois, where we're using Geographic Information Systems, or GIS, to map key components of our systems. This work improved our hydrant and valve inspection program by removing the overlapping routes and reducing travel time and fuel costs. In one district alone, we were able to cut annual travel distance by more than 5,500 miles. The GIS mapping information is also used to better identify and prioritize areas to invest capital. By locating areas more prone to main breaks, we can maintain our systems while minimizing costs.
The second example is in West Virginia, where our teams deployed new technology and practices to reduce unaccounted for water. By investing in new leak detection system and utilizing a number of management tools, such as industrial side audits and district metering area analysis, we identified specific areas for corrective action. These efforts have reduced unaccounted for water from 28% to 22% in a 12-month period, reducing the amount of unaccounted treated water by 1 billion gallons during that period. 
These are just 2 examples of what we're doing to achieve this target. It's a great effort across the business, and it's all about bringing value to our customers. 
And now, I'll turn the call over to Linda for more detail on our first quarter financial results."

In the first quarter of 2016, American Water continue to deliver solid financial results. Slide 16 shows the contribution by business segment to our quarterly results. Earnings per share from continuing ope",875,"Thank you, Walter, and good morning, everyone. 
In the first quarter of 2016, American Water continue to deliver solid financial results. Slide 16 shows the contribution by business segment to our quarterly results. Earnings per share from continuing operations for the first quarter was $0.46, up $0.02 or 4.5% over the same period last year. The Regulated Businesses contributed $0.49, up $0.04 compared to the first quarter of 2015. The Market-Based Businesses contributed $0.03, down a $0.01 compared to the same period last year, with AWE coming in flat compared to the prior year and Keystone coming in with a slight loss. Parent, which is primarily interest expense on parent debt, was, as expected, down $0.01 versus the same period last year. 
Turning to Slide 17, let me walk through the components of our quarter-over-quarter increase in earnings per share. The primary driver was our Regulated Business, which was up $0.04. Regulated revenue was up $0.06 from authorized rate increases, infrastructure surcharges and the new revenue from recently completed acquisition. Depreciation was up about $0.02, primarily from growth associated with our regulated system investment. 
The Market-Based Businesses were down $0.01 for the quarter. 
Keystone, which was not included in first quarter 2015 results, reported a net loss of about $1 million or $0.01 per share. As Susan mentioned, natural gas market conditions are more challenging than we anticipated at the start of this year. The rig count in the Marcellus and Utica is about half of what it was last year. As a result, we are not planning for drilling activity to pick up in 2016, and Keystone has taken austerity measures, which began in early March, to position it to be earnings neutral in 2016. And we expect Keystone to generate positive operating cash flow.
AWE was flat for the quarter due to accelerating $1.5 million of pretax marketing expenses in our Homeowner Services Group to the first quarter. We accelerated these expenses because of a planned system implementation in July. 
Military services results were up for the quarter, but we expect a reduction in the amount of capital upgrade on our existing bases in 2016 due to reduced military base budget. As we have noted previously, these capital upgrades can be lumpy in nature from year-to-year based on the Department of Defense budget cycle. However, we are seeing stronger activity for base privatization requests for proposals and we continue to see the long-term growth potential of our military business, consistent with our 5-year plan.
Now let me cover the regulatory highlights on Slide 18. We currently have 6 general rate cases in process for a combined annualized rate request of $110.6 million. This includes 3 cases we filed post-quarter in Iowa, New York and the preliminary application in California. Additionally, in April, the Missouri PSC approved the stipulations in our general rate case. These provide for $4.7 million of additional revenue, which excludes infrastructure replacement surcharges of $25.8 million. This case is subject to final order by the Missouri PSC. 
For rates effective from April 1, 2015 through today, we received a total of $82.8 million in additional annualized revenues from general rate cases, infrastructure charges and step increases, including yesterday's approval of our DSIC filing in Indiana of $3 million. More information is included in the footnotes on this slide.
Slide 19 highlights our continued strong financial performance. During the first quarter of 2016, we made total capital investments of $236 million, primarily for regulated system investments, mainly replacement and renewal of transmission and distribution infrastructure. We expect capital expenditures to be in the $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion range for 2016. Included in this range is our agreement to purchase the wastewater system from the Scranton Sewer Authority. 
We are seeking to close this by September 30, 2016 once the necessary approvals are obtained. The purchase price of $195 million includes cash of approximately $38 million and is subject to purchase price adjustments. As part of the acquisition, we have assumed the obligations to comply with the consent decree from the EPA and the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, requiring system upgrades of $140 million over 10 years, providing future capital growth potential.
For the first quarter 2016, cash flow from operations increased $49 million or 24.7% to about $247 million, mainly due to stronger collection of accounts receivable and the timing of unbilled revenues. Our adjusted return on equity for the past 12 months was 9.41%, an increase of 53 basis points compared to last year from continued execution of our strategy. We also announced in April, a $0.375 common stock dividend payable on June 1, 2016 to stockholders of record as of May 9, 2016. This represents a 10.3% increase over the previous dividend.
Turning to Slide 20, let me discuss our earnings guidance. The headwinds we are currently facing in our Market-Based businesses fall within the key variables of the earnings guidance range we shared with you at our Investor Day in December of last year. In addition, we're taking appropriate measures to mitigate some of these headwinds. As such, we are affirming our earnings guidance for the year in the range of $2.75 to $2.85 per share. 
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Susan."

Before we move on to Q&A, I do want to mention that we were very honored to be named to the S&P 500 on March 4. We're proud to be the only water utility in the S&P 500 as well as in the Dow Jones Utility Average, which we joined in 2015. Additionally, in recognition of our environmental and sustainability leadership, we are also very pleased to be part of the Dow Jones Sustainability Index. 
To be named to the S&P 500 is a direct reflection of our employees' commitment to deliver clean, safe, reliable and affordable water to our customers every day. 
Our employees put our customers first. This results in a more positive constructive relationship with both customers and regulators. When regulators can trust our efforts to serve customers efficiently and effectively, they have confidence in our ability to invest productively in our water systems. Investing more in our water systems gives us more reliable service, better satisfied customers and growth. Its this virtuous cycle that begins and ends with the employee-customer relationship. The successful execution of this equation is what drives our performance. The actions of our employees every day are the reason American Water is part of the S&P 500, the Dow Jones Utility Average and the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, and I'm proud to be part of their team. 
And with that, we're happy to take any questions you've got."

So actually, we're mitigating what happened in the first quarter and moving to earnings neutral for Keystone. On AWE, we basically -- if you look at the chart that Linda ended with, it's within the ram of plus and minus as we looked last year at Investor Day and projected the growth of AWE. So it's -- the business is running well. Also, Linda mentioned, if you look at AWE, being year-over-year quarter, being flat, we did accelerate some of the homeowner services marketing cost because we have a system implementation in July. And we didn't want to have marketing materials and what we tend to get are extra calls during a period of time when we were doing that.

Because Keystone, and we mentioned, they had about 20% of the market share when we bought them. And due to being affiliated with American Water not owned by a competitor E&P company, we did start seeing market share grow up to now close to 30%. We've picked up several new large customers this year. So while the market has gone down from an E&P, our share of that market for water services has gone up. Just like the industry experts, EIA, are basically targeting fall to see the supply numbers based on some projections for the summer going down and having to increase production. We see the same thing based on our discussions with our customers. So we are very conservative in our outlook, in our projections. So as Linda mentioned in her script, we are assuming no increase in production through the year. And looking at cost controls for Keystone that include -- that 80% of our cost can be variable. We're looking at a lot of process improvements. We continue to grow market share. And you're exactly right, we're seeing some of the smaller water services providers who simply can't make it through this year. It's very difficult when you don't have as strong of a balance sheet as we do nor have a growing customer segment for those water services. So our Keystone management team has done an outstanding job, as you noted, in the time like this, with a market like this to get us to the position we're in, and we are very proud of them."

So we don't really have the take-or-pay exposure now, so that's good. But you're right, what we are seeing, and you all read the papers every day, you have bankruptcies at some of the smaller E&Ps, and you're seeing a consolidation in the oil and gas industry. And let me remind you that in the Marcellus and Utica, the Appalachian Basin, basically, all of our support is for natural gas. It is not for oil. And we are also seeing to that effect, the consolidation of the oil and gas companies. We're also seeing that they were credit-worthy partners. So to have a larger water services backed by a company like American Water, it's very attractive to some of our partners. Also, keep in mind that you have to build an infrastructure for water before you need it or before you actually start producing natural gas. So we are seeing some interest expressed later in the year to start some projects."

And then continuing on the nonregulated side, you guys want to keep it somewhat of a smaller portion compared to the overall consolidated company. But obviously, with the water thing and the prowess of American Water, that regulated side is going to, at least in our view, meaningfully grow over the next 5 to 10 years. And so that means you're going to probably have to grow the nonregulated side to kind of keep it consistent with its current percentage of overall sales. And so what's the internal thinking of, let's say, over the next 5 to 10 years for the nonregulated side, where American Water might dive into that is still core to -- the core water competency but expands that nonregulated side?

And as we've said that 15% to 20%, that's more of a limitation, not a target. So if the Regulated Business -- if we see the through things that are happening nationally that there is an acceleration in the number of governmental entities that want to sell their water and wastewater, and people have been saying this for a long time, we see it very steady, legislation help. If that happens, it doesn't mean we necessarily must ensure that market base is 15% to 20%. It's more of a limiter that, from a risk profile standpoint, it will not be more than that. That does not mean it has to be that percentage. So I'll just say that upfront. Now in terms of growing the business, so we believe at American Water that there is an enough opportunity related very tightly to our core competencies that we like to keep our growth engines related pretty directly to water and wastewater. So I will tell you that as we look at our businesses and market base, we are looking at, of course, our homeowner services, military and contract. We look at any potential new business and say, ""Does this really play off our competency?"" Because our Market-Based Business benefits because of the tremendous amount of expertise in our Regulated Business. It also helps our Regulated Business by bringing in a lot of competitive entrepreneurial type ways to look at things. So we think it's a very healthy relationship. We go through a very disciplined process to look at new businesses. Just as one example, and this is public, we're very excited about the pilot project we did on geothermal on Long Island at a school, where geothermal has been around for decades, but it has always utilized ground as the heat transfer agent. And you had to have pipes, for example, if they're vertical, 250 feet in the ground; or horizontal, you need a lot of land. We're basically using our water main system to be the agent. And it's not having effects on the water, and it's able to heat and cool buildings through a geothermal system. Well, we know that our military bases -- this is another cross connection between our businesses. Several of our military bases or all of them are under a -- eventually, a net 0 charge from an energy standpoint. This type of technology can save 30%, 40%, 50% on energy cost. So we're looking at those areas that we have expertise, that we're aligned with that have really good applications as we look at different ways to grow in the Market-Based Business."

We actually are doing some sharing in 2 locations in the Monterey Peninsula where, of course, we have the conservations measures and drought. We have a pilot in Monterey that we're partnering Pacific Gas and Electric to use their backhaul system, use water meters -- smart water meters, use their backhaul system to actually look at the data. We just announced about 2 months ago that we're partnering with Commonwealth Edison, ComEd. We serve parts of Metro Chicago, and we're actually partnering with them to utilize a different type of smart meter technology to, again, utilize some of their backhaul infrastructure. How this is a win-win is that in our business, as we have said, one of the strong parts of our investment thesis is that we have years and years of capital investment we need to make because of the system nationally of the water and wastewater infrastructure system. So for us to say we'll put in the meters, and the electricity company may already have some backhaul capability there from their smart meters, then we -- where we can partner and utilize some of that infrastructure, it's great for customers. And the regulators love it because it shows directly a reduction in the amount of cost for customers, it benefits the electric utility, and it benefits us.

And in fact, it was very positive that we could continue and work on these other components for half of it before we actually build the desal plant for the other half. So it actually ensures we build part of the project earlier and then hopefully get a -- with everybody's support in the communities and the state, hopefully, then get the extension on the water withdrawal permit for the Carmel River."

And I will tell you, when you go in for DSIC and capital infrastructure, we say this, and I know some of you think we say it too much. But I don't think it can be said enough, the ability to manage our O&M cost so that for every dollar of O&M saved, we can put $6 of capital in the ground. When you hear like what Walter said, as in West Virginia, over 4 years or 3.5 years, we reduced O&M cost $1.1 million. We filed in Illinois. We've reduced our O&M cost by 3%.

With me today are Linda Sullivan, our CFO, who will go over the second quarter financial results; and Walter Lynch, our CEO, who will give key updates on our operations. Once again, American Water employees delivered strong results during the second quarter of 2016. We executed on fundamentals by investing in our water and wastewater system to ensure safe and reliable service. We operated efficiently to reduce cost impacts on customer's bill. We continue to grow our business based on our reputation and core competencies, and we work to provide excellent service to all of our customers. 
As you can see on Slide 6, we reported second quarter operating revenues of $827 million, a 5.8% increase above second quarter 2015. Earnings were $0.77 per share, a 13.2% increase above second quarter 2015. Our results reflect some timing benefits, partially offset by some one-time expenses. 
For the first 6 months in 2016, EPS increased 8.8% and revenues were up 6.1%. Slide 7 highlights how we are executing on our strategy. Our foundation remains capital investment in our regulated operations. 
During the first half of the year, we've invested $552 million in capital, including $24 million for regulated acquisitions. The majority of the remaining $528 million was in regulated operations, primarily to improve water and wastewater system improvements for the benefit of our customers. We plan to invest $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion for the full year, mostly for regulated infrastructure investments. That level of investment is balanced by our continued focus on controlling O&M costs as well as utilizing constructive regulatory mechanisms. Walter will cover this in greater detail, but we never lose sight of our customers and what they have to pay. This quarter was no exception, and our employees continue to improve efficiencies. 
We had excellent growth during the first half of 2016. We've added approximately 7,600 new customers from closed acquisitions and 5,300 customers from organic growth. We have agreements in place, pending regulatory approvals, which would add 47,800 more customers. That includes both the previously announced Scranton Sewer Authority, which will add 31,000 wastewater customers as well as our recently announced acquisition of Shorelands water company adding more than 11,000 water customers in New Jersey. 
I also want to mention acquisition activity that exemplifies my earlier comment about growing our business based on our reputation and core competencies. On Tuesday, the citizens of Iowa voted an overwhelming 86% majority to join the Iowa American family. Subject to a final agreement in regulatory approval, these 720 customer connections in will join the 730 new customers in Communities, Iowa, which closed earlier this year. These 2 additions result in a 2.3% growth from acquisition over the 63,000 customers we had in Iowa at the end of 2015. 
We are all very proud of the dedication, reputation and customer commitment of our folks in Iowa as well as in all of other states that we're privileged to start. In the Market-Based Businesses in the second quarter, we launch a municipal partnership through Homeowner Services in Georgetown, South Carolina. 
Our Contract Services Group signed a 10-year O&M agreement in July with a Township of South Orange Village, New Jersey, which has 4,700 customers. Our Military Services Group began service to our military and their families at Vandenberg Air Force Base on June 1. As we noted in the first quarter earnings call, we continue to see headwinds in AWE for the remainder of the year, primarily due to lower fixed capital upgrade on our existing military installations compared to previous years. Linda will discuss this a bit more in her comments. Many of you know that drilling activity is picking up in the Marcellus and Utica formation where our Keystone Clearwater subsidiary provide water services. 
As noted on the slide, as of today, we continue to see Keystone as being EPS neutral for the year. However, we will continue to evaluate the market and services demand and provide any update on our third quarter call. As noted on the slide, our market share continues to increase and is now around 35% of the water services market in the Appalachian Basin. As Linda will discuss in more detail, we experienced an increase in our medical cost during the second quarter, some of which we expect to impact us through the second half of the year. I will address some of the more innovative ways we are looking to manage these costs in the future in our closing remarks. 
As you can see on Slide 8, based on the results during the first half of the year, we remained on track and we are affirming our 2016 guidance of $2.75 to $2.85 per share. We also continue our progress to achieving our long-term goal of 7% to 10% EPS growth through 2020. 
And with that, Walter will give you his update on our operations."
250885,376566716,1024870,"American Water Works Company, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2016",2016-08-04,"Earnings Calls","American Water Works Company, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Susan.

We're really proud of the results our employees have delivered this Year. We've had strong growth, we made smart investments, we need to surpass all standards as shown in our annual water quality reports and we continue to realize efficiencies across the business. Through June 30, we've invested more than $535 million in our Regulated business. Of that total, we've invested $511 million to maintain and improve the service we provide and another $24 million for Regulated acquisitions. At Susan said, this investment is balanced my our focus on cost management, constructive regulatory mechanism and legislation that enables us to assist communities, who challenge water and wastewater systems. 
Our commitment to invest in our infrastructure, while focusing on customer affordability, is clear in rate cases filed and closed this year. In Missouri, our rate case settlement was adopted, and we received an order for $4.5 million of additional annualized revenue. As part of the rate order, the PSC further consolidated water to the geographic regions, going from 19 water regions to 3 and 13 wastewater regions to 2. This creates economics of scale by spreading costs over a larger group of customers, reduces company administrative costs and mitigates the volatility of our customer bills. 
During the second quarter, Iowa and New York requested an additional $13.6 million in combined annualized revenue and lower operating expenses were $3.6 million collectively. In California, on July 1, we filed an application that set new rates in each of our service areas for 2018 through 2020. This application seeks a revenue increase statewide of $51 million over the 3-year period. Also, the State Water Resources Control Board approved the 5-year time extension for California American Water to comply with the 2009 order to significantly reduce withdrawals of water from the Carmel River. This action by the board recognizes our significant progress in building cooperative alliances among California American, local governments and communities and environmental organizations. With these alliances, we're pursuing projects and water recycling and reuse that augment our water needs both before and after completion of our planned desalination facility. 
On Slide 11, you can see the success we've had in working with state governments and our commissions either in legislation or policy that enables water solutions to water and wastewater challenges. For example, the Pennsylvania legislature eliminated a consolidated tax adjustment in setting the utility rates. The new law now requires a calculation of the public utility's federal income tax expense on a stand-alone basis, separate from any gains or losses of unregulated affiliates. Prior to this law, Pennsylvania was 1 of our few states that had a consolidated tax adjustment. 
In Illinois over the last several months, Illinois American Water has worked to find solution to help our customers have a more reliable water system more quickly. The Illinois Commerce Commission adopted new rules in June, which removes the 5% cap between rate cases and instead permits rates that can an average of 2.5% a year, with no year to increase more than 3.5%. This will be a big help and stay with big infrastructure challenges. 
Finally, in Kentucky, the government signed House Bill 309 into law. This law establishes a framework for public-private partnerships in Kentucky. For the first time ever, the state or local governments can leverage private investment that complete necessary infrastructure projects to better serve the public. This law has been referenced as the most comprehensive legislation to date in the nation. 
As you can see on Slide 12, during the first half of the year, in addition to our organic growth, we welcomed about 7,600 new water and wastewater customer connections, which is about 20,000 people. We have pending acquisitions, which represents another 47,800 new customers. This includes the Shorelands acquisition, which is more than 11,000 water customers. This is another example of how we're able to provide solutions. Shorelands service area is in the part of the state that is designated by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection as a critical area in terms of water supply. Once the purchase is approved and closed, we'll welcome our new employees and our new customers. We're also working to close our acquisition of the Scranton Sewer Authority by September 30. Here, we will welcome 31,000 new wastewater customers. We will benefit from our operational and engineering expertise and our commitment to make necessary capital investments. 
You can also see in this slide, how legislative efforts are helping us provide water and wastewater solutions for people across our footprint. Out of the 9 states where we have pending our closed acquisitions, 5 have fair market value legislation. The importance of this legislation is evident when you look at the numbers. Nearly 97% of the customers we have closed are dependent and one of these fair market value space. 
Moving to Slide 13. We continue to improve our own efficiency ratio, achieving 35.2% for the last 12 months. We remain on track to meet our own efficiency target of 34% by 2020. It's a great effort by our employees across our business. And it's all about bringing value to our customers. As I did last quarter, let me provide you with a couple of examples of what we're doing to drive these results. The first example is in our customer service centers, where we've recently introduced new features to our customer self-service site. These changes improve the customer experience by using easy-to-understand language for recurring payments and enabling our customers to change the bank account to use to pay their bills without the need to contact us. For the month of July, more than 17,000 customers sign up for paperless billing and that's more than 3x the amount of customers that signed up in the month of June. The changes are a true win-win to make it easier for our customers and do business with us and to enable us to drive down costs. 
In New Jersey in the energy deregulated state, we've taken advantage of reverse options to reduce our electricity cost. We first did this in 2011 and completed another option this past fall. For this process, New Jersey American Water will save a total of $9 million for the next 3 years in energy cost, benefiting our customers. When we reduce $1 in operation to maintenance expense, we can invest $6 in capital. The $9 million cost reduction will translate into an additional $54 million in capital improvements without impacting our customer's rates. 
Finally, we thank our employees in West Virginia for the way they responded to the devastating floods there this past June. Once again, our team rose to the challenge, working safely and getting our service restored as quickly as possible. Additionally, they insist in state wide emergency response efforts. For example, we loan 2 water tankers to the West Virginia Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management to provide portable quarter for flood devastating communities outside our service area. We also provided 3 large generators to run critical facilities in neighboring communities without power. It was a great effort by employees there, and we're very, very proud of them. 
And now we'll turn the call over to Linda for more detail on our second quarter financial results."

In the second quarter of 2016, American Water delivered strong financial results. And year-to-date, we remain on track. Slide 16 shows the earnings per share contribution from each of our businesses. We repor",1051,"Thank you, Walter, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter of 2016, American Water delivered strong financial results. And year-to-date, we remain on track. Slide 16 shows the earnings per share contribution from each of our businesses. We reported earnings of $0.77 per share in the second quarter, up $0.09 or 13.2% over the same quarter last year. 
Year-to-date, we reported earnings per share of $1.23, up $0.10 or 8.8% over the same period last to. For the quarter, the Regulated Businesses were up $0.08 and the Market-Based Businesses were up $0.01. Parent, which is primarily interest expense on parent debt, was flat compared to the same period last year. 
Turning to Slide 17, let me walk through the components of our quarter-over-quarter increase in earnings per share. The primary driver for earnings growth was in our Regulated business, which was up $0.08. Regulated revenue was up $0.10 from authorized rate increases, infrastructure surcharges and new revenue from completed acquisitions and organic growth. 
O&M expense was down $0.01 per share. This represents continued improved O&M efficiency that Walter discussed and some timing impacts, including a one-time 2 benefit from settlement of the Missouri rate care that will be offset during the remainder of the year. Largely offsetting these positive items were higher medical and prescription drug insurance cost of about $5 million pretax that are managed through our Trust. These higher costs are the result of 3 items. First, we have been managing down the overfunded status of our Trust, and this year, the funded status went from being overfunded to being fully funded; second, we are seeing an increase in claims cost; and third, we trued up our liability based on our claims experience. As I mentioned, the second quarter impact was about $5 million pretax or $0.02 per share. For the remainder of the year, we estimate increase in claims will add another $3 million pretax, putting the full year increase at about $8 million pretax or $0.03 per share. American Water, like other employers, is challenged by a rising health care cost, and later, Susan will discuss actions we are taking to manage these costs going forward. Next, interest expense was up a $0.01 and deprivation expense was up about $0.02, both driven by growth associated with our Regulated system investments. 
Moving to our Market-Based Businesses. Quarterly net income was up $0.01 per share, primarily from a favorable contract dispute settlement of about $3 million pretax, which we had expected to receive later this year. After this favorable settlement, the Market-Based Businesses were relatively flat. Increases in Homeowner Services as well as the acquisition of Keystone last July were largely offset by lower capital upgrades in our Military Services Group. As noted in our first quarter call, we expect lower capital upgrades in 2016 from reduced federal budgets and because these capital upgrades can be lumpy year-over-year. One of the biggest reasons capital upgrade were lower in the second quarter was to wind down of an $85 million, 3-year project at Fort Polk. 
Let me now cover the regulatory headlights on Slide 18. We currently have 6 general rate cases and 1 infrastructure surcharge request in process for a combined annualized rate request of $113 million. For rates effective from July 1, 2015, through today, we received a total of $102 million in additional annualized revenues from general rate cases, infrastructure charges and step increases. 
As you can see on this slide, our requested ROE in our outstanding general rate cases is generally 10.75% to 10.8%, with recent authorizations at 9.75% in several of our states. Overall, our weighted, companywide authorized ROE was 9.9% at the end of this quarter. 
Looking at the change in ROE over the past 3 years since 2013, the company's average authorized ROE has only moved about 10 basis points from a prior average of 10%. And during the same time period, our weighted authorized equity ratio increased about 20 basis points. So even with sustained low interest rates over this period, changes in ROE have tended to be slow and gradual. 
Slide 19 highlights our continued strong financial performance. We made total capital investments of $316 million during the second quarter of 2016 and $552 million year-to-date, primarily for regulated system investments, mainly for the replacement and renewal of transmission and distribution infrastructure. We expect total capital expenditures to be in the $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion range in 2016. 
Our capital expenditure range was updated to include our pending acquisitions. I would also like to point out that the Shorelands acquisition announced yesterday is a stock-for-stock transaction and the maximum number of shares to be exchanged at closing will be less than 500,000, with the final number of shares based upon American Water stock price. We expect to close the transaction in the first quarter of 2017. 
For the second quarter of 2016, cash flow from operations increased $51 million or about 23% to $271 million, mainly due to focused efforts on improving the aging of our accounts receivable as well as the timing of accounts payable and accrued liability. 
Our adjusted return on equity for the past 12 months was 9.55%, an increase of 57 basis points compared to last year from continued execution on our strategies. We also announced in July a $0.375 common stock dividend payable on September 1, 2016, to stockholders of record as of August 8, 2016. 
Turning to Slide 20, we are affirming our 2016 earnings guidance. I would like to point out a few items. First, weather impacts in July are expected to be minimal, as the hot temperatures across many of our states are also accompanied by rainfall. Second, our year-to-date earnings were strong across the business. However, as I've noted, they also include some timing related items including the favorable contract dispute settlement at AWE, which we had expected later in the year, and the 2 benefit from settlement of the Missouri rate case that will be offset during the remainder of the year. Third, looking forward, despite the expected increase in group insurance cost and the headwinds we've previously discussed at our Military Services Group in Keystone, we affirm our earnings guidance range of 2 75 to 2 85 per share. 
With that, I'll turn it back over to Susan."

Before we move on to Q&A, I'd like to take a couple of minutes to talk about health care costs. Like other companies, our health care costs are going up. This is especially true in utilities where we have an even more pronounced aging workforce. We're currently partnering with our health care and pharmacy providers for better pricing, while strongly promoting a healthy and safe culture of our employees. We continue to promote wellness and health management programs, preventive care screening and education for employees on being thoughtful consumers of health care, but we're going a step further. Earlier this year, American Water was a founding member with 20 national companies, which you see on the chart, to form the health transformational alliance, or HTA. Since the initiative was kicked off in February, an additional 13 companies have joined the alliance. It will be now 33 companies representing more than 5.5 million people across the country. We're proud to be part of this cutting edge effort. The overall goal of the HTA is to create higher quality care by first partnering with facilities and positions that have better outcomes, while also aggregating the purchasing power of all the member companies to keep cost down. 
Additionally, HTA companies will pull our data without identifying individual information for better treatment options, better health outcomes and more reasonable and efficient pricing. The HTA is following a similar process for pharmaceutical purchasing and contracting systems. The HTA's efforts have been highlighted recently in several major publications, including The Wall Street Journal, Barron's and the Boston Globe. This is just the start of an exciting collaborative effort. We will keep you updated as we work with the leading companies throughout the United States to improve the quality of healthcare and slow the rising cost for our company, employees and their families. So in summary, our year-to-date financial performance reflects the successful execution of our strategy, investing in our system, upgrading efficiently, growing our business and remaining steadfast in our commitment to the highest standards of customer service and water quality. 
And with that, we're happy to take your questions."

So can you just talk a little bit about transitioning those rates across your system from these second surcharges over to base rates and whether that just becomes a bigger and bigger part of the business, DSIC and surcharges?

So even if in many states, municipalities are regulated by the PSC, the recognition of water and wastewater challenges is shared by everyone. So we do find it in many of our states, they are concerned about water quality, water issues along with their government entities.

They have to provide for schools and for roads and for parks, and the responsibility that these municipalities have is so long. And as we know, a lot of the federal funds aren't there any more that were there during the '70s and '80s and even '90s. And so they are trying to this they can to serve this to their communities. So where it make sense, and this is an option for them and they choose to put their systems up for sale. Having this type of legislation takes an obstacle away from that. In the past, we've had situations where a municipality or governmental entity willing to sell a system, we're willing to buy it. But because of the way things worked between the book value and what we're able to put in a rate base that was a considered premium, it stopped a lot of deals before they ever took place. So I think this is an effort by states to have a win-win situation. But at the end of the day, the people in those communities need to be better off and the municipalities are able then to provide critical services that they're responsible for."

We are faced with years of investment.

So you don't have people that have gone from being so far down to think, we're going to pull out all the stops and ramp everything up immediately. They have a cautiousness, so we have a cautiousness. And it is a testing of the waters. The foundations are becoming stronger. We're seeing natural gas prices, I think, closed yesterday at 2 84, for example. Just in April, it was a $1.90 per million Btu. We're starting to see better pricing as the supply is being drawn down, because of the heat across the country in this summer. We're starting to see some activities where people had not been doing drilling and now they are. We're starting to see some more drilling rigs come up. So our cautiousness is the timing. It is the spacing. It is how quickly will we see this come up, how quickly will we see the supply that's basically been drawn down and being replenished, what are the forecast for the winter month, how colder the winter be. So we try to be looking at objective third-party data like price projections, like drilling projections. We look at all of that. Then we also look at our internal discussions we have with our customers and what their drilling plans are. So the cautiousness is, which you don't want people to flip back and forth and say, it's not good, it's good. We just want to be very cautious, as we look at the ramp up in the continuing string of the natural gas drilling market and make sure that we're very careful in how we look at that emergent."

So we're very excited about that, because what that will do is they start construction as they have been in 2018 and finish in 2020. You're talking about even more valuable natural gas drilling where you can get the NGLs along with the natural gas. So we just see that area and the intersection between Utica and Marcellus being very rich in terms of the fact as we know that it is the cheapest to drill for the drillers, and it also requires a good bit of water because of the depth of the formations. So we think that's the rock to be, and we've been asking also at this point, we're not interested in going into other formations, because we think that the Utica and Marcellus is where we have the most key areas for production growth in the future."

And so others are the players then I understand that oil prices are supposed to decline because of seasonality, but they're also expected to decline following that. And in addition to that, if you look at any upstream player, they're all about how expecting to use. I think they were using something like 1,500 pounds of sand for lateral or somewhere around there, and it's expected to go to 2,000. And so I'm wondering if there's a potential to expand and capture more business in the Utica, because it's kind of open there. And then 2, net increase sand means increased means for water there. So how you guys factoring into your fingers, and if so, are you expecting how much of a positive impact, because a year ago, that was 1,000 pounds and now we're talking doubling that.

What we are finding is that in order to more efficiently utilize drills -- wells that have already been drilled, they are looking a higher pressure, more sand, which does require more water, you're exactly right. But those changes in the market and the efficiency are things that our focus to Keystone were closely with customers in terms of estimates of how much water we need. So you're right, there's changes. That's one of the reasons that wells have become so much more efficient, is they're doing the second and third frac and they're also putting a lot more sand and lot more pressure with the sand when they go to those second and third frac. So you're exactly right. I tell you there's a couple other things were involved in, and one of them is we're working with a couple of customers on some automated pumping that really is not pretty standard right now. So we consistently look at working with on how to make the production more efficient, how to get the most they can out of each individual well and to make sure that we are a solutions provider on everything around water and water services."

The cost of those investments we're working with Commonwealth Edison comment in Chicago area as well as there's a couple of other utilities that have expressed an interest. And we're very excited about that, because it truly is the win-win for our customers where we put in a water meter, but the one reason that does push us to do AMI is interestingly still a lot of water meters across our footprint are in people's homes. So the ability to put in AMI that we don't have to actually send people out to people's homes instead of times to go into their home is a real not just efficiency improvement, but also a customer satisfaction improvement. So we're taking all of these factors. We've got a plan in place to rollout AMI over the next 2 years where we can partner with electric utilities to offset some of that cost to our customers, we're all for it."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. With me today are Linda Sullivan, our CFO, who will go over the second quarter financial results; and Walter Lynch, our COO, who will give key updates on our operations.
Once again, American Water employees delivered strong results during the second quarter of 2016. We executed on fundamentals by investing in our water and wastewater systems to ensure safe and reliable service. We operated efficiently to reduce cost impacts on customers' bill. We continue to grow our business based on our reputation and core competencies, and we work to provide excellent service to all of our customers.
As you can see on Slide 6, we reported second quarter operating revenues of $827 million, a 5.8% increase above second quarter 2015. Earnings were $0.77 per share, a 13.2% increase above second quarter 2015. Our results reflect some timing benefits, partially offset by some one-time expenses.
For the first 6 months in 2016, EPS increased 8.8% and revenues were up 6.1%. Slide 7 highlights how we are executing on our strategy. Our foundation remains capital investment in our regulated operations.
During the first half of the year, we've invested $552 million in capital, including $24 million for regulated acquisitions. The majority of the remaining $528 million was in regulated operations, primarily to improve water and wastewater system improvement for the benefit of our customers. We plan to invest $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion for the full year, mostly for regulated infrastructure investments. That level of investment is balanced by our continued focus on controlling O&M costs as well as utilizing constructive regulatory mechanisms. Walter will cover this in greater detail, but we never lose sight of our customers and what they have to pay. This quarter was no exception, and our employees continued to improve efficiencies.
We had excellent growth during the first half of 2016. We've added approximately 7,600 new customers from closed acquisitions and 5,300 customers from organic growth. We have agreements in place pending regulatory approval, which would add 47,800 more customers. That includes both the previously announced Scranton Sewer Authority, which will add 31,000 wastewater customers, as well as our recently announced acquisition of Shorelands Water Company, adding more than 11,000 water customers in New Jersey.
I also want to mention acquisition activity that exemplifies my earlier comment about growing our business based on our reputation and core competencies. On Tuesday, the citizens of Blue Grass, Iowa voted an overwhelming 86% majority to join the Iowa American family. Subject to a final agreement in regulatory approval, these 720 customer connections in Blue Grass will join the 730 new customers in YES! Communities, Iowa, which closed earlier this year. These 2 additions result in a 2.3% growth from acquisition over the 63,000 customers we had in Iowa at the end of 2015. We're all very proud of the dedication, reputation and customer commitment of our folks in Iowa as well as in all of other states that we're privileged to serve.
In the Market-Based Businesses in the second quarter, we launched a municipal partnership through Homeowner Services in Georgetown, South Carolina. Our Contract Services Group signed a 10-year O&M agreement in July with the Township of South Orange Village, New Jersey, which has 4,700 customers. Our Military Services Group began service to our military and their families at Vandenberg Air Force Base on June 1. As we noted in the first quarter earnings call, we continue to see headwinds in AWE for the remainder of the year, primarily due to lower fixed capital upgrade on our existing military installations compared to previous years. Linda will discuss this a bit more in her comments.
Many of you know that drilling activity is picking up in the Marcellus and Utica formations where our Keystone Clearwater subsidiary provides water services. As noted on the slide, as of today, we continue to see Keystone as being EPS-neutral for the year. However, we will continue to evaluate the market and services demand and provide any update on our third quarter call. As noted on the slide, our market share continues to increase and is now around 35% of the water services market in the Appalachian Basin.
As Linda will discuss in more detail, we experienced an increase in our medical cost during the second quarter, some of which we expect to impact us through the second half of the year. I will address some of the more innovative ways we are looking to manage these costs in the future in my closing remarks.
As you can see on Slide 8, based on the results during the first half of the year, we remained on track, and we are affirming our 2016 guidance of $2.75 to $2.85 per share. We also continue our progress toward achieving our long-term goal of 7% to 10% EPS growth through 2020.
And with that, Walter will now give you his update on our operations."

Good morning, everyone.We're really proud of the results our employees have delivered this year.

We're really proud of the results our employees have delivered this year. We've had strong growth, we made smart investments, we meet or surpass all standards as shown in our annual water quality reports and we continue to realize efficiencies across the business. Through June 30, we've invested more than $535 million in our Regulated business. Of that total, we've invested $511 million to maintain and improve the service we provide and another $24 million for Regulated acquisitions. As Susan said, this investment is balanced by our focus on cost management, constructive regulatory mechanism and legislation that enables us to assist communities with challenged water and wastewater systems.
Our commitment to invest in our infrastructure while focusing on customer affordability is clear in the rate cases filed and closed this year. In Missouri, our rate case settlement was adopted, and we received an order for $4.5 million of additional annualized revenues. As part of the rate order, the PSC further consolidated water and sewer rates into geographic regions, going from 19 water rate regions to 3 and 13 wastewater regions to 2. This creates economies of scale by spreading costs over a larger group of customers, reduces company administrative costs and mitigates the volatility of our customer bills.
During the second quarter, Iowa and New York requested an additional $13.6 million in combined annualized revenue and lower operating expenses by $3.6 million collectively. In California, on July 1, we filed an application that set new rates in each of our service areas for 2018 through 2020. This application seeks a revenue increase statewide of $51 million over the 3-year period. Also, the State Water Resources Control Board approved the 5-year time extension for California American Water to comply with the 2009 order to significantly reduce withdrawals of water from the Carmel River. This action by the board recognizes our significant progress in building cooperative alliances among California American, local governments and communities and environmental organizations. With these alliances, we're pursuing projects and water recycling and reuse that augment our water needs both before and after completion of our planned desalination facility.
On Slide 11, you can see the success we've had in working with state governments and our commissions, either in legislation or policy that enables water solutions to water and wastewater challenges. For example, the Pennsylvania legislature eliminated a consolidated tax adjustment and setting utility rates. The new law now requires a calculation of the public utility's federal income tax expense on a stand-alone basis, separate from any gains or losses of unregulated affiliates. Prior to this law, Pennsylvania was one of a few states that had a consolidated tax adjustment.
In Illinois over the last several months, Illinois American Water has worked to find solutions to help our customers have a more reliable water system more quickly. The Illinois Commerce Commission adopted new rules in June, which removes the 5% cap between rate cases and instead, permits rates that can increase an average of 2.5% a year, with no year to increase more than 3.5%. This will be a big help and a stay with big infrastructure challenges.
Finally, in Kentucky, the governor signed House Bill 309 into law. This law establishes a framework for public-private partnerships in Kentucky. For the first time ever, the state and local governments can leverage private investments to complete necessary infrastructure projects to better serve the public. This law has been referenced as the most comprehensive P3 legislation to date in the nation.
As you can see on Slide 12, during the first half of the year, in addition to our organic growth, we welcomed about 7,600 new water and wastewater customer connections, which is about 20,000 people. We have pending acquisitions, which represent another 47,800 new customers. This includes the Shorelands acquisition, which is more than 11,000 water customers. This is another example of how we're able to provide solutions. Shorelands' service area is in a part of the state that is designated by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection as a critical area in terms of water supply. Once the purchase is approved and closed, we'll welcome our new employees and our new customers. We're also working to close our acquisition of the Scranton Sewer Authority by September 30. Here, we will welcome 31,000 new wastewater customers. We will benefit from our operational and engineering expertise and our commitment to make necessary capital investments.
You can also see in this slide how legislative efforts are helping us provide water and wastewater solutions for people across our footprint. Out of the 9 states where we have pending or closed acquisitions, 5 have fair market value legislation. The importance of this legislation is evident when you look at the numbers. Nearly 97% of the customers we have closed are pending or in one of these fair market value states.
Moving to Slide 13. We continue to improve our O&M efficiency ratio, achieving 35.2% for the last 12 months. We remain on track to meet our O&M efficiency target of 34% by 2020. It's a great effort by our employees across our business. And it's all about bringing value to our customers. As I did last quarter, let me provide you with a couple of examples of what we're doing to drive these results. The first example is in our customer service centers, where we've recently introduced new features to our customer self-service site. These changes improve the customer experience by using easy-to-understand language for reoccurring payments and enabling our customers to change the bank account they use to pay their bills without the need to contact us. For the month of July, more than 17,000 customers signed up for paperless billing, and that's more than 3x the amount of customers that signed up in the month of June. These changes are a true win-win to make it easier for our customers to do business with us, and they enable us to drive down costs.
In New Jersey, an energy deregulated state, we've taken advantage of reverse auctions to reduce our electricity cost. We first did this in 2011 and completed another auction this past fall. Through this process, New Jersey American Water will save a total of $9 million for the next 3 years in energy cost, benefiting our customers. When we reduce $1 in operation to maintenance expense, we can invest $6 in capital. The $9 million cost reduction will translate into an additional $54 million in capital improvements without impacting our customers' rates.
Finally, we thank our employees in West Virginia for the way they responded to the devastating floods there this past June. Once again, our team rose to the challenge, working safely and getting our service restored as quickly as possible. Additionally, they assisted state-wide emergency response efforts. For example, we loaned 2 water tankers to the West Virginia Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management to provide potable water for flood-devastated communities outside our service area. We also provided 3 large generators to run critical facilities in neighboring communities without power. It was a great effort by our employees there, and we're very, very proud of them.
And now we'll turn the call over to Linda for more detail on our second quarter financial results."

And year-to-date, we remain on track. Slide 16 shows the earnings per share contribution from each of our businesses. We repo",1048,"Thank you, Walter, and good morning, everyone.
In the second quarter of 2016, American Water delivered strong financial results. And year-to-date, we remain on track. Slide 16 shows the earnings per share contribution from each of our businesses. We reported earnings of $0.77 per share in the second quarter, up $0.09 or 13.2% over the same quarter last year.
Year-to-date, we reported earnings per share of $1.23, up $0.10 or 8.8% over the same period last year. For the quarter, the Regulated Businesses were up $0.08 and the Market-Based Businesses were up $0.01. Parent, which is primarily interest expense on parent debt, was flat compared to the same period last year.
Turning to Slide 17, let me walk through the components of our quarter-over-quarter increase in earnings per share. The primary driver for earnings growth was in our Regulated business, which was up $0.08. Regulated revenue was up $0.10 from authorized rate increases, infrastructure surcharges and new revenue from completed acquisitions and organic growth.
O&M expense was down $0.01 per share. This represents continued improved O&M efficiency that Walter discussed and some timing impacts, including a one-time $0.02 benefit from settlement of the Missouri rate case that will be offset during the remainder of the year. Largely offsetting these positive items were higher medical and prescription drug insurance costs of about $5 million pretax that are managed through VEBA Trust. These higher costs are the result of 3 items: first, we have been managing down the overfunded status of our VEBA Trust, and this year, the funded status went from being overfunded to being fully funded; second, we are seeing an increase in claims cost; and third, we trued up our liability based on our claims experience. As I mentioned, the second quarter impact was about $5 million pretax or $0.02 per share. For the remainder of the year, we estimate increasing claims will add another $3 million pretax, putting the full year increase at about $8 million pretax or $0.03 per share. American Water, like other employers, is challenged by rising health care costs, and later, Susan will discuss actions we are taking to manage these costs going forward.
Next, interest expense was up a $0.01, and depreciation expense was up about $0.02, both driven by growth associated with our Regulated system investments.
Moving to our Market-Based Businesses. Quarterly net income was up $0.01 per share, primarily from a favorable contract dispute settlement of about $3 million pretax, which we had expected to receive later this year. Absent this favorable settlement, the Market-Based Businesses were relatively flat. Increases in Homeowner Services as well as the acquisition of Keystone last July were largely offset by lower capital upgrades in our Military Services Group. As noted in our first quarter call, we expect lower capital upgrades in 2016 from reduced federal budgets and because these capital upgrades can be lumpy year-over-year. One of the biggest reasons capital upgrades were lower in the second quarter was the wind down of an $85 million, 3-year project at Fort Polk.
Let me now cover the regulatory highlights on Slide 18. We currently have 6 general rate cases and 1 infrastructure surcharge request in process for a combined annualized rate request of $113 million. For rates effective from July 1, 2015, through today, we received a total of $102 million in additional annualized revenues from general rate cases, infrastructure charges and step increases.
As you can see on this slide, our requested ROE in our outstanding general rate cases is generally 10.75% to 10.8%, with recent authorizations at 9.75% in several of our states. Overall, our weighted, company-wide authorized ROE was 9.9% at the end of this quarter.
Looking at the change in ROE over the past 3 years since 2013, the company's average authorized ROE has only moved about 10 basis points from a prior average of 10%. And during the same time period, our weighted authorized equity ratio increased about 20 basis points. So even with sustained low interest rates over this period, changes in ROE have tended to be slow and gradual.
Slide 19 highlights our continued strong financial performance. We made total capital investments of $316 million during the second quarter of 2016 and $552 million year-to-date, primarily for regulated system investments, mainly for the replacement and renewal of transmission and distribution infrastructure. We expect total capital expenditures to be in the $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion range in 2016.
Our capital expenditure range was updated to include our pending acquisitions. I would also like to point out that the Shorelands acquisition announced yesterday is a stock-for-stock transaction, and the maximum number of shares to be exchanged at closing will be less than 500,000, with the final number of shares based upon American Water stock price. We expect to close the transaction in the first quarter of 2017.
For the second quarter of 2016, cash flow from operations increased $51 million or about 23% to $271 million, mainly due to focused efforts on improving the aging of our accounts receivable as well as the timing of accounts payable and accrued liability.
Our adjusted return on equity for the past 12 months was 9.55%, an increase of 57 basis points compared to last year from continued execution on our strategies. We also announced in July a $0.375 common stock cash dividend payable on September 1, 2016, to stockholders of record as of August 8, 2016.
Turning to Slide 20. We are affirming our 2016 earnings guidance. I would like to point out a few items. First, weather impacts in July are expected to be minimal as the hot temperatures across many of our states were also accompanied by rainfall. Second, our year-to-date earnings were strong across the business. However, as I've noted, they also include some timing-related items, including the favorable contract dispute settlement at AWE, which we had expected later in the year, and the $0.02 benefit from settlement of the Missouri rate case that will be offset during the remainder of the year. Third, looking forward, despite the expected increase in group insurance costs and the headwinds we've previously discussed at our Military Services Group in Keystone, we affirm our earnings guidance range of $2.75 to $2.85 per share.
With that, I'll turn it back over to Susan."

Before we move on to Q&A, I would like to take a couple of minutes to talk about health care costs. Like other companies, our health care costs are going up. This is especially true in utilities where we have an even more pronounced aging workforce. We're currently partnering with our health care and pharmacy providers for better pricing, while strongly promoting a healthy and safe culture for our employees. We continue to promote wellness and health management programs, preventive care screening and education for employees on being thoughtful consumers of health care.
But we're going a step further. Earlier this year, American Water was a founding member with 20 national companies, which you see on the chart, to form the Health Transformational Alliance, or HTA. Since the initiative was kicked off in February, an additional 13 companies have joined the Alliance, with the now 33 companies representing more than 5.5 million people across the country. We're proud to be part of this cutting edge effort. The overall goal of the HTA is to create higher quality care by first partnering with facilities and physicians that have better outcomes, while also aggregating the purchasing power of all the member companies to keep costs down.
Additionally, HTA companies will pool our data without identifying individual information for better treatment options, better health outcomes and more reasonable and efficient pricing. The HTA is following a similar process for pharmaceutical purchasing and contracting systems. The HTA's efforts have been highlighted recently in several media publications, including The Wall Street Journal, Barron's and The Boston Globe. This is just the start of an exciting collaborative effort. We will keep you updated as we work with leading companies throughout the United States to improve the quality of healthcare and slow the rising costs for our company, employees and their families.
So in summary, our year-to-date financial performance reflects the successful execution of our strategies, investing in our system, upgrading efficiently, growing our business and remaining steadfast in our commitment to the highest standards of customer service and water quality.
And with that, we're happy to take your questions."

So even if in many states, municipalities aren't regulated by the PSCs, the recognition of water and wastewater challenges is shared by everyone. So we do find that in many of our states, the commission are concerned about water quality, water issues along with their governmental entities.

When you look at the fair market legislation, at least in our service area, it started with Illinois legislation. They were among the first to do that. The general question now is, I think that as you continue to see water and wastewater systems under distress across the country, this is a very viable solution that enables municipalities to benefit from water utilities like us and others to benefit and to solve -- the main thing is to solve a problem for the citizens out there who are depending on the best water quality, but also you have communities around the country who are doing an amazing job first of all, but they have all of these different priorities. They have to provide for schools and for roads and for parks, and the responsibilities that these municipalities have is so long, and as we know, a lot of the federal funds aren't there any more that were there during the '70s and '80s and even '90s. And so they are trying the very best they can to serve the citizens of their communities. So where it makes sense, and this is an option for them when they choose to put their systems up for sale, having this type of legislation takes an obstacle away from that. In the past, we've had situations where a municipality or governmental entity wanted to sell its system, we wanted to buy it. But because of the way things worked between the book value and what we're able to put in a rate base that wasn't considered premium, it stopped a lot of deals before they ever took place. So I think this is an effort by states to have a win-win situation. But at the end of the day, the people in those communities need to be better off and the municipalities are able then to provide the critical services that they're responsible for."

But I will tell you from our standpoint, the fact -- here's what we know. There is a recognition by the EPA throughout the country about the infrastructure needs that we have in the United States. Our plans are very open in our states, in our DSIC. In any of our infrastructure surcharge, we present plans. We also go in [indiscernible] quarterly, sometimes semiannually filing. Where there is a close monitoring of the projects we're working on, what we're spending in addition to our own inefficiency, at least for American Water, we also have several efforts in terms of capital efficiency. What are we doing not only to spend every owned M-dollar, but what are we doing to show that we're actually even improving how we spend every capital dollar. Because for us, it's this situation: We are faced with years of investment. We want to be as efficient with every dollar as we can possibly be because that means we can put more in the ground, not impact the customer bill and to be able to get the infrastructure replacement quickly, which still is a decades-long issue. So that's one thing we know. I will also tell you with the recent -- I'll say, attention to water quality issues in a time when you have infrastructure, but you also have emerging water quality issues, and we've seen what happens in different parts of the country when you don't invest in infrastructure. I'm not sure that, that is a risk that we are willing to take."

So I'm assuming you're optimistic because Q2 was probably strong and Q3 probably followed that strength. But what keeps you cautious? Is that seasonality potential for an oil pull back keeping you cautious? Or are you now seeing customer indications where they're keeping you cautious on Q3?

So first of all, understand that our Keystone executives and management spend a lot of time with our customers. We do have a lot of -- we share with them and they share with us some of their plans, their drilling plans. So the cautiousness is not really related to timing of holidays or vacations. It's more of you're talking about an E&P industry that's extremely cautious because of what they've gone through the past 18 months. So you don't have people that have gone from being so far down to saying, we're going to pull out all the stops and ramp everything up immediately. They have a cautiousness, so we have a cautiousness. And it is a testing of the waters. The foundations are becoming stronger. We're seeing natural gas prices, I think NYMEX closed yesterday at $2.84, for example. Just in April, it was a $1.90 per million Btus. We're starting to see better pricing as the supply is being drawn down because of the heat across the country in -- this summer. We're starting to see some activities where people had not been doing drilling and now they are. We're starting to see some more drilling rigs come up. So our cautiousness is the timing. It is the spacing. It is how quickly will we see this come up, how quickly will we see the supply that basically is being drawn down and being replenished, what are the forecast for the winter month, how cold will the winter be. So we try to base looking at objective third-party data like price projections, like drilling projections. We look at all of that. Then we also look at our internal discussions we have with our customers and what their drilling plans are. So the cautiousness is -- what you don't want is for people to flip back and forth to say, it's not good, it's great, it's not -- we just want to be very cautious as we look at the ramp up and the continuing strength of the natural gas drilling market and make sure that we're very careful in how we look at that emergent."

So we're very excited about that because what that will do is if they start construction as they have said in 2018 and finish in 2020, you're talking about even more valuable natural gas drilling where you can get the NGLs along with the natural gas. So we just see that area and the intersection between Utica and Marcellus being very rich in terms of the fact as we know that it is the cheapest to drill for the drillers, and it also requires a good bit of water because of the depth of the formations. So we think that's the right place to be, and we've been asking also at this point, we're not interested in going into other formations because we think that the Utica and Marcellus is where we have the most key areas for production growth in the future."

And so then there's the 4 other guys there. And then, the Utica, there's only 1 Ontario resource rig there. And now there's 14 -- or the 13 remaining, they're all other players. And so of those other players, was it -- I understand that oil prices are supposed to decline because of seasonality, but they're also expected to decline following that. And in addition to that, if you look at any upstream player, they're all [indiscernible] about how they're expecting to use -- I think they were using something like 1,500 pounds of sand per lateral or somewhere around there, and it's expected to go up to 2,000. And so I'm wondering if there's a potential to extend and capture more business in the Utica because it's so -- it's kind of open there. And then 2, that increased sand means increased needs for water there. So how -- are you guys factoring that into your figures? And if so, are you expecting -- how much of a positive impact because a year ago, that was 1,000 pounds, and now we're talking doubling that.

And ours is -- we're all natural gas by the way. So we do very little to no support for oil. Actually, for us, it's mostly natural gas. So that's one. Second thing, you're exactly right. What we are finding is that in order to more efficiently utilize drills -- wells that have already been drilled, they are looking at higher pressure, more sand, which does require more water. You're exactly right. But those changes in the market and the efficiency are things that our folks at Keystone work closely with customers in terms of estimates of how much water we need. So you're right, there's changes. That's one of the reasons that the wells have become so much more efficient is they're doing the second and third frac, and they're also putting a lot more sand and lot more pressure with the sand when they go to those second and third fracs. So you're exactly right. I tell you there's a couple other things we're involved in, and one of them is we're working with a couple of customers on some automated pumping that really is not pretty standard right now. So we consistently look at working with E&Ps on how to make the production more efficient, how to get the most they can out of each individual well and to make sure that we are a solutions provider on everything around water and water services."

Well, we actually have an AMI team that we're working throughout the company to come up with a rollout to -- unlike electric, the water bills are so much less expensive. Of course, we're looking at the ability to be able to justify them economically. One of the good things is we're seeing a lot of better technology with the meters that will allow us to actually put in AMR meters that we can then do software upgrades to actually make them AMI meters, which is good. We continue to work with some electric utilities on utilizing some of the same backhaul infrastructures so that our customers don't have to double the cost of those investments. We're working with Commonwealth Edison, ComEd, in the Chicago area as well as there's a couple of other utilities that have expressed an interest. And we're very excited about that because it truly is a win-win for our customers where we put in a water meter. But the one reason that does push us to do AMI is interestingly, still a lot of water meters across our footprint are in people's homes. So the ability to put in AMI that we don't have to actually send people out to people's homes and set up times to go into their home is a real not just efficiency improvement, but also a customer satisfaction improvement. So we're taking all of those factors. We've got a plan in place to rollout AMI over the next few years and where we can partner with electric utilities to offset some of that cost for our customers, we're all for it."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. With me today are Linda Sullivan, our CFO, who will go over the second quarter financial results; and Walter Lynch, our COO, who will give key updates on our operations.
Once again, American Water employees delivered strong results during the second quarter of 2016. We executed on fundamentals by investing in our water and wastewater systems to ensure safe and reliable service. We operated efficiently to reduce cost impacts on customers' bill. We continue to grow our business based on our reputation and core competencies, and we work to provide excellent service to all of our customers.
As you can see on Slide 6, we reported second quarter operating revenues of $827 million, a 5.8% increase above second quarter 2015. Earnings were $0.77 per share, a 13.2% increase above second quarter 2015. Our results reflect some timing benefits, partially offset by some one-time expenses.
For the first 6 months in 2016, EPS increased 8.8% and revenues were up 6.1%. Slide 7 highlights how we are executing on our strategy. Our foundation remains capital investment in our regulated operations.
During the first half of the year, we've invested $552 million in capital, including $24 million for regulated acquisitions. The majority of the remaining $528 million was in regulated operations, primarily to improve water and wastewater system improvement for the benefit of our customers. We plan to invest $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion for the full year, mostly for regulated infrastructure investments. That level of investment is balanced by our continued focus on controlling O&M costs as well as utilizing constructive regulatory mechanisms. Walter will cover this in greater detail, but we never lose sight of our customers and what they have to pay. This quarter was no exception, and our employees continued to improve efficiencies.
We had excellent growth during the first half of 2016. We've added approximately 7,600 new customers from closed acquisitions and 5,300 customers from organic growth. We have agreements in place pending regulatory approval, which would add 47,800 more customers. That includes both the previously announced Scranton Sewer Authority, which will add 31,000 wastewater customers, as well as our recently announced acquisition of Shorelands Water Company, adding more than 11,000 water customers in New Jersey.
I also want to mention acquisition activity that exemplifies my earlier comment about growing our business based on our reputation in core competencies. On Tuesday, the citizens of Blue Grass, Iowa voted an overwhelming 86% majority to join the Iowa American family. Subject to a final agreement and regulatory approval, these 720 customer connections in Blue Grass will join the 730 new customers in YES! Communities, Iowa, which closed earlier this year. These 2 additions result in a 2.3% growth from acquisition over the 63,000 customers we had in Iowa at the end of 2015. We're all very proud of the dedication, reputation and customer commitment of our folks in Iowa as well as in all of other states that we're privileged to serve.
In the Market-Based Businesses in the second quarter, we launched a municipal partnership through Homeowner Services in Georgetown, South Carolina. Our Contract Services Group signed a 10-year O&M agreement in July with the Township of South Orange Village, New Jersey, which has 4,700 customers. Our Military Services Group began service to our military and their families at Vandenberg Air Force Base on June 1. As we noted in the first quarter earnings call, we continue to see headwinds in AWE for the remainder of the year, primarily due to lower fixed capital upgrade on our existing military installations compared to previous years. Linda will discuss this a bit more in her comments.
Many of you know that drilling activity is picking up in the Marcellus and Utica formations where our Keystone Clearwater subsidiary provides water services. As noted on the slide, as of today, we continue to see Keystone as being EPS-neutral for the year. However, we will continue to evaluate the market and services demand and provide any update on our third quarter call. As noted on the slide, our market share continues to increase and is now around 35% of the water services market in the Appalachian Basin.
As Linda will discuss in more detail, we experienced an increase in our medical cost during the second quarter, some of which we expect to impact us through the second half of the year. I will address some of the more innovative ways we are looking to manage these costs in the future in my closing remarks.
As you can see on Slide 8, based on the results during the first half of the year, we remained on track, and we are affirming our 2016 guidance of $2.75 to $2.85 per share. We also continue our progress toward achieving our long-term goal of 7% to 10% EPS growth through 2020.
And with that, Walter will now give you his update on our operations."
250885,376566716,1025718,"American Water Works Company, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2016",2016-08-04,"Earnings Calls","American Water Works Company, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Susan.

We're really proud of the results our employees have delivered this year. We've had strong growth, we made smart investments, we meet or surpass all standards as shown in our annual water quality reports and we continue to realize efficiencies across the business. Through June 30, we've invested more than $535 million in our Regulated business. Of that total, we've invested $511 million to maintain and improve the service we provide and another $24 million for Regulated acquisitions. As Susan said, this investment is balanced by our focus on cost management, constructive regulatory mechanism and legislation that enables us to assist communities with challenged water and wastewater systems.
Our commitment to invest in our infrastructure while focusing on customer affordability is clear in the rate cases filed and closed this year. In Missouri, our rate case settlement was adopted, and we received an order for $4.5 million of additional annualized revenues. As part of the rate order, the PSC further consolidated water and sewer rates into geographic regions, going from 19 water rate regions to 3 and 13 wastewater regions to 2. This creates economies of scale by spreading costs over a larger group of customers, reduces company administrative costs and mitigates the volatility of our customer bills.
During the second quarter, Iowa and New York requested an additional $13.6 million in combined annualized revenue and lower operating expenses by $3.6 million collectively. In California, on July 1, we filed an application that set new rates in each of our service areas for 2018 through 2020. This application seeks a revenue increase statewide of $51 million over the 3-year period. Also, the State Water Resources Control Board approved the 5-year time extension for California American Water to comply with the 2009 order to significantly reduce withdrawals of water from the Carmel River. This action by the board recognizes our significant progress in building cooperative alliances among California American, local governments and communities and environmental organizations. With these alliances, we're pursuing projects and water recycling and reuse that augment our water needs both before and after completion of our planned desalination facility.
On Slide 11, you can see the success we've had in working with state governments and our commissions, either in legislation or policy that enables water solutions to water and wastewater challenges. For example, the Pennsylvania legislature eliminated a consolidated tax adjustment in setting utility rates. The new law now requires a calculation of the public utility's federal income tax expense on a stand-alone basis, separate from any gains or losses of unregulated affiliates. Prior to this law, Pennsylvania was one of a few states that had a consolidated tax adjustment.
In Illinois over the last several months, Illinois American Water has worked to find solutions to help our customers have a more reliable water system more quickly. The Illinois Commerce Commission adopted new rules in June, which removes the 5% cap between rate cases and instead, permits rates that can increase an average of 2.5% a year, with no year to increase more than 3.5%. This will be a big help in a state with big infrastructure challenges.
Finally, in Kentucky, the governor signed House Bill 309 into law. This law establishes a framework for public-private partnerships in Kentucky. For the first time ever, the state and local governments can leverage private investments to complete necessary infrastructure projects to better serve the public. This law has been referenced as the most comprehensive P3 legislation to date in the nation.
As you can see on Slide 12, during the first half of the year, in addition to our organic growth, we welcomed about 7,600 new water and wastewater customer connections, which is about 20,000 people. We have pending acquisitions, which represent another 47,800 new customers. This includes the Shorelands acquisition, which is more than 11,000 water customers. This is another example of how we're able to provide solutions. Shorelands' service area is in a part of the state that is designated by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection as a critical area in terms of water supply. Once the purchase is approved and closed, we'll welcome our new employees and our new customers. We're also working to close our acquisition of the Scranton Sewer Authority by September 30. Here, we will welcome 31,000 new wastewater customers. We will benefit from our operational and engineering expertise and our commitment to make necessary capital investments.
You can also see in this slide how legislative efforts are helping us provide water and wastewater solutions for people across our footprint. Out of the 9 states where we have pending or closed acquisitions, 5 have fair market value legislation. The importance of this legislation is evident when you look at the numbers. Nearly 97% of the customers we have closed or pending are in one of these fair market value states.
Moving to Slide 13. We continue to improve our O&M efficiency ratio, achieving 35.2% for the last 12 months. We remain on track to meet our O&M efficiency target of 34% by 2020. It's a great effort by our employees across our business. And it's all about bringing value to our customers. As I did last quarter, let me provide you with a couple of examples of what we're doing to drive these results. The first example is in our customer service centers, where we've recently introduced new features to our customer self-service site. These changes improve the customer experience by using easy-to-understand language for reoccurring payments and enabling our customers to change the bank account they use to pay their bills without the need to contact us. For the month of July, more than 17,000 customers signed up for paperless billing, and that's more than 3x the amount of customers that signed up in the month of June. These changes are a true win-win to make it easier for our customers to do business with us, and they enable us to drive down costs.
In New Jersey, an energy deregulated state, we've taken advantage of reverse auctions to reduce our electricity cost. We first did this in 2011 and completed another auction this past fall. Through this process, New Jersey American Water will save a total of $9 million for the next 3 years in energy cost, benefiting our customers. When we reduce $1 in operation to maintenance expense, we can invest $6 in capital. The $9 million cost reduction will translate into an additional $54 million in capital improvements without impacting our customers' rates.
Finally, we thank our employees in West Virginia for the way they responded to the devastating floods there this past June. Once again, our team rose to the challenge, working safely and getting our service restored as quickly as possible. Additionally, they assisted state-wide emergency response efforts. For example, we loaned 2 water tankers to the West Virginia Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management to provide potable water for flood-devastated communities outside our service area. We also provided 3 large generators to run critical facilities in neighboring communities without power. It was a great effort by our employees there, and we're very, very proud of them.
And now we'll turn the call over to Linda for more detail on our second quarter financial results."

In the second quarter of 2016, American Water delivered strong financial results. And year-to-date, we remain on track. Slide 16 shows the earnings per share contribution from each of our businesses. We reported earnings of $0.77 per share in the second quarter, up $0.09 or 13.2% over the same quarter last year.
Year-to-date, we reported earnings per share of $1.23, up $0.10 or 8.8% over the same period last year. For the quarter, the Regulated Businesses were up $0.08 and the Market-Based Businesses were up $0.01. Parent, which is primarily interest expense on parent debt, was flat compared to the same period last year.
Turning to Slide 17, let me walk through the components of our quarter-over-quarter increase in earnings per share. The primary driver for earnings growth was in our Regulated business, which was up $0.08. Regulated revenue was up $0.10 from authorized rate increases, infrastructure surcharges and new revenue from completed acquisitions and organic growth.
O&M expense was down $0.01 per share. This represents continued improved O&M efficiency that Walter discussed and some timing impacts, including a one-time $0.02 benefit from settlement of the Missouri rate case that will be offset during the remainder of the year. Largely offsetting these positive items were higher medical and prescription drug insurance costs of about $5 million pretax that are managed through our VEBA Trust. These higher costs are the result of 3 items: first, we have been managing down the overfunded status of our VEBA Trust, and this year, the funded status went from being overfunded to being fully funded; second, we are seeing an increase in claims cost; and third, we trued up our liability based on our claims experience. As I mentioned, the second quarter impact was about $5 million pretax or $0.02 per share. For the remainder of the year, we estimate increasing claims will add another $3 million pretax, putting the full year increase at about $8 million pretax or $0.03 per share. American Water, like other employers, is challenged by rising health care costs, and later, Susan will discuss actions we are taking to manage these costs going forward.
Next, interest expense was up a $0.01, and depreciation expense was up about $0.02, both driven by growth associated with our Regulated system investments.
Moving to our Market-Based Businesses. Quarterly net income was up $0.01 per share, primarily from a favorable contract dispute settlement of about $3 million pretax, which we had expected to receive later this year. Absent this favorable settlement, the Market-Based Businesses were relatively flat. Increases in Homeowner Services as well as the acquisition of Keystone last July were largely offset by lower capital upgrades in our Military Services Group. As noted in our first quarter call, we expect lower capital upgrades in 2016 from reduced federal budgets and because these capital upgrades can be lumpy year-over-year. One of the biggest reasons capital upgrades were lower in the second quarter was the wind down of an $85 million, 3-year project at Fort Polk.
Let me now cover the regulatory highlights on Slide 18. We currently have 6 general rate cases and 1 infrastructure surcharge request in process for a combined annualized rate request of $113 million. For rates effective from July 1, 2015, through today, we received a total of $102 million in additional annualized revenues from general rate cases, infrastructure charges and step increases.
As you can see on this slide, our requested ROE in our outstanding general rate cases is generally 10.75% to 10.8%, with recent authorizations at 9.75% in several of our states. Overall, our weighted, company-wide authorized ROE was 9.9% at the end of this quarter.
Looking at the change in ROE over the past 3 years since 2013, the company's average authorized ROE has only moved about 10 basis points from a prior average of 10%. And during the same time period, our weighted authorized equity ratio increased about 20 basis points. So even with sustained low interest rates over this period, changes in ROE have tended to be slow and gradual.
Slide 19 highlights our continued strong financial performance. We made total capital investments of $316 million during the second quarter of 2016 and $552 million year-to-date, primarily for regulated system investments, mainly for the replacement and renewal of transmission and distribution infrastructure. We expect total capital expenditures to be in the $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion range in 2016.
Our capital expenditure range was updated to include our pending acquisitions. I would also like to point out that the Shorelands acquisition announced yesterday is a stock-for-stock transaction, and the maximum number of shares to be exchanged at closing will be less than 500,000, with the final number of shares based upon American Water stock price. We expect to close the transaction in the first quarter of 2017.
For the second quarter of 2016, cash flow from operations increased $51 million or about 23% to $271 million, mainly due to focused efforts on improving the aging of our accounts receivable as well as the timing of accounts payable and accrued liability.
Our adjusted return on equity for the past 12 months was 9.55%, an increase of 57 basis points compared to last year from continued execution on our strategies. We also announced in July a $0.375 common stock cash dividend payable on September 1, 2016, to stockholders of record as of August 8, 2016.
Turning to Slide 20. We are affirming our 2016 earnings guidance. I would like to point out a few items. First, weather impacts in July are expected to be minimal as the hot temperatures across many of our states were also accompanied by rainfall. Second, our year-to-date earnings were strong across the business. However, as I've noted, they also include some timing-related items, including the favorable contract dispute settlement at AWE, which we had expected later in the year, and the $0.02 benefit from settlement of the Missouri rate case that will be offset during the remainder of the year. Third, looking forward, despite the expected increase in group insurance costs and the headwinds we've previously discussed at our Military Services Group in Keystone, we affirm our earnings guidance range of $2.75 to $2.85 per share.
With that, I'll turn it back over to Susan."

Before we move on to Q&A, I would like to take a couple of minutes to talk about health care costs. Like other companies, our health care costs are going up. This is especially true in utilities where we have an even more pronounced aging workforce. We're currently partnering with our health care and pharmacy providers for better pricing, while strongly promoting a healthy and safe culture for our employees. We continue to promote wellness and health management programs, preventive care screening and education for employees on being thoughtful consumers of health care.
But we're going a step further. Earlier this year, American Water was a founding member with 20 national companies, which you see on the chart, to form the Health Transformational Alliance, or HTA. Since the initiative was kicked off in February, an additional 13 companies have joined the Alliance, with the now 33 companies representing more than 5.5 million people across the country. We're proud to be part of this cutting edge effort. The overall goal of the HTA is to create higher quality care by first partnering with facilities and physicians that have better outcomes, while also aggregating the purchasing power of all the member companies to keep costs down.
Additionally, HTA companies will pool our data without identifying individual information for better treatment options, better health outcomes and more reasonable and efficient pricing. The HTA is following a similar process for pharmaceutical purchasing and contracting systems. The HTA's efforts have been highlighted recently in several media publications, including The Wall Street Journal, Barron's and The Boston Globe. This is just the start of an exciting collaborative effort. We will keep you updated as we work with leading companies throughout the United States to improve the quality of healthcare and slow the rising costs for our company, employees and their families.
So in summary, our year-to-date financial performance reflects the successful execution of our strategies, investing in our system, upgrading efficiently, growing our business and remaining steadfast in our commitment to the highest standards of customer service and water quality.
And with that, we're happy to take your questions."

When you look at the fair market legislation, at least in our service area, it started with Illinois legislation. They were among the first to do that. The general question now is, I think that as you continue to see water and wastewater systems under distress across the country, this is a very viable solution that enables municipalities to benefit from water utilities like us and others to benefit and to solve -- the main thing is to solve a problem for the citizens out there who are depending on the best water quality, but also you have communities around the country who are doing an amazing job first of all, but they have all of these different priorities. They have to provide for schools and for roads and for parks, and the responsibilities that these municipalities have is so long, and as we know, a lot of the federal funds aren't there any more that were there during the '70s and '80s and even '90s. And so they are trying the very best they can to serve the citizens of their communities. So where it makes sense, and this is an option for them when they choose to put their systems up for sale, having this type of legislation takes an obstacle away from that. In the past, we've had situations where a municipality or governmental entity wanted to sell its system, we wanted to buy it. But because of the way things worked between the book value and what we're able to put in a rate base that wasn't considered premium, it stopped a lot of deals before they ever took place. So I think this is an effort by states to have a win-win situation. But at the end of the day, the people in those communities need to be better off and the municipalities are able then to provide the critical services that they're responsible for."

Where you have drought situations, where you have the need and we need to promote water recycling reuse, you're going to start everyone looking at the whole cycle.

Our plans are very open in our states, in our DSIC. In any of our infrastructure surcharge, we present plans. We also go in when we have quarterly, sometimes semiannually filing. Where there is a close monitoring of the projects we're working on, what we're spending in addition to our O&M efficiency, at least for American Water, we also have several efforts in terms of capital efficiency. What are we doing not only to spend every O&M dollar, but what are we doing to show that we're actually even improving how we spend every capital dollar. Because for us, it's this situation: We are faced with years of investment. We want to be as efficient with every dollar as we can possibly be because that means we can put more in the ground, not impact the customer bill and to be able to get the infrastructure replaced more quickly, which still is a decades-long issue. So that's one thing we know. I will also tell you with the recent -- I'll say, attention to water quality issues in a time when you have infrastructure, but you also have emerging water quality issues, and we've seen what happens in different parts of the country when you don't invest in infrastructure.

So first of all, understand that our Keystone executives and management spend a lot of time with our customers. We do have a lot of -- we share with them and they share with us some of their plans, their drilling plans. So the cautiousness is not really related to timing of holidays or vacations. It's more of you're talking about an E&P industry that's extremely cautious because of what they've gone through the past 18 months. So you don't have people that have gone from being so far down to saying, we're going to pull out all the stops and ramp everything up immediately. They have a cautiousness, so we have a cautiousness. And it is a testing of the waters. The foundations are becoming stronger. We're seeing natural gas prices, I think NYMEX closed yesterday at $2.84, for example. Just in April, it was a $1.90 per million Btus. We're starting to see better pricing as the supply is being drawn down because of the heat across the country in -- this summer. We're starting to see some activities where people had not been doing drilling and now they are. We're starting to see some more drilling rigs come up. So our cautiousness is the timing. It is the spacing. It is how quickly will we see this come up, how quickly will we see the supply that basically is being drawn down and being replenished, what are the forecast for the winter month, how cold will the winter be. So we try to base looking at objective third-party data like price projections, like drilling projections. We look at all of that. Then we also look at our internal discussions we have with our customers and what their drilling plans are. So the cautiousness is -- what you don't want is for people to flip back and forth to say, it's not good, it's great, it's not -- we just want to be very cautious as we look at the ramp up and the continuing strength of the natural gas drilling market and make sure that we're very careful in how we look at that emergence."

So we're very excited about that because what that will do is if they start construction as they have said in 2018 and finish in 2020, you're talking about even more valuable natural gas drilling where you can get the NGLs along with the natural gas. So we just see that area and the intersection between Utica and Marcellus being very rich in terms of the fact as we know that it is the cheapest to drill for the drillers, and it also requires a good bit of water because of the depth of the formations.

And so of those other players, was it -- I understand that oil prices are supposed to decline because of seasonality, but they're also expected to decline following that. And in addition to that, if you look at any upstream player, they're all touting about how they're expecting to use -- I think they were using something like 1,500 pounds of sand per lateral or somewhere around there, and it's expected to go up to 2,000. And so I'm wondering if there's a potential to extend and capture more business in the Utica because it's so -- it's kind of open there. And then 2, that increased sand means increased needs for water there. So how -- are you guys factoring that into your figures?

And ours is -- we're all natural gas by the way. So we do very little to no support for oil. Actually, for us, it's mostly natural gas. So that's one. Second thing, you're exactly right. What we are finding is that in order to more efficiently utilize drills -- wells that have already been drilled, they are looking at higher pressure, more sand, which does require more water. You're exactly right. But those changes in the market and the efficiency are things that our folks at Keystone work closely with customers in terms of estimates of how much water we need. So you're right, there's changes. That's one of the reasons that the wells have become so much more efficient is they're doing the second and third frac, and they're also putting a lot more sand and lot more pressure with the sand when they go to those second and third fracs. So you're exactly right. I tell you there's a couple other things we're involved in, and one of them is we're working with a couple of customers on some automated pumping that really is not pretty standard right now. So we consistently look at working with E&Ps on how to make the production more efficient, how to get the most they can out of each individual well and to make sure that we are a solutions provider on everything around water and water services."

We're working with Commonwealth Edison, ComEd, in the Chicago area as well as there's a couple of other utilities that have expressed an interest. And we're very excited about that because it truly is a win-win for our customers where we put in a water meter. But the one reason that does push us to do AMI is interestingly, still a lot of water meters across our footprint are in people's homes. So the ability to put in AMI that we don't have to actually send people out to people's homes and set up times to go into their home is a real not just efficiency improvement, but also a customer satisfaction improvement.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. With me today are Linda Sullivan, our CFO, who will go over the second quarter financial results; and Walter Lynch, our COO, who will give key updates on our operations.
Once again, American Water employees delivered strong results during the second quarter of 2016. We executed on fundamentals by investing in our water and wastewater systems to ensure safe and reliable service. We operated efficiently to reduce cost impacts on customers' bill. We continue to grow our business based on our reputation and core competencies, and we work to provide excellent service to all of our customers.
As you can see on Slide 6, we reported second quarter operating revenues of $827 million, a 5.8% increase above second quarter 2015. Earnings were $0.77 per share, a 13.2% increase above second quarter 2015. Our results reflect some timing benefits, partially offset by some one-time expenses.
For the first 6 months in 2016, EPS increased 8.8% and revenues were up 6.1%. Slide 7 highlights how we are executing on our strategy. Our foundation remains capital investment in our regulated operations.
During the first half of the year, we've invested $552 million in capital, including $24 million for regulated acquisitions. The majority of the remaining $528 million was in regulated operations, primarily to improve water and wastewater system improvement for the benefit of our customers. We plan to invest $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion for the full year, mostly for regulated infrastructure investments. That level of investment is balanced by our continued focus on controlling O&M costs as well as utilizing constructive regulatory mechanisms. Walter will cover this in greater detail, but we never lose sight of our customers and what they have to pay. This quarter was no exception, and our employees continued to improve efficiencies.
We had excellent growth during the first half of 2016. We've added approximately 7,600 new customers from closed acquisitions and 5,300 customers from organic growth. We have agreements in place pending regulatory approval, which would add 47,800 more customers. That includes both the previously announced Scranton Sewer Authority, which will add 31,000 wastewater customers, as well as our recently announced acquisition of Shorelands Water Company, adding more than 11,000 water customers in New Jersey.
I also want to mention acquisition activity that exemplifies my earlier comment about growing our business based on our reputation in core competencies. On Tuesday, the citizens of Blue Grass, Iowa voted an overwhelming 86% majority to join the Iowa American family. Subject to a final agreement and regulatory approval, these 720 customer connections in Blue Grass will join the 730 new customers in YES! Communities, Iowa, which closed earlier this year. These 2 additions result in a 2.3% growth from acquisition over the 63,000 customers we had in Iowa at the end of 2015. We're all very proud of the dedication, reputation and customer commitment of our folks in Iowa as well as in all of other states that we're privileged to serve.
In the Market-Based Businesses in the second quarter, we launched a municipal partnership through Homeowner Services in Georgetown, South Carolina. Our Contract Services Group signed a 10-year O&M agreement in July with the Township of South Orange Village, New Jersey, which has 4,700 customers. Our Military Services Group began service to our military and their families at Vandenberg Air Force Base on June 1. As we noted in the first quarter earnings call, we continue to see headwinds in AWE for the remainder of the year, primarily due to lower fixed capital upgrade on our existing military installations compared to previous years. Linda will discuss this a bit more in her comments.
Many of you know that drilling activity is picking up in the Marcellus and Utica formations where our Keystone Clearwater subsidiary provides water services. As noted on the slide, as of today, we continue to see Keystone as being EPS-neutral for the year. However, we will continue to evaluate the market and services demand and provide any update on our third quarter call. As noted on the slide, our market share continues to increase and is now around 35% of the water services market in the Appalachian Basin.
As Linda will discuss in more detail, we experienced an increase in our medical cost during the second quarter, some of which we expect to impact us through the second half of the year. I will address some of the more innovative ways we are looking to manage these costs in the future in my closing remarks.
As you can see on Slide 8, based on the results during the first half of the year, we remained on track, and we are affirming our 2016 guidance of $2.75 to $2.85 per share. We also continue our progress toward achieving our long-term goal of 7% to 10% EPS growth through 2020.
And with that, Walter will now give you his update on our operations."
250885,376566716,1026378,"American Water Works Company, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2016",2016-08-04,"Earnings Calls","American Water Works Company, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Susan. Good morning, everyone.We're really proud of the results our employees have delivered this year. We've had strong growth, we made smart investments, we meet or surpass all standards as shown in our annual water quality reports and we cont",1214,"Thanks, Susan. Good morning, everyone.
We're really proud of the results our employees have delivered this year. We've had strong growth, we made smart investments, we meet or surpass all standards as shown in our annual water quality reports and we continue to realize efficiencies across the business. Through June 30, we've invested more than $535 million in our Regulated business. Of that total, we've invested $511 million to maintain and improve the service we provide and another $24 million for Regulated acquisitions. As Susan said, this investment is balanced by our focus on cost management, constructive regulatory mechanism and legislation that enables us to assist communities with challenged water and wastewater systems.
Our commitment to invest in our infrastructure while focusing on customer affordability is clear in the rate cases filed and closed this year. In Missouri, our rate case settlement was adopted, and we received an order for $4.5 million of additional annualized revenues. As part of the rate order, the PSC further consolidated water and sewer rates into geographic regions, going from 19 water rate regions to 3 and 13 wastewater regions to 2. This creates economies of scale by spreading costs over a larger group of customers, reduces company administrative costs and mitigates the volatility of our customer bills.
During the second quarter, Iowa and New York requested an additional $13.6 million in combined annualized revenue and lower operating expenses by $3.6 million collectively. In California, on July 1, we filed an application that set new rates in each of our service areas for 2018 through 2020. This application seeks a revenue increase statewide of $51 million over the 3-year period. Also, the State Water Resources Control Board approved the 5-year time extension for California American Water to comply with the 2009 order to significantly reduce withdrawals of water from the Carmel River. This action by the board recognizes our significant progress in building cooperative alliances among California American, local governments and communities and environmental organizations. With these alliances, we're pursuing projects and water recycling and reuse that augment our water needs both before and after completion of our planned desalination facility.
On Slide 11, you can see the success we've had in working with state governments and our commissions, either in legislation or policy that enables water solutions to water and wastewater challenges. For example, the Pennsylvania legislature eliminated a consolidated tax adjustment in setting utility rates. The new law now requires a calculation of the public utility's federal income tax expense on a stand-alone basis, separate from any gains or losses of unregulated affiliates. Prior to this law, Pennsylvania was one of a few states that had a consolidated tax adjustment.
In Illinois over the last several months, Illinois American Water has worked to find solutions to help our customers have a more reliable water system more quickly. The Illinois Commerce Commission adopted new rules in June, which removes the 5% cap between rate cases and instead, permits rates that can increase an average of 2.5% a year, with no year to increase more than 3.5%. This will be a big help in a state with big infrastructure challenges.
Finally, in Kentucky, the governor signed House Bill 309 into law. This law establishes a framework for public-private partnerships in Kentucky. For the first time ever, the state and local governments can leverage private investments to complete necessary infrastructure projects to better serve the public. This law has been referenced as the most comprehensive P3 legislation to date in the nation.
As you can see on Slide 12, during the first half of the year, in addition to our organic growth, we welcomed about 7,600 new water and wastewater customer connections, which is about 20,000 people. We have pending acquisitions, which represent another 47,800 new customers. This includes the Shorelands acquisition, which is more than 11,000 water customers. This is another example of how we're able to provide solutions. Shorelands' service area is in a part of the state that is designated by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection as a critical area in terms of water supply. Once the purchase is approved and closed, we'll welcome our new employees and our new customers. We're also working to close our acquisition of the Scranton Sewer Authority by September 30. Here, we will welcome 31,000 new wastewater customers. We will benefit from our operational and engineering expertise and our commitment to make necessary capital investments.
You can also see in this slide how legislative efforts are helping us provide water and wastewater solutions for people across our footprint. Out of the 9 states where we have pending or closed acquisitions, 5 have fair market value legislation. The importance of this legislation is evident when you look at the numbers. Nearly 97% of the customers we have closed or pending are in one of these fair market value states.
Moving to Slide 13. We continue to improve our O&M efficiency ratio, achieving 35.2% for the last 12 months. We remain on track to meet our O&M efficiency target of 34% by 2020. It's a great effort by our employees across our business. And it's all about bringing value to our customers. As I did last quarter, let me provide you with a couple of examples of what we're doing to drive these results. The first example is in our customer service centers, where we've recently introduced new features to our customer self-service site. These changes improve the customer experience by using easy-to-understand language for reoccurring payments and enabling our customers to change the bank account they use to pay their bills without the need to contact us. For the month of July, more than 17,000 customers signed up for paperless billing, and that's more than 3x the amount of customers that signed up in the month of June. These changes are a true win-win to make it easier for our customers to do business with us, and they enable us to drive down costs.
In New Jersey, an energy deregulated state, we've taken advantage of reverse auctions to reduce our electricity cost. We first did this in 2011 and completed another auction this past fall. Through this process, New Jersey American Water will save a total of $9 million for the next 3 years in energy cost, benefiting our customers. When we reduce $1 in operation to maintenance expense, we can invest $6 in capital. The $9 million cost reduction will translate into an additional $54 million in capital improvements without impacting our customers' rates.
Finally, we thank our employees in West Virginia for the way they responded to the devastating floods there this past June. Once again, our team rose to the challenge, working safely and getting our service restored as quickly as possible. Additionally, they assisted state-wide emergency response efforts. For example, we loaned 2 water tankers to the West Virginia Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management to provide potable water for flood-devastated communities outside our service area. We also provided 3 large generators to run critical facilities in neighboring communities without power. It was a great effort by our employees there, and we're very, very proud of them.
And now we'll turn the call over to Linda for more detail on our second quarter financial results."

In the second quarter of 2016, American Water delivered strong financial results. And year-to-date, we remain on track. Slide 16 shows the earnings per share contribution from each of our businesses. We reported earnings of $0.77 per share in the second quarter, up $0.09 or 13.2% over the same quarter last year.
Year-to-date, we reported earnings per share of $1.23, up $0.10 or 8.8% over the same period last year. For the quarter, the Regulated Businesses were up $0.08 and the Market-Based Businesses were up $0.01. Parent, which is primarily interest expense on parent debt, was flat compared to the same period last year.
Turning to Slide 17, let me walk through the components of our quarter-over-quarter increase in earnings per share. The primary driver for earnings growth was in our Regulated business, which was up $0.08. Regulated revenue was up $0.10 from authorized rate increases, infrastructure surcharges and new revenue from completed acquisitions and organic growth.
O&M expense was down $0.01 per share. This represents continued improved O&M efficiency that Walter discussed and some timing impacts, including a one-time $0.02 benefit from settlement of the Missouri rate case that will be offset during the remainder of the year. Largely offsetting these positive items were higher medical and prescription drug insurance costs of about $5 million pretax that are managed through our VEBA Trust. These higher costs are the result of 3 items: first, we have been managing down the overfunded status of our VEBA Trust, and this year, the funded status went from being overfunded to being fully funded; second, we are seeing an increase in claims cost; and third, we trued up our liability based on our claims experience. As I mentioned, the second quarter impact was about $5 million pretax or $0.02 per share. For the remainder of the year, we estimate increasing claims will add another $3 million pretax, putting the full year increase at about $8 million pretax or $0.03 per share. American Water, like other employers, is challenged by rising health care costs, and later, Susan will discuss actions we are taking to manage these costs going forward.
Next, interest expense was up a $0.01, and depreciation expense was up about $0.02, both driven by growth associated with our Regulated system investments.
Moving to our Market-Based Businesses. Quarterly net income was up $0.01 per share, primarily from a favorable contract dispute settlement of about $3 million pretax, which we had expected to receive later this year. Absent this favorable settlement, the Market-Based Businesses were relatively flat. Increases in Homeowner Services as well as the acquisition of Keystone last July were largely offset by lower capital upgrades in our Military Services Group. As noted in our first quarter call, we expect lower capital upgrades in 2016 from reduced federal budgets and because these capital upgrades can be lumpy year-over-year. One of the biggest reasons capital upgrades were lower in the second quarter was the wind down of an $85 million, 3-year project at Fort Polk.
Let me now cover the regulatory highlights on Slide 18. We currently have 6 general rate cases and 1 infrastructure surcharge request in process for a combined annualized rate request of $113 million. For rates effective from July 1, 2015, through today, we received a total of $102 million in additional annualized revenues from general rate cases, infrastructure charges and step increases.
As you can see on this slide, our requested ROE in our outstanding general rate cases is generally 10.75% to 10.8%, with recent authorizations at 9.75% in several of our states. Overall, our weighted, company-wide authorized ROE was 9.9% at the end of this quarter.
Looking at the change in ROE over the past 3 years since 2013, the company's average authorized ROE has only moved about 10 basis points from a prior average of 10%. And during the same time period, our weighted authorized equity ratio increased about 20 basis points. So even with sustained low interest rates over this period, changes in ROE have tended to be slow and gradual.
Slide 19 highlights our continued strong financial performance. We made total capital investments of $316 million during the second quarter of 2016 and $552 million year-to-date, primarily for regulated system investments, mainly for the replacement and renewal of transmission and distribution infrastructure. We expect total capital expenditures to be in the $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion range in 2016.
Our capital expenditure range was updated to include our pending acquisitions. I would also like to point out that the Shorelands acquisition announced yesterday is a stock-for-stock transaction, and the maximum number of shares to be exchanged at closing will be less than 500,000, with the final number of shares based upon American Water stock price. We expect to close the transaction in the first quarter of 2017.
For the second quarter of 2016, cash flow from operations increased $51 million or about 23% to $271 million, mainly due to focused efforts on improving the aging of our accounts receivable as well as the timing of accounts payable and accrued liability.
Our adjusted return on equity for the past 12 months was 9.55%, an increase of 57 basis points compared to last year from continued execution on our strategies. We also announced in July a $0.375 common stock cash dividend payable on September 1, 2016, to stockholders of record as of August 8, 2016.
Turning to Slide 20. We are affirming our 2016 earnings guidance. I would like to point out a few items. First, weather impacts in July are expected to be minimal as the hot temperatures across many of our states were also accompanied by rainfall. Second, our year-to-date earnings were strong across the business. However, as I've noted, they also include some timing-related items, including the favorable contract dispute settlement at AWE, which we had expected later in the year, and the $0.02 benefit from settlement of the Missouri rate case that will be offset during the remainder of the year. Third, looking forward, despite the expected increase in group insurance costs and the headwinds we've previously discussed at our Military Services Group in Keystone, we affirm our earnings guidance range of $2.75 to $2.85 per share.
With that, I'll turn it back over to Susan."

Before we move on to Q&A, I would like to take a couple of minutes to talk about health care costs. Like other companies, our health care costs are going up. This is especially true in utilities where we have an even more pronounced aging workforce. We're currently partnering with our health care and pharmacy providers for better pricing, while strongly promoting a healthy and safe culture for our employees. We continue to promote wellness and health management programs, preventive care screening and education for employees on being thoughtful consumers of health care.
But we're going a step further. Earlier this year, American Water was a founding member with 20 national companies, which you see on the chart, to form the Health Transformational Alliance, or HTA. Since the initiative was kicked off in February, an additional 13 companies have joined the Alliance, with the now 33 companies representing more than 5.5 million people across the country. We're proud to be part of this cutting edge effort. The overall goal of the HTA is to create higher quality care by first partnering with facilities and physicians that have better outcomes, while also aggregating the purchasing power of all the member companies to keep costs down.
Additionally, HTA companies will pool our data without identifying individual information for better treatment options, better health outcomes and more reasonable and efficient pricing. The HTA is following a similar process for pharmaceutical purchasing and contracting systems. The HTA's efforts have been highlighted recently in several media publications, including The Wall Street Journal, Barron's and The Boston Globe. This is just the start of an exciting collaborative effort. We will keep you updated as we work with leading companies throughout the United States to improve the quality of healthcare and slow the rising costs for our company, employees and their families.
So in summary, our year-to-date financial performance reflects the successful execution of our strategies, investing in our system, upgrading efficiently, growing our business and remaining steadfast in our commitment to the highest standards of customer service and water quality.
And with that, we're happy to take your questions."

So can you just talk a little bit about transitioning that -- those rates across your system from DSIC and surcharges over to base rates and whether that's -- as this becomes a bigger and bigger part of the business, DSIC and surcharges, is that a seamless process?

So even if in many states, municipalities aren't regulated by the PSCs, the recognition of water and wastewater challenges is shared by everyone. So we do find that in many of our states, the commission are concerned about water quality, water issues along with their governmental entities. And the whole point here is to offer optionality to municipalities, so that whatever works for them and their citizens, they have the options to do, and fair market legislation just helps out that whole situation."

When you look at the fair market legislation, at least in our service area, it started with Illinois legislation. They were among the first to do that. The general question now is, I think that as you continue to see water and wastewater systems under distress across the country, this is a very viable solution that enables municipalities to benefit from water utilities like us and others to benefit and to solve -- the main thing is to solve a problem for the citizens out there who are depending on the best water quality, but also you have communities around the country who are doing an amazing job first of all, but they have all of these different priorities. They have to provide for schools and for roads and for parks, and the responsibilities that these municipalities have is so long, and as we know, a lot of the federal funds aren't there any more that were there during the '70s and '80s and even '90s. And so they are trying the very best they can to serve the citizens of their communities. So where it makes sense, and this is an option for them when they choose to put their systems up for sale, having this type of legislation takes an obstacle away from that. In the past, we've had situations where a municipality or governmental entity wanted to sell its system, we wanted to buy it. But because of the way things worked between the book value and what we're able to put in a rate base that wasn't considered premium, it stopped a lot of deals before they ever took place. So I think this is an effort by states to have a win-win situation. But at the end of the day, the people in those communities need to be better off and the municipalities are able then to provide the critical services that they're responsible for."

So that's really the immediate issue that we're looking at and clarifying in Washington in terms of the role of storm water in the privatization legislation, which by the way is actually there. So I think it's one of those that as the entire country looks at water supply challenges and we look at the entire water cycle, it's not -- in the past, we tend to say, it's the drinking water, it's storm water, it's sewer water. Where you have drought situations, where you have the need and we need to promote water recycling reuse, you're going to start everyone looking at the whole cycle.

Our plans are very open in our states, in our DSIC. In any of our infrastructure surcharge, we present plans. We also go in when we have quarterly, sometimes semiannually filing. Where there is a close monitoring of the projects we're working on, what we're spending in addition to our O&M efficiency, at least for American Water, we also have several efforts in terms of capital efficiency. What are we doing not only to spend every O&M dollar, but what are we doing to show that we're actually even improving how we spend every capital dollar. Because for us, it's this situation: We are faced with years of investment. We want to be as efficient with every dollar as we can possibly be because that means we can put more in the ground, not impact the customer bill and to be able to get the infrastructure replaced more quickly, which still is a decades-long issue. So that's one thing we know. I will also tell you with the recent -- I'll say, attention to water quality issues in a time when you have infrastructure, but you also have emerging water quality issues, and we've seen what happens in different parts of the country when you don't invest in infrastructure.

It's more of you're talking about an E&P industry that's extremely cautious because of what they've gone through the past 18 months. So you don't have people that have gone from being so far down to saying, we're going to pull out all the stops and ramp everything up immediately. They have a cautiousness, so we have a cautiousness. And it is a testing of the waters. The foundations are becoming stronger. We're seeing natural gas prices, I think NYMEX closed yesterday at $2.84, for example. Just in April, it was a $1.90 per million Btus. We're starting to see better pricing as the supply is being drawn down because of the heat across the country in -- this summer. We're starting to see some activities where people had not been doing drilling and now they are. We're starting to see some more drilling rigs come up. So our cautiousness is the timing. It is the spacing. It is how quickly will we see this come up, how quickly will we see the supply that basically is being drawn down and being replenished, what are the forecast for the winter month, how cold will the winter be. So we try to base looking at objective third-party data like price projections, like drilling projections. We look at all of that. Then we also look at our internal discussions we have with our customers and what their drilling plans are. So the cautiousness is -- what you don't want is for people to flip back and forth to say, it's not good, it's great, it's not -- we just want to be very cautious as we look at the ramp up and the continuing strength of the natural gas drilling market and make sure that we're very careful in how we look at that emergence."

So we're very excited about that because what that will do is if they start construction as they have said in 2018 and finish in 2020, you're talking about even more valuable natural gas drilling where you can get the NGLs along with the natural gas. So we just see that area and the intersection between Utica and Marcellus being very rich in terms of the fact as we know that it is the cheapest to drill for the drillers, and it also requires a good bit of water because of the depth of the formations.

And so I'm wondering if there's a potential to extend and capture more business in the Utica because it's so -- it's kind of open there. And then 2, that increased sand means increased needs for water there. So how -- are you guys factoring that into your figures? And if so, are you expecting -- how much of a positive impact because a year ago, that was 1,000 pounds, and now we're talking doubling that. So I mean, that could be really meaningful for American Water."

So Rich, in recent weeks, the drill count's been about 36 in Appalachian Basin. And ours is -- we're all natural gas by the way. So we do very little to no support for oil. Actually, for us, it's mostly natural gas. So that's one",256,"Well, a couple of things. So Rich, in recent weeks, the drill count's been about 36 in Appalachian Basin. And ours is -- we're all natural gas by the way. So we do very little to no support for oil. Actually, for us, it's mostly natural gas. So that's one. Second thing, you're exactly right. What we are finding is that in order to more efficiently utilize drills -- wells that have already been drilled, they are looking at higher pressure, more sand, which does require more water. You're exactly right. But those changes in the market and the efficiency are things that our folks at Keystone work closely with customers in terms of estimates of how much water we need. So you're right, there's changes. That's one of the reasons that the wells have become so much more efficient is they're doing the second and third frac, and they're also putting a lot more sand and lot more pressure with the sand when they go to those second and third fracs. So you're exactly right. I tell you there's a couple other things we're involved in, and one of them is we're working with a couple of customers on some automated pumping that really is not pretty standard right now. So we consistently look at working with E&Ps on how to make the production more efficient, how to get the most they can out of each individual well and to make sure that we are a solutions provider on everything around water and water services."

Well, we actually have an AMI team that we're working throughout the company to come up with a rollout to -- unlike electric, the water bills are so much less expensive. Of course, we're looking at the ability to be able to justify them economically. One of the good things is we're seeing a lot of better technology with the meters that will allow us to actually put in AMR meters that we can then do software upgrades to actually make them AMI meters, which is good. We continue to work with some electric utilities on utilizing some of the same backhaul infrastructures so that our customers don't have to double the cost of those investments. We're working with Commonwealth Edison, ComEd, in the Chicago area as well as there's a couple of other utilities that have expressed an interest. And we're very excited about that because it truly is a win-win for our customers where we put in a water meter. But the one reason that does push us to do AMI is interestingly, still a lot of water meters across our footprint are in people's homes. So the ability to put in AMI that we don't have to actually send people out to people's homes and set up times to go into their home is a real not just efficiency improvement, but also a customer satisfaction improvement. So we're taking all of those factors. We've got a plan in place to rollout AMI over the next few years and where we can partner with electric utilities to offset some of that cost for our customers, we're all for it."

With me today are Linda Sullivan, our CFO, who will go over the third quarter financial results; and Walter Lynch, our COO, who will give key updates on our operations. 
But before we give you the summary of our third quarter results, I'd like to comment on the announcement we made on Monday. We have a binding global settlement in principle approved by the federal court for all consolidated claims in both federal and state courts in West Virginia arising from the Freedom Industries chemical spill on January 9, 2014. This settlement is not an admission of any liability or fault on the part of our company or our employees. 
As a matter of record, Freedom Industries as a company as well as 6 of their employees, including 3 officers, have pled guilty to criminal violation of the Clean Water Act as a result of the chemical spill. 
In comparison, West Virginia American Water has not been found to have violated any laws or regulations in connection with the chemical spill. 
We firmly believe the suits brought against us are without merit and resulted at least in part due to the bankruptcy of Freedom Industries and their limited ability to pay claims. 
As noted in the recent report by the Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board, the Freedom Industries chemical spill was preventable had Freedom followed proper procedures. 
Additionally, the federal court dismissed all claims against American Water parent company and our service company in pretrial decisions, nor is either a party to the class action litigation in state court. 
So why did we decide to settle these cases? First, we believe it is in the best interest of our customers, our company and especially our West Virginia employees. They're the people who work hard to deliver the highest standard of customer service possible regardless of the challenges they face. 
Second, this resolution allows us to serve our customers without the distractions and potentially significant expenses of federal and state litigation over the next several years, which Linda will quantify in a few minutes. 
And third, these distractions and expenses are further compounded by a couple of fact. West Virginia is our only regulated state in American Water with severely limited protection against claims of damages arising from outages or interruptions of services. Even electric and gas utilities in the state are more protected as our municipalities. 
Additionally, these trials would have occurred in a stat that historically has been highly favorable to the point, thus far. While West Virginia passed meaningful [indiscernible] reform measures in 2015, the lawsuits filed by plaintiffs in these cases were filed before the new measures took effect. 
Now let me turn the call over to Linda to comment on the financial element of the proposed global settlement."
250885,405253325,1071729,"American Water Works Company, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2016",2016-11-03,"Earnings Calls","American Water Works Company, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Susan. Let me start with the earnings impact. The aggregate amount of the binding global agreement in principle is $126 million pretax. Our portion is $65 million, with the remaining $61 million coming from some of our insurers. In the third q",594,"Thanks, Susan. Let me start with the earnings impact. 
The aggregate amount of the binding global agreement in principle is $126 million pretax. Our portion is $65 million, with the remaining $61 million coming from some of our insurers. 
In the third quarter, we recorded our $65 million portion of the settlement net of committed insurance receivable as an after-tax charge of $39 million or $0.22 per share, which was recorded on the books of West Virginia American Water. 
I would like to point out that 2 of our insurers that we asked to participate in the settlement have presently not agreed to participate in the settlement. Their insurance coverage level is up to $50 million in the aggregate. 
We intend to actively pursue recovery from these 2 insurers. And in fact, last Friday, West Virginia American Water filed suit against one of these insurers in West Virginia, and we will pursue arbitration against the other. We firmly believe that these insurers have a responsibility to participate appropriately. 
In terms of the structure of the settlement, Page 6 lays out the components of the structure for both our settlement of $126 million as well as another $25 million funded under a separate settlement agreement between the plaintiffs and Eastman Chemical Company. The structure establishes a two-tier approach to payments of claims made up of a guaranteed fund and claim-based payments. 
Let me discuss the guaranteed fund first. In our settlement, the guaranteed fund will be $76 million, of which all our portion would be $51 million and an insurance carrier will contribute $25 million. The 2 insurers that I mentioned earlier who did not participate in the settlement were asked to commit coverage to the guaranteed fund. Their insurance coverage level is up to $50 million in the aggregate. We have not recorded an accounts receivable from these 2 insurers, but we are actively pursuing recovery, as I mentioned earlier. 
As the chart shows, Eastman's $25 million is in the guaranteed fund. The total $101 million in the guaranteed fund must be exhausted before any claims-based payments are made. 
Now let me cover the claims-based payment. In our settlement, the claims-based payments would be up to $50 million, of which our portion would be up to $14 [ph] million and a number of our insurance carriers committed to contribute up to $36 million. 
I trust that this chart helps to explain the structure of the settlement. 
Let me know discuss a few other points. As part of the settlement, West Virginia American Water agreed it will not seek rate recovery from the West Virginia Public Service Commission for the amounts included under this settlement and for approximately $4 million in direct response cost expensed in 2014 relating to the chemical spill. 
In terms of cash flow, we intend to fund West Virginia settlement payments through existing of liquidity. Funding is not expected to begin until the settlement is final, estimated to occur in the first half of next year. 
Let me also discussed legal fees. We estimate that future defense costs could easily have been $25 million or more over the next several years had we gone through all trials in the case both federal and state, and these are only the estimated legal expenses and do not account for other expected impacts that results from significant litigation, such as management's time and attention and an ongoing distraction to our employees in West Virginia who are focused on delivering water service to our customers in that state. 
I'll now turn it back to Susan."
250885,405253325,1071729,"American Water Works Company, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2016",2016-11-03,"Earnings Calls","American Water Works Company, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Linda. We believe strongly that these uncertainties, distractions and anticipated expenses warranted a global settlement at this time, again despite the fact that we believe the suits brought against West Virginia American Water are without merits",825,"Thanks, Linda. We believe strongly that these uncertainties, distractions and anticipated expenses warranted a global settlement at this time, again despite the fact that we believe the suits brought against West Virginia American Water are without merits. 
In terms of next steps. The terms of the settlement must be finalized and approved by the court, notice of the terms of the settlement must be provided to the settlement class members, and then a final fairness hearing will be held before the final approval of the settlement. We anticipate this final hearing should occur in the first half of 2017. 
The Freedom Industries chemical spill was a challenging time for the West Virginia community, our customers and our employees. We are looking forward. And as we have for our 130 years as a company, our focus is on serving our customer's clean, safe, reliable and affordable water. 
So with that, let's discuss our third quarter performance because outside of this week's news of the pending resolution of litigation, our employees continue to consistently deliver great results across our business with their outstanding dedication and commitment to our customers. 
Excelling at fundamentals is critically important in any business. We get that, and this is why we continue to invest in our water and wastewater systems, while at the same time increasing our operating efficiencies to reduce cost impacts on our customers. 
We also continue to grow our Regulated Businesses based on our demonstrated core competencies and customer care. Our people are providing solutions and value to customers and communities across our footprint, and this is what drives our consistent results. 
Slide 7 highlights how we have executed our strategies. It starts with providing reliable service through capital investment in our Regulated operations. During the first 9 months of the year, we invested $905 million in capital, with the majority dedicated toward our Regulated operations to improve water and wastewater systems. It also included $24 million for regulated acquisitions. We plan to invest between $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion this year, with about $1.2 billion of that amount in regulated infrastructure investments. This level of investment is balanced by our continued focus on, first, controlling O&M costs; then spending every capital dollar efficiently; and finally, utilizing constructive regulatory mechanisms. 
We're extremely proud of our employees' efforts to improve efficiency, and their commitment comes from a deeply ingrained culture at American Water to provide the best quality service to our customers at an affordable price. Walter will give you a little bit background on some of these efforts in just a few minutes. 
Having the reputation of doing what is right for our customers also contributes to our growth. This year, we've already welcomed 10,700 new customers just from acquisition and a total of 10,000 more customers from organic growth. We also have signed agreements representing another 67,800 customers pending regulatory approvals. 
As we discussed in the first 2 quarterly call this year, we faced headwinds in our Market-Based Businesses in 2016. We continue to see reductions in capital upgrade projects in our Military Services Group compared to previous years. This is due to decreases in base infrastructure budgets as well as the completion earlier this year of a very large multiyear capital upgrade project we had at one of our military bases. 
We see improving conditions in natural gas drilling plans in the Appalachian basin, and our Keystone Clearwater subsidiary continues to increase its market share from about 20% when we bought the company in July of 2015 to about 35% today. 
However, due to the timing of ramp-ups and work completion schedule, at this time, we still view Keystone as being EPS neutral for this year. 
Our Homeowner Services business continues to grow, especially through municipal partnerships and expansion of services we offer. To date, we have about 1.7 million customer contracts, which serve 833,000 customers in 43 states and Washington, D.C. This business is seeing a very active national market with several municipal RSPs in process. 
We believe that our Market-Based Businesses remain strong long-term play, and they leverage our core competencies in water and wastewater treatment and management. We strategically limit their impact to our overall risk profile. These businesses are also very capital-like, with a vast majority of our investments made in our Regulated business. 
Moving on to Slide 8. Adjusted earnings were $1.05 per share for the third quarter, excluding the Freedom Industries settlement, a 9.4% increase above third quarter 2015. For the first 9 months in 2016, EPS increased 8.6%. 
Our continued strong results enable us to revise our adjusted earnings guidance to the upper end of our prior range plus $0.01, so from $2.75 to $2.85 per share to $2.81 to $2.86 per share, again excluding the Freedom Industries settlement. 
We also continue our progress toward achieving our long-term goal of 7% to 10% EPS growth through 2020. 
And with that, Walter will now give you his update on our operations."
250885,405253325,1071729,"American Water Works Company, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2016",2016-11-03,"Earnings Calls","American Water Works Company, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Susan. Good morning, everyone. During the third quarter and year-to-date, our employees continued to demonstrate their expertise and skill in delivering reliable and safe water services to our customers. Once again, we've made smart investments, a",805,"Thanks, Susan. Good morning, everyone. During the third quarter and year-to-date, our employees continued to demonstrate their expertise and skill in delivering reliable and safe water services to our customers. Once again, we've made smart investments, achieved growth to the solutions we offer to communities, and we continue to maximize efficiencies to help keep costs down. 
Our commitment to invest in our infrastructure, while focusing on efficiency of operations to balance customer costs is front and center in the regulatory requests we've made this year. 
In Kentucky, our rate case settlement was approved, and we received an order for $6.5 [ph] million of additional annualized revenues. As part of the rate order, the PSC eliminated the former 45% equity ratio cap. This allows for some flexibility in how we finance our investments in that state. 
In California, we filed a general rate case in July 1, seeking $51 million in annualized revenues over 3 years. We also received approval to begin construction of our new pipeline associated with the Monterey Peninsula water supply project, which is due to start this month. This marks another significant milestone and a multiyear approach to solving a water supply issues for residences and businesses in that area. 
And in Pennsylvania, the Public Utility Commission last month approved our proposed acquisition of the wastewater assets of the Scranton Sewer Authority, which I'll discuss in a moment. 
Turning to Slide 11. In the third quarter, record warrant and lower rainfalls swept through many of our larger service areas, especially in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. While some areas we serve were rather than usual, mainly in Missouri and Illinois, the overall effect was higher weather impacted water sales. We estimate the impact to our net revenues to be approximately $6 million. 
Also of note, on October 21, the New Jersey DEP issued a drought warning in 4 of the 6 designated drought regions. While we do have production facilities in these designated drought areas, we have the ability and capacity to transfer water to the impacted regions as authorized by the DEP. 
Currently, we're in discussions with the DEP, and we stand ready to help. 
On Slide 12, you can see the success we've had in executing our growth strategy by providing solutions to water and wastewater challenges across our footprint. 
As Susan said, our pending and closed agreements represent about 78,500 customers. 
In New Jersey, we filed with the Board of Public Utilities October 28 for approval of the Shorelands acquisition, which is 11,000 water customers. We anticipate approval in the first half of 2017. 
In Pennsylvania, we have our 2 largest pending acquisitions this year. The wastewater assets of the Scranton Sewer Authority as well as the municipal authority of the City of McKeesport. Together, these systems represent more than 50,000 customers. 
Regarding Scranton, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission in October approved our application authorizing the acquisition. The commission's approval is an important positive step forward in a regulatory review process and it reflects the hard work by our Pennsylvania team in partnership with the Sewer Authority to secure the necessary approvals. 
We remain confident that we'll receive all the necessary remaining approvals, close acquisition and begin providing quality wastewater service to Scranton and done more before the end of 2016. 
Finally, this week, we closed on our acquisition of the Borough of New Cumberland wastewater system, adding 3,100 customers to our Pennsylvania footprint. 
Moving to Slide 13. Once again, we continue to improve our O&M efficiency ratio, achieving 34.9% for the last 12 months. We remain on track to meet our O&M efficiency target of 34% by 2020. 
This tremendous effort by our employees is centered on bringing value to our customers. Once again, let me provide you with a couple of examples of what we're doing to drive these results. 
In Indiana, we completed a local project to digitize customer request to locate underground assets so that customers can excavate on their own property. Known internally as eLocate [ph], this project, which issues our GIS data, has improved our response time, reduce labor and improve accuracy and customer satisfaction on these customer requests. 
eLocate has been replicated now across 6 states and is provided over $1 million in annualized cost savings and efficiencies. 
Another example is our investment in enterprise software and meter data management, which is beginning to pay off in efficiency gains. We continue to improve our performance, closing in on a near 100% natural meter reach we're building. We've seen cost savings of over $1 million as we reduce the time spent handling exceptions. And again, every dollar we save in O&M costs, we can invest $7 in capital with no impact on our customers bills. 
And I now will turn the call over to Linda for more detail on our third quarter financial results."

In the third quarter of 2016, American Water reported earnings of $0.83 per share, including the $0.22 charge for the Freedom Industries settlement.

In the third quarter of 2016, American Water reported earnings of $0.83 per share, including the $0.22 charge for the Freedom Industries settlement. Excluding this charge, adjusted earnings per share were $1.05, 9.4% higher than the third quarter of last year. 
As shown on Slide 15, our Regulated segment was up $0.10 per share, our Market-Based Businesses were down $0.03 and the parent was favorable two [ph] pennies. 
For the 9 months ended September 30, our adjusted earnings per share were $2.27, up $0.18 or 8.6% compared to the prior year. 
As with the quarter, these results were driven by our Regulated segment, which was up $0.22. And both our Market-Based Businesses and parent were each down $0.02 per share. 
Turning to Slide 16, let me discuss the quarterly results by business segment. For the first quarter, adjusted earnings for our Regulated Businesses increased $0.10 per share. The largest driver of growth was Regulated revenue, which was up $0.15 per share. Of that $0.15, approximately $0.14 was from additional revenue authorized to rate cases and infrastructure mechanism to support investment growth as well as some fluctuations and balancing accounts, and $0.01 was from acquisitions and organic growth. 
As Walter mentioned, we experienced hot dry weather throughout much of our service area this quarter, especially in New Jersey, which increased revenue by more than $12 million. This was partially offset by wet conditions in Missouri and Illinois, which decreased revenue by about $6 million. Net-net, we had a pickup in revenue of about $6 million this quarter compared to normal weather conditions, although the year-over-year third quarter weather impact was 0. 
Next, adjusted O&M expense increased $0.03 per share this quarter. There were lots of pluses and minuses here, but among the drivers were higher production and employee-related costs, partially offset by lower insurance costs. 
We are also experiencing some O&M timing this year as more than $10 million of regulated O&M is now expected to be complete in the last quarter of the year. This includes tank painting expenses, certain maintenance and repairs as well as some project delays. 
Next, depreciation expense increased $0.02 per share from regulated investment growth. 
In the Market-Based Businesses, our third quarter results were $0.03 lower than last year's, due mainly to lower capital upgrades at our military bases. The year-over-year reduction in capital upgrades is driven by 2 factors. The first is a reduction in military base infrastructure budget and the second is the completion of an $85 million capital upgrade project at Fort Polk that contributed revenue in 2015 and which was substantially completed in the second quarter of this year. 
Also, I'd like to clarify that what we call military capital upgrade represent working capital only. These military projects are not capitalized on our balance sheet. Rather, we recover these investments through scheduled or milestone payments as we complete them. 
Finally, while we are seeing a year-over-year decrease in military capital upgrade projects, the pipeline of new bases looking to privatize remains strong. 
In the final section of the waterfall chart, you'll note that the parent is positive $0.02 per share for the quarter, primarily due to certain expenses recorded in the third quarter of last year, partially offset by higher interest on parent debt. 
And finally, we showed the $0.22 impact of the settlement, bringing our GAAP earnings to $0.83 per share for the quarter. 
Turning to Slide 17. We have 5 rate cases and 2 outstanding infrastructure surcharge requests awaiting final orders for a total revenue request of $109.7 million. We also have a total of $90.5 [ph] million in annualized rate effective since October 1, 2015, including the resolution of our Kentucky rate case for $6.5 million in late August and $9 million in annualized infrastructure surcharges in our Pennsylvania subsidiary. 
Slide 18 highlights our ongoing strong financial performance and some key cash flow and investing metrics for our business. Our capital investments year-to-date were $905 million. This is $65 [ph] million lower than the same period last year, which included the third quarter purchase of Keystone Clearwater for $133 million. We expect to spend between $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion this year, including capital for the Scranton acquisition, which we are working to close in the fourth quarter. 
Our cash flow from operations grew 8.1% to $925 million for the first 9 months of the year. The majority of this growth was driven by increased net income and depreciation, both of which are the results of infrastructure investment for our customers. 
Our adjusted return on equity improved to 9.57%. This is testament to the ongoing efforts of our employees to work efficiently and to limit regulatory lag through timely filings and innovative regulatory mechanism. 
We also continue to provide top quartile dividend growth compared to the Dow Jones Utility average and our water peers. On October 28, we declared a dividend of thirty-seven and a half cents per share payable on December 1, 2016, to shareholders of record as of November 9, 2016. 
Finally, I would like to discuss our earnings guidance. Throughout the year, we have shared with you the headwinds we faced in our Market-Based Businesses. For example, we have discussed the impact of lower capital upgrades in our military services division as well as our Keystone team's efforts to manage their business to be earnings neutral despite a very challenging natural gas market. 
Despite these headwinds, the employees in our businesses have delivered extraordinary results. Even with the additional fourth quarter O&M expense, we are revising our adjusted earnings guidance to the upper end of our prior range plus $0.01 or to $2.81 to $2.86 per share, which excludes the Freedom Industries settlement. 
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Susan."

The answer is we are, as I said, talking earlier, very committed to the Market-Based Businesses that we're in.

The capital upgrade business that Linda talked about is a big part of that, but the big difference is the back in military, while some of those infrastructure budgets may continue to be understood pressure, the pipeline for new basis that are issuing RSP or who have RSPs out there, there are -- they are significant. We have seen Army pretty much, pretty active in the past several years, the Air Force over the past couple of 3 years has gotten even more active. So there's a robust pipeline in the military when you base is doing so that's why we remain bullish on military services. Homeowner Services is doing well. There are more municipalities who are interested in partnership opportunities for these home warranties that we offer, so we feel really good about it. And then on the Keystone Clearwater, everybody in, gosh, Goldman, you guys are really doing a great job of monitoring the natural gas and oil market. So you know that things are picking up. We are very proud that through the worst of it that our organization, our business was able to stay EPS neutral. That is a huge deal, and it shows a lot about how they kept going and some of the services they were able to provide during the downturn. So yes, the Market-Based Businesses we're in, we are committed to. Now we've always said that at our core, we are a regulated utility, period. We will stay that way. Currently, anywhere from 9% to 10% of our revenue, net income comes from market-based little less this year. So we will not see that grow beyond 15% to 20% and probably closer to the up to 15% unless there's something extremely regulated-like if we win every new military base, for example, and that helps us, and it's more regulated-like. But right now, we are committed, but the Market-Based Businesses top of limited role in the overall growth of our company and the majority of our growth will always come from our capital investment in our Regulated business as well as Regulated acquisition that then turns into more capital investment into our business."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. With me today are Linda Sullivan, our CFO, who will go over the third quarter financial results; and Walter Lynch, our COO, who will give key updates on our operations.
But before we give you the summary of our third quarter results, I'd like to comment on the announcement we made on Monday. We have a binding global settlement in principle approved by the federal court for all consolidated claims in both federal and state courts in West Virginia arising from the Freedom Industries chemical spill on January 9, 2014. This settlement is not an admission of any liability or fault on the part of our company or our employees. 
As a matter of record, Freedom Industries as a company as well as 6 of their employees, including 3 officers, have pled guilty to criminal violations of the Clean Water Act as a result of the chemical spill. 
In comparison, West Virginia American Water has not been found to have violated any laws or regulations in connection with the chemical spill.
We firmly believe the suits brought against us are without merit and resulted at least in part due to the bankruptcy of Freedom Industries and their limited ability to pay claims.
As noted in the recent report by the Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board, the Freedom Industries chemical spill was preventable had Freedom followed proper procedures.
Additionally, the federal court dismissed all claims against American Water parent company and our service company in pretrial decisions, nor is either a party to the class action litigation in state court. 
So why did we decide to settle these cases? First, we believe it is in the best interest of our customers, our company and especially our West Virginia employees. They're the people who work hard to deliver the highest standard of customer service possible, regardless of the challenges they face. 
Second, this resolution allows us to serve our customers without the distractions and potentially significant expenses of federal and state litigation over the next several years, which Linda will quantify in a few minutes. 
And third, these distractions and expenses are further compounded by a couple of facts. West Virginia is our only regulated state in American Water with severely limited protections against claims of damages arising from outages or interruptions of services. Even electric and gas utilities in the state are more protected as our municipalities. 
Additionally, these trials would have occurred in a state that historically has been highly favorable to the point this far. While West Virginia passed meaningful tort reform measures in 2015, the lawsuits filed by plaintiffs in these cases were filed before the new measures took effect.
Now let me turn the call over to Linda to comment on the financial elements of the proposed global settlement."
250885,405253325,1072108,"American Water Works Company, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2016",2016-11-03,"Earnings Calls","American Water Works Company, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Susan. Let me start with the earnings impact. The aggregate amount of the binding global agreement in principle is $126 million pretax. Our portion is $65 million, with the remaining $61 million coming from some of our insurers. In the third qua",593,"Thanks, Susan. Let me start with the earnings impact. The aggregate amount of the binding global agreement in principle is $126 million pretax. Our portion is $65 million, with the remaining $61 million coming from some of our insurers. 
In the third quarter, we recorded our $65 million portion of the settlement, net of committed insurance receivables as an after-tax charge of $39 million or $0.22 per share, which was recorded on the books of West Virginia American Water.
I would like to point out that 2 of our insurers that we asked to participate in the settlement have presently not agreed to participate in the settlement. Their insurance coverage level is up to $50 million in the aggregate.
We intend to actively pursue recovery from these 2 insurers. And in fact, last Friday, West Virginia American Water filed suit against one of these insurers in West Virginia, and we will pursue arbitration against the other. We firmly believe that these insurers have a responsibility to participate appropriately.
In terms of the structure of the settlement, Page 6 lays out the components of the structure for both our settlement of $126 million as well as another $25 million funded under a separate settlement agreement between the plaintiffs and Eastman Chemical Company. The structure establishes a two-tier approach to payments of claims made up of a guaranteed fund and claim-based payments.
Let me discuss the guaranteed fund first. In our settlement, the guaranteed fund will be $76 million, of which our portion would be $51 million and an insurance carrier will contribute $25 million. The 2 insurers that I mentioned earlier who did not participate in the settlement were asked to commit coverage to the guaranteed fund. Their insurance coverage level is up to $50 million in the aggregate. We have not recorded an accounts receivable from these 2 insurers, but we are actively pursuing recovery, as I mentioned earlier.
As the chart shows, Eastman's $25 million is in the guaranteed fund. The total $101 million in the guaranteed fund must be exhausted before any claims-based payments are made. 
Now let me cover the claims-based payment. In our settlement, the claims-based payments would be up to $50 million, of which our portion would be up to $14 million and a number of our insurance carriers committed to contribute up to $36 million. I trust that this chart helps to explain the structure of the settlement. 
Let me now discuss a few other points. As part of the settlement, West Virginia American Water agreed it will not seek rate recovery from the West Virginia Public Service Commission for the amounts included under this settlement and for approximately $4 million in direct response cost expensed in 2014 relating to the chemical spill.
In terms of cash flow, we intend to fund West Virginia settlement payments through existing sources of liquidity. Funding is not expected to begin until the settlement is final, estimated to occur in the first half of next year. 
Let me also discuss legal fees. We estimate that future defense costs could easily have been $25 million or more over the next several years had we gone through all trials in the case both federal and state, and these are only the estimated legal expenses and do not account for other expected impacts that result from significant litigation, such as management's time and attention and an ongoing distraction to our employees in West Virginia who are focused on delivering water service to our customers in that state.
I'll now turn it back to Susan."
250885,405253325,1072108,"American Water Works Company, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2016",2016-11-03,"Earnings Calls","American Water Works Company, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Linda. We believe strongly that these uncertainties, distractions and anticipated expenses warranted a global settlement at this time, again, despite the fact that we believe the suits brought against West Virginia American Water are without merit",826,"Thanks, Linda. We believe strongly that these uncertainties, distractions and anticipated expenses warranted a global settlement at this time, again, despite the fact that we believe the suits brought against West Virginia American Water are without merit. 
In terms of next steps, the terms of the settlement must be finalized and approved by the court, notice of the terms of the settlement must be provided to the settlement class members, and then a final fairness hearing will be held before the final approval of the settlement. We anticipate this final hearing should occur in the first half of 2017. 
The Freedom Industries chemical spill was a challenging time for the West Virginia community, our customers and our employees. We are looking forward. And as we have for our 130 years as a company, our focus is on serving our customers clean, safe, reliable and affordable water.
So with that, let's discuss our third quarter performance, because outside of this week's news of the pending resolution of litigation, our employees continue to consistently deliver great results across our business with their outstanding dedication and commitment to our customers. 
Excelling at fundamentals is critically important in any business. We get that, and this is why we continue to invest in our water and wastewater systems, while at the same time, increasing our operating efficiencies to reduce cost impacts on our customers. 
We also continue to grow our Regulated Businesses based on our demonstrated core competencies and customer care. Our people are providing solutions and value to customers and communities across our footprint, and this is what drives our consistent results. 
Slide 7 highlight how we have executed our strategies. It starts with providing reliable service through capital investment in our regulated operations. During the first 9 months of the year, we invested $905 million in capital, with the majority dedicated toward our regulated operations to improve water and wastewater systems. It also included $24 million for regulated acquisitions. We plan to invest between $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion this year, with about $1.2 billion of that amount in regulated infrastructure investments. This level of investment is balanced by our continued focus on, first, controlling O&M cost; then spending every capital dollar efficiently; and finally, utilizing constructive regulatory mechanisms. 
We're extremely proud of our employees' efforts to improve efficiency, and their commitment comes from a deeply ingrained culture at American Water to provide the best quality service to our customers at an affordable price. Walter will give you a little more background on some of these efforts in just a few minutes. 
Having the reputation of doing what is right for our customers also contributes to our growth. This year, we've already welcomed 10,700 new customers just from acquisition and a total of 10,000 more customers from organic growth. We also have signed agreements, representing another 67,800 customers pending regulatory approvals.
As we discussed in the first 2 quarterly calls this year, we faced headwinds in our Market-Based Businesses in 2016. We continue to see reductions in capital upgrade projects in our Military Services Group compared to previous years. This is due to decreases in base infrastructure budgets as well as the completion earlier this year of a very large multiyear capital upgrade project we had at one of our military bases. 
We see improving conditions in natural gas drilling plans in the Appalachian basin, and our Keystone Clearwater subsidiary continues to increase its market share from about 20% when we bought the company in July of 2015 to about 35% today.
However, due to the timing of ramp-ups and work completion schedule, at this time, we still view Keystone as being EPS neutral for this year. 
Our Homeowner Services business continues to grow, especially through municipal partnerships and expansion of services we offer. To date, we have about 1.7 million customer contracts, which serve 833,000 customers in 43 states and Washington, D.C. This business is seeing a very active national market with several municipal RFPs in process.
We believe that our Market-Based Businesses remain strong long-term play, and they leverage our core competencies in water and wastewater treatment and management. We strategically limit their impact to our overall risk profile. These businesses are also very capital light, with a vast majority of our investments made in our regulated business. 
Moving on to Slide 8. Adjusted earnings were $1.05 per share for the third quarter, excluding the Freedom Industries settlement, a 9.4% increase above third quarter 2015. For the first 9 months in 2016, EPS increased 8.6%.
Our continued strong results enable us to revise our adjusted earnings guidance to the upper end of our prior range plus $0.01, so from $2.75 to $2.85 per share to $2.81 to $2.86 per share, again, excluding the Freedom Industries settlement. 
We also continue our progress toward achieving our long-term goal of 7% to 10% EPS growth through 2020. 
And with that, Walter will now give you his update on our operations."
250885,405253325,1072108,"American Water Works Company, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2016",2016-11-03,"Earnings Calls","American Water Works Company, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Susan.

During the third quarter and year-to-date, our employees continued to demonstrate their expertise and skill in delivering reliable and safe water services to our customers. Once again, we've made smart investments, achieved growth through the solutions we offer to communities, and we continue to maximize efficiency to help keep costs down. 
Our commitment to invest in our infrastructure while focusing on efficiency of operations to balance customer costs is front and center in the regulatory requests we've made this year. 
In Kentucky, our rate case settlement was approved, and we received an order for $6.5 million of additional annualized revenues. As part of the rate order, the PSC eliminated the former 45% equity ratio cap. This allows for some flexibility in how we finance our investments in that state. 
In California, we filed a general rate case on July 1, seeking $51 million in annualized revenues over 3 years. We also received approval to begin construction of our new pipeline associated with the Monterey Peninsula Water Supply Project, which is due to start this month. This marks another significant milestone and a multiyear approach to solving the water supply issues for residences and businesses in that area. 
And in Pennsylvania, the Public Utility Commission last month approved our proposed acquisition of the wastewater assets of the Scranton Sewer Authority, which I'll discuss in a moment. 
Turning to Slide 11. In the third quarter, record warmth and lower rainfall swept through many of our larger service areas, especially in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. While some areas we serve were wetter than usual, mainly in Missouri and Illinois, the overall effect was higher weather impacted water sales. We estimate the impact to our net revenues to be approximately $6 million. 
Also of note, on October 21, the New Jersey DEP issued a drought warning in 4 of the 6 designated drought regions. While we do have production facilities in these designated drought areas, we have the ability and capacity to transfer water to the impacted regions as authorized by the DEP. Currently, we're in discussions with the DEP, and we stand ready to help. 
On Slide 12, you can see the success we've had in executing our growth strategy by providing solutions to water and wastewater challenges across our footprint. As Susan said, our pending and closed agreements represent about 78,500 customers.
In New Jersey, we filed with the Board of Public Utilities on October 28 for approval of the Shorelands acquisition, which is 11,000 water customers. We anticipate approval in the first half of 2017. 
In Pennsylvania, we have our 2 largest pending acquisitions this year, the wastewater assets of the Scranton Sewer Authority as well as the Municipal Authority of the City of McKeesport. Together, these systems represent more than 50,000 customers.
Regarding Scranton, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission in October approved our application authorizing the acquisition. The commission's approval is an important positive step forward in a regulatory review process and it reflects the hard work by our Pennsylvania team in partnership with the sewer authority to secure the necessary approvals. 
We remain confident that we'll receive all the necessary remaining approvals, close the acquisition and begin providing quality wastewater service to Scranton and Dunmore before the end of 2016. 
Finally, this week, we closed on our acquisition of the Borough of New Cumberland wastewater system, adding 3,100 customers to our Pennsylvania footprint. 
Moving to Slide 13. Once again, we continue to improve our O&M efficiency ratio, achieving 34.9% for the last 12 months. We remain on track to meet our O&M efficiency target of 34% by 2020. This tremendous effort by our employees is centered on bringing value to our customers. 
Once again, let me provide you with a couple of examples on what we're doing to drive these results. In Indiana, we completed a local project to digitize customer request to locate underground assets so that customers can excavate on their own property. Known internally as eLOCATE, this project, which issues our GIS data, has improved our response time, reduced labor and improved accuracy and customer satisfaction on these customer requests. eLOCATE has been replicated now across 6 states and has provided over $1 million in annualized cost savings and efficiencies. 
Another example is our investment in enterprise software and meter data management, which is beginning to pay off in efficiency gains. We've continued to improve our performance, closing in on a near 100% natural meter reach we're billing. We've seen cost savings of over $1 million as we reduce the time spent handling exceptions. And again, every dollar we save in O&M costs, we can invest $7 in capital with no impact on our customers bills. 
And now I'll turn the call over to Linda for more detail on our third quarter financial results."
250885,405253325,1072108,"American Water Works Company, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2016",2016-11-03,"Earnings Calls","American Water Works Company, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Walter. In the third quarter of 2016, American Water reported earnings of $0.83 per share, including the $0.22 charge for the Freedom Industries settlement. Excluding this charge, adjusted earnings per share were $1.05, 9.4% higher than the thi",953,"Thank you, Walter. In the third quarter of 2016, American Water reported earnings of $0.83 per share, including the $0.22 charge for the Freedom Industries settlement. Excluding this charge, adjusted earnings per share were $1.05, 9.4% higher than the third quarter of last year. 
As shown on Slide 15, our Regulated segment was up $0.10 per share, our Market-Based Businesses were down $0.03 and the parent was favorable $0.02. 
For the 9 months ended September 30, our adjusted earnings per share were $2.27, up $0.18 or 8.6% compared to the prior year. As with the quarter, these results were driven by our Regulated segment, which was up $0.22. And both our Market-Based Businesses and parent were each down $0.02 per share. 
Turning to Slide 16, let me discuss the quarterly results by business segment. For the third quarter, adjusted earnings for our Regulated Businesses increased $0.10 per share. The largest driver of growth was Regulated revenue, which was up $0.15 per share. Of that $0.15, approximately $0.14 was from additional revenue authorized through rate cases and infrastructure mechanisms to support investment growth, as well as some fluctuations in balancing account and $0.01 was from acquisitions and organic growth. 
As Walter mentioned, we experienced hot dry weather throughout much of our service area this quarter, especially in New Jersey, which increased revenue by more than $12 million. This was partially offset by wet conditions in Missouri and Illinois, which decreased revenue by about $6 million. Net-net, we had a pickup in revenue of about $6 million this quarter compared to normal weather conditions, although the year-over-year third quarter weather impact was 0. 
Next, adjusted O&M expense increased $0.03 per share this quarter. There were lots of pluses and minuses here, but among the drivers were higher production and employee-related costs, partially offset by lower insurance costs. We are also experiencing some O&M timing this year as more than $10 million of regulated O&M is now expected to be complete in the last quarter of the year. This includes tank painting expenses, certain maintenance and repairs as well as some project delays. 
Next, depreciation expense increased $0.02 per share from regulated investment growth.
In the Market-Based Businesses, our third quarter results were $0.03 lower than last year's, due mainly to lower capital upgrades at our military bases. The year-over-year reduction in capital upgrades is driven by 2 factors. The first is a reduction in military base infrastructure budget and the second is the completion of an $85 million capital upgrade project at Fort Polk that contributed revenue in 2015, and which was substantially completed in the second quarter of this year. 
Also, I'd like to clarify that what we call military capital upgrades represent working capital only. These military projects are not capitalized on our balance sheet. Rather, we recover these investments through scheduled or milestone payments as we complete them. 
Finally, while we are seeing a year-over-year decrease in military capital upgrade projects, the pipeline of new bases looking to privatize remains strong. 
In the final section of the waterfall chart, you'll note that the parent is positive $0.02 per share for the quarter, primarily due to certain expenses recorded in the third quarter of last year, partially offset by higher interest on parent debt.
And finally, we showed the $0.22 impact of the settlement, bringing our GAAP earnings to $0.83 per share for the quarter. 
Turning to Slide 17. We have 5 rate cases and 2 outstanding infrastructure surcharge requests awaiting final orders for a total revenue request of $109.7 million. We also have a total of $90.5 million in annualized rates effective since October 1, 2015, including the resolution of our Kentucky rate case for $6.5 million in late August and $9 million in annualized infrastructure surcharges in our Pennsylvania subsidiary.
Slide 18 highlights our ongoing strong financial performance and some key cash flow and investing metrics for our business. Our capital investments year-to-date were $905 million. This is $65 million lower than the same period last year, which included the third quarter purchase of Keystone Clearwater for $133 million. We expect to spend between $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion this year, including capital for the Scranton acquisition, which we are working to close in the fourth quarter.
Our cash flow from operations grew 8.1% to $925 million for the first 9 months of the year. The majority of this growth was driven by increased net income and depreciation, both of which are the results of infrastructure investment for our customers.
Our adjusted return on equity improved to 9.57%. This is testament to the ongoing efforts of our employees to work efficiently and to limit regulatory lag through timely filings and innovative regulatory mechanisms.
We also continue to provide top quartile dividend growth compared to the Dow Jones Utility average and our water peers. On October 28, we declared a dividend of $0.375 per share payable on December 1, 2016, to shareholders of record as of November 9, 2016. 
Finally, I would like to discuss our earnings guidance. Throughout the year, we have shared with you the headwinds we faced in our Market-Based Businesses. For example, we have discussed the impact of lower capital upgrades in our military services division as well as our Keystone team's efforts to manage their business to be earnings neutral despite a very challenging natural gas market. 
Despite these headwinds, the employees in our businesses have delivered extraordinary results. Even with the additional fourth quarter O&M expense, we are revising our adjusted earnings guidance to the upper end of our prior range plus $0.01 or to $2.81 to $2.86 per share, which excludes the Freedom Industries settlement. 
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Susan."

You heard us describe in some detail the excellent results of our business through the third quarter of the year. And with the announcement of our preliminary settlement of the Freedom Industries chemical spill-related lawsuits, we will remove future risks and uncertainties related to legal costs and other expenses and distractions inherent in multiple ongoing multi-year litigation.
Our year-to-date financial performance reflects the successful execution of our strategy, investing in our systems, operating efficiently, growing our business and remaining steadfast in our commitment to the highest standards of customer service.
We have 6,700 amazing people that we all get the privilege of working with every day. They are great at what they do. They make life better for about 15 million people across the United States every day with the services they provide. They're the first ones to volunteer when communities are in need or natural disasters hit. I'm proud of not just what they do, but at the people that they are. And as investors, you can be proud of their record of service as well. 
Before we go to questions, as a reminder, we will have our 2016 investor conference at the New York Stock Exchange beginning with lunch on Thursday, December 15. At that time, we will share with you our projections for our lines of businesses in 2017 as well as share our capital plans for 2017 and beyond. 
As the slide indicates, we will need you to RSVP to make sure that you can get into the exchange. We hope you will be there. 
With that, we're happy to take any questions that you might have at this time."

The capital upgrade business that Linda talked about is a big part of that, but the big difference is that in military, while some of those infrastructure budgets may continue to be under some pressure, the pipeline for new bases that are issuing RFPs or who have RFPs out there, there are -- they are significant. We have seen the army pretty much, pretty active in the past several years. The Air Force, over the past couple of 3 years, has gotten even more active. So there is a robust pipeline in the military for new bases to win. So that's why we remain bullish on the Military Services. Homeowner Services is doing well. There are more municipalities who are interested in partnership opportunities for these home warranties that we offer, so we feel really good about it. And then on the Keystone Clearwater, everybody in -- gosh, Goldman, you guys are -- really do a great job of monitoring the natural gas and oil market. So you know that things are picking up. We are very proud that through the worst of it that our organization, our business was able to stay EPS neutral. That is a huge deal, and it shows a lot about how they kept going and some of the services they were able to provide during the downturn. So yes, the Market-Based Businesses we're in, we are committed to. Now we have always said that at our core, we are a regulated utility period. We will stay that way. Currently, anywhere from 9% to 10% of our revenue, net income comes from market-based, little less this year. So we will not see that grow beyond 15% to 20% and probably closer to the up to 15%, unless there is something extremely regulated-like if we win every new military base, for example, and that helps us and it's more regulated-like. But right now, we are committed, but the Market-Based Businesses have a limited role in the overall growth of our company and the majority of our growth will always come from our capital investment in our Regulated business as well as Regulated acquisition that then turns into more capital investment into our business."

Reinvesting in our capital programs for the benefit of our customers will always be first, and dividends, of course, are right up there. So we also look at other investments. Are there ways to grow? Do we look at things like -- I mean, the very bottom of our list, by the way, is buybacks. We think that we should have plenty of opportunities to invest in our business. We look at dividends. We look at refinancing debt, all of those things, we think, have far more value to our shareholders, then the latter. So we, right now, see ourselves continuing to have our dividend growth commensurate with our EPS growth. However, we also are very happy that over the past 4 years, we have had double-digit dividend increase and still remain at the bottom of our payout range."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. With me today are Linda Sullivan, our CFO, who will go over the third quarter financial results; and Walter Lynch, our COO, who will give key updates on our operations.But before we give you",473,"Thanks, Ed. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. With me today are Linda Sullivan, our CFO, who will go over the third quarter financial results; and Walter Lynch, our COO, who will give key updates on our operations.
But before we give you the summary of our third quarter results, I'd like to comment on the announcement we made on Monday. We have a binding global settlement in principle approved by the federal court for all consolidated claims in both federal and state courts in West Virginia arising from the Freedom Industries chemical spill on January 9, 2014. This settlement is not an admission of any liability or fault on the part of our company or our employees. 
As a matter of record, Freedom Industries as a company as well as 6 of their employees, including 3 officers, have pled guilty to criminal violations of the Clean Water Act as a result of the chemical spill. 
In comparison, West Virginia American Water has not been found to have violated any laws or regulations in connection with the chemical spill.
We firmly believe the suits brought against us are without merit and resulted at least in part due to the bankruptcy of Freedom Industries and their limited ability to pay claims.
As noted in the recent report by the Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board, the Freedom Industries chemical spill was preventable had Freedom followed proper procedures.
Additionally, the federal court dismissed all claims against American Water parent company and our service company in pretrial decisions, nor is either a party to the class action litigation in state court. 
So why did we decide to settle these cases? First, we believe it is in the best interest of our customers, our company and especially our West Virginia employees. They're the people who work hard to deliver the highest standard of customer service possible, regardless of the challenges they face. 
Second, this resolution allows us to serve our customers without the distractions and potentially significant expenses of federal and state litigation over the next several years, which Linda will quantify in a few minutes. 
And third, these distractions and expenses are further compounded by a couple of facts. West Virginia is our only regulated state in American Water with severely limited protections against claims of damages arising from outages or interruptions of services. Even electric and gas utilities in the state are more protected as our municipalities. 
Additionally, these trials would have occurred in a state that historically has been highly favorable to the point this far. While West Virginia passed meaningful tort reform measures in 2015, the lawsuits filed by plaintiffs in these cases were filed before the new measures took effect.
Now let me turn the call over to Linda to comment on the financial elements of the proposed global settlement."

Let me start with the earnings impact. The aggregate amount of the binding global agreement in principle is $126 million pretax. Our portion is $65 million, with the remaining $61 million coming from some of our insurers. In the third qua",593,"Thanks, Susan. Let me start with the earnings impact. The aggregate amount of the binding global agreement in principle is $126 million pretax. Our portion is $65 million, with the remaining $61 million coming from some of our insurers. 
In the third quarter, we recorded our $65 million portion of the settlement, net of committed insurance receivables as an after-tax charge of $39 million or $0.22 per share, which was recorded on the books of West Virginia American Water.
I would like to point out that 2 of our insurers that we asked to participate in the settlement have presently not agreed to participate in the settlement. Their insurance coverage level is up to $50 million in the aggregate.
We intend to actively pursue recovery from these 2 insurers. And in fact, last Friday, West Virginia American Water filed suit against one of these insurers in West Virginia, and we will pursue arbitration against the other. We firmly believe that these insurers have a responsibility to participate appropriately.
In terms of the structure of the settlement, Page 6 lays out the components of the structure for both our settlement of $126 million as well as another $25 million funded under a separate settlement agreement between the plaintiffs and Eastman Chemical Company. The structure establishes a two-tier approach to payments of claims made up of a guaranteed fund and claim-based payments.
Let me discuss the guaranteed fund first. In our settlement, the guaranteed fund will be $76 million, of which our portion would be $51 million and an insurance carrier will contribute $25 million. The 2 insurers that I mentioned earlier who did not participate in the settlement were asked to commit coverage to the guaranteed fund. Their insurance coverage level is up to $50 million in the aggregate. We have not recorded an accounts receivable from these 2 insurers, but we are actively pursuing recovery, as I mentioned earlier.
As the chart shows, Eastman's $25 million is in the guaranteed fund. The total $101 million in the guaranteed fund must be exhausted before any claims-based payments are made. 
Now let me cover the claims-based payment. In our settlement, the claims-based payments would be up to $50 million, of which our portion would be up to $14 million and a number of our insurance carriers committed to contribute up to $36 million. I trust that this chart helps to explain the structure of the settlement. 
Let me now discuss a few other points. As part of the settlement, West Virginia American Water agreed it will not seek rate recovery from the West Virginia Public Service Commission for the amounts included under this settlement and for approximately $4 million in direct response cost expensed in 2014 relating to the chemical spill.
In terms of cash flow, we intend to fund West Virginia settlement payments through existing sources of liquidity. Funding is not expected to begin until the settlement is final, estimated to occur in the first half of next year. 
Let me also discuss legal fees. We estimate that future defense costs could easily have been $25 million or more over the next several years had we gone through all trials in the case both federal and state, and these are only the estimated legal expenses and do not account for other expected impacts that result from significant litigation, such as management's time and attention and an ongoing distraction to our employees in West Virginia who are focused on delivering water service to our customers in that state.
I'll now turn it back to Susan."
250885,405253325,1072319,"American Water Works Company, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2016",2016-11-03,"Earnings Calls","American Water Works Company, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Linda. We believe strongly that these uncertainties, distractions and anticipated expenses warranted a global settlement at this time, again, despite the fact that we believe the suits brought against West Virginia American Water are without merit",826,"Thanks, Linda. We believe strongly that these uncertainties, distractions and anticipated expenses warranted a global settlement at this time, again, despite the fact that we believe the suits brought against West Virginia American Water are without merit. 
In terms of next steps, the terms of the settlement must be finalized and approved by the court, notice of the terms of the settlement must be provided to the settlement class members, and then a final fairness hearing will be held before the final approval of the settlement. We anticipate this final hearing should occur in the first half of 2017. 
The Freedom Industries chemical spill was a challenging time for the West Virginia community, our customers and our employees. We are looking forward. And as we have for our 130 years as a company, our focus is on serving our customers clean, safe, reliable and affordable water.
So with that, let's discuss our third quarter performance, because outside of this week's news of the pending resolution of litigation, our employees continue to consistently deliver great results across our business with their outstanding dedication and commitment to our customers. 
Excelling at fundamentals is critically important in any business. We get that, and this is why we continue to invest in our water and wastewater systems, while at the same time, increasing our operating efficiencies to reduce cost impacts on our customers. 
We also continue to grow our Regulated Businesses based on our demonstrated core competencies and customer care. Our people are providing solutions and value to customers and communities across our footprint, and this is what drives our consistent results. 
Slide 7 highlight how we have executed our strategies. It starts with providing reliable service through capital investment in our regulated operations. During the first 9 months of the year, we invested $905 million in capital, with the majority dedicated toward our regulated operations to improve water and wastewater systems. It also included $24 million for regulated acquisitions. We plan to invest between $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion this year, with about $1.2 billion of that amount in regulated infrastructure investments. This level of investment is balanced by our continued focus on, first, controlling O&M cost; then spending every capital dollar efficiently; and finally, utilizing constructive regulatory mechanisms. 
We're extremely proud of our employees' efforts to improve efficiency, and their commitment comes from a deeply ingrained culture at American Water to provide the best quality service to our customers at an affordable price. Walter will give you a little more background on some of these efforts in just a few minutes. 
Having the reputation of doing what is right for our customers also contributes to our growth. This year, we've already welcomed 10,700 new customers just from acquisition and a total of 10,000 more customers from organic growth. We also have signed agreements, representing another 67,800 customers pending regulatory approvals.
As we discussed in the first 2 quarterly calls this year, we faced headwinds in our Market-Based Businesses in 2016. We continue to see reductions in capital upgrade projects in our Military Services Group compared to previous years. This is due to decreases in base infrastructure budgets as well as the completion earlier this year of a very large multiyear capital upgrade project we had at one of our military bases. 
We see improving conditions in natural gas drilling plans in the Appalachian basin, and our Keystone Clearwater subsidiary continues to increase its market share from about 20% when we bought the company in July of 2015 to about 35% today.
However, due to the timing of ramp-ups and work completion schedule, at this time, we still view Keystone as being EPS neutral for this year. 
Our Homeowner Services business continues to grow, especially through municipal partnerships and expansion of services we offer. To date, we have about 1.7 million customer contracts, which serve 833,000 customers in 43 states and Washington, D.C. This business is seeing a very active national market with several municipal RFPs in process.
We believe that our Market-Based Businesses remain strong long-term play, and they leverage our core competencies in water and wastewater treatment and management. We strategically limit their impact to our overall risk profile. These businesses are also very capital light, with a vast majority of our investments made in our regulated business. 
Moving on to Slide 8. Adjusted earnings were $1.05 per share for the third quarter, excluding the Freedom Industries settlement, a 9.4% increase above third quarter 2015. For the first 9 months in 2016, EPS increased 8.6%.
Our continued strong results enable us to revise our adjusted earnings guidance to the upper end of our prior range plus $0.01, so from $2.75 to $2.85 per share to $2.81 to $2.86 per share, again, excluding the Freedom Industries settlement. 
We also continue our progress toward achieving our long-term goal of 7% to 10% EPS growth through 2020. 
And with that, Walter will now give you his update on our operations."
250885,405253325,1072319,"American Water Works Company, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2016",2016-11-03,"Earnings Calls","American Water Works Company, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Susan.

During the third quarter and year-to-date, our employees continued to demonstrate their expertise and skill in delivering reliable and safe water services to our customers. Once again, we've made smart investments, achieved growth through the solutions we offer to communities, and we continue to maximize efficiency to help keep costs down. 
Our commitment to invest in our infrastructure while focusing on efficiency of operations to balance customer costs is front and center in the regulatory requests we've made this year. 
In Kentucky, our rate case settlement was approved, and we received an order for $6.5 million of additional annualized revenues. As part of the rate order, the PSC eliminated the former 45% equity ratio cap. This allows for some flexibility in how we finance our investments in that state. 
In California, we filed a general rate case on July 1, seeking $51 million in annualized revenues over 3 years. We also received approval to begin construction of our new pipeline associated with the Monterey Peninsula Water Supply Project, which is due to start this month. This marks another significant milestone and a multiyear approach to solving the water supply issues for residences and businesses in that area. 
And in Pennsylvania, the Public Utility Commission last month approved our proposed acquisition of the wastewater assets of the Scranton Sewer Authority, which I'll discuss in a moment. 
Turning to Slide 11. In the third quarter, record warmth and lower rainfall swept through many of our larger service areas, especially in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. While some areas we serve were wetter than usual, mainly in Missouri and Illinois, the overall effect was higher weather impacted water sales. We estimate the impact to our net revenues to be approximately $6 million. 
Also of note, on October 21, the New Jersey DEP issued a drought warning in 4 of the 6 designated drought regions. While we do have production facilities in these designated drought areas, we have the ability and capacity to transfer water to the impacted regions as authorized by the DEP. Currently, we're in discussions with the DEP, and we stand ready to help. 
On Slide 12, you can see the success we've had in executing our growth strategy by providing solutions to water and wastewater challenges across our footprint. As Susan said, our pending and closed agreements represent about 78,500 customers.
In New Jersey, we filed with the Board of Public Utilities on October 28 for approval of the Shorelands acquisition, which is 11,000 water customers. We anticipate approval in the first half of 2017. 
In Pennsylvania, we have our 2 largest pending acquisitions this year, the wastewater assets of the Scranton Sewer Authority as well as the Municipal Authority of the City of McKeesport. Together, these systems represent more than 50,000 customers.
Regarding Scranton, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission in October approved our application authorizing the acquisition. The commission's approval is an important positive step forward in a regulatory review process and it reflects the hard work by our Pennsylvania team in partnership with the sewer authority to secure the necessary approvals. 
We remain confident that we'll receive all the necessary remaining approvals, close the acquisition and begin providing quality wastewater service to Scranton and Dunmore before the end of 2016. 
Finally, this week, we closed on our acquisition of the Borough of New Cumberland wastewater system, adding 3,100 customers to our Pennsylvania footprint. 
Moving to Slide 13. Once again, we continue to improve our O&M efficiency ratio, achieving 34.9% for the last 12 months. We remain on track to meet our O&M efficiency target of 34% by 2020. This tremendous effort by our employees is centered on bringing value to our customers. 
Once again, let me provide you with a couple of examples on what we're doing to drive these results. In Indiana, we completed a local project to digitize customer request to locate underground assets so that customers can excavate on their own property. Known internally as eLOCATE, this project, which issues our GIS data, has improved our response time, reduced labor and improved accuracy and customer satisfaction on these customer requests. eLOCATE has been replicated now across 6 states and has provided over $1 million in annualized cost savings and efficiencies. 
Another example is our investment in enterprise software and meter data management, which is beginning to pay off in efficiency gains. We've continued to improve our performance, closing in on a near 100% natural meter reach we're billing. We've seen cost savings of over $1 million as we reduce the time spent handling exceptions. And again, every dollar we save in O&M costs, we can invest $7 in capital with no impact on our customers bills. 
And now I'll turn the call over to Linda for more detail on our third quarter financial results."
250885,405253325,1072319,"American Water Works Company, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2016",2016-11-03,"Earnings Calls","American Water Works Company, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Walter. In the third quarter of 2016, American Water reported earnings of $0.83 per share, including the $0.22 charge for the Freedom Industries settlement. Excluding this charge, adjusted earnings per share were $1.05, 9.4% higher than the thi",954,"Thank you, Walter. In the third quarter of 2016, American Water reported earnings of $0.83 per share, including the $0.22 charge for the Freedom Industries settlement. Excluding this charge, adjusted earnings per share were $1.05, 9.4% higher than the third quarter of last year. 
As shown on Slide 15, our Regulated segment was up $0.10 per share, our Market-Based Businesses were down $0.03 and the parent was favorable $0.02. 
For the 9 months ended September 30, our adjusted earnings per share were $2.27, up $0.18 or 8.6% compared to the prior year. As with the quarter, these results were driven by our Regulated segment, which was up $0.22. And both our Market-Based Businesses and parent were each down $0.02 per share. 
Turning to Slide 16, let me discuss the quarterly results by business segment. For the third quarter, adjusted earnings for our Regulated Businesses increased $0.10 per share. The largest driver of growth was Regulated revenue, which was up $0.15 per share. Of that $0.15, approximately $0.14 was from additional revenue authorized through rate cases and infrastructure mechanisms to support investment growth, as well as some fluctuations in balancing account and $0.01 was from acquisitions and organic growth. 
As Walter mentioned, we experienced hot dry weather throughout much of our service area this quarter, especially in New Jersey, which increased revenue by more than $12 million. This was partially offset by wet conditions in Missouri and Illinois, which decreased revenue by about $6 million. Net-net, we had a pickup in revenue of about $6 million this quarter compared to normal weather conditions, although the year-over-year third quarter weather impact was 0. 
Next, adjusted O&M expense increased $0.03 per share this quarter. There were lots of pluses and minuses this year, but among the drivers were higher production and employee-related costs, partially offset by lower insurance costs. We are also experiencing some O&M timing this year as more than $10 million of regulated O&M is now expected to be complete in the last quarter of the year. This includes tank painting expenses, certain maintenance and repairs as well as some project delays. 
Next, depreciation expense increased $0.02 per share from regulated investment growth.
In the Market-Based Businesses, our third quarter results were $0.03 lower than last year's, due mainly to lower capital upgrades at our military bases. The year-over-year reduction in capital upgrades is driven by 2 factors. The first is a reduction in military base infrastructure budget and the second is the completion of an $85 million capital upgrade project at Fort Polk that contributed revenue in 2015, and which was substantially completed in the second quarter of this year. 
Also, I'd like to clarify that what we call military capital upgrades represent working capital only. These military projects are not capitalized on our balance sheet. Rather, we recover these investments through scheduled or milestone payments as we complete them. 
Finally, while we are seeing a year-over-year decrease in military capital upgrade projects, the pipeline of new bases looking to privatize remains strong. 
In the final section of the waterfall chart, you'll note that the parent is positive $0.02 per share for the quarter, primarily due to certain expenses recorded in the third quarter of last year, partially offset by higher interest on parent debt.
And finally, we showed the $0.22 impact of the settlement, bringing our GAAP earnings to $0.83 per share for the quarter. 
Turning to Slide 17. We have 5 rate cases and 2 outstanding infrastructure surcharge requests awaiting final orders for a total revenue request of $109.7 million. We also have a total of $90.5 million in annualized rates effective since October 1, 2015, including the resolution of our Kentucky rate case for $6.5 million in late August and $9 million in annualized infrastructure surcharges in our Pennsylvania subsidiary.
Slide 18 highlights our ongoing strong financial performance and some key cash flow and investing metrics for our business. Our capital investments year-to-date were $905 million. This is $65 million lower than the same period last year, which included the third quarter purchase of Keystone Clearwater for $133 million. We expect to spend between $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion this year, including capital for the Scranton acquisition, which we are working to close in the fourth quarter.
Our cash flow from operations grew 8.1% to $925 million for the first 9 months of the year. The majority of this growth was driven by increased net income and depreciation, both of which are the results of infrastructure investment for our customers.
Our adjusted return on equity improved to 9.57%. This is testament to the ongoing efforts of our employees to work efficiently and to limit regulatory lag through timely filings and innovative regulatory mechanisms.
We also continue to provide top quartile dividend growth compared to the Dow Jones Utility average and our water peers. On October 28, we declared a dividend of $0.375 per share payable on December 1, 2016, to shareholders of record as of November 9, 2016. 
Finally, I would like to discuss our earnings guidance. Throughout the year, we have shared with you the headwinds we faced in our Market-Based Businesses. For example, we have discussed the impact of lower capital upgrades in our military services division as well as our Keystone team's efforts to manage their business to be earnings neutral despite a very challenging natural gas market. 
Despite these headwinds, the employees in our businesses have delivered extraordinary results. Even with the additional fourth quarter O&M expense, we are revising our adjusted earnings guidance to the upper end of our prior range plus $0.01 or to $2.81 to $2.86 per share, which excludes the Freedom Industries settlement. 
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Susan."

The answer is, we are, as I said, talking earlier, very committed to the Market-Based Businesses that we're in. Specifically, for American Water Enterprises, predominately, you have Homeowner Services and you have the military. The capital upgrade business that Linda talked about is a big part of that, but the big difference is that in military, while some of those infrastructure budgets may continue to be under some pressure, the pipeline for new bases that are issuing RFPs or who have RFPs out there, there are -- they are significant. We have seen the army pretty much, pretty active in the past several years. The Air Force, over the past couple of 3 years, has gotten even more active. So there is a robust pipeline in the military for new bases to win. So that's why we remain bullish on the Military Services. Homeowner Services is doing well. There are more municipalities who are interested in partnership opportunities for these home warranties that we offer, so we feel really good about it. And then on the Keystone Clearwater, everybody in -- gosh, Goldman, you guys are -- really do a great job of monitoring the natural gas and oil market. So you know that things are picking up. We are very proud that through the worst of it that our organization, our business was able to stay EPS neutral. That is a huge deal, and it shows a lot about how they kept going and some of the services they were able to provide during the downturn. So yes, the Market-Based Businesses we're in, we are committed to. Now we have always said that at our core, we are a regulated utility period. We will stay that way. Currently, anywhere from 9% to 10% of our revenue, net income comes from market-based, little less this year. So we will not see that grow beyond 15% to 20% and probably closer to the up to 15%, unless there is something extremely regulated-like if we win every new military base, for example, and that helps us and it's more regulated-like. But right now, we are committed, but the Market-Based Businesses have a limited role in the overall growth of our company and the majority of our growth will always come from our capital investment in our Regulated business as well as Regulated acquisition that then turns into more capital investment into our business."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. With me today are Linda Sullivan, our CFO, who will go over the third quarter financial results; and Walter Lynch, our COO, who will give key updates on our operations.
But before we give you the summary of our third quarter results, I'd like to comment on the announcement we made on Monday. We have a binding global settlement in principle approved by the federal court for all consolidated claims in both federal and state courts in West Virginia arising from the Freedom Industries chemical spill on January 9, 2014. This settlement is not an admission of any liability or fault on the part of our company or our employees. 
As a matter of record, Freedom Industries as a company as well as 6 of their employees, including 3 officers, have pled guilty to criminal violations of the Clean Water Act as a result of the chemical spill. 
In comparison, West Virginia American Water has not been found to have violated any laws or regulations in connection with the chemical spill.
We firmly believe the suits brought against us are without merit and resulted at least in part due to the bankruptcy of Freedom Industries and their limited ability to pay claims.
As noted in the recent report by the Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board, the Freedom Industries chemical spill was preventable had Freedom followed proper procedures.
Additionally, the federal court dismissed all claims against American Water parent company and our service company in pretrial decisions, nor is either a party to the class action litigation in state court. 
So why did we decide to settle these cases? First, we believe it is in the best interest of our customers, our company and especially our West Virginia employees. They're the people who work hard to deliver the highest standard of customer service possible, regardless of the challenges they face. 
Second, this resolution allows us to serve our customers without the distractions and potentially significant expenses of federal and state litigation over the next several years, which Linda will quantify in a few minutes. 
And third, these distractions and expenses are further compounded by a couple of facts. West Virginia is our only regulated state in American Water with severely limited protections against claims of damages arising from outages or interruptions of services. Even electric and gas utilities in the state are more protected as our municipalities. 
Additionally, these trials would have occurred in a state that historically has been highly favorable to the point this far. While West Virginia passed meaningful tort reform measures in 2015, the lawsuits filed by plaintiffs in these cases were filed before the new measures took effect.
Now let me turn the call over to Linda to comment on the financial elements of the proposed global settlement."
250885,405253325,1073931,"American Water Works Company, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2016",2016-11-03,"Earnings Calls","American Water Works Company, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Susan. Let me start with the earnings impact. The aggregate amount of the binding global agreement in principle is $126 million pretax. Our portion is $65 million, with the remaining $61 million coming from some of our insurers. In the third qua",593,"Thanks, Susan. Let me start with the earnings impact. The aggregate amount of the binding global agreement in principle is $126 million pretax. Our portion is $65 million, with the remaining $61 million coming from some of our insurers. 
In the third quarter, we recorded our $65 million portion of the settlement, net of committed insurance receivables as an after-tax charge of $39 million or $0.22 per share, which was recorded on the books of West Virginia American Water.
I would like to point out that 2 of our insurers that we asked to participate in the settlement have presently not agreed to participate in the settlement. Their insurance coverage level is up to $50 million in the aggregate.
We intend to actively pursue recovery from these 2 insurers. And in fact, last Friday, West Virginia American Water filed suit against one of these insurers in West Virginia, and we will pursue arbitration against the other. We firmly believe that these insurers have a responsibility to participate appropriately.
In terms of the structure of the settlement, Page 6 lays out the components of the structure for both our settlement of $126 million as well as another $25 million funded under a separate settlement agreement between the plaintiffs and Eastman Chemical Company. The structure establishes a two-tier approach to payments of claims made up of a guaranteed fund and claim-based payments.
Let me discuss the guaranteed fund first. In our settlement, the guaranteed fund will be $76 million, of which our portion would be $51 million and an insurance carrier will contribute $25 million. The 2 insurers that I mentioned earlier who did not participate in the settlement were asked to commit coverage to the guaranteed fund. Their insurance coverage level is up to $50 million in the aggregate. We have not recorded an accounts receivable from these 2 insurers, but we are actively pursuing recovery, as I mentioned earlier.
As the chart shows, Eastman's $25 million is in the guaranteed fund. The total $101 million in the guaranteed fund must be exhausted before any claims-based payments are made. 
Now let me cover the claims-based payment. In our settlement, the claims-based payments would be up to $50 million, of which our portion would be up to $14 million and a number of our insurance carriers committed to contribute up to $36 million. I trust that this chart helps to explain the structure of the settlement. 
Let me now discuss a few other points. As part of the settlement, West Virginia American Water agreed it will not seek rate recovery from the West Virginia Public Service Commission for the amounts included under this settlement and for approximately $4 million in direct response cost expensed in 2014 relating to the chemical spill.
In terms of cash flow, we intend to fund West Virginia settlement payments through existing sources of liquidity. Funding is not expected to begin until the settlement is final, estimated to occur in the first half of next year. 
Let me also discuss legal fees. We estimate that future defense costs could easily have been $25 million or more over the next several years had we gone through all trials in the case both federal and state, and these are only the estimated legal expenses and do not account for other expected impacts that result from significant litigation, such as management's time and attention and an ongoing distraction to our employees in West Virginia who are focused on delivering water service to our customers in that state.
I'll now turn it back to Susan."
250885,405253325,1073931,"American Water Works Company, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2016",2016-11-03,"Earnings Calls","American Water Works Company, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Linda. We believe strongly that these uncertainties, distractions and anticipated expenses warranted a global settlement at this time, again, despite the fact that we believe the suits brought against West Virginia American Water are without merit",826,"Thanks, Linda. We believe strongly that these uncertainties, distractions and anticipated expenses warranted a global settlement at this time, again, despite the fact that we believe the suits brought against West Virginia American Water are without merit. 
In terms of next steps, the terms of the settlement must be finalized and approved by the court, notice of the terms of the settlement must be provided to the settlement class members, and then a final fairness hearing will be held before the final approval of the settlement. We anticipate this final hearing should occur in the first half of 2017. 
The Freedom Industries chemical spill was a challenging time for the West Virginia community, our customers and our employees. We are looking forward. And as we have for our 130 years as a company, our focus is on serving our customers clean, safe, reliable and affordable water.
So with that, let's discuss our third quarter performance, because outside of this week's news of the pending resolution of litigation, our employees continue to consistently deliver great results across our business with their outstanding dedication and commitment to our customers. 
Excelling at fundamentals is critically important in any business. We get that, and this is why we continue to invest in our water and wastewater systems, while at the same time, increasing our operating efficiencies to reduce cost impacts on our customers. 
We also continue to grow our Regulated Businesses based on our demonstrated core competencies and customer care. Our people are providing solutions and value to customers and communities across our footprint, and this is what drives our consistent results. 
Slide 7 highlight how we have executed our strategies. It starts with providing reliable service through capital investment in our regulated operations. During the first 9 months of the year, we invested $905 million in capital, with the majority dedicated toward our regulated operations to improve water and wastewater systems. It also included $24 million for regulated acquisitions. We plan to invest between $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion this year, with about $1.2 billion of that amount in regulated infrastructure investments. This level of investment is balanced by our continued focus on, first, controlling O&M cost; then spending every capital dollar efficiently; and finally, utilizing constructive regulatory mechanisms. 
We're extremely proud of our employees' efforts to improve efficiency, and their commitment comes from a deeply ingrained culture at American Water to provide the best quality service to our customers at an affordable price. Walter will give you a little more background on some of these efforts in just a few minutes. 
Having the reputation of doing what is right for our customers also contributes to our growth. This year, we've already welcomed 10,700 new customers just from acquisition and a total of 10,000 more customers from organic growth. We also have signed agreements, representing another 67,800 customers pending regulatory approvals.
As we discussed in the first 2 quarterly calls this year, we faced headwinds in our Market-Based Businesses in 2016. We continue to see reductions in capital upgrade projects in our Military Services Group compared to previous years. This is due to decreases in base infrastructure budgets as well as the completion earlier this year of a very large multiyear capital upgrade project we had at one of our military bases. 
We see improving conditions in natural gas drilling plans in the Appalachian basin, and our Keystone Clearwater subsidiary continues to increase its market share from about 20% when we bought the company in July of 2015 to about 35% today.
However, due to the timing of ramp-ups and work completion schedule, at this time, we still view Keystone as being EPS neutral for this year. 
Our Homeowner Services business continues to grow, especially through municipal partnerships and expansion of services we offer. To date, we have about 1.7 million customer contracts, which serve 833,000 customers in 43 states and Washington, D.C. This business is seeing a very active national market with several municipal RFPs in process.
We believe that our Market-Based Businesses remain strong long-term play, and they leverage our core competencies in water and wastewater treatment and management. We strategically limit their impact to our overall risk profile. These businesses are also very capital light, with a vast majority of our investments made in our regulated business. 
Moving on to Slide 8. Adjusted earnings were $1.05 per share for the third quarter, excluding the Freedom Industries settlement, a 9.4% increase above third quarter 2015. For the first 9 months in 2016, EPS increased 8.6%.
Our continued strong results enable us to revise our adjusted earnings guidance to the upper end of our prior range plus $0.01, so from $2.75 to $2.85 per share to $2.81 to $2.86 per share, again, excluding the Freedom Industries settlement. 
We also continue our progress toward achieving our long-term goal of 7% to 10% EPS growth through 2020. 
And with that, Walter will now give you his update on our operations."
250885,405253325,1073931,"American Water Works Company, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2016",2016-11-03,"Earnings Calls","American Water Works Company, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Susan.

During the third quarter and year-to-date, our employees continued to demonstrate their expertise and skill in delivering reliable and safe water services to our customers. Once again, we've made smart investments, achieved growth through the solutions we offer to communities, and we continue to maximize efficiency to help keep costs down. 
Our commitment to invest in our infrastructure while focusing on efficiency of operations to balance customer costs is front and center in the regulatory requests we've made this year. 
In Kentucky, our rate case settlement was approved, and we received an order for $6.5 million of additional annualized revenues. As part of the rate order, the PSC eliminated the former 45% equity ratio cap. This allows for some flexibility in how we finance our investments in that state. 
In California, we filed a general rate case on July 1, seeking $51 million in annualized revenues over 3 years. We also received approval to begin construction of our new pipeline associated with the Monterey Peninsula Water Supply Project, which is due to start this month. This marks another significant milestone and a multiyear approach to solving the water supply issues for residences and businesses in that area. 
And in Pennsylvania, the Public Utility Commission last month approved our proposed acquisition of the wastewater assets of the Scranton Sewer Authority, which I'll discuss in a moment. 
Turning to Slide 11. In the third quarter, record warmth and lower rainfall swept through many of our larger service areas, especially in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. While some areas we serve were wetter than usual, mainly in Missouri and Illinois, the overall effect was higher weather impacted water sales. We estimate the impact to our net revenues to be approximately $6 million. 
Also of note, on October 21, the New Jersey DEP issued a drought warning in 4 of the 6 designated drought regions. While we do have production facilities in these designated drought areas, we have the ability and capacity to transfer water to the impacted regions as authorized by the DEP. Currently, we're in discussions with the DEP, and we stand ready to help. 
On Slide 12, you can see the success we've had in executing our growth strategy by providing solutions to water and wastewater challenges across our footprint. As Susan said, our pending and closed agreements represent about 78,500 customers.
In New Jersey, we filed with the Board of Public Utilities on October 28 for approval of the Shorelands acquisition, which is 11,000 water customers. We anticipate approval in the first half of 2017. 
In Pennsylvania, we have our 2 largest pending acquisitions this year, the wastewater assets of the Scranton Sewer Authority as well as the Municipal Authority of the City of McKeesport. Together, these systems represent more than 50,000 customers.
Regarding Scranton, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission in October approved our application authorizing the acquisition. The commission's approval is an important positive step forward in a regulatory review process and it reflects the hard work by our Pennsylvania team in partnership with the sewer authority to secure the necessary approvals. 
We remain confident that we'll receive all the necessary remaining approvals, close the acquisition and begin providing quality wastewater service to Scranton and Dunmore before the end of 2016. 
Finally, this week, we closed on our acquisition of the Borough of New Cumberland wastewater system, adding 3,100 customers to our Pennsylvania footprint. 
Moving to Slide 13. Once again, we continue to improve our O&M efficiency ratio, achieving 34.9% for the last 12 months. We remain on track to meet our O&M efficiency target of 34% by 2020. This tremendous effort by our employees is centered on bringing value to our customers. 
Once again, let me provide you with a couple of examples on what we're doing to drive these results. In Indiana, we completed a local project to digitize customer request to locate underground assets so that customers can excavate on their own property. Known internally as eLOCATE, this project, which issues our GIS data, has improved our response time, reduced labor and improved accuracy and customer satisfaction on these customer requests. eLOCATE has been replicated now across 6 states and has provided over $1 million in annualized cost savings and efficiencies. 
Another example is our investment in enterprise software and meter data management, which is beginning to pay off in efficiency gains. We've continued to improve our performance, closing in on a near 100% natural meter reach we're billing. We've seen cost savings of over $1 million as we reduce the time spent handling exceptions. And again, every dollar we save in O&M costs, we can invest $7 in capital with no impact on our customers’ bills. 
And now I'll turn the call over to Linda for more detail on our third quarter financial results."
250885,405253325,1073931,"American Water Works Company, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2016",2016-11-03,"Earnings Calls","American Water Works Company, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Walter. In the third quarter of 2016, American Water reported earnings of $0.83 per share, including the $0.22 charge for the Freedom Industries settlement.

In the third quarter of 2016, American Water reported earnings of $0.83 per share, including the $0.22 charge for the Freedom Industries settlement. Excluding this charge, adjusted earnings per share were $1.05, 9.4% higher than the third quarter of last year. 
As shown on Slide 15, our Regulated segment was up $0.10 per share, our Market-Based Businesses were down $0.03 and the parent was favorable $0.02. 
For the 9 months ended September 30, our adjusted earnings per share were $2.27, up $0.18 or 8.6% compared to the prior year. As with the quarter, these results were driven by our Regulated segment, which was up $0.22. And both our Market-Based Businesses and parent were each down $0.02 per share. 
Turning to Slide 16, let me discuss the quarterly results by business segment. For the third quarter, adjusted earnings for our Regulated Businesses increased $0.10 per share. The largest driver of growth was Regulated revenue, which was up $0.15 per share. Of that $0.15, approximately $0.14 was from additional revenue authorized through rate cases and infrastructure mechanisms to support investment growth, as well as some fluctuations in balancing account and $0.01 was from acquisitions and organic growth. 
As Walter mentioned, we experienced hot dry weather throughout much of our service area this quarter, especially in New Jersey, which increased revenue by more than $12 million. This was partially offset by wet conditions in Missouri and Illinois, which decreased revenue by about $6 million. Net-net, we had a pickup in revenue of about $6 million this quarter compared to normal weather conditions, although the year-over-year third quarter weather impact was 0. 
Next, adjusted O&M expense increased $0.03 per share this quarter. There were lots of pluses and minuses this year, but among the drivers were higher production and employee-related costs, partially offset by lower insurance costs. We are also experiencing some O&M timing this year as more than $10 million of regulated O&M is now expected to be complete in the last quarter of the year. This includes tank painting expenses, certain maintenance and repairs as well as some project delays. 
Next, depreciation expense increased $0.02 per share from regulated investment growth.
In the Market-Based Businesses, our third quarter results were $0.03 lower than last year's, due mainly to lower capital upgrades at our military bases. The year-over-year reduction in capital upgrades is driven by 2 factors. The first is a reduction in military base infrastructure budget and the second is the completion of an $85 million capital upgrade project at Fort Polk that contributed revenue in 2015, and which was substantially completed in the second quarter of this year. 
Also, I'd like to clarify that what we call military capital upgrades represent working capital only. These military projects are not capitalized on our balance sheet. Rather, we recover these investments through scheduled or milestone payments as we complete them. 
Finally, while we are seeing a year-over-year decrease in military capital upgrade projects, the pipeline of new bases looking to privatize remains strong. 
In the final section of the waterfall chart, you'll note that the parent is positive $0.02 per share for the quarter, primarily due to certain expenses recorded in the third quarter of last year, partially offset by higher interest on parent debt.
And finally, we showed the $0.22 impact of the settlement, bringing our GAAP earnings to $0.83 per share for the quarter. 
Turning to Slide 17. We have 5 rate cases and 2 outstanding infrastructure surcharge requests awaiting final orders for a total revenue request of $109.7 million. We also have a total of $90.5 million in annualized rates effective since October 1, 2015, including the resolution of our Kentucky rate case for $6.5 million in late August and $9 million in annualized infrastructure surcharges in our Pennsylvania subsidiary.
Slide 18 highlights our ongoing strong financial performance and some key cash flow and investing metrics for our business. Our capital investments year-to-date were $905 million. This is $65 million lower than the same period last year, which included the third quarter purchase of Keystone Clearwater for $133 million. We expect to spend between $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion this year, including capital for the Scranton acquisition, which we are working to close in the fourth quarter.
Our cash flow from operations grew 8.1% to $925 million for the first 9 months of the year. The majority of this growth was driven by increased net income and depreciation, both of which are the results of infrastructure investment for our customers.
Our adjusted return on equity improved to 9.57%. This is testament to the ongoing efforts of our employees to work efficiently and to limit regulatory lag through timely filings and innovative regulatory mechanisms.
We also continue to provide top quartile dividend growth compared to the Dow Jones Utility average and our water peers. On October 28, we declared a dividend of $0.375 per share payable on December 1, 2016, to shareholders of record as of November 9, 2016. 
Finally, I would like to discuss our earnings guidance. Throughout the year, we have shared with you the headwinds we faced in our Market-Based Businesses. For example, we have discussed the impact of lower capital upgrades in our military services division as well as our Keystone team's efforts to manage their business to be earnings neutral despite a very challenging natural gas market. 
Despite these headwinds, the employees in our businesses have delivered extraordinary results. Even with the additional fourth quarter O&M expense, we are revising our adjusted earnings guidance to the upper end of our prior range plus $0.01 or to $2.81 to $2.86 per share, which excludes the Freedom Industries settlement. 
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Susan."

We are constantly looking at the landscape, and we have 3 hurdles when we look at whether we would enter a new state. The first one is, what is the regulatory climate? The second one is, what is the business climate and are they open to private water? And the third is, do we see a line of sight to get to at least 50,000 customers within 5 years? So those are our gates, and we are constantly looking across the country. We rate every state based on those 3. So we would not disclose if we had any activity until there was signed agreements, but we are always looking beyond our states. But right now, our focus -- we're seeing a lot of opportunity. To your point about -- it only seems -- it seems mostly in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Pennsylvania is where we have the most mature laws that are favorable for this. Act 11, which was passed at 2012, maybe 2013, and then, of course, Act 12, which we are seeing more of the fair value legislation across the country, but I think you're seeing a state that has been more mature in some of the enabling legislative efforts that have been translated into regulatory policies. And so we are looking towards seeing more activity in other states as their legislation enabling legislation becomes more mature."

The answer is, we are, as I said, talking earlier, very committed to the Market-Based Businesses that we're in. Specifically, for American Water Enterprises, predominately, you have Homeowner Services and you have the military. The capital upgrade business that Linda talked about is a big part of that, but the big difference is that in military, while some of those infrastructure budgets may continue to be under some pressure, the pipeline for new bases that are issuing RFPs or who have RFPs out there, there are -- they are significant. We have seen the army pretty much, pretty active in the past several years. The Air Force, over the past couple of 3 years, has gotten even more active. So there is a robust pipeline in the military for new bases to win. So that's why we remain bullish on the Military Services. Homeowner Services is doing well. There are more municipalities who are interested in partnership opportunities for these home warranties that we offer, so we feel really good about it. And then on the Keystone Clearwater, everybody in -- gosh, Goldman, you guys are -- really do a great job of monitoring the natural gas and oil market. So you know that things are picking up. We are very proud that through the worst of it that our organization, our business was able to stay EPS neutral. That is a huge deal, and it shows a lot about how they kept going and some of the services they were able to provide during the downturn. So yes, the Market-Based Businesses we're in, we are committed to. Now we have always said that at our core, we are a regulated utility period. We will stay that way. Currently, anywhere from 9% to 10% of our revenue, net income comes from market-based, little less this year. So we will not see that grow beyond 15% to 20% and probably closer to the up to 15%, unless there is something extremely regulated-like if we win every new military base, for example, and that helps us and it's more regulated-like. But right now, we are committed, but the Market-Based Businesses have a limited role in the overall growth of our company and the majority of our growth will always come from our capital investment in our Regulated business as well as Regulated acquisition that then turns into more capital investment into our business."

And really for us, the first place were looking at that is on military bases. We've had a couple of our basis where we serve water and wastewater who have indicated an interest. So we are working through the Department of Defense as to whether that can fall under the purview that they've got for their privatization language in legislation, which we believe it does, the Senate and the Senators and the congressmen believe it does, but I think they're going through the lawyers and the Department of Defense to get comfortable with it. So I think what you would find is, storm water is part of the watercycle. We are looking at how that would look. So for us, we're continuing to look at storm water, but our foray into that would most probably come through our military bases and it's our ability to take that part over along with water and wastewater."
